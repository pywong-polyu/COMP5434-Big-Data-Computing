The fear, however, of a more significant supply chain disruption is now associated with \"stockpiling\" or hoarding of items ranging from food, to hand soap, sanitary wipes, and surgical facemasks. 4 My favorite iPhone apps tell me that hand soap and sanitizer are \"unavailable until further notice. \" We are now hearing that pharmacies are completely out-of-stock of hydroxychloroquine. Hospital supplies seem scarcer than before-or am I just noticing that more now? Disinfectant wipes, antibacterial soaps, and alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) are in high demand as a consequence of hoarding, profiteering and fear behaviors. As surgical professionals, we have been pursuing the art of perfecting sanitization techniques for the past 2 centuries. In the 1800s, the Hungarian physician, Dr. Semmelweis identified doctors to be their own worst enemies. He postulated that doctors were the source of germ transmission. 5 By introducing the practice of handwashing in a simple chlorinated lime solution before assisting with childbirth, he was able to reduce maternal mortality.",

Some of the supply chain deficiency is expected to impact human and animal pharmaceuticals. 6 Additionally, there are shortages of essential medical supplies, such as surgical gowns, masks, respirator devices, and other equipment used for personal protection. This may invariably affect our operating rooms. Of course, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Food & Drug Administration recommends against travelers wearing surgical masks for COVID-19 barrier protection. Regardless of anyone's' beliefs, the decrease in supply, increase in demand, and crippled supply chain is very tangible, and may impact our operating rooms. 6 These fears are not all in vain. Several pandemics have foreshadowed the end of very prosperous eras. Between 165-180 AD, a disease that is now thought to have been Smallpox, ravaged through the Roman Empire's trade routes. It wiped out nearly a third of the Empire's population and decimated the economy to a point it did not recover from for nearly one thousand years. Just over a century later, the \"Plague of Cyprian\" furthered the economic decline to a point the western empire was unable to ever overcome. Without even considering the advent of modern medical care, it is essential to note that diseases like Smallpox can deliver mortality rates of nearly 75%.",

While COVID-19 likely involves numerous morbidity and mortality challenges ahead, the vast majority of those infected will physi-cally recover. The societal recovery after a pandemic can rapidly improve beyond the levels that existed before the times of despair. No one will discount the extreme human cost thus far with COVID-19 or during past pandemics like Black Death. At the time of Black Death, roughly 60% of human life in Europe was lost. This dramatic change, however, meant that field workers had a new-found negotiating power. This power shift is thought to have catalyzed toppling the archaic feudal economy. Similarly, after the Spanish flu, states with greater human losses were ultimately able to recover their supply chains and make larger gains than previously documented.",

            "text": "A possible positive outcome of our current pandemic is improved knowledge and adherence to sanitation protocol, many of which spine surgery operating rooms have championed for decades. COVID-19 is transmitted by hand to mouth/face, aerosol transmission, and via the fecal oral route. Unsurprisingly, current protocol in hospitals adequately addresses these routes. Regulations often require handwashing for 2 minutes before and after patient encounters. To increase adherence, the more convenient ABHR has become the standard worldwide, though soap and water continue to outperform ABHR for viral load reduction. Improving hand hygiene with the concepts of sterile field practices in the operating room could arm us with tools needed to defend against current and future microbe intruders. Examples of practices we could borrow from the operating room include awareness of sterile fields, distancing to prevent instrument contamination, and barrier protection. In the end, hand hygiene is one of the most important steps anyone can take to prevent infection.",

We are a part of a finely interwoven global economic, medical, and social network. In whatever country we reside, and whichever operating room we practice, the COVID-19 pandemic now affects us. As part of the team of surgical and medical practitioners that will lead the recovery from COVID-19, it is on us to choose how we economically, psychologically, and medically recover to a place more advanced than before.",

Said to be inspired by the 50-year-old painter's liaison with 19-year-old model, Marie-Therese Walter, the grotesque nature of the depicted forms reduces this moment of intimate contact to a level of crudity, probably more representative of his deteriorating relationship with his wife",
