We initiated this randomized phase III trial to determine whether a cyclophosphamide-free adjuvant chemotherapy regimen would increase the likelihood of menses resumption and improve survival outcomes. Methods: Young women with operable estrogen receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer after definitive surgery were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamidefollowed by weekly paclitaxel (EC-wP) or epirubicin and paclitaxel followed by weekly paclitaxel (EP-wP). All patients received at least 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy after chemotherapy. Two coprimary endpoints were the rate of menstrual resumption at 12 months after chemotherapy and 5-year disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01026116). All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results: Between January 2011 and December 2016, 521 patients (median age \u00bc 34 years; interquartile range \u00bc 31-38 years) were enrolled, with 261 in the EC-wP group and 260 in the EP-wP group. The rate of menstrual resumption at 12 months after chemotherapy was 48.3% in EC-wP (95% confidence interval [CI] \u00bc 42.2% to 54.3%) and 63.1% in EP-wP (95% CI \u00bc 57.2% to 68.9%), with an absolute difference of 14.8% (95% CI \u00bc 6.37% to 23.2%, P < .001). The posthoc exploratory analysis by patient-reported outcome questionnaires indicated that pregnancy might occur in fewer women in the EC-wP group than in the EP-wP group. At a median follow-up of 62 months, the 5-year disease-free survival was 78.3% (95% CI \u00bc 72.2% to 83.3%) in EC-wP and 84.7% (95% CI \u00bc 79.3% to 88.8%) in EP-wP (stratified log-rank P \u00bc .07). The safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of relevant drugs. Conclusions: The cyclophosphamide-free chemotherapy regimen might be associated with a higher probability of menses resumption.",

The substitution of cyclophosphamide with paclitaxel might result in a reduced incidence of ovarian failure and an increased likelihood of early menses resumption. It has been reported that the substitution of paclitaxel for cyclophosphamide results in comparable efficacy in a general population but might produce greater benefits in high-risk patients (7) . Therefore, we designed the present clinical trial to investigate 2 coprimary endpoints in young women with ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. The first endpoint compares the menstrual resumption rate of the standard regimen (epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel [EC-wP] ) with the cyclophosphamide-free chemotherapeutic regimen (epirubicin/paclitaxel followed by weekly paclitaxel [EP-wP]), and the second investigates the disease-free survival (DFS) between the patients treated with the 2 regimens.",

The standard duration of endocrine therapy is at least 5 years, and all the patients who had a pregnancy within 48 months interrupted their endocrine therapy. According to the St. Gallen Breast Cancer Consensus, for women contemplating pregnancy after breast cancer, the optimal timing and impact of interrupting endocrine therapy is unknown. However, the panel recommended a minimum of 18 months following diagnosis before anticipated pregnancy (30) . Several clinical studies have investigated the optimal timing for pregnancy after breast cancer. In a matched case-control study, no DFS difference was observed between the pregnant and nonpregnant cohorts in ER-positive patients. In that study, approximately 60% of cases were pregnant after 2 years from surgery, though time to pregnancy had no statistically significant impact on survival (31, 32) . Another study showed a trend toward increased risk of recurrence in patients who conceived within 24 months after diagnosis (33) . In our clinical practice, we asked women contemplating pregnancy to conduct restaging scans before attempting conception and suggested a minimum 24-month interval between diagnosis and anticipated pregnancy. The decision of pregnancy should be very discreet. Subsequent adequate follow-up among breast cancer survivors is crucial (34) , and women who temporarily interrupt endocrine therapy due to pregnancy should be reminded to resume endocrine therapy following attempted or successful pregnancy.",

            "text": "Limitations of the trial included that we did not consider the rates of pregnancy or successful delivery as secondary endpoints due to the high probability of confounding factors. But we reported the posthoc exploratory analysis of pregnancy outcomes. Moreover, early intervention with LHRHa makes it impossible to observe menses resumption. We thus performed sensitivity analyses as complementary results to augment the main findings. We also did not report on the pattern of menstruation, and irregular menses might also lead to infertility. The fertility function should be further evaluated by measuring the levels of other markers, such as anti-M\u00fc llerian hormone and inhibin. Anti-M\u00fc llerian hormone may help to separate patients with amenorrhea due to tamoxifen use from those with loss of ovarian reserve. In addition, contrasting pathological characteristics of breast cancer between Asian and American women suggest racial differences in biology (35) , and whether our findings can be extrapolated to other races is unknown. Furthermore, the recurrence of ER-positive breast cancer occurs at a steady rate during 5 to 20 years, and an adequate follow-up is needed for more reliable survival outcomes (36) . Finally, in the era of genetic testing, information on gene predisposition for early-onset patients might provide new insights. Although young women with triple-negative breast cancer have higher mutation rates in BRCA1/2, RAD51C, and RAD51D genes (8, 37) , the germline mutation spectrum in young women with ER-positive or HER2-negative breast cancer as well as its effect on chemotherapy sensitivity are unknown and warrant further study.",
