Patients receiving Cepheid tests had significantly shorter LOS and 24 poLOS compared to patients receiving the RNA and DiaSorin tests (p<0.01 and p<0.01, 25 respectively). The Cepheid test carried the best benefit-to-cost ratio, 0. 10, p<0.05 . As of December 1, 2020, there have been 13.4 million COVID positive cases in 43 the United States, leading to over 267,000 deaths. According to the CDC, New Jersey 44 ranks second in the US with 190 deaths/100,000 cases 1, 2 . The COVID-19 pandemic put 45 extraordinary pressure on the healthcare system of New Jersey, as hospitals diverted both 46 physical and human resources to meet rising critical care demands. Additionally, the 47 resources normally used to provide orthopaedic care were repurposed 3 . Despite the re-48 allocation of resources, patients with orthopaedic trauma continued to present to the 49 trauma bay 4 . 50 Historically, SSI rates described for \"all-comer\" orthopaedic trauma patients 51 range from 1.3%-15.6% 5-8 . The causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has been 52 shown to be transmitted via respiratory secretions and may be spread during orthopaedic 53 procedures 9-12 . This raises concern for increased perioperative complications, especially 54 increased complication and morality rates in COVID positive hip fracture patients [13] [14] [15] . 55 Current literature has described individual hospital experiences in response to 56 COVID-19, safety protocols, and perioperative outcomes with isolated extremity 57 fractures. To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the effectiveness of the 58 implemented safety measures for all comer orthopaedic trauma patients. In addition, no 59 study has evaluated 180-day outcomes. Moreover, there is a paucity of literature that 60 exists regarding the impact of COVID test type ordered and its relationship to the 61 associated hospital course. 62",

Additionally, when accounting for all patients that presented to 233 the ED, there was no increased likelihood to discharge or perform non-operative 234 management of a patient during COVID as compared to the non-COVID cohort.
