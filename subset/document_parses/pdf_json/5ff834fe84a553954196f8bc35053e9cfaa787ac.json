The socioeconomic characteristics of the study population were estimated using a zip code-level analysis of US Census data and compared to national US Metrics for 2016. Samples from 4,874 individuals were deposited to a single commercial DNA bank from 1997 to 2019. Samples originated from 31 countries across 6 continents, with the majority of samples originating from the United States (US; 97.37%; n = 4,746). A higher proportion of individuals identifying as females (55.58%; n = 2,709) utilized the service compared to males (41.18%; n = 2,007). The age distribution was bimodal, peaking around 5 years of age and again around 65 years of age. Whole blood was the preferred specimen for submission. Sample deposits peaked in 2015 with 559 annual deposits. Clinical genetic counselors were the most common referral source (41.73%; n = 2,034). Individuals utilizing DNA banking services are estimated to reside in wealthier, more educated and less racially diverse zip codes compared to national metrics. Although direct to consumer DNA banking is being utilized by the general public and clinical genetic counselors in the US, it is not widespread.",

            "text": "DNA banking describes the long-term storage and preservation of genetic material from an individual for future clinical or research testing. This service is typically voluntary and performed at the request of a consented individual or their legal representative(s) for a fee. Unlike clinical and research biorepositories, the individual or their legal representative has control over how, when, and why the genetic material is used. Comparably, biobanks for human subjects accept, process, store, and distribute de-identified biological specimens and associated data for use in research and clinical settings with appropriate consent and oversight (De Souza and Greenspan. 2013) . Typically, the participant may request specimen and record destruction, but cannot withdraw the information for personal use, and will not receive individual results generated by research. Draft societal guidelines for DNA banking were first published in 1989 in response to emerging clinical molecular test availability for heritable disorders (Yates et al. 1989 ). At a time when molecular testing was in its infancy, preservation of genetic material was advocated in the hope that at some point testing may become available for molecular confirmation of the medical diagnosis, presymptomatic diagnosis, carrier detection, and prenatal diagnosis. DNA banking may be performed at any point in one's life, but is frequently utilized in the perimortem and postmortem periods, especially in the context of a personal or family history of a heritable condition (Quillin et al. 2010 (Quillin et al. , 2018 Cl\u00e9ophat et al. 2020) . Banking may be the last chance to retain a DNA sample for future interpretation when current testing is unclear, not readily available or accessible, or is not desired at the time. For severe adult onset neurological disorders, some individuals may not want to know their molecular status, but choose to bequest testing rights to extended family members (Smith et al. 2014) . In cases where genetic testing is unavailable or inconclusive, DNA banking ensures sufficient relevant genetic material is available for testing as technologies advance, become more affordable and accessible (Overwater et al 2014) .",

This includes informed consent, specimen ownership, specimen and data storage, duration of storage, and ensuring dignity, privacy, and confidentiality. DNA banks are narrower in scope than traditional biobanks, as the individual or their legal representative has complete ownership over the biological specimen. After providing appropriate informed consent, the owner may request for the specimen to be withdrawn, transferred, tested, or destroyed at any point in time. It is important for DNA banks to consider specimen ownership in a broader context as specimens may be received from deceased individuals (postmortem) or from individuals whose life expectancy is limited or whose capacity to provide informed consent is limited. In such situations, ownership of the specimen may be appointed to a designated legal representative.",

This study investigates a single commercial DNA banking service that has acquired samples for 4,874 individuals over a 22-year period. (97.38%) samples originated from the US (zip codes were available for 4,738 of these samples). Samples were received from all 50 states (range 0.04 to 14.38%). Of the non-US samples, 81 (1.66%) were of international origin and 47 (0.96%) did not specify origin Overall, participation rates were higher for female individuals particularly as age increased. This may be a reflection of current societal trends where females are the primary health care decision maker for their families in the US (Matoff-Stepp et al. 2014) . Higher volumes of male samples were observed in age ranges corresponding to prenatal, neonatal, infancy, and early childhood periods. This is consistent with trends in pediatric mortality in the US and may partially reflect male susceptibility to X-linked recessive disorders (Balsara et al. 2013 ). The number of samples deposited for fetal-derived specimens is not surprising given current estimates of monogenic disease and fetal loss (Smith et al. 2015) . For individuals referred to the service by health care providers, the volume of fetal and postmortem specimens in our cohort may also reflect the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) recommendation for retaining appropriate postmortem samples for DNA banking and genetic testing (Middleton et al. 2013) . Preservation of DNA is particularly important for cases with a suspected genetic etiology, as well Fig. 2 Biological specimen source. a A total of 5,043 Specimen types were provided for 4,874 individuals. b Whole blood was the most common specimen type provided DNA banking (83.72%; n = 4,222/5,043). From 1997 to 2007, a whole blood specimen was provided for every DNA banking request, sometimes with additional specimen types. Between 2008 and 2019, whole blood submissions varied from 72.85 to 98.54% per year as sudden and/or unexplained deaths where a cause is not clear at autopsy. Postmortem genetic testing has the potential to identify cause of death and identify relatives at risk for a genetic disorder or sudden death. In cases of recurrent fetal loss, retaining perimortem and postmortem DNA may aide future reproductive planning. Furthermore, in cases where individuals decline traditional autopsy due to personal beliefs, DNA banking may offer an alternate means to elucidate cause of death.",

These findings are consistent with prior studies, which have reported lower utilization of clinical genetic services in racial and ethnic minorities within the US (Underhill Lynch et al. 2017; Carroll et al. 2020 ). Likewise, lack of insurance and/or reliance on Medicaid has also been reported to be a major barrier for genetic service access, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities in the US (Lynch et al. 2017; Rajpal et al. 2017 ). As the out-ofpocket cost of DNA banking is typically lower than that of clinical genetic testing in the US, this service has the potential to be accessible to individuals from a broad range of socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds (Quillin et al. 2011) . Although cost is a common barrier to genetic testing, lack of testing recommendation or lack of referral for genetic services is also cited as a major barrier to access, particularly in minority populations (Muller et al. 2018; Cragun et al. 2019 ). In addition, lack of knowledge, lack of information, lack of communication, and distrust of the medical system may also limit participation in biobanks and utilization of precision medicine services among individuals from minority populations within the US (Heredia et al. 2017; Rosas et al. 2020) . Interestingly, willingness to donate to research biobanks is correlated with increased knowledge and positive opinions of the service, which suggests that providing public education be a key initiative to improve commercial DNA bank enrollments (Domaradzki and Pawlikowski. 2019) . Collectively, promotion of genetic training programs for health professionals, community outreach programs for the general public, and partial or full coverage of DNA banking services by insurance may increase the accessibility and utilization of DNA banking and other genomic services in the US (Quillin et al. 2011; Senier et al. 2019) .",

Acceptable specimen types changed over the 22-year interval. For the first 14 years of the service, the specimen type was almost exclusively restricted to whole blood. Although on rare instances, additional specimen types were banked along with whole blood. From 2011 onwards, the lab began formally accepting additional tissue types, as well as extracted DNA. This dataset is known to contain related individuals. The DNA banking service does not maintain genealogical information for participants. Due to potential violation of random, independent sampling, data in this study was limited to descriptive statistics. Generalizations from this cohort may also be limited as there are known socioeconomic biases in access and knowledge of DNA banking and genetic testing in the US (Quillin et al. 2018; Canedo et al. 2019 ). Lastly, the information presented in this study is based on zip codes as a proxy for demographic information, which was imputed based on ACS from a fixed 5-year interval.",
