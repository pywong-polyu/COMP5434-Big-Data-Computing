            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is the first pandemic of the third decade of the 21 st century. The first cases with COVID-19 infection were detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, in December 2019, presenting with fever, cough, pneumonia, and lymphopenia, and unamenable to usual antibiotics. The etiology was soon detected to be a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Despite robust measurements, the infection became pandemic in less than three months, with more than 41 million infected cases and over 1.1 million deaths by the end of October 2020. 1, 2 Since then, the differentiation between COVID-19 and influenza has remained critical for patient management. Currently, the gold-standard diagnostic test for COVID-19 is considered to be the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Nonetheless, not only is this test unavailable even in many developed countries, but also it is associated with questionable accuracy. In this context, chest computed tomography (CT) scanning continues to be of vital importance for diagnosis. Chest CT has a high sensitivity of about 95% to 97% in the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia. 3, 4 Despite the very promising sensitivity of chest CT to detect COVID-19 infection, the major limitation of this modality is still its low specificity. 5 Currently, radiologists with limited chest imaging experience cannot differentiate COVID-19 from other viral or bacterial pneumonia conditions with high accuracy. Hence, any technique that can improve the specificity of chest CT can enhance their performance. The low specificity of chest CT to differentiate this pneumonia can be partially attributed to the inability of the human eye to detect subtle radiology findings. Generally, the human eye can identify a few radiology features such as the size, density, borders, and enhancement of lesions. In this context, radiomics has proven itself as a rapidly evolving research field in radiology. The basic concept behind radiomics is the ability of computers and software to detect many more radiology features from medical images. In radiomics, the region of interest is generally selected and segmented by a radiologist in order that many features can be extracted from the segmented area. The extracted feature is then analyzed to detect the best diagnostic feature before artificial intelligence (AI) models are developed for these features. 6 In this study, we sought to determine whether radiomics in tandem with different AI models could improve the specificity of chest CT to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from H1N1 pneumonia.",

Pulmonary lesions in the chest CT images in the lung window were then segmented by the same radiologist using 3D Slicer. 7 If a part of a lesion was ground-glass opacification/opacity, and the other part was consolidation, the lesion was segmented as two different lesions. Patchy lesions attaching to each other were considered a single lesion. Axial CT was used for segmentation. Each lesion was segmented in multiple axial slices, and the segmented areas were added to obtain a 3D volume for each lesion. The one-third central portion of the bronchovascular structures was avoided during the segmentation, whereas the two-thirds peripheral portions of the bronchovascular structures were included within the segmented lesions, if they were encased by parenchymal opacities. Pulmonary fissures were also avoided during the segmentation, and large pulmonary lesions were limited to a single pulmonary lobe. Chronic lesions such as calcifications, fibrosis, cavities, pleural effusions, lymphadenopathy, and atelectasis were diagnosed visually by the radiologist at the segmentation time and were not included in the segmentation.",

The authors extracted radiomics features from pulmonary lesions and then selected the most predictive features via LASSO.

            "text": "The application of radiomics feature extraction with different scanners is challenging. Reports indicate that feature extraction depends on the imaging protocol, reconstruction techniques, scanner vendors, and imaging protocol. [17] [18] [19] [20] In our study, CT images were obtained via the same pulmonary protocol with similar thickness, pitch factor, and matrix and with almost the same kVp and mAs. Still, we obtained the images by using three different CT scanners, which could interface with the observed results. To avoid the bias induced by different CT scanners, we repeated the AI model training once more after harmonizing the extracted features. Harmonization has been proposed to resolve the effect of different scanners, protocols, and image reconstruction techniques on radiomics-based models. In this context, ComBat harmonization has been promising, and it is especially robust in improving chest CT feature extraction. It has been reported that this technique can reduce the variance of extracted features by different chest CT protocols even close to zero. 21 The same technique also enhanced our classifier models. This finding again confirms that radiomics feature extraction is scanner and protocol dependent, and that all features must be harmonized before AI model training.",

Indeed, PCR can be negative in 38% of patients with COVID-19 on the day of initial symptoms. 23 Having an additional technique with a low false-negative rate in detecting COVID-19 could lessen this PCR weakness. Our review of the confusion matrix showed that our best model missed very few lesions of COVID-19 (false-negative rate= <1%). We believe that our model or similar platforms can diminish the low sensitivity of PCR in COVID-19.",

The chest CT images were obtained with the lung protocol and thickness of less than 1.5 mm. PCR: Polymerase chain reaction; CT: Computed tomography; ML: Machine learning of estimators=50 and learning rate=100,000), and random forest (number of trees=11). The application of LASSO, PCA, and redundancy maximum relevance did not change ML performance, so all the features were used for the final ML development. Nevertheless, the feature selection techniques suggested that the size of the lesion (shape), large dependence emphasis (GLDM), large-area low gray-level emphasis (GLSZM), and gray-level nonuniformity (GLSZM) were the most important features apropos of correlation with the class output. With the use of the raw features, the neural network (100 layers) had the highest area under the curve (AUC). The AUC of the neural network was 0.87 and 0.87 for the 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation analyses, respectively. These numbers were 0.79 and 0.86 for decision tree, 0.83 and 0.84 for SVM, 0.85 and 0.83 for random forest, 0.85 and 0.79 for AdaBoost, 0.7 and 0.7 for Na\u00efve Bayes, and 0.57 and 0.55 for k-NN. The performance of these models is summarized in table 3. The training was repeated once more on the harmonized features to resolve the possible effect of the different scanners on the extracted features and the subsequent classification models. The 10-fold cross-validation and leaveone-out cross-validation analyses of these models demonstrated improved classification by using the harmonized features. This time, the random forest had the highest performance with an AUC of 0.97 for 10-fold cross-validation(table 4), and 0.969 for leave-one-out cross-validation. These numbers were 0.91 and 0.93 for neural network (100 layers), 0.91 and 0.9 for AdaBoost, 0.89 and 0.89 for decision tree, 0.85 and 0.85",
