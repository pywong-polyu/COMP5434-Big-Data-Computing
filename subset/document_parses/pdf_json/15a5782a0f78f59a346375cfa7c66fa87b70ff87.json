Healthcare workers (HCW) are overexposed and infection rates are higher than in the rest of the population. Strict clinical assessment is paramount to detect suspicious cases. In this context, olfactory or taste dysfunction (OTD) appears as an early and frequent symptom. Evaluating its presence in early stages plays an important role nowadays. Methods We performed a descriptive observational single-center study among 256 HCW at Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada affected by COVID-19 and confirmed using RT-PCR. A telephonic interview was performed, after obtaining oral informed consent. Results OTD was present in up to 70% of the cases as an early symptom, including mild-to-severe cases. The extent of these sensory deficits lasted an average of 11 days. In 26% of the patients, these sensory alterations persisted for over a month. Conclusion OTD is reported as an early symptom among HCW with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its strong association with test positivity is useful in the management of the infection and should be enough to indicate preventive isolation. We consider that OTD needs to be included in clinical screening questionnaires in HCW.",

Indeed, in our series, three cases had their PCR done only because of their hyposmia as a unique and presenting symptom. Lechner et al. [22] outlined anosmia and ageusia as potential screening symptoms. We believe that olfactory and taste dysfunction may be found independently due to the fact that we have patients who presented with one or another symptom separately. Furthermore, when both of the symptoms were present, grading in the modified VAS for each was respectively very different leading to the idea of them being independent of each other. Nevertheless, in some cases undoubtedly, dysgeusia could be secondary to olfactory loss.",

We agree with Reitsma et al., indicating that healthcare workers are at extra risk of getting infected,nevertheless, they also emphasize the fact that they give us a unique opportunity to question about their symptomatology due to the circumstances. They also highlight, in any case, that anosmia as the only complaint, or anosmia combined with either fever and/or shortness of breath seems to be the best predictor of early COVID-19 infection [26] .",
