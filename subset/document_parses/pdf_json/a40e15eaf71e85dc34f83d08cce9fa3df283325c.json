As of March 11, 2021, more than 200 countries, regions or territories around the world have recorded COVID-19 cases, with more than 100 million confirmed cases along with more than 2 million deaths worldwide (https://covid19.who.int/). Transmission of Novel Coronavirus can be divided into direct contact transmission and airborne transmission. The direct contact refers to contact with infected patients, which results in extremely high risk of infection, and airborne transmission through dispersed droplets and aerosol, which presents an uncertain infection risk (Chia et al. 2020, Sakharov and Zhukov 2020) . Infected people spread virus particles when talking, coughing or sneezing, which further adhere to the droplets of mucus and saliva (Raj, Velraj and Haghighat 2020) . The aerosol propagation is achieved by smaller droplets that could spread to far distances (Jayaweera et al. 2020 ). In the past, there were studies on other cases of diseases transmission by aerosol, such as influenza (Malik Peiris, Poon and Guan 2009), SARS (Ignatius et al. 2004 ) and smallpox (Kiang and Krathwohl 2003) , which will be revisited in this study.",

(Anand, Cheong and Sekhar 2020) reported on the role of room air purifiers in the spread of COVID. In this sense, CDC and OSHA have recommended the use of physical barriers between the workers to reduce exposure. This approach has been widely applied to separate office workers, manufacturing workers, meat and poultry processing workers, retail food service workers, etc. (Laue 2018, Shirzadi, Tominaga and Mirzaei 2020) . The Canadian National Collaborating Center for Environmental Health (NCCEH) published a guideline for use of such partitions (van Hooff and Blocken 2020).",

            "text": "With the prospects of return to public places and workplaces in gradual transition to normal circumstances, implementation of low-cost disease transmission strategies, in particular for open spaces, is rather imperative. Even though physical isolation measures such as wearing masks (Liao et al. 2021 ) and keeping social distance (Choi and Shim 2021) are reducing the transmission of aerosol particles, there is still a risk of virus infection within indoor environments. In this sense, proper distribution of airflow and use of physical barriers can decrease the spreading of aerosol particles, thus further reducing the risk of human infection (Xu et al. 2020) . The critical factors impacting indoor airflow distribution include ventilation mode (location and design of air diffusers) as well as supply airflow rate (Bjorn and Nielsen 2002 , Ding et al. 2020 , Chen, Feng and Cao 2021 , Lv et al. 2019 . In case of physical barrier and air deflectors, the focus will be on large and open space (Espinosa and Glicksman 2017, Lv et al. 2019 ). The goal is to effectively adopt forced interference strategies (e.g., physical barrier) in the premise of appropriate and sufficient airflow. So far, no systematic study has been done to investigate the effectiveness of such physical barriers on preventing the disease transmission and to analyze its interference with HVAC systems under varied operational and air diffuser location scenarios.",

Fig. 8 displays distribution of airflow field under current and modified ventilation modes at planes of x=3.3 m, y=3.1 m and z=1.1 m. The results points to an average velocity magnitude for modified ventilation mode that is about 3.5 times higher than that of current ventilation system. According to Fig. 8 (b-c) , the ventilation air supplied to the occupied area is significantly increased in modified ventilation mode due to a larger jet airflow that can be created by diffuser in order to reach the occupied areas along the walls. In addition, it can be observed that the modified airflow pattern has a greater impact on airflow uniformity compared to the current ventilation system, which is one of the disadvantages of increasing the air change rate per hour (ACH).",

Fig. 9 shows the velocity distribution field at the planes of x=3.3 m and y=3.1 m for different physical barrier heights for pollution source at location B. Fig. 10 illustrates the airflow distributions at the plane of z=1.1 m with the same conditions as Fig. 9 . In case of physical barrier absence, the airflow generated by the coughing at location B can directly follow to the breathing area of the opposite staff and spread to the further area, as presented in Fig. 9 (a) and Fig. 10 (a) . As the barrier height grows to above 40 cm, the airflow from the pollution source located at B can hit the physical barrier directly to form an upward flow and exit through the outlet, as shown in Fig. 9 (b-e) . If the height further increases, the coughing flow from personnel is well blocked by the barrier. According to Fig. 10 (b-d) , as the height of barrier gradually increases, less diffusion airflow spreads to the side regions close to source B. With higher barrier heights, collision jet may be introduced into the working area to further increase airflow volatility. In general, barrier height of at least 40 cm has a sufficient effect on airflow obstruction when the pollutant source is located at position B. The corresponding non-uniformity effect can be more obvious for office areas where the height is 60 cm or higher. Further simulations were carried out to verify the impact of physical barrier height on the velocity fields through analyzing the cases with pollutant source locations at A and C, as shown in for airflow hindering, similar to conditions of pollutant sources A and B. Fig. 12 (b-c) and Fig. 12 (e-f) show the inhomogeneity of indoor airflow is also dramatically increased with the barrier height set to 60 cm or greater values. In summary, a barrier height of at least 40 cm is recommended to prevent the dispersion of virus from an infected occupant with unknown location in an open office. as shown in Fig. 13 (a) and Fig. 14 (a) . Roughly 16 occupants have relative concentration values of above 0.6% in their working area. As the height of physical barrier increase to 40 cm, it starts to show a blocking effect on pollutant dispersion as displayed in Fig. 13 (b), corresponding to the work zone of about 11 occupants, as shown in Fig. 14 (b) . With the barrier height increases above 50 cm (i.e., 60 cm and 70 cm), the obstructive effect towards pollutant is more obvious, as shown in Fig. 13 (d-e) and Fig. 14 (c-d) . Further analyze was carried out to study the influence of different barrier heights on pollutant dispersion by comparing the simulation results for pollutant source located at point A and C along with barrier heights of 40, 60 and 70 cm, as displayed in Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 . For pollutant source at A, the hindering effect of physical barrier on the pollution dispersion is not as obvious as that of source of B, as shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 15 (a-c) . The ranges of relative concentration above 0.6% correspond to the working areas for 18, 3 and 0 occupants with barrier heights of 40, 60 and 70 cm, respectively, according to Fig. 16 (a-c) . It is observed that the airflow propagation is affected by the barrier height. However, as pollutant source A is far away from the air outlet, there will be a slow diffusion state for pollutants. For pollution source located at position C, the average relative concentration values are decreased by 23% and 15% in comparison with pollution sources at point A and B, respectively (with a barrier height of 40 cm). As per Fig. 15 (d-f) and Fig. 16 (d-f) , most of pollutants produced by a infected person can be directly discharged from indoor space since the location of source C is rather close to the outlet, as shown in Fig. 4 . Appendix A shows an unsteady dispersion process of pollutant lasting up to 100s following a cough at position C. In case of pollution source at point C, the number of occupied areas with a relative concentration value (C/C ref )",

It is observed that if the height is further increased, the performance of physical barrier will improve with dispersion of pollution becoming negligible such that no relative pollutant concentration of above 0.6% could be observed in occupied areas. In summary, under modified ventilation mode, for a pollution source close to outlet (i.e., pollutant source at B and C), the barrier height of at least 60 cm can show a favorable effect on the pollutant hindering. While for a source position far from the outlet (i.e., pollutant of A), blocking effect of increasing the barrier height is no longer obvious and only reaches an acceptable level with a height of 70 cm or more. Thus, in terms of pollutant dispersion with unclear location of infected person, the barrier height of 60 cm can provide good blocking effect against pollution dispersion. For regions far from the outlet (with a radius distance of larger than 4 m) or those located at zone 3 (shown in Fig. 4) , a 70 cm height (or more) may not be effective in obstructing the spread of contaminant. In these circumstances, locations in distant areas of zone 3 and faraway from the air outlet may not be recommended for workstations. ",

It may be advisable for occupants to stay away from certain areas such as zone 3, as shown in Fig. 4 . Three additional cases are supplemented as shown in Fig. 19 (a) , it could be observed that a barrier height below 80 cm and pollutant source located at A (around 4.2 m away from the outlet), the obstruction effect was not varying from the case with a barrier height of 70 cm (as shown in Fig. 15 and Fig. 16) , in which the maximum infection rate was calculated as 24.3% (ref., Table 5 ). According to the simulation results presented in Fig. 19 (b) , for a barrier height of 70 cm and pollutant source location at A1 (6.5 m away from the outlet), dispersion of pollutants cannot be effectively suppressed below an infection risk of 27.3%, as shown in Table 5 . If the location of pollutant source is in zone 2, 3.8 m from the air outlet, the pollutant dispersion could be restricted with a barrier height of at least 60 cm, such that the personnel infection rate could be reduced to 23%, as shown in Fig. 19 (c) and Table 5 . Hence, it is not suggested for personnel to stay at zone 3 as the mitigation effect of physical barriers cannot be significantly exploited. In order to further improve the applicability of physical barrier, some limitations of this study need to be focused on. In simulation, it was assumed that pollution (in form of aerosols) behaves like a gas (as shown in Appendix A), while the droplets (large-sized coarse particles) from human coughing are assumed to fall to the ground or other surfaces in about 1m from the source. In a real-life situation, the evaporation of liquid droplets to liquid core (changing from large particles to small ones) is also critical in simulation of pollutant dispersion produced by coughing or sneezing.",

It is observed in simulation results, that the infection risk in areas less that 4m from the outlet is well reduced. Understanding the effect of ventilation system on airflow and pollutant concentration, implementation of physical barriers can further reduce the possibility of infection risk (e.g., at least 60 cm height of physical barrier above the desk surface of (a) (b) (c) 80 cm for region within 4 m away from the outlet). However, for a poorly-designed air conditioning system without sufficient ventilation air and uniform air diffuser locations, the effect of barrier height in reducing the infection rate remains to be verified. In other cases with room heights, spaces and ventilation modes which are different from the office, the performance of physical barrier and effective coverage distance of the outlet are also the focus of attention. Moreover, it is essential to integrate the prevention strategies (e.g., physical barrier) with related control techniques, such as multi-mode ventilation system (Shao et al. 2017) , intelligent and online monitoring of air condition systems Ren 2018, Cao and Ding 2020) , demand-controlled supply air devices (Wang et al. 2021) . Lastly, the design of physical barriers or air conditioning systems (including supply air openings and pipelines) has to be in line with functional and aesthetic requirements. The optimization of design and costing can further help to meet the needs of different groups of people and achieve broader application prospects.",

With a single source of pollution (one occupant infected out of 43), the maximum infection risk for other 42 occupants is estimated. In case of numerous pollution sources, one could adopt a linear ventilation model (LVM) to rapidly obtain the corresponding concentration fields (Ren and Cao 2020), i.e., utilizing the principle of linear superposition to calculate the infection risk for multiple pollutant sources. Fig. 17 depicts occupant infection risk corresponding to various barrier heights and pollution source locations. Without a physical barrier, the infection risk for a single source of pollution located at point A, B or C positions could be up to 100%. With implementation of barriers of 40 cm and 50 cm, the infection risk can be reduced to 59% and 63%, respectively, for source C. If physical barrier height is above 50 cm, infection probability, with a pollutant source at A, can be decreased to 37% and 25%, corresponding to the barrier heights of 60 cm and 70 cm, respectively. In case of a pollution source at B, a barrier height of 60 cm can reduce the infection risk to about 20%, but infection probability does not significantly decrease with further increase of height. In case of a pollution source at C, infection risk can remain steadily below 10% if barrier height is increased to 60-70 cm. In sense, due to the unknown location of infected personnel in an open office, a barrier height of at least 60cm would be appropriate for the workstations close to the outlet (with a maximum distance less than 4 m) or located in zones 1 and 2 (as shown inFig. 4). In case of zone 3 (which is away from the air outlet), a 70 cm physical barrier height shows only a limited effect in reducing infection risk. As such, it may be preferable to recommend occupant to stay away from the certain areas located at zone 3 as shown inFig. 4.

As the barrier height increases, the blocking performance is further improved compared to the situation with no physical barrier. The barrier heights of 60-70 cm can prevent the infection risk to 21%.With a physical barrier height of 60 cm, the infection risk has largely decreased to its minimum value, followed by almost no further improvement. In general, if the number of pollutant sources increases to 3, the mitigation of infection risk with barrier heights of above 60 cm is no longer significantly different from that of a single source at either location of A, B and C. In case of an unidentified number of pollution sources, a barrier height of at least 60 cm can be effective for mitigation of infection with sufficient supply air rate (modified ventilation mode).",
