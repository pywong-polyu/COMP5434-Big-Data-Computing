In addition, one third of patients achieved steroid-free remission during follow-up (week 24 and week 52). Our study provides some relevant findings on the long-term real-life effectiveness of ustekinumab treatment in UC. With respect to drug survival, we observed that the proportion of patients maintained under ustekinumab treatment was over 60% at 12 months, being primary failure the main reason for ustekinumab discontinuation. These results are similar to those reported for other drugs in particularly refractory patient populations [5] [6] [7] . We acknowledge that ustekinumab might have been maintained in some patients, despite not reaching clinical remission, as the last medical option to avoid surgery. However, ustekinumab might have exerted some effect even in those patients avoiding colectomy (less than 10% of our patients ended-up undergoing surgery).",

Aims: To evaluate the durability, effectiveness and safety of ustekinumab in UC in real-life. Methods: Patients included in the prospectively maintained ENEIDA registry who received at least one intravenous dose of ustekinumab due to active UC [Partial Mayo Score (PMS) >2] were included. Clinical activity and effectiveness were defined based on PMS. Shortterm response was assessed at week 16. Results: A total of 95 patients were included. At week 16, 53% of patients had response (including 35% of patients in remission). In the multivariate analysis, elevated serum Creactive protein was the only variable significantly associated with lower likelihood of achieving remission. Remission was achieved in 39% and 33% of patients at weeks 24 and 52, respectively. Thirty-six percent of patients discontinued the treatment with ustekinumab during a median follow-up of 31 weeks. The probability of maintaining ustekinumab treatment was 87% at week 16, 63% at week 56, and 59% at week 72; primary failure was the main reason for ustekinumab discontinuation. No variable was associated with risk of discontinuation. Three patients reported adverse events; one of them had a fatal severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Ustekinumab is effective both in the short and the long-term in real-life, even in a highly refractory cohort. Higher inflammatory burden at baseline correlated with lower probability of achieving remission. Safety was consistent with the known profile of ustekinumab.KEYWORDS: ustekinumab, ulcerative colitis, response, remission, durability, real-world evidence.",

In this study, at weeks 12-16, 39.8% of patients had clinical remission. This figure is quite similar to ours: 34.7% of patients were in remission at week 16.We found that CRP serum concentration over the normal range upper limit was the only factor significantly associated with lower probability of achieving remission. Similarly, Amiotet al observed that patients with PMS>6 had significantly lower chance of achieving remission in the short-term 2 . Those findings suggest that the inflammatory burden has a significant impact on ustekinumab effectiveness during the induction in UC patients. Other factors, such as concomitant treatment with immunomodulators or the number of previous biologics do not seem to have an impact on treatment response. The long-term effectiveness of ustekinumab in UC in real life has hardly been studied. Ochsek\u00fchn et al. published a retrospective series of 19 UC patients treated with ustekinumab 3 . The main aim was to know the proportion of patients in clinical remission at one year; 53% of patients (10/19) had clinical remission after 12 months of treatment.",
