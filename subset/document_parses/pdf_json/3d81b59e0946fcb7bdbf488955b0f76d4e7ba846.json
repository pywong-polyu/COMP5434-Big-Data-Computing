India, like other countries, is also facing the wrath of Covid 19 pandemic. By end of May, 2020, there have been 6.3 million cases globally, with 374,000 deaths. In response, the countries took unprecedented steps like closure of international borders, lock down and enforcement of social distancing. The basic aim was to prevent breakdown of fragile health system that is unable to counter such a viral onslaught. With reports that the virus is transmitting within community in US and Europe much before official recognition of such event raises the same question for India [7] . With early closure of boundaries and nation-wide lockdown, the epidemic is apparently having a sluggish growth in the country. It is supported by the fact that the number of total cases now takes more than 15 days for getting double [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 692, "end": 695, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 931, "end": 934, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "WHO, as a strategy to overcome the pandemic, suggested for extensive testing [10] .
