The classical SIR model implicitly requires an exponential distribution for the length of this period of time. We will show how a general distribution can be easily taken into account using the Transient Little Law and present numerical methods to solve the model in an efficient way. Our numerical experiments show that in the presence of a more realistic distribution, with lower variability than the exponential distribution, the size of peak of infected individuals on the graph will be higher and occur earlier. Conversely, a higher-variability distribution will lead to a lower peak that takes longer to dissipate. We also discuss some extensions to the basic model, to include variants like SEIRD and SIS. These findings should have profound and important consequences in the design of public policy. : medRxiv preprint",

Predicting the size, and ultimate impact of the pandemia, is not easy, because there are still many unknowns. We think, however, that there is a contributing factor that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been identified in academic literature: most models used for prediction are some variant of the SIR model, that does not explicitly consider the probability distribution for the length of the infectious period, but rather assume a recovery rate proportional to the number of infectious individuals. As we will see, this is akin to assuming an exponential distribution.",

The population is split in three groups: the Susceptible (S) are all individuals in a population that have not been infected; Infectious (I) are those individuals that have acquired the disease and are assumed to be infectious from the moment they get it; finally, the Removed (R) are the individuals that have either recovered or died, and are assumed to have gained immunity and, therefore, will not be infected again. It is assumed that the total population remains constant, so there are no births and no deaths for other causes other than the epidemic itself.

In this paper, we will adopt the convention that the previous quantities are measured as a percentage of the total population, so S 0 + I 0 + R 0 = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1. The term \u03b2S(t)I(t), in equations (1a) and (1b), tells us that the rate of incidence of new infections is both proportional to the number of infected individuals, I(t), and also to the proportion of available individuals, S(t), and this makes sense. The term \u03b3I(t), however, is problematic. It implies that in the next \u2206t any of the infected individuals will recover with the same probability \u03b3\u2206t, regardless of how long ago they acquired the disease. A random variable that exhibits this behavior is said to have a memory-less property. This, in turn, implies that the length of the disease must follow an exponential distribution with mean \u03b3 \u22121 , since it is well-known that the exponential is the only distribution that follows this property (see, e.g., [4] ). We will show how to incorporate in the model an arbitrary distribution for infectious period. The resulting model is not a set of ODE, but it is still easy to compute in a few seconds. To the best of our knowledge, our results are new. The reader can see other techniques that have been applied to stochastic modeling of epidemics in the surveys [5] and [6] , and references therein.",

Arrivals spend a time T characterized by the distribution G(t) \u2261 P{T \u2264 t}. For convenience, throughout this paper, we will often use the survival function, G(t) \u2261 1 \u2212 G(t). For our case, we will assume this time is independent of the arrival process, although those assumptions are not required for the TLL. For the moment, assume at time t = 0 the system is empty. At any later time, t > 0, the number of expected arrivals that have occurred so far, \u039b(t), will be split as \u039b(t) = I(t) + R(t), where I(t), is the expected value of entities still in the system, and R(t) is the expected value of departures.

One could use a computation scheme like Simpson rule, readily available in many libraries like SciPy [8] . However, for some distributions, g(t) can be very high when t is close to 0, and that would pose a challenge for the precision and stability of the integral computation. Therefore, we devised a robust algorithm to compute the integral, converting I(t)S(t) into a piece-wise linear function and then computing the exact integral. Let B(t) \u2261 S(t)I(t).

First, given the current prominence of the spread of Covid-19, we run the model with parameters close to those that have been reported for this disease. In particular, we will use the parameters reported in [10] : we assume that T is distributed as a Normal(mean = 4.5, SD = 1), and the basic reproductive number, R 0 = 2.2. R 0 represents the number of individuals infected directly by an individual that is infected. In the classical SIR model, R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3. Our purpose here is not to present a fit for Covid-19 dynamics in any particular geography, since that is outside of the scope of this paper. Rather, if we assume that the given parameters are valid for a particular hypothetical epidemic, that we will call DIVOC, we will show how different the dynamics will be for the SIR-G model compared to the classical SIR model. In Figure 1 , you can see how these models behave. The model that uses a realistic distribution (dotted lines) has a peak higher and earlier. The classical SIR model predicts size of the peak to reach 19% of the population and occur on day 50. However, in the SIR-G model we see that the peak is reached much earlier on day 36 and will reach 36%. This would have important consequences on the strain placed on medical facilities and the number of ICU's beds and respirators needed. Interestingly enough, the limit value of R(t) is the same in both cases. Therefore, in both models the number of people that ever gets infected is the same (and consequently, assuming all patients can get the same quality of care, the number of deaths will be identical as well). In Section 7, we provide a mathematical proof that this result will hold in general, regardless of the distribution.",

Also, the family of PH distributions is closed under many operations. In particular, as we will see, the residual equilibrium distribution in (4) is a PH distribution. There are well established methods to fit data or moments to create a PH distribution (see e.g. [13, 14, 15] ), and there are libraries that allow users to easily fit data to distributions and manipulate the variables with relatively little coding ( [16, 17] ",
