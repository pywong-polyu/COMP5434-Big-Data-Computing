A recent study demonstrated that children with hearing loss reported lower QoL scores as compared with normal-hearing peers only in hearing-related instruments. 5 This confirms the importance of using a specific tool.",

            "text": "QoL is defined by World Health Organization as ''an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns.'' 6 Health-related QoL is an important measure that has to be assessed in several pathologic conditions. Even if its evaluation requires the use of ad hoc questionnaires, there are several tools used in the world to measure it in deaf children, but they are not specific. A recent review about the impact that pediatric hearing loss has on QoL 7 showed us different tools to evaluate it, but the authors concluded that ''an instrument addressing the relevant domains of QoL in hearing impaired children, such as the Youth Quality of Life Instrument and the HEAR-QL [Hearing Environments and Reflection on Quality of Life], may be more sensitive in detecting differences in hearing related QoL.'' In fact, only these 2 instruments are a condition-specific QoL measure in a population of children or adolescents who are deaf. The first is for 11-to 18-year-olds 8 : the Youth Quality of Life Instrument-Deaf and Hard of Hearing Module (YQOL-DHH). The second, the HEAR-QL, has 2 versions: the HEAR-Q-26, which applies to 7-to 12year-olds, 9 and the HEAR-Q-28, which applies to 13-to 18year-olds. 10 Another important but older review showed that for children with cochlear implants, there were no specific instruments that assessed the impact of deafness on the QoL, 11 but a recent study brought out a new conditionspecific tool for children aged 6 to 12 years with cochlear implants: the QOL-CI. 12 Adolescence is one of the most difficult periods of life. It is defined by World Health Organization as ''the phase of life between childhood and adulthood, from ages 10 to 19 years. It is a unique stage of human development and an important time for laying the foundations of good health. Adolescents experience rapid physical, cognitive and psychosocial growth. This affects how they feel, think, make decisions, and interact with the world around them.'' 13 The QoL concept is crucial in youth with hearing loss because this period is characterized by social participation in everyday life. 14 Still little is known about how this phase influences the QoL of teenagers who are deaf. Actually, only the YQOL-DHH and the HEAR-Q-28 are validated tools for this purpose. The first analyzes 3 domains: self-acceptance/advocacy, perceived stigma, and participation. The second analyzes 4 subscales: social interactions, school difficulties, feelings, and hearing situations. These tools are both valid instruments to evaluate QoL in adolescents with hearing loss, but the first includes a larger population in the adolescent period. This is the reason for the current translation.",

An article suggested that in a group of young people with the same degree of hearing loss, the factors that most affect their QoL are the technology used and the school setting. 18 Another important factor affecting the QoL in deaf or hard of hearing youth is the perceived level of difficulty in understanding conversations. 19 It is significantly correlated to lower scores in participation, because it reflects the ability to interact with peers, and to higher scores in the perceived stigma; these are 2 domains of the YQOL-DHH. Sufficient self-esteem is extremely important for psychosocial functioning. In fact, self-esteem is defined as the confidence in one's worth or abilities, and it describes the overall subjective sense of personal value; it consists in how much you appreciate yourself. Children with hearing loss have lower levels of self-esteem in the social domains because they frequently experience lower language and communication skills. Kind of communication, type of education, and audiologic characteristics are related to self-esteem. 20 In Italy we do not have a hearing-related QoL questionnaire for teenagers that could aid different clinicians (eg, otolaryngologists, speech therapists, psychologists, audiometrists) and professionals (eg, communication assistants, teachers) who work with people with hearing loss, to help them to optimize their well-being. There are different generic tools developed for adults and some others where parents or caregivers evaluate the child's QoL, but not one is specific for age and pathology and, above all, self-reported.",

They independently produced a forward translation of the original source instrument (instructions, items, and response choices). In August 2020, both translators and the local project manager, who oversees the translation process, conducted a virtual meeting to create a pooled version. Both translations were compared and potential discrepancies annotated; appropriate formulation choices were then identified to solve the problems. During the reconciliation process, some variations were done according to the culture of the target country, and the original authors were contacted to discuss conceptual interpretation issues.

The third consultant, blind to the original version of YQOL-DHH, produced a backward translation. The goal of this translation was to verify the reflection of the same content of the original questionnaire. A comparison between the translated version and the original source was conducted by the local project manager and the back translator during a video conference. No misunderstandings or inaccuracies in the intermediary forward version were found except for the definition ''hard of hearing,'' which is not used in the Italian clinical practice. Therefore, only the translation of the term ''deaf'' was left in the target language questionnaire. At the end of this phase, the second forward version was ready.",
