            "text": "The ability to confront new questions, opportunities, and challenges is of fundamental importance to human progress and the resilience of human societies, yet the capacity of science to meet new demands remains poorly understood. Here we deploy a new measurement framework to investigate the scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the adaptability of science as a whole. We find that science rapidly shifted to engage COVID-19 following the advent of the virus, with scientists across all fields making large jumps from their prior research streams. However, this adaptive response reveals a pervasive \"pivot penalty,\" where the impact of the new research steeply declines the further the scientists move from their prior work. The pivot penalty is severe amidst COVID-19 research, but it is not unique to COVID-19. Rather it applies nearly universally across the sciences, and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. While further features condition pivoting, including a scientist's career stage, prior expertise and impact, collaborative scale, the use of new coauthors, and funding, we find that the pivot penalty persists and remains substantial regardless of these features, suggesting the pivot penalty acts as a fundamental friction that governs science's ability to adapt. The pivot penalty not only holds key implications for the design of the scientific system and human capacity to confront emergent challenges through scientific advance, but may also be relevant to other social and economic systems, where shifting to meet new demands is central to survival and success.",

In a similar frame, science has been described as an endless frontier [5][6][7] [8] , engaging an ever-evolving array of questions, opportunities, and challenges [9, 10]. New areas emerge, from synthetic biology to climate change to the COVID-19 pandemic, that demand new and potentially diverse forms of attention [11] [12] [13] [14]. Science's ability to adapt to novel demands is thus critical to scientific and human progress [5][6][7]. Confronted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has looked to science to understand, manage, and construct solutions, all in rapid fashion. Given that few scientists were studying coronaviruses or pandemics prior to 2020-and until recently exactly zero were studying COVID-19 specifically-the advent of COVID-19 called upon scientists across the frontiers of knowledge to consider a directional change or \"pivot\" in their research [15] , which offers a high-scale opportunity to study the adaptability of science. Here we take stock of science's reaction to the pandemic across all scientific fields. We reveal both COVID-specific lessons together with novel and systematic facts about the adaptability of scientific research as a whole, informing the nature of scientific progress and human capacity to confront emergent opportunities and challenges.",

Yet in understanding adaptability there are fundamental unknowns. On the one hand, research suggests that pivoting into new research areas may be difficult. The specialization of expertise [16], the design of funding systems [17, 18] , and the nature of scientific incentives, culture, and communities [19-22] may all limit the capacity of science and scientists to respond effectively to changing demands [23] [24] [25] [26] , and even with substantial new funding opportunities scientists can be reluctant to engage new research directions [27] . On the other hand, the value of novelty [28] [29] [30] and exploration [31] [32] [33] in creative search suggests that large pivots and associated novel perspectives might be especially fruitful in propelling high-impact advances [34, 35] . Further, the rise of teams in science may help to overcome individual limits and facilitate fruitful pivots [16, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . The COVID-19 shock provides a new lens to understand science's adaptability and its constraints, raising several fundamental questions. Who exactly shifts the direction of their research? How far do they travel from their prior work? What factors condition their response and, critically, what is the impact of the research that results?",

We find that a scientist's propensity to write a COVID-19 paper is strongly predicted by the relevance of his or her prior work (Fig. 1C) . Among all authors who published in 2020, those who had not participated in producing this prior body of work had a 4.8% chance of writing a COVID-19 paper. By contrast, those who participated most substantially in producing the relevant corpus of prior work had a 50.1% probability of writing at least one COVID-19 paper, corresponding to a nearly eight-fold increase over the baseline rate. Fig. S2 considers alternative author proximity metrics, based on (i) title keyword similarity between COVID-19 papers and the scientist's pre-pandemic research or (ii) a simple count of the author's relevant prior papers, uncovering similar findings. Together, these results show that scientists are far more likely to write COVID-19 papers when their prior work is quantifiably more relevant.",

Moreover, engaging new coauthors tends to be associated with larger pivots (Fig. S7A-B) . Overall, these results are consistent with teamwork expanding reach [16, 39, 40 ]. Yet at the same time, these new collaborators mostly came from within the same institution We further probe science's adaptability through the lens of funding. Drawing on over 600 different funding sources worldwide, we measure the proportion of grant-supported research for all 2020 papers, separating them into COVID and non-COVID (red vs blue lines in Fig. 4C ). There is a large and monotonic decrease in grant-supported research as pivot size increases for both COVID and non-COVID papers. And this relationship is especially pronounced for COVID-19 papers, which are substantially less likely to cite a funding source across all pivot sizes (Fig. 4C ). Hence while COVID papers are characterized by larger pivots, grant-supported research disproportionately features small pivots. These findings are natural to the extent that existing projects are tied to specific agendas, so that large pivots in general, and COVID-19 pivots in particular, tend to occur without acknowledging specific grants. Further examining COVIDspecific funding mechanisms of the NIH and NSF, we find that COVID-specific grants were issued rapidly, peaking from late spring to early fall (Fig. S8 ). Yet at the same time, among the funded PIs who published a COVID-19 paper in 2020, 59% (NIH) and 32% (NSF) of PIs had published at least one COVID-19 paper before receiving the grant, suggesting the adaptive funding may still lag the early adaptive research efforts. Overall, these results show that grant funding in science is associated with less pivoting, and appears to facilitate scientists engaged in consistent rather than adaptive research streams. In the case of COVID-19, despite the adaptive efforts by funders such as the NSF and NIH, science's response came largely without project-specific funding, especially in the critical, early phase of the pandemic.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has produced enormous demand for relevant scientific research [55] and provides a high scale event to examine the adaptability of science. We find that science faces systematic challenges to pivoting research, which may not be easy to overcome. Although an extremely broad frontier of science engaged in COVID-related research, the highest-impact work came from those pre-situated closely to the subject, and even these individuals were pivoting to a personally unusual degree. COVID-19 authors tended to be high-impact scientists, but not young ones, often worked in large teams and with novel coauthors, and they pivoted largely without project-specific funding. Most importantly, the response betrays a deep tension, where the further people pivot, the less impactful the work tends to be. This 'pivot penalty' appears not only among COVID-19 research but also across the sciences, and it has become increasingly pronounced over the past five decades.",

Outside the emergency context, these findings also challenge the notion of outsiders offering fresh insights, further emphasizing the importance of expertise and accumulation of knowledge. Research on creative search has documented the benefits of exploration [31] and out-of-box thinking [22, 57, 58] .

This expertise advantage and associated pivot penalty has implications for science institutions in their hiring and funding strategies in pursuit of generating high-impact work.

We restrict our analysis to the 45.2 million papers with at least five references. We do this for two reasons. First, pivot size -our primary variable of interest -uses reference information as a proxy of a paper's knowledge sources. Second, this restriction helps filter out non-research articles and incomplete records. A manual check of a random sample of excluded papers shows that many are commentary or editorial pieces that cite very few references, while some others are due to the lack of reference data sharing between Since our primary interest is papers closely related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we limit the search to the title and abstract, yielding 95.5K COVID-related papers.",

To further ensure the quality of these keywords, we also go through the final word list by hand, allowing us to identify words that took on a different meaning due to COVID. For example, \"princess\" appears as a common COVID word, because of the \"Diamond Princess\" cruise ship. However, prior to COVID, it had no relation to coronaviruses, so we remove it. We use this modified word list to then \"score\" paper titles. For every paper title, we look up the relative frequency measure for each word. The paper's score is then the average of all the title words. We then aggregate up to the author level by averaging the scores of all their pre-2020 papers.

Further Features Condition Adaptability but the Pivot Penalty Persists. (A) We group scientists into three cohorts based on their first publication year. Within each cohort, we find that the probability that a scientist writes a COVID paper is an increasing function of his/her prior impact, as measured by the number of citations accrued from 2015-2019. Comparing across the three cohorts shows that older scientists are substantially more likely than younger scientists to pivot into COVID-19 research.

Nevertheless, studying the adaptability of science in different settings and time scales, beyond emergencies and extending to longer-run research shifts, are key areas for future work. Moreover, the pivot penalty uncovered here is measured through the citationimpact and journal placement of the resulting papers; studying other characteristics may further enrich our understanding about the costs and benefits of scientific pivots. Lastly, pivoting to engage new challenges is not unique to science but may underpin the dynamics of success and survival for individuals, firms, and governments across human society [4, 13, 61, 65-67], 12 suggesting the uncovered pivot penalty may be a generic property of many social and economic systems, with potential applicability in broader domains.
