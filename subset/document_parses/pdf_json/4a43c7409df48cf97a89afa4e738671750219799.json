It is designed to assess if a trainee has gained sufficient knowledge for independent specialist practice in core cardiology. A critical evaluation of the ECCC was undertaken using current educational theory. Miller's Pyramid was considered, and the Utility Equation was employed in a mixed methods approach. The utility analysis findings were that the EECC measured well on reliability and validity although improvement could be made in educational impact, cost-effectiveness and accessibility. Recommendations for enhancement were then put forward. No assessment instrument is perfect, and it is important to remember that the EECC is one component of assessment strategy for specialist trainees, complementing other evidence of professional competence. After appraisal, while improvement can be made, the EECC fulfils its ambitions of assessment.",

As such, devising an appropriate assessment strategy is a crucial component of effective curriculums. Despite challenges, the goal of medical education is a worthwhile pursuit as its aspirations are improvements in patient care. Assessments of the highest quality measuring domains which are principal to the practice of medicine should therefore be designed, evaluated and enhanced [1] .

In his classic model, development of clinical competence is divided into four hierarchies ( Figure 1 ). The lowest tier is knowledge 'Knows' and forms the base for development of expertise. It is the foundation of competence via a solid base of specialist medical knowledge. It is followed by competence 'Knows How' where application of knowledge is assessed via patient management scenarios. In performance 'Shows How', demonstration of knowledge and skills is integrated into successful clinical performance in a simulated controlled clinical environment. Finally, in action 'Does', clinical competence and performance is assessed in vivo based on the assessment of practice in the workplace. Miller's model strives to distinguish between knowledge and action, and it argues that to truly assess professional competence at its highest level, learners should be assessed authentically in the workplace.",

This is because it is a three-hour long examination comprising one hundred and twenty questions over five content domains, and thus, reliable scores can be obtained from large sampling across the specific domains. As a test instrument format, MCQs fare well with higher reliability estimates as they are time-efficient and favour broad sampling. More questions can be sampled per hour of testing time compared to other methods like essays or OSCEs which are more time-consuming. In addition, as an objective assessment, the EECC is not liable to assessor variance which subjective assessment methods are prone to. There is no room for subjectivity or examiner bias from the computer marked sheets. Reliability is also affected by question performance. An example is the poorly written MCQ with inferior distractors which could be plausible to a competent candidate. To ensure adequate question performance, the EECC Board meets to select questions written by the writing group. This standard setting group then reviews each question using a modified Angoff method to estimate its difficulty with the final pass mark informed by their collated scores. To further improve reliability, the questions are reviewed prior to sitting to ensure no errors. After the examination is sat, the performance of each question is reviewed and questions with p-values less than 30% (too difficult) and more than 90% (too easy) and questions where there was a negative correlation with candidate performance (suggesting a poorly written question) are reviewed to ensure that the question was not misleading and the answer key was not inaccurate or that it tests an unimportant content area. Any items of concern are then excluded from the assessment [4] [5] [6] . These measures on examination development all promote reliability of question performance.",

Approximately 50% of questions are those that have performed well in previous exams, and approximately 50% of questions are new [5] . The reuse of questions is practical in objectively marked assessments and promotes reliability, ensuring comparability between year groups. Finally, one area of consideration remains the standard setting. Whilst any standard setting process is inherently subjective and there is no perfect method, the EECC utilises criterion-referenced standards. It uses the modified Angoff method where a group of subject matter experts estimate the performance of a borderline or minimally acceptable candidate. The pass mark is then determined with the Hofstee method, expecting between 75% and 95% of candidates to pass. The above requires suitable expert judges and due diligence. It can be argued that criterion-referenced methods assessing a passing level of minimum competence, compared to normreferenced methods assessing relative performance in a group, are more suited to a professional exam aimed at assessing minimum competence [15, 16] .",

Therefore, one potential recommendation is that members of the question writing group ensure highquality standards of the writing process through suitable training. This is in conjunction with the already available Question Writing Guide [17] .

Thus, the MCQ format remains regarded to be a valid test of competence. To overcome this limitation, one consideration could be the introduction of simulated clinical scenarios or observed clinical encounters. For example, a practical skills station could be incorporated using the Mentice vascular interventional system trainer VIST\u00ae as an endovascular simulator to test the practical competency of coronary angiography skills of candidates. This would be similar to the approach adopted by the British Society of Echocardiography who have a practical assessment station for transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) accreditation using a HeartWorks\u00ae simulator. However, whilst attractive in principle, this approach would likely have an adverse impact practically on the accessibility or cost-effectiveness of the EECC as a multinational assessment.",

Therefore, to mitigate the risks of an exclusively written examination, highquality questions that test application of knowledge and skill have to be written to promote professional authenticity. A further important point is related to the constant evolution of medical knowledge. In the past three years, fourteen updated clinical practice guidelines have been published by the ESC ranging from atrial fibrillation to acute coronary syndromes to supraventricular tachycardia. Cardiology is a fast-changing field with new evidence and examination questions that are not updated which have a real danger of being superseded by new knowledge.

In addition, a computer-based test interface provides further economies of scale. Yet, a conscious decision has to be made for further cost efficiencies as at present, candidates may not be getting value for money. A cost analysis can be undertaken, and there are examples in the literature [27] . One sidenote of practical consideration is related to tax relief for UK candidates. Examination fees were previously tested in court and were understood to be non-tax deductible. This position might have changed after the Court of Appeal judgment in the case of Revenue & Customs Commissioners v Dr Piu Banerjee ([2010] EWCA Civ 843) [28, 29] . The case is related to Dr Banerjee, a specialist registrar in dermatology, who became entitled to tax relief on training costs when employed on an employment contract where training was an intrinsic contractual duty. Following this judgment, various Royal Colleges have published guidance and resources on those wishing to claim tax relief. They include draft sample letters to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs department (HMRC) [30] . The BCS could potentially follow suit in supporting their trainees with similar guidance and sample letters to reduce the cost burden of this examination. One limitation to be recognised is that the authors do not have information to expand about what happens in other European countries for candidates in a similar position; however, we hope that representing the experience of trainees based in the UK, other European readers will be able to apply them to their own educational system where differences exist.",

In addition, the EECC is customarily sat once a year.
