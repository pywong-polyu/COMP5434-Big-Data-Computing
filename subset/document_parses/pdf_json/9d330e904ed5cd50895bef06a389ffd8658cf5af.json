We present a unique case of Miller-Fisher Syndrome (MFS), a variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) that was noted in conjunction with a COVID-19 infection. In this case, a patient presented with bilateral facial palsy, dysarthria, rightsided hemiparesis, ataxia, and the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. His computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and serology test results did not support alternate etiologies for facial palsy. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation, which was consistent with the diagnosis of MFS and further supported by his ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. A five-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy combined with physical, occupational, and speech therapy improved his recovery.",

These receptors are abundant in the lung epithelia but are also present in the small intestines and in the brain at the vascular and neuronal levels [5] [6] . It has been suggested that compared to the prior severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was responsible for the outbreak in 2003, the novel SARS-COV-2 binds to cell membranes expressing hACE2 with greater affinity, resulting in its increased neuro-invasive potential and neurological sequelae [1, 7] .",

While the literature is scant regarding facial diplegia as a neurological complication of SARS-CoV-2, Caama\u00f1o and colleagues suggested it could occur in an atypical variant of GBS [10] . Overall, GBS accounts for 3% of reported bilateral facial palsy cases and is typically preceded by a viral upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection [11] . MFS is a clinical variant of GBS, typically characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. In addition, it may include symptoms such as dysarthria, dizziness, and cranial nerve involvement, which can lead to facial paresis. Although it is one of the rarer neurological sequelae, there have been an increasing number of case reports linking GBS, an immune-mediated polyneuropathy, with COVID-19 infection and even fewer reported cases associated with the MFS variant [12] .",

This is a rare event often found in association with anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibodies, but its absence does not exclude MFS [24] . Numerous studies mentioned in Table 1 had undetectable levels of serum antiganglioside antibodies, including anti-GQ1b. Beyond the theory of hACE2 involvement, it is unclear exactly how the disease process of MFS is induced in individuals who have COVID-19. Treatment for MFS in this context is not largely different from the standard of care. Given the risk of respiratory involvement with MFS, where invasive airway interventions, such as intubation, may be required, patients are typically",
