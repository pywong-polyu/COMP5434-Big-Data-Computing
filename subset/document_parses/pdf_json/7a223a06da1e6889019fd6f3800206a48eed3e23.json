Even though CAV is associated with graft damage, this injury is more insidious and episodic than that of acute rejection.

Our hypothesis is that dd-cfDNA rises only during subclinical acute ischemic episodes, in the same way as cardiac troponin. Both are not usually elevated in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. Unfortunately, the design of our study does not allow to draw inferences about the performance of the biomarker throughout the different stages of the disease.",
