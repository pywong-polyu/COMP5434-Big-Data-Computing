During this process short peptides processed from self or foreign proteins may be presented on the surface bound to MHC molecules for binding to T cell receptors. Those that bind and activate an immune response are called epitopes. Computational prediction of T cell epitopes has many applications in vaccine design and immuno-diagnostics. This is the basis of immunoinformatics which allows in silico screening of peptides before experiments are performed. The most effective approach is to estimate the binding affinity of a given peptide fragment to MHC class I or II molecules.",

            "text": "With the availability of whole genomes for many microbial species it is now feasible to computationally screen whole proteomes for candidate peptides. epitopepredict is a programmatic framework and command line tool designed to aid this process. It provides access to multiple binding prediction algorithms under a single interface and scales for whole genomes using multiple target MHC alleles. A web interface is provided to assist visualization and filtering of the results. The software is freely available under an open source license from https://github.com/dmnfarrell/ epitopepredict Background An essential step in provoking adaptive immunity, delivered by the activated CD8+ or CD4+ T cells, is the recognition of T cell receptor (TCR) to T cell epitopes. The 'epitope' is the peptide-MHC combination resulting from the binding of antigenic peptides to MHC proteins. This is the major determinant step and is computationally predictable. Algorithms that can identify MHC-class I ot MHCclass II binding peptides rapidly and accurately are essential in for vaccine development, neo-epitope discovery and immunogenicity screening of protein therapeutics. Many MHC binding predic-tion methods exist for both class I and II and have been comprehensively reviewed [1] . Currently the most effective are machine learning (ML) based approaches which are trained on existing binding affinity data for a given MHC molecule. To do this the peptide sequence is encoded and these features fit against the known affinity. To date artificial neural networks (ANN) preform better at this task than other models such as linear regression. This is likely because the hidden layers in such networks are better able to account for the contribution of intrapeptide residue-residue interactions to the binding affinity. All methods vary in accuracy over MHC alleles depending on the availability of quality datasets. Pan-allele tools have been developed to deal with this issue [2] . These approaches can impute affinities for unknown alleles on the basis of neighboring MHC with the highest sequence similarity and which have sufficient training data.",

The algorithms perform best at this classification task rather than re-producing exact affinities. This problem is intrinsic to ML-based approaches: the effect of the most dominant features is penalized intentionally to achieve better generalization on blind test data [3] . Another source of the inaccuracy is the loss of sensitivity of experimental assays at either very high or low binding affinity regimes. As a consequence, epitope candidates for subsequent experimental validation selected by ranking the affinities may not necessarily be the best approach. Percentage ranking is now often the recommended method [4] . However the exact approach probably depends on the study in question. For example, searching a small number of proteins might mean taking the top ranked percentile from each sequence regardless of score. Threshold selection is discussed later in the examples.",

We therefore include in our method a global standardization of the score over the entire proteome, similar to that used by Bremel et al. [5] and others, by setting a global cut-off based on the top percentage of scores from the entire proteome. In addition, some alleles have a significantly higher score distribution and will dominate the results if a uniform score cut-off is applied; this applies in general to MHC binding predictors. Thus separate global cut-off per allele so that low scoring alleles would be better represented is also advisable. This approach is consistent with recent work by Paul et al. [6] regarding allele-specific thresholds in MHC-I prediction. Three alternative such threshold strategies are provided in this library and discussed below.",

Each predictor may wrap methods from other python packages or call command line predictors. For example the TepitopePredictor uses the epitopepredict.tepitope module provided with this package. This approach allows us to integrate a new prediction method in a relatively straightforward and consistent manner. The prediction methods always return a Pandas DataFrame [10] in a standard format. The predict_sequences method is used for multiple protein sequences and can be run in parallel. This can take a GenBank or fasta file as input. For large numbers of sequences the prediction function should be called with save=True so that the results are saved as each protein is completed to avoid memory issues, since many alleles might be called for each protein.

The data used for training was primarily from the IEDB and was curated by the authors of MHCflurry [16] from various sources. The regression model must be trained for each allele. When this is done the model is persisted with the joblib module and can be re-loaded for new predictions for that allele.

A typical use of epitope prediction tools is to select a candidate list of peptides for testing from a large sequence space representing multiple potential antigens. This example provides a comparison of the three different selection methods in epitopepredict using a realistic example. It uses a set of known CD4 epitopes discovered in a study by measuring IFN-\u03b3 T cell responses to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) antigens in a healthy South African cohort [23] . The test data is available as supplementary tables in that paper. It comprises 75 15-mer epitopes selected from a set of known Mtb antigens. Here we perform a simple benchmark to find the percentage coverage of predicted MHC-II binders in two predictors, netMHCIIpan and Tepitope, using the three threshold methods for selecting promiscuous binders described above. These are then compared across a selection of cut-offs that each yield a certain number of binders. Ideally we would want to produce as small a number of predicted binders as possible to reduce the number to be experimentally tested.",

For each set of results we found only promiscuous binders above an allele specific cutoff using the 'global' selection strategy. In addition clusters of binders were detected to find areas of high binder density in each sequence. The assumption underlying this method is that 20mer peptides covering these regions will be more likely to yield at least one true positive epitope and hence elicit a T-cell response. The results are a set of clusters for both prediction methods, ranked by number of binders per unit length. This has also been referred to as the 'epitope density' method [25] . We further contrasted this cluster selection with the more conventional ranking of top scoring binders. We also included random non high scoring peptides as a control. 20-mer peptides derived from these sets were synthesized and tested for IFN-\u03b3 responses in M.bovis naturally infected cattle. Approximately 24% out of 270 peptides had high responses (using known epitopes as the baseline response). The random controls had no responses above this threshold.",

This will be especially useful for performing high throughput calculations in many sequences and alleles. It is designed to scale for proteome scanning by allowing multiple processing threads to be used with any of the prediction methods. The API can also be easily applied to single sequences or small numbers of antigens. A web interface allows users to readily review results if they wish.",
