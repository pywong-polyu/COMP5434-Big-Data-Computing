            "text": "The Joint United Nations Programme (UNAIDS) proposed in 2014 the following Fast-Track targets (FTTs) for 2020: 90% of patients living with HIV to know that they are infected, 90% of those infected to be on ART (antiretroviral therapy), and 90% of patients on ART to have an undetectable viral load [5, 6] . When these 90-90-90 targets are achieved, the percentage of all patients virally suppressed is estimated to be 73% of all people living with HIV [5] . Furthermore, UNAIDS, in 2014, estimated that the world AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) epidemic would end by 2030 if the proposed targets are achieved by 2020 [5] . The guidelines for HIV treatment changed in 2015, recommending starting antiretroviral therapy regardless of the number of CD4 T lymphocytes [7] . Until 2015, only patients with CD4 counts below 500/mm 3 had a recommendation for antiretroviral therapy [8] . The treatment guidelines have also been changed over time, and a new class of drugs, namely integrase strand transfer inhibitors-INSTIs (e.g., raltegravir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir), have been introduced in the standard treatment. Due to their higher efficacy, fewer adverse effects, and fewer drug-drug interactions, INSTIs became the first line of antiretroviral therapy [6, 9] . Elvitegravir (EVG), dolutegravir (DTG), and raltegravir (RAL) proved an efficiency with a viral load suppression \u2265 90% (viral load < 50 copies/mL) in HIV-infected treatment-naive and -experienced patients who followed an INSTI-based cART-regimen [10] . Kolakowska et al. [11] reported a higher antiviral potency of INSTIs compared to other classes of ART. However, contradictory neuro-psychiatric effects, especially for DTG, weight gain for DTG, lower adverse effects rates of bictegravir (BIC), and the caution of elvitegravir/cobicistat in patients with other co-morbidities are reported [11] .",

Levi et al. conducted a systematic review of continuum care in 196 countries, evaluated 69 countries [12] , and concluded that none of the evaluated countries met the 90 (up to 87% in the Netherlands)-90 (up to 71% in Switzerland)-90 (up to 68% in Switzerland) targets. Huerga et al. [13] reported higher values of 90-90-90 targets on women (79%-71%-93%) compared to men (68%-68%-92%) on the South Africa population from Mbongolwane, Eshowe, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The reported progress towards 90-90-90 on the Kediri city population in Indonesia was 6.4%-74.9%-9.9%, as reported by Sekalembe et al. in 2020 [14] . In Rwanda, a study conducted in 2018 reported 97% of people living with HIV on ART, and 91% of those on ART were virally suppressed [15] . The 90-90-90 targets reported in 2018 by Brown et al. showed the highest percentages in the West European countries (87%-91%-93%), lowest values in the East European countries (76%-46%-78%), and intermediate values in Central European countries (83%-73%-75%) [16] . In Romania, the reported HIV prevalence is 0.07%, with an annual incidence of 0.002%, and 850 cases/year on average from 2011 to 2017 [17] . A decrease in AIDS incidence and mortality due to ART and a reduction in pediatric HIV infection is observed in Romania [18] . The Romanian cohort, a particularity of this country, is formed by patients younger than 13 years infected iatrogenically before 1991 with HIV, in most cases in hospitals and orphanages [19] . Limited information is available in the scientific literature regarding the 90-90-90 FTTs achievement in Romania. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported in May 2017 the following data for Romania: 98% of people living with HIV were diagnosed, 75% were under ART, and 38% had viral suppression [20] . We aimed to evaluate the UNAIDS 90-90-90 Fast-Track targets' achievements by comparing the continuum-of-care data of HIV-infected patients living in Cluj County in two moments: the end of 2016 and 2020.",

This finding showed the predominance of the disease among men. Still, the lower frequency of women could also be explained by women's social stigma regarding sexually transmitted diseases and thus the tendency to postpone medical evaluation, leading to an advanced stage diagnosis of the HIV infection [28] and, therefore, a less satisfactory treatment outcome.",

The patients with an HIV viral load under 200 copies/mL are considered to have a low risk of transmission of HIV infection [31] , so this target contributes to the decrease in HIV transmission. In our study, the percentage of patients with an HIV viral load below 50 copies/mL (undetectable, Table 2 ) increased by 15.9% at the end of 2020 compared to 2016. In Romania, the patients with an HIV viral load below 200 copies/mL is 81.2%, and those with an undetectable viral load is 73.2% [27] . Our results showed that HIV-infected subjects who live in Cluj County are virally suppressed at a higher percentage than the nationally reported data (Table 2 and Figure 1 ). Furthermore, despite the epidemiologic condition in 2020, the active surveillance of HIV-infected subjects living in Cluj County regarding the viral load was higher than the one reported in 2019 in Romania (78.60%) [32] . In Central Europe, the percentage of patients under ART who are virally suppressed is 75%, and, from all patients with HIV infection, the percentage is 46% [16] . In Cluj County, the data are above the regional averages (Table 4 ) [4, 33] . The results reported in our study could be explained by the fact that ART is initiated within seven days after the diagnosis, and the adherence to the treatment is high. We have generous support from the psychologist in evaluating the patients, increasing their commitment to therapy. In addition, the efficacy of the newest drugs used is another factor that could explain our results. When considering different antiretroviral regimens, we can observe that the number of patients treated with INSTIs has increased from 17.3% to 43.6% in our county (Table 3) . These drugs are currently the preferred first-line used treatment regimen worldwide [34, 35] due to their high efficacy and fewer adverse effects and drug interactions. In our HIV center, we comply with the latest guidelines in HIV treatment and disease monitoring, and over the past four years, we have obtained good results using INSTIs as recommended by the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS). The number of patients in our study undergoing the PI regimen has significantly decreased (Table 3 ) because the treatment schedule involves the intake of many tablets per day, with adverse effects that are more frequent than other ARTs [36] . The number of patients treated with an NNRTI regimen also significantly decreased in 2020 (Table 3) . These drugs proved effective in the viral load reduction ( Figure 1 ) and currently remain an alternative therapeutic regimen, since they have a high rate of side effects. The risk of viral resistance increases if the correct administration of doses according to the schedule is omitted [37] .",

The evaluation of a cohort from only one county could be seen as irrelevant in an international context. However, knowing that the targets of continuum care are achieved at our AIDS Center could be helpful in the context of cross-border health care in the European Union and/or decisions regarding choosing where to study or live. Second, due to sample composition, no age-stratified analysis was appropriate, as recommended in the March 2021 WHO guideline [23] .

Almost 89% of HIV-infected patients living in Cluj County in December 2016 were under ART. The cohort evaluated in December 2016 was predominantly formed by adults (218, 96.5-82.4% virally suppressed), with five adolescents (2.2%, all virally suppressed with undetectable viral load) and three children (1.3%, all virally suppressed with undetectable viral load). Similarly, at the end of December 2020, the evaluated cohort comprised adults (361, 98.1-91.7% virally suppressed), with six adolescents (1.6-83.3% virally suppressed;",
