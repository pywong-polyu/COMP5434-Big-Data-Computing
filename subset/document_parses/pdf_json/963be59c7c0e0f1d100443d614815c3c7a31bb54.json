Migrating data to the cloud raises multiple privacy issues, as they are completely controlled by a cloud provider. Hence, an untrusted cloud provider can potentially breach users' privacy and gain access to sensitive information. The problem becomes even more pronounced when the cloud provider is required to store a statistical database and periodically publish analytics. In this work, we first present a detailed example showing that the use of cryptography is not enough to ensure the privacy of individuals. Then, we design a hybrid protocol based on Functional Encryption and Differential Privacy that allows the computations of statistics in a privacy-preserving way.",

From real-time traffic analysis to disease outbreaks discovery, statistics allow societies to predict critical situations and prepare accordingly. However, along with the growth of cloud computing, such prediction services are moving to the cloud, where untrusted third parties may host and control statistical databases. Naturally, this raises several security concerns as the privacy of individuals can often be breached. These concerns become even greater when the analytics in question refer to extra sensitive data, such as medical records. A first response to these problems was presented in [1] with the formalization of differential privacy.",

In a differential private scheme, a curator (data owner) generates a dataset and, upon request of an analysts, releases statistics. To ensure the individuals' privacy the statistics are filtered through a privacy mechanism and finally the analyst receives a noisy result. However, the results must be published in a way that will allow any analyst to deduce accurate enough results without breaching the privacy of any given individual. Although the problem of privatizing datasets has been thoroughly studied by both researchers and big industrial players like Apple and Google, the problem of further securing datasets with encryption has not drawn much attention so far. In this work, we aim to combine differential privacy with the promising concept of Functional Encryption (FE) in an attempt to design a protocol for privacy-preserving release of statistics.",

More precisely, FE schemes provide key generation algorithms that output decryption keys with remarkable capabilities. In contrast to traditional cryptography, each functional decryption key sk f is associated with a function f . Decrypting a ciphertext Enc(x) using sk f , yields f (x) and thus keeps the x private. More recent works [2] generalized the concept of FE by presenting Multi-Input Functional Encryption (MIFE). In a MIFE scheme, given encryptions Enc(x 1 ), . . . , Enc(x n ), a user can use sk f to recover f (x 1 , . . . , x n ).

PSFE.Setup: Represents a three party protocol between C, the CSP and MA. PSFE.Setup is initiated by C who wants to outsource an encrypted dataset (EDS) to the CSP. To encrypt the dataset, C hashes all the categorical and the ordinal entries concatenated with a salt s to prevent dictionary attacks. Apart from that, C also hashes the entries without the salt and stores each pair (salted and unsalted hashed entry) in a list L MAs . For the numerical ones, C generates a symmetric key k and uses it to encrypt the corresponding entry. Apart from that, for each generated k, C generates a unique index. The keys, along with their indexes are stored in a list L MA k . Finally, C sends m 1 = t 1 , pk CSP (EDS), \u03c3 C (H(t 1 ||EDS)) to the CSP and m 2 = t 2 , pk MA (L MA k , L MAs ), \u03c3 C H(t 2 L MA ) to MA. Upon receiving these messages, both the CSP and MA verify their freshness (by looking at the timestamps t 1 and t 2 ) and the identity of the sender (by verifying the signature). If the verifications are successful, the CSP stores EDS and MA stores both L MAs and L MA k . In addition to that, both the CSP and MA send an acknowledgement to C that they have successfully stored EDS and the two lists via m 3 = t 3 , \u03c3 CSP (H(t 3 EDS)) and m 4 = t 4 , \u03c3 MA (t 4 L MAs L MAs ) respectively.

Upon receiving m 6 old , A verifies the signature, and since m 6 old contains a valid CSP's signature, the verification is successful. However, when A tries to verify the freshness of the message, she notices that the timestamp is old and thus drops the communication. As a result, the only way for ADV to successfully launch the attack, is to use another result list R mal . Just like before, when the CSP sends m 6 to A, ADV intercepts the communication and replaces R with R mal . However, the result list R is also included in the CSP's signature. Thus, replacing R with R mal in an indistinguishable way, is equivalent to forging the CSP's signature.

Flow of PFSE.SetupPSFE.Read: Represents a tree party protocol between A, the CSP and MA. PSFE.Read is initiated by the analyst A wishing to perform statistical analysis on the encrypted dataset. To do so, A first generates a search token \u03c4 s as \u03c4 s = H(w i ), H(w j ), f , where H(w i ) refers to a categorical or ordinal value, H(w j ) refers to a variable, and f is the description of a function that will be applied to the ciphertexts. Then, A sends m 5 = t 5 , \u03c4 s , \u03c3 A (H(t 5 \u03c4 s )) to the MA. Upon reception, MA verifies the freshness and the signature of m 5 . If the verification is successful, MA retrieves the list L MAs , containing the salted hashes, finds which salted values correspond to H(w i ) and H(w j ) and sends them to the CSP via m 6 = t 6 , H(w i s i ), H(w j s j ), \u03c3 MA (t 6 H(w i s i ) H(w j s j )). Upon reception, the CSP verifies the freshness and the signature of m 6 . If the verification is successful, the CSP finds the ciphertexts that correspond to H(w i s i ) with attribute H(w j s j |) and sends the result R back to A via m 7 = t 7 , R, \u03c3 CSP (H(t 6 R)) . At the same time CSP retrieves the unique index for each ciphertext c i \u2208 R, and stores them in a list L index before outsourcing them to MA via m 8 = t 8 , L index , f, \u03c3 CSP (H(t 7 L index f )) . Upon reception of m 8 (and if the verifications are successful), MA can construct the functional key sk f as a linear combination of all the keys k i such that H(k i ) \u2208 L index . Apart from that, MA samples an error e \u2248 Lap(1/\u01eb) and computes a noisy key sk \u2032",
