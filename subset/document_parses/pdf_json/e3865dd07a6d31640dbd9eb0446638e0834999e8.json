            "text": "The rapid detection of viruses is becoming increasingly important to prevent widespread infections. However, virus detection via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is time-consuming, as it involves independent nucleic acid extraction and complementary DNA synthesis. This process limits the potential for rapid diagnosis and mass analysis, which are necessary to curtail viral spread. In this study, a simple and rapid thermolysis method was developed to circumvent the need for extraction and purification of viral RNA. The developed protocol was applied to one-chip digital PCR (OCdPCR), which allowed thermolysis, RT, and digital PCR in a single unit comprising 20,000 chambers of sub-nanoliter volume. Two viruses such as tobacco mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus were tested as model viral particles. First, the temperature, exposure time, and template concentration were optimized against tobacco mosaic viral particles, and the most efficient conditions were identified as 85\u00b0C, 5 min, and 0.01 \u03bcg/nL with a cycle threshold of approximately 33. Finally, the OCdPCR analysis yielded 1,130.2 copies/\u00b5L using 10 \u22122 \u03bcg/nL of viral particles in a 30 min thermolysis-RT reaction at 70\u00b0C. This novel protocol shows promise as a quick, accurate, and precise method for large-scale viral analysis in the future.",

At several points during the pandemic, the number of infected individuals has rapidly increased due to small-scale infections and mutated viruses.

            "text": "Along with the development of vaccines and treatments against virus, the diagnosis of viral infections using high-speed and accurate ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection assays is paramount, as various studies have reported (Brown et al., 2021; Garg and Garg, 2021; Howe et al., 2021; Ibrahimi et al., 2021; Luethy and Johnson, 2021; Van Rijn and Boonstra, 2021; Yuan et al., 2021) . For example, an integrated microfluidic system with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been developed for the rapid detection of influenza A viruses (Shen et al., 2019) . In addition, several assays and sensors for detection of pathogens such as virus have been developed, including quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) using loop-mediated isothermal amplification, magnetic beadbased RNA extraction for rapid large-scale testing, and electrode-based electrochemical immunosensing (Klein et al., 2020; Nagura-Ikeda et al., 2020; Fabiani et al., 2021; Taki et al., 2021) . A fundamental limitation of the current diagnostic analysis methods of viral pathogens, however, is the reliance on two consecutive enzyme reactions: reverse transcription (RT), followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This requires labor-intensive laboratory-based protocols to isolate viral RNAs and amplify deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). At the laboratory level, it is difficult to achieve desirable accuracy and precision in viral RNA detection and diagnosis due to time and resource limitations. However, in a pandemic situation, allocation of necessary resources is prioritized, allowing for large-scale development of diagnostic methods.",

            "text": "Although RT-PCR is an accurate method for detecting viruses, certain disadvantages do exist (Van Rijn and Boonstra, 2021) . The essential steps of isolating RNA from a viral sample and synthesizing complementary DNA (cDNA) through an RT reaction, then amplifying this cDNA using PCR, are routinely conducted manually (Garg and Garg, 2021; Voon et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021) . In general, a total reaction time of at least 4 h is required to isolate viral RNA from biological samples, synthesize cDNA, and perform PCR according to the manufacturer protocols (Arevalo-Rodriguez et al., 2020; Ibrahimi et al., 2021) . Moreover, conventional RT-qPCR analyses rely on 96-or 384-well plates, limiting high-throughput sample analysis in the case of mass infection. This can cause a shortage of commercial kits make and virus detection and diagnosis difficult. Additionally, the RT and PCR reactions differ in terms of optimum reaction conditions and constituents, such as solution pH, temperature, and concentration, and the buffer used. Although nucleic acid extraction and isolation kits are commercially available, they are expensive and time-consuming. For example, commercial viral RNA isolation kits require a lysis step involving chemical treatment, followed by a concentration step using an elution buffer (Li et al., 2015) . This protocol limits large-scale sample analysis and rapid diagnosis (Tang et al., 2013; Abdallah et al., 2020; Ulloa et al., 2020) . Additionally, the lysis buffers provided in commercial kits contain reagents such as RNase inhibitors for membrane lysis and RNA stabilization (Tosh et al., 1997; Li et al., 2015; Zucha et al., 2020) . As RNA is relatively unstable during heating and hydrolysis, certain conditions can result in sample degradation by RNase, reducing the concentration of the RNA template and producing low amplification results (Campos et al., 2021; Rattanachaisit et al., 2021; Schoenmaker et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "Due to the rapid spread of viral pathogens, precise, large-scale detection with few false positives and a high true negative rate is an important factor in diagnostic performance. Moreover, determining the precise concentration of viral RNA is the most critical factor in diagnosis, and depends on the absolute number of RNA copies in the initial analytical volume. This is challenging and limits the application of conventional RT-qPCR analysis. Therefore, a sensitive PCR technique that can analyze viral RNA with precise and repeatable outputs is required (De Boer et al., 2011) . Recent digital PCR (dPCR) technology enables the precise analysis of nucleic acids, and are capable of absolute quantification of viral load regardless of the availability of reference RNA (Basu, 2017; Cristiano et al., 2021; Karon et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2021; Rattanachaisit et al., 2021; Yi Han Tan et al., 2021) . dPCR can provide not only unparalleled precision by splitting the sample into tens of thousands of partitions and analyzing these each using microfluidic technology, but also lowlevel viral RNA detection even in the presence of inhibitors, by offering nanoscale reaction environments suitable for one-step thermolysis RT-qPCR. dPCR works by splitting a DNA or cDNA sample into several separate, parallel PCR reactions. After PCR analysis, the negative fraction can be used to generate an absolute number of target molecules in a sample, without standards or endogenous controls. Of course, the price of digital PCR equipment and consumable chips should be considered, but basically, RNA isolation and purification steps can be omitted, enabling analysis in a shorter time when RT and PCR reactions are performed in one pot. There is no need to rely on reference materials or standards, and it has the advantages of high resistance to inhibitors and excellent analysis ability for complex mixtures (Basu, 2017; Yi Han Tan et al., 2021) .",

This study presents a protocol to obtain viral RNA using simple thermolysis, in which viral RNA was directly utilized as an RT reaction template. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) were used as model virus particles (Knight, 1955; Du et al., 2013) . Furthermore, a one-step direct RT-qPCR method was developed to detect viruses within a single PCR tube without the need for separate chemical treatment or purification. This protocol was applied to a one-chip digital PCR, which showed high accuracy and precision. As biological risks such as COVID-19 and other pathogens continue to be reported, it is necessary to prepare rapid identification protocols.

Interestingly, the average C T values at different thermolysis temperatures and times were lowest at a viral concentration of 0.01 \u03bcg/nL. The C T value increased with viral particle concentration. For example, C T value reached a peak of 39 at 0.1 \u03bcg/nL with 5 min thermolysis, and reached 37 with 10 min thermolysis. This might be due to the increase in impurities generated from the host during lysis, including tissues, DNA, and viral debris, because the dried viral sample was directly used for thermolysis. These impurities may have acted as inhibitors in the RT-qPCR reaction, thereby resulting in increased C T values. In addition, concentration and temperature had a complex effect on the C T values, as described previously.

The initial step of 5 min exposure time for thermolysis at 85\u00b0C included additional time, required to lower the temperature to the optimum RT temperature of 50\u00b0C, and needed to maintain this temperature for 30 min or more.

The protocol developed by optimizing RT-qPCR analysis was verified and applied to dPCR analysis. Not only did the dPCR technique provide a much higher precision and accuracy in quantifying nucleic acids than that of the qPCR, but it also allowed for suitable reaction conditions in a one-chip assay. Considering the physical shape of the dPCR chip, one of the benefits of this system is the increase in concentration and purification effect by partitioning (Basu, 2017) . In addition, silicon-based dPCR has a much higher heat transfer and thermal controllability in sub-nanoliter-sized chambers, resulting in faster thermal changes during PCR cycles. Because the PCR reaction depends on thermal changes during the amplification cycle, most of the operational time relies on thermal ramping steps rather than each reaction, so efficient thermal changes speed up the process. For the conventional PCR reaction, components such as dNTPs, polymerase, oligomers, and other reagents were mixed in a 10-20 \u03bcL reaction volume. However, this could be dispersed into less than 1 nL of reaction volume under dPCR conditions, providing much less possibility of interference by reaction elements. This effective concentration and purification by partitioning was optimal in continuous RT and PCR reactions in a single dPCR chamber because fewer interfering and inhibiting elements in different reaction systems could be effectively partitioned in a single dPCR chamber, resulting in higher RNA and cDNA yields and amplification.",

            "text": "Also, the precision in dPCR was well known to be limited by the Poisson statistics of which the total number of template molecules in the analyzed sample. This means that the lower prevision could be obtained as the volume of the viral particle increases in a limited reaction volume. When applied to RT-qPCR, the size of the virus is not a big problem because there are few spatial restrictions, but when applied to digital PCR, the size of the virus is also one of the important variables. However, the chip volume can be controllable depending on the size of analyzing viral particles. The sensitivity of virus detection due to the volume effect may be affected, but since the size of the digital PCR chamber is approximately 60 \u03bcm, it is possible to sufficiently detect viruses corresponding to 20-100 nm size. This was confirmed through digital PCR analysis results for TMV corresponding to 18 nm \u00d7 300 nm, which showed analysis results at a level similar to that of CMV at 20 nm. To efficiently detect viral RNA, it is important to develop analysis protocols simultaneously. This indicates the necessity of studying reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase enzymes, which are critical factors in cDNA synthesis and amplification. In addition, most commercial enzymes and supplementary element concentrations are not suitable for the chamber size of the dPCR system, and will require optimization for efficient viral RNA detection and diagnosis. Currently, RT-qPCR probes, such as Progema company's GoTaq \u00ae Probe qPCR and RT-qPCR system or myPOLS company's Volcano3G \u00ae RT-PCR master mix, operate in a single step. In addition, commercial kits that can accurately detect viral particles with a high speed as the goal of this study are emerging due to the development of hot-start polymerase enzymes that optimize the different reaction conditions of RT and PCR such as temperature, buffer, and pH.",
