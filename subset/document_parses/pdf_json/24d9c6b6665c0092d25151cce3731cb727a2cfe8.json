During World War I, more U.S. troops died from RTI and its complications than from battle injuries, 3 and, as recently as 2009, the novel A(H1N1)pgm09 virus was responsible for 20 to 30 hospitalizations weekly within the Military Health System. 4 Even more recently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) has emerged as a highly contagious and virulent virus causing RTI with a high fatality rate. 5 The severity of disease that SARS-CoV2 causes, known as coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, has a tremendous public health burden and, along with other viruses causing RTI, carries the potential to reduce military strength, readiness, and lethality. As vaccine development is a lengthy process, and effectiveness of any vaccine will be variable, 6 it is imperative to identify immediate strategies that may mitigate risk of developing COVID-19 and other RTI, and which may reduce the duration and severity of illness following infection. Some have speculated that interventions targeting the gut microbiota may be one strategy. 7 The human gastrointestinal tract is inhabited by trillions of microorganisms collectively known as the gut microbiota. These microbes largely coexist in a mutually beneficial relationship with their human host, carrying out functions the human body cannot and producing myriad compounds that modulate health and physiology. 8 For example, the gut microbiota is integral to deterring colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by pathogenic microbes. 9 Additionally, the location of the microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract places the community in close proximity to the largest collection of immune cells in the body, the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). A primary function of the GALT is to monitor and manage the gut microbiota and other antigens. As a result, the gut microbiota and human immune system constantly interact, with the immune system influencing the gut microbiota, and the gut microbiota influencing immune function. 10 One implication of the dynamic bidirectional relationship between gut microbes and the immune system is that changes in the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota can alter immune function, potentially altering host susceptibility to infection. 11 The modulation of susceptibility is not limited to gastrointestinal pathogens because the GALT interconnects with multiple arms of the innate and adaptive immune systems which are responsible for immune responses throughout the body, including within the pulmonary system. 10 Composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota is influenced by many factors. For example, militaryrelevant stressors may alter the gut microbiota in ways that could be beneficial to health and immune function in some cases, but detrimental in others. 12 Notably, initial military training and military deployment are sources of physical and psychological stress, and associated with high rates of RTI. 3 However, more so than stress, diet is a predominant mediator of gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity. 13 As a result, dietary interventions that target and modulate the gut microbiota may provide strategies for enhancing immune function before, during, and after stress.",

In contrast, the latter approach relies on prebiotics, defined as \"substrates (e.g., nutrients) that are selectively utilized by host microorganisms (e.g., gut microbes) conferring a health benefit.\" 16 Although there are few established prebiotics at present, several oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and other compounds are considered \"candidate prebiotics\" 16 because their utilization by gut microbes is thought to result in a health benefit. Synbiotics are combinations of probiotics and prebiotics. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics modulate multiple aspects of local and systemic immune function in a variety of experimental models. 17, 18 However, those effects and their mechanisms of action are not shared across all products (i.e., bacterial strains, or prebiotic type) or observed in every population studied, and effects on in vitro, ex vivo, or other measures of immune function do not necessarily translate to effects on infection and illness in vivo. As such, evidence synthesis and recommendations for use require attention to the form of the intervention itself, desired outcomes, and target population.",

The focus on healthy non-elderly adults is justified in that immune function and susceptibility to RTI is known to vary with age and health status. 19 The focus on immune responses to vaccination is justified by the substantial interindividual variability in immune responses to vaccination which impacts vaccine effectiveness, 20 evidence that the gut microbiota and gut microbiota-targeted interventions may influence that variability, 19 and the recognition that vaccine challenge models are a gold-standard method for measuring immune function. 21 Further, once a SARS-CoV2 vaccine is available, its use in military populations will be widespread and maximizing its effectiveness will be critical. Although it is unlikely that a single dietary intervention will prevent or eliminate COVID-19 or other viral diseases entirely, such interventions may provide safe, low-cost (relative to pharmaceuticals), and easily accessible strategies for reducing risk of infection and illness severity.

Since then, additional relevant studies on probiotic supplementation and RTI-related outcomes have been published (Tables II and S2 ). Evidence from some of those studies and others conducted up to 2014, which included \u223c4,000 participants, have been collated in 2 separate meta-analyses (Table II) . 23, 24 Those meta-analyses reported that probiotics reduced the number of individuals experiencing a RTI episode by 47% 23 and reduced the mean duration of RTI episodes by approximately 1 to 2 days. 23, 24 However, both meta-analyses relied heavily on studies conducted in children, and both excluded studies conducted in athletes (a population relevant to military personnel). Comprehensive narrative and systematic reviews focused exclusively on probiotic use in athletes have concluded that \u223c65% of studies show favorable effects of probiotics on some aspect of immune function in athletes to include reducing the incidence, duration, and/or severity of RTI. [25] [26] [27] In one of those reviews, a position stand on probiotic use in athletes, the authors concluded that \"specific probiotic strains can reduce the number of episodes, severity and duration of upper RTI\" in athletic populations. 26 For the purposes of the present report, we consolidated relevant studies captured in the meta-analyses and systematic reviews cited earlier with relevant recently published trials (Table S2) . Of the 26 studies included, 38% (10 of 26), 45% (10 of 22), and 37% (7 of 19) reported that probiotics reduced the incidence, duration, or severity of RTI, respectively. While only 2 studies demonstrated favorable effects across all three outcomes (one of which reported favorable effects in men but detrimental effects in women), 62% (16 of 26) reported a favorable effect of probiotics on at least one of those outcomes. Single-strain relative to multi-strain supplements slightly more often reported at least one favorable effect (65% vs. 56% of trials), and interventions using single-strains of Lactobacillus more often reported at least one favorable effect (9 of 13 trials) when compared to interventions using single strains of Bifidobacterium (2 of 4 trials). Relatively few probiotic strains or multi-strain combinations were investigated in more than one study, and results were not always consistent in studies that did use the same strain/strain-combinations. These differential findings may be partly attributable to strainspecific effects and to other aspects of the study designs such as the duration and dose of supplementation, the populations studied, and uncontrolled lifestyle factors such as diet, sleep, smoking habits, and stress level. For example, Lactobacillus fermentum VRI-003 (PCC) reduced RTI duration and severity in men in two separate studies but increased RTI incidence, duration, and severity in women in one of the studies. 28, 29 The one strain for which favorable effects were observed in multiple studies was Lactobacillus casei Shirota. That strain, when administered in a fermented milk product, reduced the incidence of RTI in three of four studies. [30] [31] [32] [33] In the single study in which RTI incidence was not reduced, the overall incidence was unexpectedly low and antibody titers to cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus were reduced by L. casei Shirota suggesting an immune benefit from the probiotic intervention. 31",

            "text": "The response to vaccination is mediated by innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immunity, and can be assessed using a variety of measures including antibody titers, seroconversion rates, seroprotection rates, and/or vaccine-specific immunoglobulin concentrations (see Table II legend for definition of seroconversion and seroprotection). 19 Several studies have examined whether probiotics improve immune responses to vaccinations against viruses that cause RTI, most often examining vaccine responses against seasonal influenza strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B-strain) (Table S3) . Results from many of those studies have been collated in two recent meta-analyses 34,35 and a systematic review. 36 In one metaanalysis, 34 probiotics were found to increase the odds of achieving seroprotection following H3N2, but not H1N1 or B-strain vaccination, and increase the odds of seroconversion following H3N2 and B-strain, but not H1N1 vaccination (Table II) . A separate meta-analysis reported that probiotics increased antibody titers following H1N1 and H3N2, but not B-strain, vaccination (Table II) . 35 However, both meta-analyses included elderly and hospitalized patients, and excluded the largest relevant trial. That trial of 1,099 healthy young and middle-age adults found no effect of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei 431 (L. casei 431) supplementation on any measure of vaccine responsiveness or the incidence of postvaccination RTI. 37 However, the duration of postvaccination RTIs were reduced by \u223c1 day, 37 and the same probiotic strain improved antibody responses to vaccination in a smaller trial. 38 Further, all other studies conducted in healthy non-elderly adult populations have reported favorable effects of probiotics on at least one outcome related to immune responses to influenza vaccinations, though favorable effects are rarely seen against all influenza strains tested (Table  S3) . Two additional studies of healthy young and middleage adults have also reported that various probiotics increased concentrations of vaccine-specific antibody responses following vaccination against polio 39 and hepatitis A 40 viruses. Collectively, these observations are consistent with recent reviews examining the entire evidence base (neonates through elderly adults and all types of vaccines) which have concluded that probiotic interventions can likely improve vaccine efficacy and that future research should focus on defining optimal strains/strain-combinations and dosing regimens. 36, 41 Probiotics Summary The evidence reviewed above collectively demonstrates that probiotics show promise for reducing the incidence, duration, and/or severity of RTI and improving immune responses to vaccinations against RTI-causing viruses in healthy nonelderly adults. However, benefits have not been observed with all strain/strain-combinations tested which is consistent with the concept that immunomodulatory effects of probiotics are likely strain-specific. 15 Results from vaccination trials similarly suggest that not all probiotics are effective against all viral strains. Therefore, not all probiotics available in the marketplace should be expected to protect against RTI or improve vaccine responsiveness. That conclusion is consistent with the findings of recent meta-analyses suggesting that probiotics overall appear to modestly reduce RTI incidence, duration, and/or severity in infants and children, but that evidence is stronger for certain strains, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, than others. [42] [43] [44] Meta-analyses focused on studies conducted solely in healthy non-elderly adults are notably absent from the evidence base. Therefore, despite promise, the magnitude of benefit for military populations is uncertain and the most effective strains/strain combinations and dosing regimens are unclear. Nonetheless, the modest benefits reported in metaanalyses of studies conducted to date do have the potential to substantially reduce military health care burden and costs. In support, a recent mathematical modelling analysis based on 2 of the meta-analyses reviewed herein 23, 24 estimated that if the entire U.S. population were to take probiotics, the total number of sick days due to RTI would be reduced 10% to 25% annually at an estimated cost savings of up to $1.4 billion when productivity loss is included. 45 Effect estimates included a 50% to 60% reduction in RTI-related sick days in unvaccinated individuals (e.g., SARS-CoV2) and those sharing indoor environments (e.g., military barracks). 45 While confirming such an analysis is impossible, and limitations included assuming that all probiotic formulations are equally effective and not accounting for costs of the probiotics themselves, the analysis does make the point that probiotics may provide a cost-efficient option for reducing RTI burden, particularly in high-risk groups. Also worth noting in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are results from recent meta-analyses which concluded that probiotics reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilation 46 and reduce the duration of diarrhea and hospitalization because of viral gastroenteritis. 47 Consumption of probiotics that have shown benefit for reducing RTI incidence, duration, and/or severity, or improving vaccine responses in at least one well-conducted human trial, such as L. casei Shirota, should therefore not be discouraged in healthy adults if the product is obtained from a reputable source. Recent reviews provide excellent guidance on considerations for identifying reputable probiotic supplements. 48 However, large, well-designed studies 49 conducted in military populations at high risk for RTI are ultimately needed to enable more definitive recommendations regarding the most effective probiotic strain, strain combinations, and dosing regimens for improving RTI-related outcomes in military personnel.",

In that study, dose-response effects of galacto-oligosaccharides on RTI symptoms were not observed and effects varied by stress level and body weight status. 51 The paucity of studies examining effects of established prebiotics on RTI incidence, duration, and severity in healthy non-elderly adults is somewhat surprising as biological plausibility for immunomodulation has been demonstrated in animal studies, and favorable effects have been observed in some studies of infants, children and, to a lesser extent, elderly and critically-ill adults (reviewed in Refs. 17, 52, and 53). Of note, evidence suggests that certain nondigestible fermentable carbohydrates and plant-derived phenolic compounds that modulate the gut microbiota in a nonselective manner, or are metabolized and biotransformed by the gut microbiota, may have some efficacy for reducing RTI incidence, duration, and/or severity. 54, 55 For example, a 2016 meta-analysis of 6 studies which included 531 volunteers found that plant phenolics known as flavonoids reduced the incidence of RTI in healthy non-elderly adults by 33%. 54 This evidence is consistent with the concept that immunomodulatory properties of prebiotics and related compounds are attributable to both metabolites produced from those compounds by gut microbes in addition to those compounds promoting the growth of beneficial microbes, and suggests that many combinations of dietary components could impact RTI-related outcomes through effects on the gut microbiota.",

            "text": "Currently, no singular diet or dietary intervention can prevent or cure RTI and associated sequelae caused by any virus including SARS-CoV2. However, reducing risk and illness severity would reduce health care burden, and, within the military, increase force readiness. Notably, the magnitude of reduction in RTI incidence and duration attributed to probiotics in different meta-analyses is similar to, if not better than, the effects achieved through dietary supplementation with vitamins C and D, zinc, and Echinacea which are commonly used remedies for RTI. [63] [64] [65] [66] Further, although not reviewed herein, some gut microbiota-targeted interventions, primarily probiotics, have demonstrated potential for reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of gastrointestinal tract infections. 47, 67, 68 Like respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections represent a significant burden on the military health care system and force readiness. 69 Thus, accumulating evidence from meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials support the conclusion that dietary supplementation with gut microbiota-targeted interventions, and certain probiotic strains in particular, can provide a promising safe and accessible strategy for reducing the burden that multiple infectious diseases pose for military health care and force readiness. Although reductions at the individual level appear to be modest, when extrapolated to the entire military population, reductions in health care burden and costs could be significant. To fully understand that promise, and the associated magnitude of any risk reduction and cost-benefits for military personnel, research in military populations, particularly those at high risk for RTI, is needed. Until then, the probiotics and prebiotics investigated in studies reviewed herein which have demonstrated beneficial effects in one or more studies (see Supplemental Tables) can be considered viable options for military personnel interested in reducing RTI-related illness.",
