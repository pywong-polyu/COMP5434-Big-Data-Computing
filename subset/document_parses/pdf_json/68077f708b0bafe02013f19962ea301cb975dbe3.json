There was no significant difference in neurotrauma phenotype incurred relative to total cases. Injury mechanism was less likely to be motor vehicle collision and more likely caused by falls, gunshot wound, and recreational vehicle accidents (P < 0.05). Location of injury was less likely on roads and public locations and more likely at indoor private locations (P < 0.05). The proportion of patients with neurotrauma with blood alcohol concentration >0.08 g/dL was reduced in 2020 (11.4% vs. 9.0%; P < 0.05). Mortality was higher during 2020 compared with pre-COVID years (7.7% vs. 6.4%; P < 0.05).",

INTRODUCTION T he coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic incited a global public health response through government, commercial, and behavior protocols aimed at reducing spread. Within the United States and on a state-by-state basis, public health mandates were issued. Pennsylvania was an early adaptor of stayat-home mandates and closing of nonessential businesses, issuing the mandate on March 12, 2020. During the week of March 10e16, nationwide perceptions of health risk dramatically increased. 1 Several investigators have highlighted the impact of the pandemic on hospital bed availability, preparation, and resource use during the peak of the disease. 2 The pandemic, statewide shutdowns, and the social distancing concept affected trauma volumes and mechanism of injury. 3, 4 The effect has been seen among many surgical subspecialties, including orthopedic and plastic surgery. 5 In Europe, the pandemic affected the total number of patients presenting with neurosurgical emergencies, including aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and spinal cord injury, whereas relative volumes were similar. 6 More patients presented via the emergency room rather than outpatient clinics and patients with spinal emergencies presented an average of 48 hours later despite comparable symptoms to previous years studied. 6 Mechanism of injury has been investigated among other surgical fields, in which increased assault-related injuries, including domestic abuse, as well as decreased motor vehicle collisions, were found. 5, 7 These findings have been seen both in adult and in pediatric realms. 8, 9 The COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders dramatically affected the public health landscape, with potential implications for our populations with trauma, mechanism/place of injury occurrence, and the ability to effectively respond to these emergencies. The goal of the current study was to evaluate neurotrauma presentations within Pennsylvania state as well as analyze our subset within Allegheny county.",

Patient consent was not required or sought given that data were both de-identified and obtained from a registry. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures were formally implemented on March 12, with urging of nonessential businesses to close. Approximately 3 months of social distancing ensued until June 5, when Allegheny county and the remaining large counties within Pennsylvania entered the green phase of planned reopening, thus allowing most businesses to reopen, following strict health guidelines. Thus, traumatic injuries incurred between March 12 and June 5, 2020 were analyzed and compared with the same period in 2017e2019. Trauma cases were grouped and reviewed among all trauma centers participating in Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study within Pennsylvania state. A subgroup analysis among the only 3 level I trauma centers within Allegheny county was completed as well.",

Compared with the average number of presentations between 2017 and 2019, there was a 27% reduction in the number of neurotrauma presentations in 2020. There was a decreased neurotrauma incidence rate in 2020 compared with previous years (2017 IRR, 1.32, P < 0.0001; 2018 IRR, 1.33, P < 0.0001; 2019 IRR, 1.43, P < 0.0001). Allegheny county made up a large proportion of these data because there were 721 neurotrauma presentations in 2020, with a 26.5% reduction compared with 2017e2019 (P < 0.0001) ( Figure 1 ). Table 1 compares the demographics and characteristics of neurotrauma alerts between the pre-COVID and COVID periods. There was no difference in the race or sex of patients experiencing a neurotrauma among the 4 years. There was no difference in median age (P \u00bc 0.072); however, there was a change in neurotrauma incidence based on age-group subsets (P < 0.001) ( Table 1 ). The trauma alert system is used to triage based on severity of injury and varies by institution. Generally, level 1 trauma alerts are anticipated as the most severe and level 3 as least severe. There was no change in level 1 trauma likelihood but there was a decrease in level 2 trauma (P \u00bc 0.008) and increase in level 3 likelihood during the 2020 index period (P \u00bc 0.005).",

Compared with previous years, COVID neurotraumas were less likely to be caused by motor vehicle accidents (P < 0.001) and more likely to be caused from falls (P \u00bc 0.027) or recreational vehicle accidents, which includes bicycles and all-terrain vehicles (P < 0.001). There was an increase in the number of gunshot wound (GSW) assaults in 2020 (P \u00bc 0.006); however, the number of self-inflicted GSWs was unchanged.

One study 10 evaluated traumas at a level 1 center in New Orleans, Louisiana and found a 70% reduction in traumatic injuries at their center, whereas the present study found a 27% reduction within both Pennsylvania and Allegheny county. Similarly, that cohort identified a reduction in road-related trauma during the index period as well as increased gunshot-related trauma. 10,11 A level 1 trauma center in Virginia identified a reduction of trauma volume by 43%, with a likewise increase in traumas caused by chronic alcohol use. 12 At level 2 trauma centers, orthopedic-related trauma volume decreased by approximately 45%. 13 Internationally, a study from New Zealand identified a similar reduction of 43% during their nation's lockdown. 14 From South Carolina, 1 study 15 identified an increase in the prevalence of domestic violenceerelated trauma at a rural trauma center. The 27% reduction in neurotrauma presentations in Pennsylvania was less than in other locations studied, highlighting the regional variability. The larger number of quaternary, referral-receiving centers is a possible explanation for this effect. 16 However, the time frame of shutdown, strictness of mandates, and the socioeconomic climate of the region are all variables that have a bearing on these estimates. The present study does contain data on a subset of pediatric patients and several of these findings apply to both pediatric and adult patients. 8, 9 The alcohol abuse use was anticipated to be affected in 1 disparate ways by the pandemic. One theory hypothesizes increased use of alcohol because of distress caused by the pandemic. Another postulates decreased intake because of financial and availability restrictions for many citizens. 17 In the present study, there were fewer alcohol-related neurotraumas across the state; however, this finding was not evident within Allegheny county, where alcohol was a factor in 11.6% of neurotraumas. Among those patients who presented intoxicated, the median BAC was higher during the index period of 2020 in Allegheny county. Multiple factors play a role in determining alcohol use during the pandemic, including age and psychological history. Lechner et al. 18 found alcohol use on a college campus to increase after campus closure because of the pandemic; increased use was associated with those students with fewer social supports. ",

In addition, registries require assumptions to be made when interpreting data. For instance, assessing patient Glasgow Coma Scale score highlights these limitations because the Glasgow Coma Scale score reported in the field before presentation and initially on hospital arrival is often incorrect and varies based on the familiarity of personnel with the scale. 22 Likewise, the scale is often erroneously scored in patients who remain paralyzed or sedated from the field, and thus, the registry data probably overestimate severe TBIs. Another limitation is diagnostic data and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision coding. TBI is indicated by the S06.0 code and has multiple subsets based on intracranial bleed pattern. However, this code also includes concussion. In this vein, mild TBI and mild neurotrauma may be overestimated as well. Despite limitations, there are several strengths, particularly analysis of large quaternary metropolitan care centers as opposed to referral centers. Other studies evaluating similar trends often compare with single previous years as opposed to the present study, which evaluates similar time periods from 2017 to 2019.",

Quantifying the reduction in trauma volume helps identify adequate resource availability, including hospital and intensive care unit beds, ventilators, and staff, which have been a limited resource during the pandemic. Multiple neurosurgeons have commented on the reduction in these resources and methods to manage these scarcities. [23] [24] [25] In addition, although the neurotrauma phenotype was unchanged, mortality increased. One possibility may be that the pandemic led to delayed presentations and thus increased morbidity on presentation. Another possibility is that limited resources, hospital staff, and longer times to interventions in the setting of mandated coronavirus precautions may have contributed to an increase in mortality. The societal response to shutdown is reflected in the shifts in mechanism and location of neurotrauma and is useful in understanding the response to future similar events. Inversely, the same information can be used to predict the expected trend when shutdown orders are lifted and we move into later phases of the pandemic. For instance, and anecdotally, several surgeons have commented on the larger than anticipated increase in gun violence and neurotrauma when shutdown orders were lifted. Gun violence increased across the state even during the pandemic and may even be expected to further increase after. Also, based on the recent literature, neurotrauma volumes within Pennsylvania were not affected as largely as was seen in other locations. If similar shutdown measures are reimplemented, the current findings may provide guidance for preparedness, the injury types requiring further vigilance, and management of hospital resources and availability. Characterizing the initial response to the statewide shutdown is only the first step in understanding the entirety of the effect of the pandemic on trauma as well as the complex interplay between societal mandates and individual response.",
