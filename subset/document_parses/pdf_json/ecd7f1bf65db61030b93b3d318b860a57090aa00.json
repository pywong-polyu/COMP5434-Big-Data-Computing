Data on work-related COVID-19 in the study of Marinaccio and colleagues was based on compensation claims of workers. In the Netherlands, an expert-based onepage guidance document for assessment and reporting of COVID-19 as occupational disease was developed by occupational physicians and data specialists. This guidance document, based on the general 6-step approach, 2 was published on the website of the Netherlands Center for Occupational Diseases 3 and communicated by newsletters. Occupational COVID-19 reports, International Classification of Diseases-10 code U.071, contain information about age, sex, occupation, economic sector, work disability and potential cause for occupational COVID-19. In the period March-September 2020, 904 cases were reported.",

Work disability was reported in most of the cases and in 21% of the workers this lasted for more than 3 months. Among workers from nurse and caring homes, contact with infected patients and colleagues was reported in 94% of the cases. In 516 of the 670 cases (77%), unprotected contact with a patient with COVID-19 was reported, which could be caused by a lack of sufficient personal protective equipment. In 27 of the 670 cases (4%), nurses and caregivers were infected while using personal protective equipment.",
