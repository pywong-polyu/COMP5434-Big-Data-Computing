Since a level III alert (moderate level) was announced on January 5, 2020 in Macau, the Macau government took active, rapid measures to contain the outbreak including suspensions of group tour visas for mainland Chinese visitors to Macao SAR on January 22, 2020, suspensions of licensed casinos and other entertainment venue operations for 15 days from February 5, 2020, and bans of all non-resident workers (except from Mainland China, the region of Taiwan, and Hong Kong SAR) from entering Macao SAR on March 19, 2020 (Loi et al., 2021) . These control measures have had negative economic effects on about three quarters of the territory's population who were directly or indirectly employed in casinos and other entertainment venue operations, as well as government tax revenues (Elizabeth et al., 2021) .",

From this perspective, many Macau residents may experience serious mental health problems at this particular time. Additionally, a large-scale nationwide study conducted in the general population of China (n = 56,679) reported the prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms was 27.9%, 31.6%, and 29.2%, respectively . And, compared with individuals not in quarantine, those undergoing quarantine had an increased risk for poor psychological outcomes (Chen et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) . Moreover, in the general population of other countries, the impact of poor psychological health on quality of life due to COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown has been documented (Epifanio et al., 2021; Ferreira et al., 2021; K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7el et al., 2021) . However, to date, the absence of studies on the mental health status of Macau residents and its links with quality of life provided us with the impetus to study this issue in this population under pandemic conditions.",

            "text": "During the past few years, network analysis (NA) has been used widely in many fields to understand the interconnectedness of multicomponent systems (Montazeri et al., 2020) . NA has been found to be particularly advantageous in psychiatry due to insights it has provided in relation to interactions of symptoms of psychopathology and mental health (Beard et al., 2016) . Two important elements -\"Nodes\" and \"Edges\" constitute the network graph, which is the core concept in NA (Epskamp et al., 2012) . Each node stands for one symptom and each edge represents the partial correlation coefficient between two nodes, after controlling for the effects of other nodes in the model (Epskamp et al., 2012) . The goal of this approach is to identify a central node that is highly connected to other nodes and is emphasized due to its potential clinical implications for risk of developing particular syndromes and targeted interventions. This novel approach also has possible utility in understanding psychiatric comorbidities (Cramer et al., 2010b) wherein particular symptoms of one disorder are related to a higher risk of experiencing other disorders. Symptoms that increase the risk of contagion from one disorder to other disorders are called \"bridge symptoms\" and can be identified in NA (Cramer et al., 2010b) . As such, clinicians can target bridge symptoms to treat or prevent comorbidity (Jones et al., 2021) .",

For example, in a sample of migrant Filipino workers employed in Macau, \"Fatigue\" was the most central symptom in the whole network, followed by \"Worry too much\" and \"Depressed mood\" (Garabiles et al., 2019) . The latter two symptoms were also identified as central symptoms in a psychiatric sample from the United States (Beard et al., 2016) . Similarly, symptoms \"Fatigue\" and \"Feeling of worthlessness\" were found to be the most influential in the anxiety and depressive symptom (anxietydepression symptom hereafter) network of nursing students in China (Ren et al., 2021) . Another network analysis conducted during and after the peak of the pandemic also found that \"Fatigue\", as a bridge symptom, played an important role in the anxiety and depression model after the peak of the pandemic . Given that fatigue has emerged as a key symptom in various NA studies of anxiety and depression, there may be utility in considering co-morbid syndromes that contribute to fatigue within network models. To this end, insomnia symptoms (insomnia hereafter) characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality that often results in fatigue (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), may be a useful focus in network models of anxiety and depression.",

Nodes having higher expected influence in the network mode were considered to be more important. Bridge expected influence was calculated to identify bridge symptoms using the bridge function via R package networktools (version 1.2.3) (Payton, 2020) . Bridges having higher expected influence values reflected a greater risk of contagion from one community to other communities compared to bridges with lower expected influence values (Jones et al., 2021) . To identify bridge symptoms, we used the 80th percentile of bridge expected influence values as a cutoff (Garabiles et al., 2019) . To identify particular symptoms that were directly associated with QoL, the \"flow\" function in R package qgraph was used (Epskamp et al., 2012) . Moreover, R package mgm (version 1.2-12) was used to compute the predictability of each node, an index that reflects controllability of the network model (Haslbeck and Waldorp, 2020) . Predictability values represented interconnectedness or the extent to which a node was associated with its neighboring nodes and was expressed as the area in the rings around each node in the layout of the network.",

            "text": "This was the first study to document the network structure of insomnia, depression and anxiety symptoms among Macau residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this network, we found that the strongest edges were all within particular mental disorder communities rather than between different disorders, consistent with the findings of previous network research (Beard et al., 2016; Garabiles et al., 2019; Groen et al., 2020) . The strongest edge in the whole network was between insomnia symptoms ISI1 \"Severity of sleep onset\" and ISI2 \"Sleep maintenance\". This diverges from results of a related population study from the Netherlands exploring relations between insomnia symptoms and personality traits wherein the edge ISI2-ISI3 (Sleep maintenance -Early morning wakening problems) was strongest (Dekker et al., 2017) . This discrepancy may be due, in part, to differences in the focus of these surveys. Specifically, our research was conducted in the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic which has contributed to more widespread difficulties falling asleep and maintaining sleep due infection fears (Ahorsu ISI: Insomnia Severity Index; PHQ-9: the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7: 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale; SD, standard deviation. a The values of expected influence were raw data generated from the network. et al., 2020) and anxiety emanating from worries about personal economic losses (Huang et al., 2020) . Consequently, risks and consequences of COVID-19 may have contributed to the comparatively strong relationship between ISI1 \"Severity of sleep onset\" and ISI2 \"Sleep maintenance\" relative to other symptoms in the network. The second strongest edge to emerge in our sample was between PHQ1 \"Anhedonia\" and PHQ2 \"Sad Mood\", a novel link that has not been documented previously. Once again, this association may be unique to this specific sample in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, though consequent pandemic-based studies are needed to verify or refute this hypothesis. Other strong edges in present network were often between insomnia symptoms, indicating that sleep problems in Macau residents during the COVID-19 pandemic are prominent and should be assessed as a matter of course in local referrals for mental health services. Expected influence centrality of nodes performed well in identifying specific symptoms that contributed most strongly to the overall psychopathology symptom network in this sample. Specifically, an insomnia symptom, ISI2 \"Sleep maintenance\", had the highest centrality value, indicating that this symptom plays the most critical role in maintaining the entire symptom network. Consequently, it can be hypothesized that interventions targeting improvements in maintenaning adequate amounts and quality of sleep have the potential to relieve other symptoms in the anxiety-depression-insomnia symptom network (McElroy and Patalay, 2019). Although the particular sleep symptom differed from that of Dekker et al. (2017) who found item ISI4 \"Sleep dissatisfaction\" was the most influential symptom in their insomniapersonality network model, it is notable that specific insomnia symptoms were most critical across different network models. According to the DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), impaired sleep maintenance is a consequence of multiple or prolonged nocturnal awakenings. Previous reviews have concluded that cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective in targeting and reversing behavioral and cognitive processes that perpetuate insomnia as well as related symptoms such as worry and fatigue in adult samples (e.g., van der Zweerde et al., 2019), including older adults who often have medical comorbidities (Lovato et al., 2016; Lovato et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2019) . Certain psychosocial interventions such as CBT-I are viewed as the first line of intervention due to their low risk of adverse effects and effectiveness (van der Zweerde et al., 2019) . In addition, pharmacologic strategies including the use of sedative-hypnotic drugs are an alternative treatment for sleep disturbances that may be useful over relatively brief periods. Agents such as benzodiazepines (e.g., Estazolam, Temazepam) (Gooneratne and Vitiello, 2014; Qaseem et al., 2016; Schroeck et al., 2016) and nonbenzodiazepines (e.g., eszopiclone) (Smagula et al., 2016) are effective in improving sleep-maintenance insomnia in this context.",

Notably, this symptom was strongly connected with another bridge symptom, ISI1 \"Severity of sleep onset\", indicating that aside from sleep-maintenance insomnia, sleep-onset insomnia may be another symptom critical to maintaining the entire network and an important target for intervention. Certain medications (e.g., Triazolam, Zolpidem, Zaleplon, Ramelteon) have been found to be effective in improving sleep onset (Zheng et al., 2020) . Moreover, meta-analyses have found that psychological interventions also improve sleep onset latency and total sleep time (Cheung et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2015) . Other bridge symptoms, GAD5 \"Restlessness\", GAD6 \"Irritability\", and PHQ8 \"Motor problems\" in this network have also been identified in previous network studies (Ren et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020) .

Within the current network model, we explored which symptoms most directly associated with QoL. The insomnia symptom, \"Sleep dissatisfaction\", emerged as the most prominent correlate. The influence of insomnia on residents' QoL is consistent with the prominence of insomnia symptoms within the entire symptom network (i.e., most critical central and bridge symptoms emerged from the insomnia symptom community). Though the prevalence of insomnia (27.6%) in Macau residents was lower than rates of anxiety (28.8%) and depressive symptoms (38.5%), the essential role of insomnia symptoms on overall mental health status and QoL cannot be ignored based on NA results. Once again, analyses of bridge symptoms underscore how interventions specifically targeting insomnia symptoms within this population may have far-reaching implications for alleviating residents' overall levels of insomnia, anxiety, and depression in tandem with improving their QoL.",

Aside from its novel foci, a strength of this study was the reliability of its main results within the entire sample as well as within each gender. Strengths aside, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, due to the cross-sectional study design, causal links related to symptom changes over time could not be assessed. Second, due to restrictions related to managing the pandemic, symptoms were assessed solely on the basis of self-report measures that can be susceptible to response biases such as those related to recall and social desirability. Third, on average, participants were young adults (mean age = 29.91 years) so findings may not generalize equally well to all age groups in Macau. Finally, although the present findings provide potential insights related to psychiatric symptoms that are most prominent within a particular population during an era-defining pandemic, findings may not generalize to other populations or non-pandemic living conditions.",
