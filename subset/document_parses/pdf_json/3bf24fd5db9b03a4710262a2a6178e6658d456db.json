The study was conducted in Shiraz city, southern Iran, in May and Jun 2020. Adult flies were sampled at the outdoor areas of two hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. Fly samples were first washed twice to remove the insect surface attached to SARS-CoV-2 virions. After that, the disinfected fly samples were homogenized. Fly surface washout and homogenate samples were tested using Taq Man real-time PCR assay for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In a total of 156 houseflies, 75% of samples from the body washout samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, 37% of the homogenized specimens were positive for the SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the possible infection of the insects or uptake of the virion to the insect metabolism. The other possibility is the houseflies up took the blood or blood fluids of the patients and the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 survived in the insect body without replicating. Our preliminary findings suggest that the houseflies could transmit SARS-CoV-2 as a mechanical or biological vector especially during the warm seasons while increasing the population and activity of houseflies.",
