            "text": "Understanding stressors is an effective measure to decrease employee stress and improve employee mental health. The extant literature mainly focuses on a singular stressor among various aspects of their work or life. In addition, the extant literature generally uses questionnaires or interviews to obtain data. Data obtained in such ways are often subjective and lack authenticity. We propose a novel machine-human hybrid approach to conduct qualitative content analysis of user-generated online content to explore the stressors of young employees in contemporary society. The user-generated online contents were collected from a famous Q&A platform in China and we adopted natural language processing and deep learning technology to discover knowledge. Our results identified three kinds of new stressors, that is, affection from leaders, affection from the social circle, and the gap between dream and reality. These new identified stressors were due to the lack of social security and regulation, frequent occurrences of social media fearmongering, and subjective cognitive bias, respectively. In light of our findings, we offer valuable practical insights and policy recommendations to relieve stress and improve mental health of young employees. The primary contributions of our work are two-fold, as follows. First, we propose a novel approach to explore the stressors of young employees in contemporary society, which is applicable not only in China, but also in other countries and regions. Second, we expand the scope of job demands-resources (JD-R) theory, which is an important framework for the classification of employee stressors.",

Employees who experience performance stress understand that meeting or exceeding performance expectations can lead to promotions, raises, and other benefits, while failing to meet expectations can lead to probation, termination, and other harmful outcomes. This experienced stress to improve performance affects employee well-being and stimulating psychological reactions. Second, the work environment is another direct stressor that can cause a threat to health and well-being. For instance, empirical studies demonstrate that a longer commute time is associated with lower job satisfaction and higher turnover tendency [10] . Apart from commute time, several studies have shown that poor working conditions (e.g., workplace ostracism and bullying) are associated with negative mental health effects such as depression and anxiety [11] [12] [13] . Moreover, unfair behavior in the working environment can also cause stress for employees [14] [15] [16] . Finally, resource shortages are another direct stressor. Firms strive to achieve more with less input in order to make more profit, satisfy growing customer demand, or respond to new opportunities in the marketplace. Employees will not have access to learning or exercising initiative [17] . There is little doubt that resource shortages lead to employees putting in more hours every year, with consequences ranging from burnout and fatigue to absenteeism, declining health, and strained interpersonal relationships [18] [19] [20] .",

First, employee stress is higher when they experience higher levels of family financial stress. Researchers suggest high rates of mental health issues among low-income families and their children [28] [29] [30] [31] . Second, the considerable cost of education makes it impossible for employees to guarantee their children adequate education, which makes them feel overburdened and stressed [32] . Third, in recent years, pressing housing issues such as high housing costs, overcrowding, and job-housing imbalance have forced huge pressure on young employees, especially in developing countries such as China [33] [34] [35] .",

In addition, there is research summarizing the previous research results on the stressors for young employees, but it does not verify these stressors using the real data [36] . Furthermore, researchers all propose hypotheses on a stressor beforehand subjectively, and then validate it based on observed data. In our study, we did not make any hypotheses on the kinds of stressors beforehand, rather, we focused on discovering the stressors directly from free narrations online and summarized the discovered stressors using the job demand-resource model (JD-R model). The JD-R model is a framework that is applied in the classification of employee stressors; it analyses the development process of any stressor following the demand process or resource process. Demand process refers to the job demands that lead to constant overtaxing and, in the end, to stress and exhaustion. Resource process refers to the lack of resources complicating the meeting of job demands, which also further leads to stress and withdrawal behavior [37] . With the JD-R model framework as shown in Figure 1 , any stressor for employees can be categorized [38] .",

To improve the accuracy of subsequent machine-learning, we identified the informative sentences that can directly express stressors for employees. We treated the identification process as a classification task: the classifier will identify the informative and noninformative sentences, and label them as 1 and 0, respectively. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was chosen to train the classifier. As an important basic model in deep learning, CNN can automatically extract key features and has a short training time to avoid the tedious process of manual feature extraction [43, 44] . In addition, large-scale network implementation is much easier with CNN than with other neural networks [44] . The process of classification can be divided into three steps. In step 1, we manually labeled a small set of sentences as informative/noninformative sentences to build a set of training data. We randomly selected 1000 sentences from the answers of each question, with a total of 3000 sentences. We manually judged whether each sentence represented the stressors for young employees: if a sentence represents the stressors for young employees, it is labeled as 1; otherwise it will be labeled as 0. In step 2, we trained the text classifier. Since texts cannot be directly calculated, we mapped the raw UGC data onto sentence embeddings using Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model. With the architecture of multi-layer bidirectional transformer encoder, BERT is empirically powerful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Unlike other traditional language models such as RNN, it is an unsupervised model and does not require manual intervention [45] . The sentence embeddings are input in the CNN model to train the classifier. In step 3, the trained classifier automatically identifies informative sentences from the UGC.",

Since the sentences were written in Chinese, it was necessary to split the sentences into words. We used \"Jieba\", a Python software for Chinese text segmentation, to segment the Chinese sentences into a corpus. It is worth noting that, as mentioned earlier, we collected responses from three questions. We segmented the responses to the same question into one corpus. In this way, we constructed three corpora. In step 2, we removed the stop words. In the corpus, there were many stop words (e.g., \"but\" and \"and\") that would significantly affect the efficiency of NLP and need to be deleted. Table 1 illustrates the comparison between the raw and processed data. Table 1 . Examples of the raw and processed data.",

Third, the words were classified into the nearest cluster. Fourth, each cluster center was recalculated. The iterations of the second and fourth steps continued until there was no further change in each cluster center. We clustered the words into 30 groups for each question, with a total of 90 groups.

Long working hours and heavy tasks also make them feel tired and under great strain. On the other hand, high living expenses such as buying houses, supporting aging parents, and so on, weigh heavily on their minds. In addition, it is worth noting that besides external pressures, many young employees are also constantly under the stresses resulting from the gap between their dreams and real lives. People have an easy access to luxurious lifestyles through social media, which can produce the illusion that they are inferior and lead to people's discontentment with their current situations.",

Job resources refer to those physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that may do any of the following: (a) be functional in achieving work goals; (b) reduce job demands at the associated physiological and psychological costs; and (c) stimulate personal growth and development [37] .",

Meanwhile, all of the identified sentences related to \"family life\" express that employees have to pay a considerable sum of money to raise their families, thus they have to work flat out to earn enough income from work. Personal resources refer to the beliefs people hold regarding how much control they have over their environment [38] . The identified keywords related to \"desire for material aroused by social media\", \"insatiable desire\", \"the gap between the rich and poor\", and \"the gap between dream and reality\" only express that employees feel extremely miserable about the gap between their dreams and real lives. Additionally, our results also suggest that there are other stressors for employees that cannot be explained by JD-R theory: the sentences related to \"rough time during the work\" and \"lack of social security\" express that employees are often squeezed by their supervisor due to the lack of social guarantee of employee rights, which makes them feel exhausted.

With gradual improvement in the legal system, the abusive behavior of supervisors has gradually disappeared. However, in fact, in many enterprises, being squeezed by supervisors is still an inescapable stressor for young employees. Many supervisors are constantly putting pressure on the employees to increase labor output. This leads to excessive physical and mental output that puts tremendous pressure on employees in the environment.",

Previous research in organizations has demonstrated that the hard work of co-workers is for the affections from others, which are related to the employees' psychological stress [49] . However, importantly, we found clear evidence that employees were influenced not only by colleagues, but also by social media and loved ones. Our results indicate that social media is one of the most important ways through which employees can be affected by others. In recent years, the use of social media has become a global phenomenon. Over two-thirds of Internet users have active accounts on social networking sites [50] . This leads to the frequent occurrence of social media fearmongering, which causes individuals to indulge in frequent negative comparisons between themselves and others, resulting in many unrealistic material desires. In addition, we also found that pressure from parents such as pushing for marriage could also put psychological strain on employees.",

In this respect, we extended the research results of the JD-R model. Most of the previous research on personal resources in the JD-R model emphasize the people's perceptions of their control over their environment [38] . That is, it emphasizes the employees' subjective feelings about whether they can finish the work on schedule. However, through data analysis, we found that personal resources should also be extended to one's subjective feelings about the social environment. Due to subjective cognitive bias, employees feel that their life is worse than others, that there is a gap between dream and reality, and between material desire and reality. The frequent occurrences of social media fearmongering only aggravate these subjective cognitive biases. When these problems are not solved, they develop anxiety.",

In the future, we can utilize UGC data from various sources and conduct research together with other traditional social science methods. Second, our approach can be further improved, since it still needs human reading sentences for categorization. In the future, we can utilize automatic text classification techniques and text generation techniques for categorization and interpretation. Third, this research only discussed the stressors from the lack of resources and the increase in job demand. We encourage future research to further explore the factors in the context of the entire JD-R model and examine the direct and indirect effects on and of resources on the stressors. Finally, all of our samples were collected from China. We encourage future research to further explore the employee stressors in different countries and compare the differences. ",
