Supporting users both to deposit and to query and fetch data is our priority, and the tools and services that we continue to develop reflect this. The importance of well-structured open data has been thrown into stark relief by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ENA has adapted to meet the new challenges that come with such data rates and volumes. Simultaneously, the building momentum of many biodiversity projects leads to increasing complexity of taxonomy maintenance and sample classification (e.g. BiCiKL: https://bicikl-project.eu/; Darwin Tree of Life: https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/; Aquatic Symbiosis Genomic Project: https://www.sanger. ac.uk/collaboration/aquatic-symbiosis-genomics-project/; UniEuk: https://unieuk.org/). The European Nucleotide Archive is part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) (1), which ensures that data is captured and mirrored globally, in collaboration with international partners: the United States National Institutes of Health's National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; GenBank and Sequence Read Archive) and the Japanese National Institute of Genetics' DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ) (2, 3) . This active collaboration focuses on development of shared data standards and exchange mechanisms to provide the most rich and accurate network of data to the global community. ENA is an ELIXIR Core Data Resource and Deposition Database (4) .",

Deployed in April 2020, the tool is mainly intended for smallerscale submissions, reducing the burden on the submitter. Once a user drags and drops their file(s), a User Support Bioinformatician at the ENA is able to provide a direct point of contact for support in the event of validation errors or other issues. Additional tools are offered to support users' SARS-CoV-2 sequence workflows, such as to assist with submissions already made to GISAID (https://github.com/enasequence/ena-content-dataflow/ blob/master/scripts/GISAID to ENA.README.md) and to prepare bulk submissions (https://github.com/ enasequence/ena-bulk-webincli).",

            "text": "Following the retirement of the quarterly ENA sequence release process in March 2020, we have provided further tools to support users wishing to synchronise local data sets with ENA. First, we have launched a system to provide snapshots of the assembled/annotated sequence, coding sequence and non-coding sequence sets. These snapshots provide an index of the records in the data files, including accession, data class, taxonomic division, and last updated date as well as the complete sequences in FASTA format. These snapshots are available on our public FTP site at http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/ sequence/snapshot latest. Second, we have provided a utility that can be used to compare the full set of public sequences available from ENA against the full set that would have been available on a previous date. This allows users to track which records were added/updated since their last import and which records were deleted (or suppressed). This tool, the 'snapshot change lister', is available at https: //github.com/enasequence/enaBrowserTools. Additionally, we have launched the ENA File Downloader (https://github.com/enasequence/ena-ftpdownloader/tree/master/command-line-downloader). This standalone utility allows a user to make systematic calls to ENA's APIs to poll, retrieve and synchronise content of interest to local storage without requiring any scripting or direct interaction with the APIs. Complementing existing tools such as the ENA Browser, the Pythonbased enaBrowserTools and the GUI-based ENA FTP Downloader, this new tool adds a further method for downloading and synchronising data and metadata from ENA. Its support for both FTP and Aspera protocols provides flexible data transfer options.",

Organising metagenome assemblies into 'primary metagenome' (currently 73 060 data sets), 'binned metagenome' (22 497) and 'Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MAG)' (37 046), we see good compliance with the appropriate data standards (80% of MAG data sets comply with MIMAGS (5) or MIUVIGS (6)). We have improved the discoverability of these data; assemblies submitted to ENA can be retrieved by their 'assembly type' and further filtered using associated sample metadata. For example, when retrieving a set of all binned metagenomes with a particular threshold for completeness and contamination, this can be effected in a single API call: = analysis&query = assembly type = %22binned%20metagenome%22%20AND%20completene ss score%3E90%20AND%20contamination score%3C5. Data structures for 'primary metagenomes' and 'binned metagenomes' are not yet exchanged with INSDC, however MAGs are exchanged and available via all INSDC partners. INSDC uses the 'metagenome source' annotation to classify assemblies from a metagenomic source and this annotation can be included in searches to include INSDC partner submitted MAGs. For example, a user can fetch all WGS set MAGs submitted across INSDC with the following API query: = wgs set&query = (assembly typ e = %22Metagenome-Assembled%20Genome%20\\(MA G\\)%22%20OR%20metagenome source = %22 * %22)",
