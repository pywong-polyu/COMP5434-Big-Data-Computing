            "text": "Influenza A and B viruses express membrane proteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), resulting in human antibody responses [1] . Strains of influenza virus are classified by the core proteins (A, B, or C), the species of origin (mainly avian or swine), and the country or region of initial isolation [1] . Influenza A is classified by the subtypes of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) [1] . Worldwide, influenza A causes annual outbreaks and epidemics during the 'flu season,' or occasional pandemics [1] . Outbreaks of influenza B occur every two to four years [1] . There are 16 H virus subtypes in the natural bird reservoir and nine N virus subtypes, but only three hemagglutinin subtypes cause human respiratory infection, H1, H2, and H3 [1] . In the past century, there have been four influenza pandemics [1] . In 1918, the H1N1 pandemic virus originated from an avian strain adapted to infect humans and transmit between humans [1] . Two other pandemics were human-avian strains, H2N2 in 1957 and H3N2 in 1968 [1] . A further pandemic was caused by a quadruple re-assortment of two swine influenza strains, one human strain, and one avian strain, H1N1, in 2009 and 2010 [1] . There are concerns that avian H5N1 influenza could repeat the adaptation in 1918 and cause another influenza pandemic [1, 2] . Pigs have a role in generating pandemic influenza virus strains because their tracheal epithelial cells express receptors for both the avian and human influenza viruses [1, 3] . Pigs may promote avian and human viral genetic re-assortment to produce a novel pandemic strain of the influenza virus. [3] . New strains arising from antigenic shift often emerge from Southeast Asia, where the proximity of humans, birds, and pigs may encourage viral re-assortment [1, 3] . However, in 2009, pandemic H1N1 influenza was identified in North America, highlighting the importance of global influenza virus surveillance programs [3] .",

The WHO global influenza surveillance platform, Flu-Net, was initiated in September 2020 and included data from 139 countries, territories, and areas [6] .

This scenario cannot be confirmed and may be less likely, because the influenza viruses isolated since April 2020 have been limited [10] . Second, seasonal influenza may return, but some variants disappear, particularly if they do not have large zoonotic reservoirs [10] . The third possible scenario is that there are only intermittent outbreaks of seasonal influenza [10] . However, this scenario is unlikely because of the return of international travel and because even the best influenza vaccines have limited efficacy [10] .
