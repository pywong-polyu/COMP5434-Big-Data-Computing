In this study, we analyzed data collected from mass screenings conducted among 28 LTCFs in Fulton County, Georgia, both as a response to a confirmed case and as a preventive measure before active infections were identified. We found that more than 1 in 4 LTCF residents, and 1 in 10 LTCF staff, had SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in facilities where testing was conducted only after a case had been identified, a dramatically greater proportion of residents (47% vs 1.5%) and staff (13% vs 1.7%) were found to be infected, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection was already widespread by the time a single case was diagnosed through passive means. Encouragingly, among LTCFs screened before a case was passively diagnosed, only about 2% of residents and 2% of staff were found to be positive, and few .

CMS further recommends that if a SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified within the facility, weekly testing should be conducted of residents until all have tested negative. One concern with conducting serial RT-PCR testing of infected individuals until they test negative is the uncertainty of whether a person who tests positive is actively infected and infectious, or whether a positive test represents non-viable viral material. A recent study found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was unable to be cultured in specimens that tested positive by RT-PCR 8 days after symptom onset [11] , though individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 can continue to have detectable virus by PCR for as long as 6 weeks [12] . Another challenge to COVID-19 surveillance in some LTCFs is the fear of negative .

Census lists provided by LTCFs and case reports from hospitals and medical examiners assisted in the identification and retroactive linkage of cases in residents and staff that were not reported by LTCFs and their subsequent inclusion in this analysis. Lastly, there may be several unmeasured factors that could account for differences between the LTCF groups, such as resident to staff ratio, resident and staff adherence to IPC measures, prevalence of comorbid conditions especially among residents, facility airflow design and maintenance practices, and degree of functional impairment that may predispose to more frequent and closer resident-staff interaction.",

All 15 (100%) of the Response group facilities had a substantial proportion of both residents and staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Residents: median 46% [IQR 27% -73%] infected; Staff: median 9.4% [IQR 5.9% -20%]). Although the infection rate was significantly lowerin the Preventive Group facilities, 7 (54%) of 13 facilities still had at least one resident who was SARS-CoV-2 infected and 4 (31%) had at least one infected staff member. Of the 1,085 individuals (residents and staff) diagnosed with COVID-19, 18% (n=192) required hospitalization and 12% died (n=135). Although hospitalization rates did not differ significantly among COVID-positive residents in the Response group and those in the Preventive group (21% vs 29%, p=0.38), the magnitude of hospitalizations was overwhelmingly among residents and staff in LTCFs in the Response group (n=186 of 191 hospitalized, 97%). Similarly, among the overall 135 deaths among COVID-positive individuals across all 28 LTCFs, the majority (n=131, 97%) occurred among residents living in Response group facilities.",

Identification of such individuals can lead to the prevention of additional infections by isolating residents and excluding staff that are infected, initiating contact tracing, and increasing infection prevention measures including cleaning and sterilization procedures.",
