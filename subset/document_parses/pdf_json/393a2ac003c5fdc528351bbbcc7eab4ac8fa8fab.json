Objective: To determine the geographic accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 testing sites in the United States, as quantified by travel time. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing sites as of April 7, 2020 in relation to travel time. Setting: United States COVID-19 pandemic. Participants: The United States, including the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Exposures: Population density, percent minority, percent uninsured, and median income by county from the 2018 American Community Survey demographic data. Main Outcome: SARS-CoV-2 testing sites identified in two national databases (Carbon Health and CodersAgainstCovid), geocoded by address. Median county 1 km 2 gridded friction surface of travel times, as a measure of geographic accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 testing sites. Results: 6,236 unique SARS-CoV-2 testing sites in 3,108 United States counties were identified. Thirty percent of the U.S. population live in a county (N = 1,920) with a median travel time over 20 minutes. This was geographically heterogeneous; 86% of the Mountain division population versus 5% of the Middle Atlantic population lived in counties with median travel times over 20 min. Generalized Linear Models showed population density, percent minority, percent uninsured and median income were predictors of median travel time to testing sites. For example, higher percent uninsured was associated with longer travel time (\u03b2 = 0.41 min/percent, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.53, p = 1.2x10 -12 ), adjusting for population density. Conclusions and Relevance: Geographic accessibility to SARS-Cov-2 testing sites is reduced in counties with lower population density and higher percent of minority and uninsured, which are also risk factors for worse healthcare access and outcomes.

While controlling for population density as a potential confounder, percent minority was associated with an increase in travel time (\u03b2 = 0.15 min/percent, 95% CI 0.12-0.18), as was percent uninsured (\u03b2 = 0.41 min/percent, 95% CI 0.3-0.53). These associations remained when also adjusting for median income. We found a significant negative interaction between percent uninsured and population density (p<0.01) suggesting that the disparity of longer rural travel times is greater in counties where a higher proportion of the population is uninsured. Percent minority and population density did not interact statistically.",

The testing site distribution recapitulates structural disparities, including inequities among minority, uninsured, and rural groups, which may further perpetuate disparities as the pandemic progresses. Differential accessibility to testing may lead to biases in estimation of disease incidence, in turn, potentially delaying identification of COVID-19 hot spots. In the absence of representative testing, syndromic surveillance tools (e.g. Safepaths.mit.edu, CovidNearYou.org) may provide early warning signals, and augment targeted-testing and other public health interventions.",

However, there is potential for differential missingness of sites located in areas with reduced \"webscraping\" visibility or sites specifically placed to address geographic inaccessibility. Nevertheless, this work highlights the potential utility of data sharing during a pandemic, and the need for comprehensive resources to identify geographic gaps and optimize access for all.",
