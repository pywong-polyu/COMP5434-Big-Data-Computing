The purpose of this case report was to present how nonconfirmatory and conflicting diagnoses led to increased burden and suffering for a patient thus affecting quality of life. There were many physician visits and multiple tests performed on the patient. However, the primary care physician and specialists could not reach a confirmatory diagnosis. The treatment plans did not offer relief of symptoms, and the patient continues to experience digestive symptoms, enduring this burden for over 2 years. The central theme of this paper is to inform health care providers the importance of utilizing evidence-based primary care specialist collaboration models for better digestive disease outcomes. Consistent with patient's experience, the authors propose to pilot/adopt the integrative health care approaches that are proven effective for treating digestive diseases.",

The burden and cost of gastrointestinal (GI), liver, and pancreatic diseases are increasing each year. Total expenditures for GI diseases are US$135.9 billion annually in the United States (2) . Considering the multiple challenges this causes to patients and to the US health care system, it requires further exploration based on patient experiences, with a goal to reduce the burden on patients and health care spending (3) .",

(2) The use of evidence-based integrative health approaches in the patient's plan of care is another (10) . Models like these using integrative health care approaches early enough in the treatment plan must be piloted for application toward treating digestive diseases (10).",
