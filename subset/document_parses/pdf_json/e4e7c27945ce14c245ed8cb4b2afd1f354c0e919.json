The Pfizer-BioNTech, BNT162b2 vaccine was first offered exclusively to high-risk population, such as medical personnel (including pregnant women). In this study we compare short term outcomes in vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated pregnant women. Methods: In this prospective observational cohort study, vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant women were recruited using an online Google forms questionnaire targeting medical groups on Facebook and WhatsApp. A second questionnaire was sent one month after the first one for interim analysis. Our primary outcome was composite complications in vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups, considered any of the following: vaginal bleeding, pregnancy loss, hypertension, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth. Secondary outcomes included: vaccine side effects, diagnosis of COVID-19 since the last questionnaire, prevalence of vaccinated participants, and reasons for refusal to be vaccinated. Results: Overall, 432 women answered the first questionnaire, of which 326 responses were received to the second questionnaire. Vaccination rate increased from 25.5% to 62% within a month. Maternal age, gestational age at enrollment, nulliparity and number of children were similar in both groups. The rate of composite pregnancy complications was similar between vaccinated and non-vaccinated group (15.8% vs 20.1%, p = 0.37), respectively. The risk for COVID-19 infection was significantly lower in the vaccinated group (1.5% vs 6.5%, p = 0.024, Odds Ratio: 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.19-17.6). Conclusions: mRNA vaccine during pregnancy does not seem to increase the rate of pregnancy complications and is effective in prevention of COVID-19 infection.",

Six months later, the developers demonstrated that the vaccine is protective against COVID-19 [6] . On December 27th 2020, a massive vaccination program began in our country, prioritizing health care workers and high risk population such as elderly and people with comorbidities [9] . The vaccine was given in two doses, three weeks apart. No official recommendation was published to vaccinate pregnant women due to lack of evidence regarding safety, since this population was excluded from phase II/III trial. However, along with the discovery of the mutant variants of the virus, and due to a sudden increase in morbidity and intensive care unit admission in this population, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided not to withhold vaccination from pregnant women. At first, the vaccine was available only to pregnant women at risk (i.e., medical personnel). However, within several weeks the recommendations have changed, and the vaccine was recommended to all pregnant women at any gestational age due to the dramatic increase in morbidity.",

The questionnaires were distributed by the primary investigator, using her private Facebook account, on social networks such as Facebook and WhatsApp. At first, we targeted medical groups only. We chose these groups because the vaccine was available only for medical workers who are pregnant at that time. Few days after sharing the 1st questionnaire in these groups, the vaccine became available to all pregnant women, regardless their occupation and thus the questionnaire was posted publicly on the wall of the primary investigator's Facebook account with a request to share the post as much as possible so it could reach as many women as possible.",

Second, the recruitment was based upon being part of social network, having an e-mail, and we acknowledge the mistakes in self registration and the potential bias in self-reported outcomes. Third, we should keep in mind that the incidence of complications (such as miscarriage or stillbirth) might be even higher in both groups, because events like that have psychological impact which might affect women's will to participate in a questionnaire and remember such traumatic event. Fourth, although some women were lost to follow up, the number was minimal, and thus unlikely to affect the results. Lastly, the suboptimal power for the primary outcome might undermine the validity of the conclusions. To reach a power of 80% with the yielded incidences, a 2,392 cohort would be needed. These numbers were not available in the examined period.
