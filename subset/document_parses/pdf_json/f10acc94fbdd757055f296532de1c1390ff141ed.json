This turn of phrase is among the most frequently used within our field, and for good reason; it encapsulates how we understand school and why it remains so challenging to make it fundamentally any different than it has nearly always been. Across nearly all of the regions of the world covered in this journal, school looks nearly identical. Thus, while the views presented within these pages may be heterodox, there is a certain stubbornness to the structural orthodoxy of school.",

Even so, while there is space within the vectors of disagreement, there has generally been little consideration of new or alternative grammars. Recent scholarship outside (Mehta and Fine 2019) and within this journal (Courtney and Mann in press) has begun to explore such alternative grammars or lexicons. Mehta and Fine (2019) , for example, envision the expansion of places where students learn from just schools to places in addition to schools, such as community centers and even online (p. 380). They also identify different grammars operating within traditional schools, in some of the electives that students take or in their choice of extracurricular activities. Differently, yet also importantly, Courtney and Mann suggest that what both Tyack and Tobin, and Mehta and Fine call \"grammars\" actually reflect but do not define grammars. Courtney and Mann reconceptualize the grammar of schooling to be the ideology that orients institutions within a given period. By this view, grammars are not the structures or actions within them but rather the international discourses of industrialization, welfarism, neoliberalism, and neoconservatism that shape what goes on in schools.",

Valuing more places where young people learn is necessary-and Mehta and Fine's work opens a space for centering work that does so for students who traditionally do not benefit from the more innovative features generally saved for the more privileged-but the original grammar persists. Likewise, the ways that Courtney and Mann reconceptualize what we call grammar is helpful in shifting our gaze from structures to ideologies, but what they call the lexical features of the grammar-the structures of schooling-by and large remain.",

The year 2020 brought with it a playful opportunity to look back over the last 20 years and chart a path forward for the next twenty. Dennis Shirley and I proposed a Special Issue for this purpose and invited authors to consider the last two decades of research on educational change and suggest directions for the Journal going forward. We asked authors to write these pieces in 2019 with the plan to publish the article in 2020. At the same time, we intended for this Special Issue to mark an editorial shift to my own new role.",

As we put the finishing touches on our introductory and concluding remarks-from our homes, socially distant-in June 2020, we cannot help but feel that this Special Issue serves as a time capsule not just of the accumulated knowledge of educational change since the turn of the twentyfirst century but of the very idea of school itself, a collection of ideas preserved in amber to recall what educational life was like \"before.\" In this moment of worldwide chaos, and especially in this moment of massive shifts in both school as a physical structure and schooling as a more global concept, we are forced to re-consider our original reflective intent and to shift from a musing on what it has meant to study educational change to chart a new course for what it should mean. It is within this reconsideration that we have the potential to challenge the grammar of schooling. We have the opportunity to remake schools that are more equitable for more people, more professional for those who work in them and more inclusive for those who depend on them. Even using grammar as a term of discourse, we are most certainly heading into a new grammar that is yet to be defined. As researchers in the field of educational change, we have the opportunity to shape this discourse, and future issues of the Journal of Educational Change will take a central role in doing so.",

Certainly, many researchers will respond to these questions. But for readers and scholars of educational change and our Journal, I would like to suggest that we ask a different question, one that builds on the three vectors of disagreement outlined by Dennis and offers a path toward agreement: What weaknesses in educational change research do these vectors reveal, how has COVID-19 brought these weaknesses into even starker contrast, and how can we as a field respond in ways that improve school and schooling around the world while also making our field more robust, more relevant, and more far-reaching? Have we been asking questions that helped only ourselves, keeping the research in language that was inaccessible or even unavailable to people in schools? Was our focus on a few countries too narrow? Were our voices too few? Too privileged? Several articles in this issue would respond affirmatively. Our conversations in educational change have primarily been with each other, limited to our too narrow group of thinkers. We have failed, or at least not done enough, to make space for people doing the work in schools.",

Many of the top researchers not just in educational change but in educational research more broadly have opined on the impact these seismic shifts will have for schools. There are undoubtedly issues of equity, of access, of instructional quality, of teachers' autonomy and professionalism, and of the sheer physicality of what ideal schools can and should look like. I would like to use this space to consider a different angle: What role can the Journal of Educational Change play in not only responding to but envisioning how educational change research should look, going forward? As Counts (2013) famously asked: Dare the schools build a new social order?",

Can we at last write a new grammar of school that breaks the mold that has persisted for so long? Indeed, these very questions of educational change have never been more opportune. For the last 20 years, it has been a hypothetical question: How can we take what exists and make it better for more people? Going forward, we have an even more powerful platform: given our expertise about what is needed for school change, and our many years of extensive research from around the world, what role can we, as researchers, take in helping our partners in the field shape their future? And what can we learn from them as they do so?",

There is no precedent for what is happening and we have none of our traditional trappings to work from; we have no evidence of best practice, no randomized control trials to say what does or does not work. But we do have the collective wisdom of the last 20 years to make sure that what we know works-collective thinking, reflective practice, creative instruction, professional treatment, an eye toward justice-should not be lost. At the same time, our colleagues in schools also know what works-they do the work day in and day out. Let's join together to build a new type of educational change research-collaborative, practice-focused, evidence-informed, critically considered, multi-national, truly just research that welcomes all voices. Together, we can be a part of sustainable educational change for the next generation of students, teachers, and school leaders.",
