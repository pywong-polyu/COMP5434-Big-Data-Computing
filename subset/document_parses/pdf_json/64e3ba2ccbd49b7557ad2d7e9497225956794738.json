Evidence showed that this model had been successfully applied in handling the COVID-19 pandemic [5] . The aims of this article are to apply the SEIPS model to systematically describe the strategies and actions taken by the five public hospitals in the New Territories West Cluster (NTWC) of Hong Kong Hospital Authority and examine if the SEIPS model could support organizations in planning for and managing a pandemic. The strategies and actions taken in the NTWC since the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020 are summarized in Table 1 , and the key actions of each domain are highlighted below.",

This Committee, consisted of key hospital leaders, served as a communication platform for all stakeholders to continuously monitor the rapidly changing situation, make swift decisions and disseminate important messages. The CCE also communicated closely with the Hospital Authority Head Office and other regional clusters on the strategic approaches at the corporate level. ",
