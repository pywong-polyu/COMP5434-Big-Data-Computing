Eye gaze-controlled interfaces have been used for people with a severe motor impairment who cannot use the alternative computer peripherals. In this research, we developed a control architecture for an eye-gaze control of a wheelchairmounted assistive robot for activities of daily living (ADL) of individuals with upper limb impairment. Functional impairments of the Upper or Lower Extremities (ULE) are common in the elderly [1] . They are often secondary to conditions such as strokes, spinal cord injury (SCI), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA), trauma, and occupational injuries [2] . Being a powerful tool for object manipulation and communication, the human Upper Extremity (UE) is the most evolved body part. Its functionality largely reflects our workability, and the quality of life heavily relies on the proper functioning of UE motion [3] . It is challenging for a person to do their daily activities due to physical mobility loss [4] . In recent decades the number of Individuals with UE disabilities has increased at an alarming rate.",

People with motor dysfunctionalities face several problems in carrying out ADL, including feeding, toileting, dressing, and bathing [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Usages of assistive technologies like a powered wheelchair and robotic hand to assist these people are on the rise [4] . Working with assistive technologies and upgrading them for better usage is becoming a newer trend [4] and caught the interest of clinics, research, and industry [19] . Different types of research work are going on to improve assistive technology [20] [21] [22] . In particular, assistive robotics appeared as an exciting research topic that can enhance people's quality of life with motor dysfunctionalities. The earlier powered wheelchair was controlled with a joystick [23] [24] [25] , but people with musculoskeletal disease/injury could not use the handcontrolled joystick [26] . That is the reason why eye-gaze control has been explored [19, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . And researchers are improving the eye-gaze control of an assistive robot to help these impaired people's daily activities. This eyegaze control of assistive robot technology aims to help mute, paralyzed, elderly, or confined patients so that they can communicate with assistive robots easily, do their daily living activities, and live independently [29] .",

This work tried to improve the existing assistive technology mechanics, improve the physical interface, and focus on sharing the control between the technology and the user who will use the system. Oculomotor behaviors, gaze control, smooth pursuit, saccades, and their interactions with vision are described in [38] , emphasizing on past 25 years' literature review on eye movements. From this work, we got the general idea of how prediction, learning, and attention work with sensory signals and how these things contribute to effective eye movement operations. If the head movement was permitted during eye-tracking, it isn't easy to track the eye movement. A simple eye gaze tracker-based interface controls the wheelchair with free head movement described in [27] . A 3D orientation sensor is used in this eye-gaze estimation system to measure the head position and orientation. In this way, a user can keep a comfortable head pose or change head position while navigating the wheelchair. But the experimental result shows that this system is a little bit slower than other keyboard-based navigation systems.",

Authors in [29] describe using a low-cost gaze tracking hardware (Gazepoint GP3 Eye Tracker) to visually draw some shapes, used as input for robot command. A custom algorithm and MATLAB are used to detect and process the command. A small humanoid robot (NAO) is used for this experiment. The robot works as a personal assistant for impaired people, and people can use an eye gaze tracking system to command the robot. An eye-tracking robotic system for controlling a wheelchair and doing some daily living activities (ADL) using a wheelchair-mounted handexoskeleton is explored in [30] . The system is named EMOHEX, which can help people with disabilities move the wheelchair and also hold an object using the robotic arm. A graphical user interface is developed in [31] to control the powered wheelchair. An eye tracker interacts with the system and helps people with upper limb disabilities do their daily living activities.",

The controller updates the torque commands every 4 ms and is executed in xArm controller. Furthermore, to realize the real-time control of the system, and also to ensure the right control torque commands were sent to the joints as well as the reference voltage commands for the drivers, we have also added a proportional-integral (PI)controller to minimize the differences between desired and measured currents The current signals measured from the current monitor output of motor drivers are sampled at 0.1 ms, and are then filtered with a 2nd order filter with a damping factor \u03b6 = 0.90 and natural frequency \u03c9 0 = 3000 rad/s prior to being sent to the PI controller. This control architecture includes combination of three types of control loops: a position loop, a speed loop, and a current loop (see Fig. 6 ). The primary goal of the current loop is to control torque, which influences speed, and therefore, position. The current loop is nested inside the speed loop, making current the innermost loop, with the speed loop in the middle, and the position loop being the outermost loop. The current loop here is a PI controller with both proportional and integral gains. Current control parameters are set for tuning the current control loop.",

We have created a graphical user interface for interacting with the wheelchair and xArm. In addition, we have added a tabbed view for selecting the xArm and wheelchair mode. Figure 7 shows the updated graphical user interface to control the robotic arm. This was needed for simple button representation and ease of usage. The xArm tab is divided into three different modes of operation. For operating the xArm we have added some buttons for the functionalities of Cartesian mode, Gripper movement, Pretrained ADLs, and Joint maneuvering. In cartesian mode, the buttons control the arm in XYZ axis and open and close the gripper. For more effective and efficient control, we added buttons for maneuvering the joints individually. For repetitive ADL tasks, we added buttons to load and run predefined trajectories. Using the return button, the end-effector can move between two specific target positions following the same trajectory.",

Cartesian mode is used for the manual operation of the robotic arm. Still, for predefined ADL trajectories, the pickle file is loaded and executed through the graphical user interface to complete the task. Figure 12 shows the example of these ADL tasks performed using eye gaze control. The object on the shelf was five feet from the ground, and the object on the table was two and a half feet from the ground. Figure 13 shows the end-effector trajectories while performing an ADL picking object from an upper shelf in manual cartesian mode operation and previously saved path. From both trajectories, it can be concluded that manual cartesian manipulation is traveling some extra distance than the predefined ADL path. The joint angles, torques, and speed of each joint are represented in Fig. 14 . Each joint begins to move at the initial angle for this specific task and stops at the final angle. From the initial position of the end effector to the final position, most of the load was imposed on joint two and joint three. We can also observe the speed fluctuations over the course due to the switching frequencies of the control.

Because of the higher degree of the upper extremity, they cannot control the wheelchair or the robotic arm with other standard input devices such as finger or chin-controlled joystick. The developed control system and the interface are validated through the experiments with the healthy participants. Our experiments involved different essential activities of daily living and controlling the wheelchair with the same interface, which is also necessary for the mobility independence of people with disabilities. The overall experience results obtained from the participants indicate a promising solution for the individuals who are struggling with or unable to do their primary day-to-day tasks for their motor dysfunctions.",

The tabbed view feature in the interface allowed us to add bigger buttons for controlling both the wheelchair and the robotic arm. We acknowledge that it is difficult to make generalized statements about the findings with only the healthy participants. In future studies, people with upper limb mobility impairments are necessary to derive robust conclusions about the proposed method. Also, there are some uncertainties with the participants' feedback as it is not objective. Additionally, as our method involves eye movement, the proposed method can only be used for a user who has intact eye movement. To make this control system more efficient and user-friendly in the next phase, we will add object detection features. Object detection and recognition features of computer vision will aid the user in manipulating objects involved with activities of daily living more easily.",

To 18:173 accomplish this task, we first develop a graphical user interface based on wheelchair and robotic arm control commands to control manually in cartesian mode and follow the predefined trajectory of specific ADLs. Then, we solved the inverse kinematic of the robotic arm using the gradient descent algorithm. Finally, we evaluated the control system involving the eye gaze tracker in a human-robot collaboration with ten healthy participants. We constrained the robot workspace for safety measures. This project conforms to how eye gaze helps to manipulate assistive robotics. Our future direction for this project will be improving the robotic control architecture to reduce task completion time. Moreover, we will evaluate our developed system further with people with upper mobility impairments. ",
