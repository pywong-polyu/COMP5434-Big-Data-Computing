[3] Some scores such as the Ranson score also include items which must be evaluated 48 hours after admission, delaying prediction of severity. [4] [5] [6] Fever is commonly seen in AP but has received surprisingly little attention in the literature. It has been our clinical experience that AP patients with relative bradycardia (RB) tend to have milder disease and shorter length of stay (LOS). We therefore evaluated the relationship between RB at fever onset and disease severity and LOS in AP patients. No studies to date have evaluated the pulse-temperature relationship in AP.",

[7] AP severity was evaluated using the Ranson score, with the modified Ranson score used for biliary AP. [4, 8] Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients without renal disease or known allergies and most were reevaluated by CT 48 hours after admission. All examinations were evaluated by radiologists for the presence of necrosis or extrapancreatic complications. CT severity was determined using the modified CT severity index. [9] Delirium was diagnosed based on the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. [10] Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of at least 38.0\u00b0C at any moment during the hospital stay, measured by an electronic thermometer. Blood and urine cultures were taken from all patients who developed fever. Patients were divided into the RB group and the nonbradycardia (NB) group based on their heart rate at the first instance of fever during the hospitalization. Patients with heart rates less than the expected heart rates calculated using the formula devised by Ostergaard et al [11] at fever onset were considered to have RB. Specifically, male patients with heart rates < 10.2 \u00c2 body temperature (Celsius) -305 and female patients with heart rates < 11 \u00c2 body temperature (Celsius) -332 were placed in the RB group ( Fig. 1) . Postfever LOS was defined as the number of days from the onset of the first instance of fever to the date of discharge.",

[13] RB, or pulse-temperature dissociation, refers to an increase in body temperature without the expected corresponding increase in the heart rate. Various infectious etiologies such as bacteria (including Chlamydia, Listeria, Rickettsia, Legionnaire disease, typhoid fever, Q fever, tularemia, psittacosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, and mild to moderate conoravirus disease 2019), viruses, and parasites have been reported, as well as noninfectious etiologies including drug fever, lymphoma, adrenal insufficiency, cyclic neutropenia, and factitious fever. [14, 15] The mechanisms underlying RB are not well understood but have been suggested to include pathogenic impact on the sinoatrial node or myocardium, inflammatory cytokine release, increased parasympathetic stimulation, and reduced heart rate variability. [14, 16] The pulsetemperature relationship is most sensitive for temperatures above 38.9\u00b0C. [13, 17] Given these proposed mechanisms, RB can theoretically occur in the setting of many other etiologies. RB may be underreported due to the lack of physician awareness and the lack of a consistent definition. The formula used in our study comes from a Danish study on 6000 febrile patients which defined RB as heart rates below the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval. [11] In our analysis, we defined RB as heart rates below the expected heart rates according to the formula, which are already much lower than expected heart rates under traditional definitions.",

[19, 21, 22] Bohidar et al [19] analyzed 45 febrile AP patients and concluded that infected pancreatic necrosis was the cause of fever in only 18% of cases. Another report found that inflammation per se was the cause of fever in 57.7% of febrile AP patients and that prolonged fever of over 2 days was associated with higher severity, pancreatic necrosis, sepsis, and higher CT grades and CRP. [20] Pancreatic infection, the leading cause of death in late-stage severe AP, was found in 12% of 1741 cases in a systematic review. [22, 23] Bacterial translocation has been implicated as the main cause of pancreatic infection, which may be difficult to prove due to the low sensitivity of traditional blood cultures. [24, 25] The same review found extra-pancreatic infections in 32% of AP cases, most commonly respiratory infection and bacteremia, which were not associated with predicted survival or mortality. [22] Pancreatic infections may be associated with preceding or simultaneous extra-pancreatic infections. [26] Regardless of the infectious source, culture positivity has been linked to greater mortality and combined pancreatic and extrapancreatic sources of sepsis are associated with longer hospital stays. [27] On the other hand, randomized control trials have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in AP. [27] ",

The significant negative correlation between RB and the Ranson score was probably the main reason that RB ceased to remain significant when the Ranson score was added. On the flipside, this negative correlation supports RB as a favorable prognostic indicator in febrile AP patients. Furthermore, fever was observed within 48 hours in 93.9% of cases. The presence of RB can therefore be evaluated before the Ranson score can be calculated in most cases, serving as an early clue to a favorable prognosis. As there are naturally limits to predicting LOS based on a single dichotomous variable, RB should be considered together with other clinical factors.",

The study was a retrospective study at a single institution with a limited sample size, limiting the generalizability of study results. Patients were determined to have fever based on any single measurement above 38.0\u00b0C, which may have been transient and unrelated to pancreatitis. Grouping of patients into RB and NB groups were influenced by timing of measurement and chance, as heart rates and body temperatures change constantly. The formula used to calculate RB may not be applicable to our sample of Japanese patients. Nonmedical factors such as patient requests for early or delayed discharge may have affected LOS. Only patients on beta blockers were excluded; patients on calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or other medications which may affect the heart rate were not excluded. However, these other medications have a less significant impact on the pulse-temperature relationship compared to beta blockers. [17] Drug fever, a reported cause of RB, is always difficult to rule out. Many patients were also given acetaminophen for pain relief and/or prophylactic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs after ERCP, which may have reduced body temperatures as well as heart rates.",
