While a range of engineering strategies have been developed to functionalize the EV surface, current approaches fail to address the limitations associated with endogenous surface display, pertaining to the heterogeneous display of commonly used EV-loading moieties among different EV subpopulations. Here we present a novel engineering platform to display multiple protein therapeutics simultaneously on the EV surface. As proof-of-concept, we screened multiple endogenous display strategies for decorating the EV surface with cytokine binding domains derived from tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and interleukin 6 signal transducer (IL6ST), which can act as decoys for the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL6, respectively. Combining synthetic biology and systematic screening of loading moieties, resulted in a three-component system which increased the display and decoy activity of TNFR1 and IL6ST, respectively. Further, this system allowed for -2 -combinatorial functionalization of two different receptors on the same EV surface. These cytokine decoy EVs significantly ameliorated disease phenotypes in three different inflammatory mouse models for systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and intestinal inflammation. Importantly, significantly improved in vitro and in vivo efficacy of these engineered EVs was observed when compared directly to clinically approved biologics targeting the IL6 and TNF\u03b1 pathways.",

Our group and others have utilized the display of surface ligands to achieve targeted delivery of nucleic acid species in hard-to-reach tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS) [2] [3] [4] [5] . While being a highly promising strategy, recent studies have highlighted the limitations associated with conventional endogenous surface display technologies, as they typically label only a fraction of the EV population and thus limit the targeting capabilities to a minor sub-set of EVs. Emerging evidence indicates that EVs have numerous subpopulations aside from the classical division into exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies [6] [7] [8] [9] . This heterogeneity is critically important in EV engineering, especially when delivery of a therapeutic cargo is required in combination with a targeting ligand approach for successful therapy.",

Various studies have emphasized that both cytokines play a key role in stimulating inflammation and tissue damage 10, 11 . Hence, these pathways are correspondingly targeted by clinically used drugs, including blockers of TNF-receptor (TNFR) (Etanercept, Infliximab) and IL6 receptor (IL6R)(Tocilizumab), to alter the adaptive immune response in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 12, 13 . The soluble TNF\u03b1 homotrimers exert diverse biological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic signaling, through binding to one of its two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 14 . The cytokine IL6 has broad, pleiotropic biological activities and has been shown to exert both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory signals in deregulated adaptive immune responses 15 . Studies have highlighted that the trans-signaling activation by IL6 complexed to soluble IL6R through IL6 signaling transducer (IL6ST), is linked to inflammation, whereas classical IL6 cis-signaling has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and involved in regenerative processes 12 . In this study, we thus aimed to express TNFR and IL6ST on EVs as a clinically relevant approach that enable us to assess the display of the therapeutic proteins on a functional level rather than the mere presence on EV surfaces. Furthermore, the therapeutic relevance of these two cytokines in various inflammatory diseases allowed us to investigate the potency of these receptor decoy systems in vivo. Here, a screen of multiple endogenous display strategies was conducted for the decoration of the EV surface with cytokine binding domains of TNFR1 and IL6ST, which can decoy the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL6, respectively.",

A trimerization domain 'Foldon' derived from T4 fibritin protein of T4 bacteriophage 20 was introduced to the lead TNFR1 design either in the extracellular-or intracellular region (Figure 2A ). The addition of a multimerization domain to the TNFR1-N term Syntenin construct further increased the efficiency of the decoy EVs to sequester TNF\u03b1 ( Figure 2B -C). Similarly, we introduced a dimerization domain 'GCN4 L.Z', derived from yeast 21 , and a tetramerization domain 'Fragment X', derived from Phosphoprotein P of human metapneumovirus 22 , to the IL6ST-N term Syntenin construct in the intracellular domain ( Figure   2D ). Both designs showed a significant enhancement over their predecessors ( Figure To reduce the variability associated with cellular transfection and to further scale up the production of therapeutic EVs for in vivo applications, stable engineered HEK293T producer cells for production of IL6ST\u2206-LZ-NST-and TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST-decoy EVs were established using lentiviral transduction. HEK293T IL6ST\u2206-LZ-NST decoy EVs inhibited IL6/IL6R induced trans-signaling with reduced STAT3 activation and TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NSTdecoy EVs could inhibit TNF\u03b1 stimulated NF-kB activation in a dose dependent manner (Supp. Figure 7A and 7B). To further validate whether our EV engineering strategy is applicable to other cell types, we validated the approach in a more therapeutically relevant cell source, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which were engineered to stably produce the respective decoy EVs (Supp. Figure 7C ). MSC TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST and IL6ST\u2206-LZ-NST EVs displayed a dose response to decoy the cytokines similar to what was observed using HEK293T cellderived decoy EVs ( Figure 3A -B). The engineered MSC-derived EVs were characterized using NTA, showing that the majority of the EVs were in the size range of exosomes with a peak of around 100 nm (Supp. Figure 7D ). Characterization by WB of isolated EVs from the respective cell source confirmed expression of both common EV markers ALIX and TSG101, absence of apoptotic body marker calnexin and presence of the respective decoy proteins ( Figure 3C and Supp. Fig 8) 24 . In addition, the presence of decoy receptors (TNFR1 or IL6ST) on EVs was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy, using primary antibodies against the respective decoy receptor ( Figure 3D ).",

MSCderived TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST and IL6ST\u2206-LZ-NST decoy EVs exhibited a highly similar surface protein profile as compared to MSC Ctrl EVs for 37 different surface markers on tetraspanin positive vesicles ( Figure 3F and Supp. Figure 9A -C). Furthermore, to determine whether the decoy receptors are present on the tetraspanin positive subpopulation of EVs, we modified the bead-based assay by using decoy receptor-based detection instead of tetraspaninbased detection of the 37 different capture beads. Upon using hTNFR1 antibody as a detection antibody for assessing the 37 different antigens, CD63 and CD81 were observed to be the most enriched surface markers on TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST positive vesicles, whereas Ctrl EVs and IL6ST\u2206-LZ-NST EVs were negative for all markers ( Figure 3G and Supp. Figure 9D -F). A similar trend was observed for IL6ST\u2206-LZ-NST EVs upon using mIL6ST antibody as a detection antibody for the capture beads ( Figure 3H and Supp. Figure 9G -I). These results clearly indicate that our engineering strategy allows for highly efficient engineering of EVs with negligible disruption of their endogenous surface protein profile.

The protective effect in mice with LPS-induced inflammation was further improved by combinatorial treatment with both decoy EVs, as compared to 6.5\u00d710 11 unmodified MSC-EVs.

To explore the potential effect of decoy EVs in neuroinflammation, the experimental autoimmune EAE mouse model, mimicking MS in humans, was used. To evaluate the effect of treatment in these mice, clinical scores on a scale of 0-5 are used that reflect the disease severity (EAE-score, Table 1 ). Upon repeat subcutaneous (SC) administration of control MSC EVs, as depicted in Figure 5A , no effect was observed on disease progression compared to mock treatment. However, as hypothesized, TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST decoy EVs (4\u00d710 10 ) Subcutaneous (SC) treatment significantly reduced disease progression over time ( Figure 5B ). At the endpoint (day 16), mice treated with decoy EVs could still move freely (Supp. Movie 1), with only minor tail and/or hind limb weakness, as compared to mock treated mice that were hind limb paralyzed. Additionally, significantly lower EAE-scores were observed in mice treated with TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST decoy EVs (EAEscore 1.7/5) compared to control EVs (EAE score 3.0), which was similar to mock treatment (EAE score 2.9/5) ( Figure 5C ). In addition, mock treated EAE mice displayed a gradual decrease in body weight after symptom onset, reflecting disease progression (Supp. Figure   11A ). Mice treated with TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST decoy EVs displayed sustained bodyweight over time, with increased weight at the endpoint (4.2%) compared to mock treated mice (Supp. Figure 11B ). In addition, treatment with TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST decoy EVs reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL6 in spinal cord compared to mock treatment (Supp. Figure 12A and 12B) .",

To this end, MSC cells stably expressing both TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST and IL6ST\u2206-LZ-NST were generated (Supp. Figure 13A ). The optimized engineered EVs isolated from conditioned medium were characterized using NTA, showing that the majority of the EVs were in the size range of exosomes with a peak of around 100 nm (Supp. Figure   13B ). Characterization of isolated EVs from the respective cell source confirmed surface expression of both common EV markers ALIX and TSG101, absence of the apoptotic body marker calnexin, and co-expression of both decoy proteins by WB (Supp. Figure 14) . To validate the extent of engineering and to identify populations of EVs displaying both, or at least a single version, of the decoy receptors, single vesicle imaging flow cytometry 28 was performed after labelling of EVs with anti-TNFR and anti-IL6ST antibodies ( Figure 6A ). As expected, we observed a heterogenous pool of engineered EVs in our analysis, where 23% of the population of engineered EVs were found to carry both decoy receptors simultaneously, whereas 37% and 40% of engineered EVs were determined to carry either TNFR1 or IL6ST respectively ( Figure 6B and Supp. Figure 15A ). This was further validated by immuno-gold EM, where double positive EVs could be detected ( Figure 6C ). Furthermore, we observed a similar trend as with single engineered EVs in the multiplex bead-based flow cytometry assay, where the surface protein profile was similar to MSC Ctrl EVs, and the decoy receptors could be detected on several sub-populations ( Figure 6D and Supp. Figure 15 B-E). Decoy EVs purified from these double stable cells showed similar potency to decoy both cytokines in the in vitro cell assays as compared to their single decoy EV counterparts ( Figure 6E -F).",

The approaches developed thus far rely on multi-modular engineering strategies, where a set of several proteins are used for achieving drug loading and imparting targeting moieties. Recent work by our group shows that the majority of these proteins, especially Lamp2b and CD63, fail to co-localize in the same vesicle subpopulation upon overexpression in producer cells 31 . Furthermore, Lamp2b, one of the most widely used EV engineering proteins for displaying targeting peptides, labeled only a fraction of EVs in our hands 31 . As a result of EV heterogeneity, there is a risk that for multi-modular strategies that the various modules (e.g. therapeutic and targeting) are distributed between mutually exclusive EV subpopulations, thereby negatively affecting the therapeutic efficacy of the EVs.",

We hypothesized that a matrix metalloprotease (MMP) cleavage site previously annotated 19 in TNFR1 resulted in cleavage of the receptor from the decoy EV surface, hence reducing the efficacy of the TNFR1-decoy EVs.

However, addition of the dimerization domain both in the extracellular and intracellular domain decreased the efficacy of the display, potentially because it affects the cytokine binding properties of the receptor. Furthermore, a sorting domain derived from transferrin receptor (TfR) along with GCN4 L.Z dimerization domain showed similar efficacy as compared to Syntenin in our screen when it was fused to IL6ST. Importantly, the variation in active dose among the different sets of experiments is primarily due to large-scale transfection and therefore a relative comparison with multiple doses was performed in every screen to account for this variation. Based on these findings, we selected N-term-Syntenin as the EV-sorting domain for both TNFR1 and IL6ST decoy EVs with the intracellular dimerization domain included for IL6ST (IL6ST\u2206-LZ-NST) and with the intracellular trimerization domain and deletion of MMPcleavage site for TNFR1 (TNFR1\u2206\u2206-FDN-NST) (Figure 2A and 2D).

Although beyond the scope of this study, future developments could include conjugation of TfR domains beside Syntenin to achieve display of two or more different biologics on EV surface. However, the co-localization of these two-sorting domains into the same EV population must first be confirmed.believe that this strategy can easily be adapted for decoying e.g. viruses, merely by displaying the human proteins which serve as an entry point for the viruses. For instance, the cytokine binding parts could be replaced with human ACE2 proteolytic domain to decoy SARS-CoV-2 and prevent viral uptake into the cell. This effect can be complemented with cytokine decoy receptors to reduce the overactive immune response.In conclusion, the platform described here has the potential to be implemented in several EV engineering strategies for displaying targeting ligands, decoy receptors, single chain antibodies, as well as other therapeutic modalities. By further modifying these designs, luminal therapeutic cargo loading and display of targeting moiety can be achieved simultaneously, hence addressing the limitation of engineering applications imparted by the heterogeneity of released EVs. By combining protein therapeutics and a natural delivery vehicle that can overcome tissue barriers, engineered EVs have great potential to be the next generation biotherapeutics.NF-\u03baB reporter (Luc)-HEK293 cells (BPS Bioscience, catalogue no. 60650) were cultured and used as proposed by the manufacturer. 30,000 cells per well were seeded to a 96-well plate with culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% P/S) and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .After 24 hours, the cells were treated with or without EVs, and with hTNF\u03b1 (5 ng/ml, NordicBiosite) in 50 \u00b5l of complete DMEM. 6 hours after treatment the cells were lysed using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (Sigma) and mixed with D-Luciferin assay (Promega) prior to luminescence measurement by Luminometer (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions.HEK-Blue IL6 Cells (Invivogen, catalogue no. hkb-hil6) were cultured and used as proposed by the manufacturer. 30,000 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well plate with culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% P/S) and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .
