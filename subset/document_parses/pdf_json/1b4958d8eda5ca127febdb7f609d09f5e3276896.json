Levels of sense of smell perception were determined when the participants detected, recognized, or identified all (normosmia), 1-3 (hyposmia), or none (anosmia) of the odorants. Associated factors of olfactory dysfunction were identified by multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 95%CI). Recent Findings Olfactory dysfunction is a prevalent disorder affecting up to 20% of the general population. In addition to viral infection, including COVID-19, a number of other causes and factors may also be involved. Summary 1,956 surveys were conducted and 1,921 were analyzed. Most of the participants (62.1%) were women. The general prevalence of olfactory dysfunction, regarding detection, was 7.2% (7.1% hyposmia, 0.1% anosmia). Age-related olfactory deterioration was observed in both sexes from the 5th decade of life (OR 2.74, p = 0.0050). Women showed better olfactory identification (OR 0.73, p = 0.0010). Obesity (OR 1.97, p = 0.0070), low educational level, bad/very bad self-perceived olfactory function (OR 2.74, p = 0.0050), olfactory loss for less than one week (OR 1.35, p = 0.0030), exposure to toxics/irritants (OR 1.31, p = 0.0030), active smoking (OR 1.58, p < 0.0010), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.74-4.10, p < 0.0001) were identified as factors associated with olfactory dysfunction. These results in a Mexican population suggest better olfactory identification (verbalization) in females. Age was a determining factor in the olfactory deterioration process and obesity and diabetes mellitus were also associated with olfactory disorders. Finally, these findings reinforce the differential diagnosis with other potential causes of sense of smell loss, during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

In that context, some authors have proposed the suspicion of COVID-19 upon sudden onset of anosmia, even in the absence of other symptoms [1\u2022\u2022, 3] . In recent years, the study of olfaction has become relevant because several analyses have suggested that olfactory dysfunction is a marker of health deterioration [4, 5\u2022, 6] .",

Odor detection is related to the most peripheral part of the olfactory system [7] , whereas identification and recognition memory involve cognitive tasks of central structures, such as the orbitofrontal region and other areas of the limbic system. In addition to viral etiology [8, 9] , several other causal factors have been described: posttraumatic events [10] [11] [12] , neurodegenerative diseases [13] [14] [15] , sinonasal inflammatory diseases (chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps) [16] [17] [18] [19] , and allergic rhinitis (in adults [20] or children) [21, 22] .",

The statistical analysis was performed using the PASW Statistics 18 program. The potential risk factors for the prevalence of olfactory disorders were calculated using age-adjusted logistic regression models (multivariate analysis). Olfactory disorders were the dependent variable. Frequencies and means were calculated for the descriptive statistics, as a hypothesis test by p value (significant when p < 0.0500) for the chi-square (Chi 2 ) test.

According to the prevalence of olfactory loss found (7.2%) in our study, we estimate that around 6 million Mexicans have some degree of olfactory dysfunction, of which they are unaware (79.5% of participants with detection hyposmia perceived their sense of smell as good or very good). We based our prevalence study on the Catalan OLFACAT Survey [29] regarding odor detection, recognition memory, and forced-choice identification. Although the prevalence of detection hyposmia in our population was lower than that reported in the OLFACAT survey (7.2% vs 19.4%), odor identification was similar (55.6% vs 48.8%). Those differences can be explained by the demographic characteristics in the two populations, with a tendency toward a younger population with a lower educational level in the OLFAMEX survey. Detection hyposmia is expected to be lower in a younger population, but its relation to recognition and identification, which depend on cognitive and semantic capability, is less clear. [32] Several studies have focused on olfactory disorders in the general population, reporting a prevalence of 1 to 20%. That wide range is due to the diversity of methods used for assessing olfaction [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Researchers are currently encouraging the use of universal language and methodological quality so there can be the consistency of results in this field [33] .",

A significant number of that older population will experience agerelated sensory loss and a worsening in general health, wellbeing, self-sufficiency, and quality of life. In the OLFAMEX study, a strong decrease in olfactory identification was demonstrated in the 6th and 7th decades of life, with more than half of the participants > 65 years of age having significant olfactory disorders [23-25, 27, 29, 34] . Thus, we observed a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunction from the 6th decade of life. In our Mexican study population, aging was associated with detection, recognition memory, and identification of olfactory dysfunction. Different agents, acting alone or together, can potentially explain that deterioration. An increase in the number of patches of respiratory epithelium, which represents a loss of primary olfactory receptor neurons, has been found in the olfactory zone in the older adult population [35] , as well as a decrease in the expression of olfactory receptors in olfactory mucosa, predominating in men [36] . Similarly, exposure to harmful agents, the risk of head trauma from falls, the prevalence of diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases, increase with aging. The National Social Life and Aging Project (NSHAP) study [4] , conducted in the US from 2005 to 2011 on an older adult population, found that 5year mortality was associated with hyposmia (OR 1.54) and highly associated with anosmia (OR 3.24). They concluded that olfactory dysfunction is one of the strongest 5-year predictors (together with heart failure, diabetes, and stroke) of mortality and can serve as a marker of accumulated toxic environmental exposures.",

However, the findings on olfactory sensitivity are inconclusive. In a study involving 154 adults, Gouveri et al.

In our study, females showed a higher capacity for forced-choice identification (OR 0.73) but, as in Gouveri's study, we found no differences for detection and recognition. It is well-known that olfactory identification involves a semantic memory task that requires individual knowledge of a specific odor [40] . Larsson et al.

The impact of obesity on cardiovascular (cerebral vascular disease, blood hypertension) and metabolic (diabetes mellitus) systems have been widely studied. The olfactory and endocrine systems appear to be connected, with important roles played by insulin, ghrelin, and leptin. Similarly, a high-fat diet can affect the general neuro-architecture of the olfactory system by reducing the number of olfactory receptor neurons and their axonal projection [47] . The lower the olfactory function, the higher the emotional consumption of food and the consequent increase in BMI [48] . In our study, obesity was associated with odor detection loss by 97% and recognition memory by 44%. That situation is a great challenge for the comprehensive management of obesity and partially explains the difficulty of adhering to a healthy diet, since obesity may be a significant cause-effect in olfactory disorders. Said event is even more relevant in older adults, in whom olfactory impairment plays a role in poorer diet quality [49\u2022\u2022] .",

The theory of cognitive reserve posits that highly educated individuals suffering from brain diseases are more likely to use strategies to recruit brain structures other than those normally used in cognitive tasks [32] . The identification of an odorant requires semantic memory, which is a cognitive ability that is increased by formal education [53] . Some studies [29, 32] have reported that a high educational level improves the capacity of odor recognition memory and identification. Similarly, in the OLFAMEX survey, we found higher skills for odor detection, recognition memory, and identification in the middle/high educational level groups. The participants that could not read or write had a 2 to 3-times higher association with recognition and identification of olfactory disorders.",

In the OLFAMEX survey, exposure to toxic/harmful substances was associated with identification hyposmia. The impact of smoking on the respiratory tract and its inflammatory, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects are well known. Despite contradictory study results, structural or functional changes have been found in the olfactory neuroepithelium, suggesting that smoking may impact odor detection and recognition memory [55] . Bramerson et al. [27] found no differences between the threshold and discriminative capacity in smokers and non-smokers but Mullol et al.

The first to be altered [35] is odor identification because certain medial temporal lobe structures involved are affected in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease [56] . Similarly, olfactory deficits can be found early on in patients with PD. Olfactory dysfunction is the second most common characteristic after rigidity and akinesia and could even be the most frequent early alteration [14] . A study involving 48 relatives of persons with PD (25 individuals with hyposmia and 23 with normosmia) found that 8% of individuals with hyposmia developed PD compared with 0% of individuals with normosmia, indicating that olfactory disorders precede the classic clinical motor signs of the disease [57] . Our results showed that participants with a personal or family history of those diseases had difficulty correctly identifying odorants, and 28% had hyposmia. Taking into account the significant number of dopaminergic neurons lost at the time of clinical diagnosis of PD, the detection of patients in the prodromal period of clinical parkinsonism is very important for the development of treatment strategies that reduce or prevent motor PD [14, 58, 59] .",

Nevertheless, a personal history of olfactory loss for < 1 week appears to be associated with olfactory loss, with respect to both memory and identification. Postviral etiology is frequently associated with olfactory loss in the course of acute manifestations, such as nasal blockage and rhinorrhea [8, 9] . In the COVID-19 epidemic, evidence has emerged that reveals the appearance of olfactory alterations as one of the most common signs of that viral infection [1\u2022\u2022, 2, 60, 62] . Some authors suggest that anosmia could be the only clinical presentation, without any other significant symptoms [3] , or even an early sign of COVID-19 infection [62] . In the context of post-viral olfactory loss, the mechanism of lesion development is unclear, and even though most patients in our study experienced spontaneous recovery, we observed the persistence of a certain degree of injury manifested by alterations in olfactory recognition and identification. Accordingly, we must be aware of possible permanent sequelae in olfactory function, as consequences of COVID-19.",

The study's significant strengths include the large size of the sample population, the face-toface collection of data by trained personnel, and the ability to identify persons with acute respiratory infections. Its limitations or weaknesses were the lack of control over the selfdescribed level of education, which tended to be higher than known characteristics in Mexico, as well as not distinguishing participants with a neurodegenerative disease from those that had only a direct family history, preventing a separate evaluation of those two groups. Nevertheless, our results about the olfactory condition are very revealing in our Mexican population and the association with olfactory loss paves the way for further investigations in that direction. Given the relevant prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Mexico [63] , as well as in many other developed countries worldwide, there is an important unmet need to deeply investigate the impact of DM2 and obesity on the sense of smell, and in consequence, their potential roles in early mortality.",
