We evaluate the performance of tracking-based intervention methods on a network SEIR model, which we augment with an additional parameter to model pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and study the effectiveness of these methods in combination with or as an alternative to quarantine and global lockdown policies. Our focus is on the basic trade-off between human-lives lost and economic costs, and on how this trade-off changes under different quarantine, lockdown, tracking, and testing policies. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Tests combined with patient quarantines reduce both economic costs and mortality, however, an extensive-scale testing capacity is required to achieve a significant improvement. (2) Tracking significantly reduces both economic costs and mortality. (3) Tracking combined with a moderate testing capacity can achieve containment without lockdowns. (4) In the presence of a flow of new incoming infections, dynamic \"On-Off\" lockdowns are more efficient than fixed lockdowns. In this setting as well, tracking strictly improves efficiency. The results show the extreme usefulness of policies that combine tracking and testing for reducing mortality and economic costs, and their potential to contain outbreaks without imposing any social distancing restrictions. This highlights the difficult social question of trading-off these gains against patient privacy, which is inevitably infringed by tracking.",

For simplicity we quantify the former by \"human lives lost\" (a fraction of the total number of infected) and the later by \"fraction of labor days lost\" due to social distancing or quarantine. Figure 1 demonstrates the dynamics and outcomes of an outbreak under three different lockdown levels. Figure 1a shows the \"usual\" graph of the number of infected people over time. With a lax 30% lockdown, the disease spreads quickly and dies-out due to herd immunity only when over 80% of the population have been infected. With a more strict lockdown of 60% we reduce R 0 to a somewhat lower value R e , but still to a value above 1, thus \"flattening the curve\" and reaching herd immunity at a lower infection percentage, leading to a total of around 40% of the population being infected. An even stricter lockdown of 80% reduces R e below 1, stopping the spread of the disease rather quickly. Figure 1b depicts the trade-off between the mortality cost and the economic cost of these three approaches. With a 30% lockdown we have a low economic cost but a high mortality cost. As we increase the lockdown rate, the economic cost rises, while the mortality cost decreases. However, as we continue to increase the lockdown rate, at a high enough rate, we manage to quickly eliminate the disease (the \"hammer\" 22 ), allowing the economy to return to normal, resulting in low economic and low mortality costs.",

This is demonstrated in Fig. 2 that shows the total population percentage of symptomatic cases and the economic costs as a function of the rate of symptoms among infection cases, with and without quarantine. The precise population mortality in every outbreak is some percentage of the total symptomatic cases, where the exact percentage depends on specific properties of the disease and of the population, on environmental conditions and conditions of the healthcare system.

People who have been in contact with an infected person need scrutiny for two possible reasons: on the one hand they may already be infected by this person without knowing it and, on the other hand, they may be the asymptomatic source of this person's infection and may infect others. Obviously, tracking contacts of infected patients is a difficult and costly endeavor which seriously infringes on the privacy of infected people and of their contacts. Yet, in most western countries, citizens are required by law to cooperate with such an epidemiological investigation by health authorities. In the current COVID-19 crisis, it has become clear that effective contact tracing at scale requires automated tools such as cell-phone GPS-tracking which further heightens the privacy concerns. Trading-off the human-rights loss of privacy versus the human-rights losses from lockdowns is a difficult social question and requires a clear understanding of the possible benefits of tracking.

This method avoids the collateral damage of neighbor isolation: only infected individuals are put in quarantine.

These are shown both for a closed system and for an open system with a small flow of incoming infections. The effectiveness of tracking is clearly visible at all levels of social distancing, with Track and Test being especially effective, often taking us below the critical threshold of contagion that eradicates the disease.

This is rather limiting in our \"open system\" model that assumes a small steady flow of spontaneous infections, thus ruling out the possibility of complete eradication of the disease. In such (realistic) models, a natural strategy would be to dynamically relax the lockdown when there are only very few infected people, tightening it back when the number of infected people increases (this is the \"hammer-and-the-dance\" strategy popularized in 22 ). These dynamic lockdowns may be able to out-perform static constant levels of lockdown. Figure 5a depicts the cost map of percentage of labor days lost versus the total percentage of infected population for 24 different On-Off policies. The two colors indicate whether the lockdown policy is applied with the limited tests version of the Track and Test method or with random tests and the Quarantine method; the population percentage of tests per day for both methods is 0.5% . Table 1 shows the details of the algorithms corresponding to the policies in the figure. The 12 left columns are policies with the Track and Test method and the right columns are with random tests and Quarantine. The dotted curves show the comparison to the costs of using fixed lockdowns with the two methods and the same number of tests. It can be seen that in the presence of incoming infections, dynamic lockdown policies are more efficient than fixed lockdowns both for Quarantine with random tests and for the Track and Test method. Also in this setting with a limited testing capacity and in combination with dynamic lockdowns, Track and Test policies show a clear advantage over Quarantine policies.

The SIR model is based on three coupled differential equations that describe the dynamics of the sizes of three populations: Susceptible S, Infected I and Removed R.

As seen in these equations, the classical SEIR model is deterministic and considers the population as a homogeneous continuum. A natural extension of the model is to a Markov chain model with discrete \"compartments\" that count the population in each of the states. Stochastic compartmental models of this type allow to simulate more complex settings where the population is no longer homogeneous but is divided to different groups (such as age groups) that have different transition rates between states, or to add more states such as hospitalization states and different disease severity levels; of course, this flexibility comes with the cost of more free parameters in the models. Several such models were recently designed for simulating outbreaks in the current COVID-19 crisis with different interventions, some of which are used by advisory teams for policy makers or as publicly available open source tools (e.g., 28, 29 ) . A basic characteristic of compartmental models is that they count the population size in each state and the flows of populations between the different states but, importantly, they do not have identities for individuals and do not model individual interactions.",

In principle, a strict lockdown for a sufficient period of time can eradicate an infection completely. However, lockdowns have two key caveats as mitigation or containment tools: the first caveat is the high economic and social costs of lockdowns, and the second is that a full extinction state of the infection is not always feasible in practice due to its sensitivity to new incoming infections. In Fig. 3 , the red curves show the effect of using only lockdowns as a mitigation tool. The figures depict the cost maps of the total percentages of infected population and the percentages of labor days lost throughout a period of 18 months, in a closed system (Fig. 3a) and with a small flow of incoming infections (Fig. 3b) . The numbers near each marker indicate the lockdown level and the dotted lines are linear interpolations. The results show a qualitative difference between closed and open systems: In a closed system, as seen in Fig. 3a , it is possible to hold a strong lockdown of 80% that reduces the effective reproductive number to below 1 and to eradicate the infection completely. This leads to an overall low percentage of infected population and to relatively low costs, since the lockdown can be removed after a short period once there are no more infections. However, Fig. 3b shows how adding even a small incoming flow of infections (a single new infection per week in a 100,000 population) leads to a different result; when relying solely on lockdowns, herd immunity is not reached and, in the lack of additional tools to restrain the spread of the infection, the lockdown cannot be removed and the economic cost remains high. The curves show that in both closed and open systems there is a trade-off between mortality and labor days lost, but in systems that are 100% closed this trade-off breaks when moving from a subcritical to a supercritical lockdown level, while in the more realistic presence of some leakage of new infections the trade-off persists.",

When looking at fixed lockdown levels and comparing the no-quarantine (red) and Quarantine (yellow) methods, we see that at low lockdown levels, quarantining symptomatic cases creates some trade-off between economic cost and the mortality rate, mainly in the closed system condition. This happens because a significant part of the population are symptomatic and quarantined, leading to a non-negligible loss of labor www.nature.com/scientificreports/ days. However, this trade-off breaks when the lockdown level is higher and closer to the critical value. E.g., at lockdown levels of 0.6 in both closed and open systems, Quarantine has lower economic costs and lower mortality rates than the no-quarantine benchmark.",

On the other extreme, if there are almost no symptomatic cases, then the infection is not considered dangerous and even a widespread outbreak is not a serious concern. The situation of intermediate values is harder to control: When only part of the infected individuals develop symptoms, and symptoms may start either early or late during the infectious stage of the disease, asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals act as \"invisible spreaders\" of the infection, leading to high mortality. Fig. 2 shows the total population percentage of symptomatic cases as a function of the rate of symptoms, with and without quarantines. As can be seen, a high symptoms rate exerts \"force\" in two opposite directions: On the one hand, symptomatic cases can be detected and isolated, but on the other hand, a higher rate of symptoms naturally leads to more symptomatic cases. The tension between these two forces is expressed in the non-monotonic cost curves, both having a maximum point, with intermediate symptom rates resulting in high costs.",

Notice that the actual active cases count does not include recovered cases while the quarantined cases typically do include some recently recovered patients. Figure 7a shows the dynamics of the active cases count across time (in blue), presented as percentages of the population, and the dynamics of the percentage of the population currently in quarantine (in orange) for the Quarantine method. Figure 7b shows a similar plot for the Track and Test method. Both figures are presented in the more realistic open-system condition. We observe two problems in the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Quarantine method: First, the number of quarantined cases reaches significantly lower levels than the number of actual cases, and second, Quarantine is \"lagging behind\" the dynamics of the actual infected cases. Both of these problems stem from the fact that the Quarantine method relies on passive detection of symptomatic cases; these cases consist only a part of the actual cases due to a large fraction of asymptomatic cases and are detected with a latency due to the incubation and pre-symptomatic time of the disease. The Track and Test method manages to overcome both of these difficulties, as it does not rely only on natural detection of symptomatic cases. Instead, these cases are used as seeds to track and then quarantine infection chains, quarantining also exposed and asymptomatic individuals. Figure 7b shows that the quarantined cases reach close to the actual active cases and very little lag effect can be seen. The advantage of tracking and testing is seen in the two orders of magnitude difference in scale between the two figures (approximately 30% vs. 0.3% at the maximum points).",

An issue that might arise in the context of the Track and Test method is that in the worst case, this method requires an unbounded number of tests (limited only by the size of the population). It could be that Track and Test simply tests the whole population in a short period of time; such a strategy, if it were possible to implement, would stop the infection, and it does not require any tracking. For (an extreme) example, if the whole population was to be tested in a single day, all infected individuals could be quarantined, and the infection would not spread. To test whether this is the case we first look at the actual number of tests run by the (unbounded) Track and Test method, and then look at a bounded-tests variant of the method. Figure 8a shows the average number of tests actually performed by the Track and Test method across time in 50 realizations of the infection spreading process, presented as percentages of the population. The shaded area in the figure shows the 1st to the 3rd quartiles across the different realizations. It can be seen that in practice, the unbounded Track and Test method typically requires only a moderate number of tests per day. The average rate of daily tests increases at the beginning of the outbreak, reaching 0.25% of the population and then gradually decreases. Figure 8b shows the full distribution of test rates over all simulation instances and all simulation days. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Most of the mass of the distribution is indeed centered at low test rates, but there is a tail of low probability events of days with high test rates. The inset in logarithmic scale shows that these events are rare, and their probability roughly decays exponentially with the test rate, but still, their probability is not negligible. Next, we describe a bounded version of the Track and Test method which avoids these high-test-rate events, and show that such test rates are not really required for effective tracking and testing.",

In the special case of zero test capacity, this algorithm is equivalent to the Track and Quarantine algorithm, and in the special case of infinite capacity it is equivalent to the Track and Test algorithm. Figure 4 shows the percentage of total infected population (Fig. 4a ) and the economic costs (Fig. 4b) as a function of the daily test capacity in population percentages for the bounded Track and Test method and the Quarantine method.

In terms of economic costs, at low test capacities Track and Test has higher costs than the Quarantine method, but the cost drops rapidly as the capacity is increased. For test capacities of 3% and above, also the bounded version of Track and Test manages to contain the outbreak without the use of lockdowns and at lower costs than the Quarantine method.",

Tracking without tests has a stronger effect, however, this is still not sufficient to reach one-digit percentages in the size of the outbreak, and still there are non-negligible costs due to largescale quarantines. The Track and Test method manages to contain the outbreak at low costs and outperforms the other approaches. This advantage of Track and Test is not a result only of a large number of tests, nor a result of tracking alone, but it is a result of the combination of tracking with a sufficient testing capacity for contacts of infected individuals.",

We have seen that on the one hand, in closed systems a strong lockdown leads to a fast extinction of the infection, which in turn leads also to low economic costs, but on the other hand, if there are incoming infections the fixed lockdown is not desirable as it leads to high costs. If a sufficient testing capacity is available (of around 3% ), we have seen that the Track and Test method can effectively contain the outbreak at low costs without lockdowns. Now we consider a more restrictive setting for interventions, where there is a non-zero incoming flow of infections-and so a complete eradication of the infection is not possible-and the daily test capacity is limited to a more moderate value. In this setting we turn to evaluate the performance of a family of dynamic lockdown algorithms that we call \"On-Off \" lockdown policies, in the spirit of the \"Hammer and Dance\" idea as advocated in 22 . We evaluate the On-Off lockdown policies in combination with the Track and Test method and with the Quarantine method.",

The algorithms track the current number of known active cases, in percentages of the population size. If this number is above the On threshold, the lockdown level is switched to High. If the known active cases are below the Off threshold, the lockdown is switched to Low. For example, an On-Off policy with parameters (50, 80, 10, 1) means that if the number of known active cases is above 10% of the population a strict 80% lockdown will be applied, and once the number of known active cases drops below 1% of the population, the lockdown will be relieved to a 50% level. The choice of a lockdown policy is orthogonal to the choice of tracking, testing or quarantine method, in the sense that any On-Off policy can be used in combination with any method of the methods discussed in the previous sections. Figure 5a shows the cost map of 24 policies that are a combination of 12 On-Off algorithms applied with two methods: the bounded version of Track and Test and the Quarantine method with random tests, both with a daily test capacity of 0.5% of the population. The letters in the figure mark the different policies as shown in Table 1 ; the 12 left columns in the table are with the bounded Track and Test method and the right columns are with the Quarantine method. Larger circles in Fig. 5a indicate higher variance between simulation instances and the radius shows the standard deviation.

For the Quarantine method, policies M-R are strict and policies S-X are trembling-hand. Each of these two families shows a cost-mortality trade-off: changes in the thresholds of the algorithm within the same family that reduce mortality also increase the economic cost. When switching between the trembling-hand family S-X to the strict family M-R the trade-off breaks and it is possible by such changes in the algorithm to reduce both costs and mortality, except for policy S that has a slightly lower mortality than policy M. For the Track and Test method (purple markers in the figure), policies A-E are strict and policies G-L are trembling-hand On-Off policies. Policies G-L all have similar high cost and low mortality, and policies A-E show the cost-mortality trade-off as in the Quarantine method. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ An especially interesting policy in Fig. 5a is policy A that achieves a very low mortality rate and has a moderate cost of 35% , significantly lower than the fixed lockdown alternatives (the dotted lines in the figure). Figure 5b shows the dynamics of the spread of the infection under policy A. It can be seen that under this policy the 80% lockdown is active less than half of the time, and is restarted at a frequency of about one month. This algorithm leads to a slow quasi-linear spread of the infection, reaching less than 2% of the population in 18 months.",

Our model describes individual interactions directly, as edges in a time dependent network, and keeps track of the internal state of each individual in the population. These features of the model were introduced in order to allow studying policies that rely on individual-level tracking directly, without making a priory assumptions about the outcomes of tracking. Of course, the model has limitations. Specifically, we do not model in this work heterogeneity in susceptibility levels or in viral loads of infected individuals, we use a linear model for the economic cost of lockdowns and quarantines, and we consider the total percentage of infected individuals as a proxy to mortality and other health outcomes of the infected population. Therefore, the total outbreak size and the economic cost in our model should be interpreted as first approximations and as comparative metrics between mitigation approaches. For example, in an economy where the costs of lockdowns are super-linear in the intensity of the lockdowns or its duration due to externalities, lockdown-based policies become more expensive and the economic gap in favor of tracking-based methods will increase. Or, if parts of the population are not susceptible, either naturally or due to vaccines, then the model describes only the sub-population of susceptible and the actual fraction of the population infected by the disease will be lower under all intervention policies. Another limitation is in complexity: keeping track of the interaction network requires considerable computational resources. Although this complexity is polynomial in the population size, in a large population performing or simulating individual-level tracking can be challenging and more sophisticated algorithmic solutions may be required. Additionally, in reality there may be gaps between a planned policy and that which is implemented in the field. Such issues of compliance, enforcement and implementation may pose constraints to policy makers which are not included in our model; our results describe only the potential of the different interventions policies assuming that they are implemented.",

If the testing capacity is around 3% , Track and Test manages to stop the spread of an infection, without any lockdowns. When the testing capacity is lower, we have shown that strict On-Off lockdowns dominate fixed-lockdown policies, and again, Track and Test policies dominate non-tracking policies. Table 1 .

Digital tracking has a serious cost in the privacy of infected individuals and their contacts, but on the other hand, lockdowns and social distancing restrictions have their own severe costs in freedom and human rights, beyond their economic costs.

The relevant equation set for each individual is determined according to the epidemiological state of that individual (S, E, I, or R). The four equation sets are the individual interaction and discrete time counterparts of the four SEIR equations presented in Eq. (1), with the additional information regarding the symptoms, visibility, and quarantine states of each individual. A key difference from the classical SEIR model is that here each individual has an internal state, and so the number of parameters that are updated at each step of the dynamics of a population of N individuals is 6N, and the number of interactions is quadratic with N, while the population-based SEIR keeps track of a coarser information of only four states (the population sizes of each of the four states {S, E, I, R}). The equations of the dynamics are as follows: If the individual is in the susceptible state, i.e., s(v t ) = S: \u2022 Denote the number of interactions of individual v t at time t with infections individuals by k(v t ) = |{(v t , u t ) \u2208 E t : s(u t ) = I}| \u2022 The state v t+1 in the next day is updated according to: and the other parameters remain: t c",
