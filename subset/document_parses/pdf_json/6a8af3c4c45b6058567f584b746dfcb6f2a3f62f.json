            "text": "Poor quality diets, including high consumption of sugary drinks and ultra-processed food, are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] . Solutions to encourage healthier food purchases in retail settings are urgently needed. Nutrition-related point-ofsale policies and interventions that have shown promise include excise taxes on sugary drinks and ultra-processed food [4] [5] [6] [7] ; marketing restrictions [8, 9] ; and requiring warning labels on sugary drinks and ultra-processed food [9] [10] [11] [12] 12] . Most evidence on these policies comes from either real-world observational studies or laboratory-based experimental studies. Observational studies tend to have high external validity but may be limited in their ability to eliminate alternative explanations for observed changes [13] . By contrast, experiments can allow for stronger causal inference but often occur in artificial settings and rely on self-reported outcomes, which may limit their generalizability to real-world settings and behaviors [13] . For example, prior experiments of nutrition interventions have typically involved showing participants a food or beverage product via an online survey, after which participants rate their perceptions of the product or their intentions to purchase the product [10, [14] [15] [16] . Online experiments have several benefits, including that they allow for manipulation of many experimental arms within the same study; can be conducted at relatively low cost; can easily be conducted in national samples; and can provide early insights about the potential for policies to change behavior. However, participants' stated impressions of products do not perfectly predict actual behavior change [17, 18] .",

            "text": "By contrast, naturalistic laboratories that resemble real-world stores offer a novel solution for providing high-quality evidence about the effect of point-of-sale interventions on consumer behavior. Store laboratories can create a naturalistic, immersive experience that mimics real-life shopping experiences. These labs also allow researchers to measure real-life behavioral outcomes, which may have better construct validity than self-reported outcomes [19] . Moreover, store laboratories enable researchers to randomly assign participants to experience different interventions, allowing for strong causal inference without needing to rely on partnerships with retailers who may be resistant to implementing pointof-sale policies like taxes or warning labels. Studies have successfully used laboratory stores to examine point-of-sale interventions to reduce the purchase of sugary drinks [20] , as well as tobacco [21, 22] and alcohol [23] . However, studies have not yet examined the validity of using store laboratories as a proxy for real-world purchases, including evaluating 1) the extent to which behavior in store laboratories mirrors behavior in the world and 2) the extent to which participants perceive store laboratories to resemble real-world environments. Moreover, the feasibility of using store laboratories for longitudinal data collection remains to be established, especially among populations at risk for diet-related health disparities.",

We focused on sugary beverages because the consumption of sugary drinks is associated with health outcomes such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [27] . Thus, we aimed to assess whether beverage purchasing behavior in the store laboratory setting was similar to real-life beverage purchasing behavior. In addition, we aimed to examine whether participants viewed the store as being realistic and whether the protocol was feasible and acceptable.",

We then compared the percentages from realworld purchases vs. Mini Mart purchases for sugary drinks and non-sugary drinks using Chi-Square tests with Fisher's p. We also reported the percentage agreement for purchasing any sugary drinks and purchasing any non-sugary drinks. We descriptively compared the medians of total volume in mL purchased from stores (i.e., according to receipts provided at Visit 1) and the total volume in mL purchased at the Mini Mart at Visit 1. For these calculations, we created a per capita/per day variable by dividing the volume in mL by household members and then dividing that number by seven. We reported results both including and excluding coffee and tea because these tend to be purchased in bulk and thus infrequently. We did not compare Visit 3 receipts with Mini Mart purchases because we did not expect them to be similar (participants were instructed to buy their beverages in the Mini Mart for that week).

One possibility for the observed differences is that participants may have purchased fewer beverages in the Mini Mart because the Mini Mart was located on the second floor of a building and only had shopping baskets, not carts, therefore limiting the volume participants could carry. In addition, although the study budget was designed to reflect typical beverage expenditures, the budget was set at an average based on top grocery retailers in North Carolina and might not reflect a given family's shopping budget, especially given that the majority of participants reported an annual household income below $25,000. If the Mini Mart budget was larger than a parent's typical budget, an income effect may have led parents to purchase products in the Mini Mart that they might not typically buy [31] , potentially including more sugary drinks. Future studies could construct more tailored budgets based on a household's typical expenditures [32] . A third possibility is that the receipt collection is itself an imperfect approach for assessing typical beverage purchases. It is possible that not all receipts were reported and the act of collecting receipts could have changed participants' behavior. In addition, one week of receipt data may not be representative of a household's \"typical\" purchases [33] . Receipt collection occurred the week prior to participants starting the study in the Mini Mart. This could have posed a particular problem for items purchased in bulk (e.g., multipacks of water); if parents purchased these products the week before, they may not have needed to purchase these items in the Mini Mart. In the future, it would be useful to validate Mini Mart results with multiple weeks of receipt data and collect these with a washout period of at least two weeks prior to beginning Mini Mart visits.",

Over 90% of participants stated that their purchases were similar to real-life, that the Mini Mart felt like a real store, and that they could imagine completing their grocery shopping there. Although 88% stated that there were enough beverage options, this is one area for potential improvement, as it is possible that the 12% who felt there were inadequate beverage options purchased less, resulting in the overall reduced beverage purchases we observed in the Mini Mart. One possibility would be to conduct a pre-experiment survey to identify the most-purchased products among participants and use those data to selectively stock the store with brands that are most frequently consumed by participants in the study. That said, randomized trials are internally valid even if participants' purchases differ somewhat from real life because the observed differences across treatment groups can still be attributed to the treatment.",

We recruited 61 Latinx parents to attend five study visits within the intended timeframe of three months. The ease of recruitment offers a promising sign for subsequent trials using similar methods, given that the main reason trials are terminated early is low enrollment [34] . All but two participants attended the final study visit, representing 97% retention, which is well above the typical threshold for acceptable retention of around 80% [35] . High retention in trials is important for both ensuring timely study completion and preventing potential biases caused by differential attrition by trial arm [35] . Nearly all (95% or more) participants said they would recommend the study to a friend and that they would participate in the study again if they had the opportunity. These acceptability ratings are similar to a tobacco study protocol [30] that was used successfully in two large-scale randomized trials [36, 37] .",

Working directly with retailers would allow for a truly \"realworld\" setting for a trial, but collaborating with retailers presents challenges such as: finding retailers willing to participate in studies; obtaining transaction data; and randomizing at the individual level. In addition, food retailers may be reluctant to test interventions they view as potentially harmful to sales, such as taxes or warning labels. Another viable option is to conduct experiments in virtual 3D stores [38] [39] [40] , which may facilitate faster and more affordable recruitment, although the simulated shopping environment is not as realistic as a physical store. Finally, some studies have used experimental online stores intended to replicate online grocery shopping or food ordering websites [41, 42] . Online stores may also allow for faster recruitment and can be very realistic for people who typically buy groceries online; rates of online shopping have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [43] . However, online stores would provide a less realistic experience for people who do not shop online.",

Scientists who wish to use a physical store laboratory might consider partnering with colleagues studying different health issues (e.g., nutrition, tobacco, alcohol) and pooling resources to create a physical store laboratory that can be used in a variety of studies. The total amount of space required to create a store laboratory could be relatively small depending on the type of environment being emulated. For example, we were able to stock over 200 unique beverages, similar to beverage offerings in a grocery store, plus 60 additional food and household products in only 245 square feet of space. Finally, before conducting clinical trials in store laboratories, researchers should consider budgeting for pilot studies to develop and test protocols for: (1) managing inventory throughout the study; (2) exposing participants to study stimuli; (3) randomizing participants to study arms; (4) providing shopping instructions to participants; (5) tracking participants' selections; and (6) collecting and administering payment exchanges.",
