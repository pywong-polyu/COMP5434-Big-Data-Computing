Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a beta coronavirus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family. The family is composed of single-stranded positive ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses [1] . Coronaviruses have four genera, and the alpha and beta genera have viruses known to cause human disease. They are zoonotic viruses that can be transmitted from animal to human; and the first time that occurs, it is referred to as a spillover event. The SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be closely related to coronaviruses found in the bat population and to the SARS-CoV [2] . Two coronaviruses found in bat populations, RaTG13 and RmYN02 were found to have 96.2% and 93.3% sequence homology, respectively with SARS-CoV-2 [3, 4] . Coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins have also been found to have sequence homology to SARS-CoV-2 [5] . The zoonotic source for SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be established. The bat and pangolin coronaviruses lack the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike (S) protein, which SARS-CoV-2 possesses making the theory of human to human transmission at undetectable rates post spillover, a possibility for the virus to have acquired these genomic features prior to starting off the pandemic [6] . December patients was temporarily assigned the name 2019-nCoV [8] .",

The structural proteins are the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M), the S protein and the envelope (E) protein. The RNA is oriented in a 5'-3'direction which makes it a positive sense RNA virus, and the RNA can be read directly as a messenger RNA (mRNA, Fig. 1 ). The RNA replicase is encoded at the 5' terminal end. The nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) has proofreading activity which allows the rate of mutations to stay low. The S protein causes the attachment of the virus to the host cell at the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is present on the membrane of the host cell. The ACE2 receptors are found in abundance on alveolar cells. The attachment causes fusion of the viral lipid membrane with the cell membrane of the host thus internalising the virus. The host machinery translates the viral RNA and leads to the production of the replicase and structural proteins of the virus. The replicase is cleaved into nonstructural proteins of which RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is one of them. Viral replication and amplification is carried out and assembly of the virions is carried out in the host cell endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. During the process of replication, errors can occur in the genome leading to mutations which give rise to variants. The virions are finally released out of the cell by exocytosis [10, 11] .",

According to the report by Davies et al, nearly 5,000 out of 17,452 COVID-19 deaths during the months September to February were due to this variant. They also estimated that the mortality was approximately 55% higher when compared to other variants [20] . Similarly, the scientific reports in January 2021 indicated that there was an increased rate of death with this variant [21] . As of April 1, 2021, there were 12,505 reported cases across 51 jurisdictions [22] . It has been identified in 82 countries [23] . [22] . The mutation E484K in this variant mediates the antibody escape is the main reason for the reduced sensitivity to vaccines [25] . The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) were authorized in the USA before the identification of this strain in the country [26] . According to the latest studies, these two vaccines elicited lower neutralizing antibodies than that of the previous strains. Novavax, Janssen, and Astra-Zeneca conducted trials in South Africa that have dominant B.1.351 mutated strains. These studies demonstrated the lower vaccine efficacy compared to that of the other variants where this strain was not dominant [27] . [22] . It has 35 mutations with 17 amino acid changes. Its notable mutations are K417T, E484K, and N501Y [22] . In a study by Naveca et al, it was found that this variant is 2.2 times higher transmissible that led to a few cases of reinfection who recovered from COVID-19, and almost has a similar rate infection in the younger (18 -59 years old) and older (> 60 years old) patients [28, 29] . B.1.351 and P.1 consist of similar receptor binding mutations and hence, the vaccine efficacy against P.1 strain is assumed to be similar to B.1.351. As the studies demonstrated reduced vaccine efficacy against B.1.351, it is likely that the efficacy against P. 1 strain is reduced [30] . Sinovac Biotech has initiated the clinical trials which demonstrated that the CoronoVac vaccine is 50% effective in preventing infection with the P.1 variant in Brazil [31] . [15] . It was identified last year across the USA and Europe. It is a variant with a mutation in the S protein. In January 2021 it rose rapidly as the cause of cases across several counties in California [35] .",

A small percentage of the fully immunized population will still get sick to varying degrees from COVID-19 disease. They are known as vaccine breakthrough cases. A person who has SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected on or after 14 days after completing the primary series of a US FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine fits the definition of a vaccine breakthrough case. More than 75 million people have been fully vaccinated as of April 13, 2021 since December 14, 2020. During the same duration, there have been 5,814 vaccine breakthrough cases reported across the USA. Forty-five percent of the total cases were female, 29% were asymptomatic, 45% were over 60 years of age, 7% of the total cases were hospitalized, and 1% died [48] . There have been several hurdles in general to vaccine administration. Pregnant and breastfeeding women, immunocompromised, diverse race and ethnicities have been underrepresented populations in vaccines studies. Vaccine refusal has been an issue physicians have had to deal with even in pre-pandemic times [49] . There has been growing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [50] . Equitable vaccine distribution, storage requirements and cost are factors that will have a significant impact in areas across the world.",

Children and immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk of developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome or long-haul COVID [51, 52] . The longer the virus propagates the chance of mutations are higher. Vaccine breakthrough cases are often undercounted and fully vaccinated populations should still practice preventative measures. At the time of this paper 40.7% of the total population in the USA was fully vaccinated. The USA ranks eighth in terms of percentage of population vaccinated. Israel ranks first with 57% of the total population vaccinated followed by Bahrain and Aruba [53, 54] . Continuation of precautionary measures including masking, hand hygiene, isolation and quarantine along with other public health mitigation strategies, genomic surveillance and vaccination plays an important role in prevention of spread; early identification of variants, prevention of mutations and viral replication, respectively, and still form the cornerstone of the action plan to control the COVID-19 pandemic [55] .",
