Most corticosteroid prescription refills (81%) occurred within 90 days of the previous fill and included both inhaled and oral dosage forms. Inhaled dosage forms were commonly dispensed for a long days' supply. Accordingly, we calculated cumulative days' supply including both oral and inhaled corticosteroids by looking back 90 days from an index corticosteroid dispensing. For example, for a corticosteroid fill on March 31st 2010, every corticosteroid fill between January 1st and March 31st would contribute to determining the number of cumulative days' supply during the 90-day look-back period. Each corticosteroid dispensing served as an anchor to calculate previous corticosteroid exposure. We evaluated four thresholds to define \"chronic\" corticosteroid therapy: any corticosteroid dispensing, or \u2265 30-, 45-, or 60-day cumulative days' supply during the past 90 days.",

To associate corticosteroid use with the underlying CLD severity, rather than a seasonal respiratory infection, we compared trends of our various definitions of chronic corticosteroid based on cumulative days' supply during the past 90 days. As a result, shorter courses of chronic corticosteroid use paralleled the increasing RTI infection rates at RSV season onset, but this effect was attenuated when requiring \u2265 45 cumulative days' supply to define chronic steroid use.

While Medicaid billing records are a reliable source for ascertaining medical support for CLD [10] , claims-based treatment duration information can be inaccurate. Second, our CLD cohort may not exactly mirror those recommended for palivizumab immunoprophylaxis in guidelines. For example, our data could not provide the actual duration of oxygen use that guidelines require to determine the eligibility (i.e., supplemental oxygen at least 28 days after birth). Third, our operational definition for chronic corticosteroid use included inhaled corticosteroids based on an empirical finding of its prevalent use. Given a continuous evaluation of the beneficial effects of inhaled corticosteroid on the pulmonary system [11] , we acknowledge a restriction to systemic corticosteroids, which were not investigated in this study on their own, could have been relevant. Finally, our study findings may not be generalizable to other countries where guidelines for CLD treatment can be different from those in the U.S.",

Recently, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has changed RSV epidemiology, causing unexpected variations in the RSV season onset and offset [12] .
