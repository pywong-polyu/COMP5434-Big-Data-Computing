            "text": "Background and Purpose: Infection is a common comorbidity and cause of death in emergency trauma patients, especially in diabetic patients. Once the patients are admitted, they are more susceptible to further complications like sepsis and resultant increase in inhospital mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate risk factors associated with sepsis after trauma and death in trauma patients. Methods: A total of 397 trauma patients were divided into 2 groups according to HbA1c level, HbA1c: <6.5% (n = 259), HbA1c: >6.5% (n = 138), and baseline clinical characteristics were collected. The independent risk factors of sepsis associated with trauma were screened using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to investigate risk factors for 30-day all-cause mortality. Results: The sepsis incidence (76.1% vs 35.9%, P<0.001) and mortality rate (29.7% vs 7.3%, P<0.001) were significantly higher in HbA1c>6.5% group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent risk factors of sepsis after trauma were diabetes (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.41-6.79), hypertension (OR: 2.55, 95% CI: 1.35-4.82), coagulation disorder (OR: 3.45, 95% CI: 1.23-9.67), creatinine (OR: 3.71, 95% CI: 1.66-8.31), urea nitrogen (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99), HbA1c%>6.5 (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.65-2.54), increase in body mass index (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03-1.13) and lower initial GCS score (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that male (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.21-3.12), HbA1c >6.5% (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.32-1.6), albumin (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86), creatinine (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), APTT (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), SOFA score (HR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.31), age >65 years (HR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.95-5.3) were independent risk factor for trauma patients' mortality. Conclusion: The prevalence of sepsis and mortality was higher in trauma patients with HbA1c >6.5%. HbA1c was independent risk factor for sepsis and all cases of mortality in trauma patients.",

            "text": "To date, trauma still exerts a significant burden for health care systems worldwide and is one of the most common injuries managed in the emergency department. Within the United States, trauma is the primary cause of mortality in individuals younger than 45. 1 For patients who do not need surgical intervention or have been admitted to hospital after surgery, most of them need to continue treatment in the emergency intensive care unit (EICU). During EICU treatment, complications after trauma including sepsis, multiple organ failure (MODS) and other late trauma complications increase the probability of a poor prognosis and mortality. 2 A large sample of studies has been conducted to explore the risk factors of post-traumatic sepsis, but its research variables are directly related to trauma, such as the number of trauma sites, blood transfusion, etc. without considering the basic state of the patient. 3 Current studies have shown that diabetics, especially those with poor blood glucose control, are more likely to develop infectious diseases than non-diabetic patients. 4 Therefore, it is necessary to explore the risk factors of post-traumatic infection in diabetic patients. At present, a few studies have made preliminary exploration into the matter, and are mainly limited to specific surgical studies. 5 The specific analysis of sepsis after trauma in patients with poor blood glucose control has not been reported. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a common indicator of long-term glycemic control; this is mainly because red blood cells live for 120 days, which reflects blood sugar levels for the first 120 days. Therefore, it is often used as an indicator of long-term control of blood glucose in diabetic patients, or used to assess the prognostic risk of other diseases. Previous studies have found that HbA1c levels are associated with increased mortality within a period of 6 months and poor neurological outcomes in out-ofhospital cardiac arrest survivors. 6, 7 In addition, HbA1c levels are not affected by acute attacks of illnesses; as a result, it is a reliable marker to determine the presence of hyperglycemia before onset. We speculate that HbA1c levels may be a reliable predictor for sepsis and probable increased mortality for trauma patients. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the relationship between HbA1c levels with effect to sepsis and all-cause mortality in trauma patients. 8",

Only patients who completed the HbA1c examination were included in the study. For patients with a history of multiple admissions, we focused on the data that was provided by the first admission. The remaining exclusion criteria are: Patients who presented with sepsis at the time of admission to the EICU; age less than 18 years old; the length of hospital stay in EICU was less than 24 hours; automatic discharges. We conformed to the definition and description of sepsis that was provided by the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (sepsis-3). 9 Our study utilized the anonymous data available from electronic medical records and paper medical records; hence, the requirement for informed consent was waived.

The remaining 397 patients were eligible for analysis and were divided into high HbA1c (n = 259, 65.2%) and low HbA1c (n = 138, 34.8%) groups using HbA1c 6.5% as the cut-off point. We summarize the demographic, mortality and sepsisrelated data shown in Table 1 . There were 114 patients older than 65 years, accounting for 28.7%, and 76.7% of the patients were male. The SOFA score and BMI were 8 (3, 15) and 26.90 (24.20, 30.25) , respectively. The most common underlying comorbidities were hypertension (26.4%), alcohol abuse (16.4%) and diabetes (15.9%). Compared with the low HbA1c group, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in inflammatory markers such as WBC and neutrophils with high HbA1c. As expected, those with high HbA1c had a higher SOFA score [4(3, 7) vs 4(2, 5), p =0.011] and were more likely to have longer length of EICU stay [6(3, 12) vs 3(2, 8) p =0.001] compared with those in the low HbA1c group. The other variables appeared to be comparable between these two groups, except that those with high HbA1c were more likely to be male (39.1% vs 23.2%, p <0.001) compared to those in the low HbA1c group.",

According to our study, univariate analysis results showed that PH, albumin and hemoglobin on admission were risk factors for mortality of emergency trauma patients, which was consistent with the results of some previous studies. Acidosis is an established risk factor for death. 10 Mypinder's study showed that hemoglobin concentrations <90g/L was associated with increased hospital mortality in patients with severe brain injury. 11 A retrospective analysis of 12,418 patients showed that hypoalbuminemia is common in patients with acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock, and is associated with higher shortterm and long-term mortality. 12 After adjusting for age, sex, BMI and other covariates, creatinine and HbA1c were independent risk factors for sepsis and increased mortality in trauma patients. We believe that this result may be related to diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients. Nakanishi's study also suggested an association between renal function and HbA1c, suggesting that HbA1c>7.0% increases the risk of diabetic microangiopathy, which increases the risk of diabetic nephropathy. 13 In our results, HbA1c was most closely related to blood glucose, so we focused on analyzing the influence of HbA1c on trauma patients. There are some studies on the relationship between blood sugar and trauma prognosis, but the results are not consistent. Studies suggest that hyperglycemia caused by stress and diabetes increases ICU mortality in trauma patients, on the other hand, some research believes that increased mortality occurs only in trauma patients with stress hyperglycemia. It does not occur in trauma patients with hyperglycemia due to diabetes. 14,15 Study of Edwards supports our conclusion that trauma patients with HbA1c greater than 6% at admission had a higher mortality rate than 50% and ICU hospitalization and mechanical ventilation were significantly higher than those in the HbA1c normal group. 16 Our findings support the view that HbA1c levels may help predict incidences of sepsis in trauma patients after their admission. Previous studies have focused on the relationship between HbA1c and sepsis, and it is believed that hyperglycemia is independently associated with poor prognosis, especially in diabetic patients. 17, 18 The study of Baltrusaitis about hand trauma suggests that the wounds were more susceptible to infection in patients with high HbA1c. 19 The result of Iavazzo study suggests that the increase of preoperative HbA1c may indicate a higher risk of infection complications and readmission within 30 days in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. 20 Our results suggest that pre-admission blood glucose level can be a predictor of sepsis after admission in trauma patients. Patients with high HbA1c were more likely to develop sepsis than patients with low HbA1c (76.1% vs35.9%). In the case of inflammatory stimulation due to abnormal regulatory response of the immune system for people with elevated blood glucose, it is noted that lymphocyte reduction rate is increased, and neutrophil, serum CRP and IL-6 levels were elevated. 21 These may be the reasons why patients in this study are more likely to develop sepsis.",

The injury of vascular endothelial glycocalyx(VEG) caused by hyperglycemia is considered to be the starting factor of pathological injury such as atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetic complications and the occurrence and development of sepsis. 22, 23 VEG is the first protective layer on the surface of the endothelial surface layer (ESL), which is involved in regulating cell adhesion and migration in an inflammatory state to influence important functions like vascular tension, endothelial permeability, coagulation and thrombosis. Up regulation of endothelin-1 in diabetic patients induces podocyte heparinase, which in turn leads to glomerular VEG injury. 24, 25 With the exception of hyperglycemia, under other pathophysiological conditions such as atherosclerosis, infection, ischemia/reperfusion injury and trauma, ESL can be disrupted to impair endothelial function. 26 Studies suggest that patients with higher HbA1c levels are more severely damaged than patients with lower HbA1c levels during sepsis. From this perspective, HbA1c itself may play the role of a marker reflecting a chronic hyperglycemic state and suggesting that VEG has been disrupted before trauma occurs. 27 ",

            "text": "VEG shedding may lead to a series of adverse consequences. First, VEG damage activates and enhances the activity of inflammatory cells. Study has shown that the shedding of VEG exposes the surface adhesion molecules of vascular endothelial cells, which makes inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and mononuclear-macrophages easier to adhere to endothelial cells, and further transendothelium migration to the tissue space outside the vessel leads to inflammatory dispersal. 28 In addition to the inflammatory response, VEG injury can destroy the tight junction between endothelial cells, the structural integrity of endothelial cells will become loose. 29 ARDS caused by pulmonary edema is one of the main causes of death in trauma patients, especially in the elderly. 30 After VEG injury, the fluid flow in the capillaries greatly exceeds reabsorption, leading to interstitial edema and local ischemia, accelerating tissue ischemia, which eventually leads to organ dysfunction. 31 All above mentioned mechanisms shown in Figure 3 lead to an increase in the incidence of sepsis and mortality in trauma patients with high HbA1c. In addition to our research, there are other studies on the above mechanism. Maranon et al showed that the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, in peripheral blood in patients HbA1c>6.5% were significantly higher than those in HbA1c<6.5%, and these inflammatory factors may be induced by thioredoxin activation of NF-\u03baB and expression of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, reactive oxygen species can lead to lipid peroxidation; amplify the inflammatory cascade, eventually leading to cell death and more serious inflammatory response. 32 Study of Chin has found that acute hyperglycemia can induce sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter 1(NKCC1) expression by activating serum glucocorticoid kinase 1-NKCC1 pathway, affect alveolar fluid regulation, and aggravate lung injury. 33 To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the relationship between HbA1c levels and sepsis occurrence and mortality in emergency trauma patients. This study revealed the relationship between HbA1c levels and ICU mortality in trauma patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survival time of patients with high HbA1c was significantly shorter than that of patients with low HbA1c. We conclude that HbA1c greater than 6.5% is associated with increased mortality in EICU patients. META analysis, which included 57 RCT studies in 2020, suggests that intense blood glucose control can reduce all-cause mortality in ICU patients compared with routine blood glucose control. 34 The relationship between previous blood glucose levels and blood glucose control levels during treatment and mortality in trauma patients still needs further study.",
