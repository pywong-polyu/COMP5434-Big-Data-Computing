Weakness and chills began 24 h post-vaccination. Temperature was 103.3 F on presentation with stable hemodynamics. Symptoms also included generalized arthralgia and a headache. Initial labs showed a creatinine of 2.81 mg/dl, normal electrolytes, WBC count 3.3 k/mm 3 , 12 g proteinuria and trace hematuria. C3 was low at 77 (normal is 90-200) and dsDNA positive.",

Pulse dose solumedrol (500 mg intravenously \u00c2 3 days) was initiated and then switched to 60 mg prednisone. Five days later, creatinine was down to 1.7 mg/dl and fevers resolved. Due to recent history of pulmonary embolism, he was on coumadin. Kidney biopsy was initially held due to a therapeutic INR and coumadin was held. Once INR was normal and while on a heparin bridge, he declined a kidney biopsy as renal function was improving with treatment. He had a history of a hematoma needing a blood transfusion with his initial kidney biopsy which also was a reason for him to decline a kidney biopsy. AKI, low c3, symptoms, dsDNA positivity and negative infectious workup clinically correlate with a lupus nephritis flare. Prompt treatment helped improve parameters with C3 coming up to 86, 5 days after steroid initiation along with symptomatic improvement. He was discharged on 60 mg oral prednisone with a plan to taper. Mycophenolate mofetil was continued as before.",

Prior COVID illness is a risk for vasculitis flares after vaccination. 4 Data are still limited to prove definitive causation, but further research is needed as more cases are being reported. With more coronavirus vaccines being administered worldwide and recommendations for booster shots in immunocompromised individuals, there is potential for more associations with vasculitis flares. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two cases of lupus nephritis flare-ups after the coronavirus vaccine. 5, 6 Early diagnosis and treatment led to a quick improvement in renal function in our case. Further research is needed regarding routine surveillance post-vaccination in autoimmune disease, especially in those with prior COVID-19 infection. Surveillance could include laboratory testing or serologic markers specific to the underlying vasculitis.",
