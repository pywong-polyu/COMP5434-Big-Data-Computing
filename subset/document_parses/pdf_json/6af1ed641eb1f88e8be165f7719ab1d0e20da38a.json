Aetiology remains unclear, but cardiac damage in COVID-19 has been suggested to be attributed to stress-induced cardiomyopathy and immunological and microvascular damage. 3 Case reports have documented that younger, previously healthy patients can develop significant regional cardiac injury due to acute coronary thrombosis in COVID-19, even with milder disease presentations. 4 5 In our patient, the myocardial involvement was global, suggesting diffuse inflammatory damage as a more probable pathway than regional ischaemic dysfunction due to microvascular thrombosis or atherosclerotic plaque rupture. 9 A particularity of the present case is the significant amount of myocardial injury, as reflected by an increase in TnT to >3\u00d7 upper limit of normal combined with ECG and echocardiographic abnormalities, despite the patient's young age and the absence of previous cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms underlying and the predisposition to COVID-19 myocarditis in young, otherwise healthy individuals remain poorly understood and are a research priority. 3 Both central neurological manifestations, such as encephalopathy, seizures and ataxia, and peripheral nerve damage have been attributed to COVID-19, including frequent reports of loss of taste and smell, and rarely cranial neuritis mainly affecting eye movement. [10] [11] [12] [13] Whether SARS-CoV-2 actually displays neurotropism is currently not clear. 10 In our patient, the low antibody index indicates there has not been viral replication within the central nervous system.
