Evidence from earlier epidemics (e.g., SARS in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009) suggests widespread mental health impacts (3) (4) (5) . People who have been directly infected or those in direct contact with someone with the infection may experience increased stress and anxiety, depression, and also post-traumatic stress disorder (6, 7), but the perceived infection risk could also lead to higher anxiety among non-infected individuals (8) . Given the short timeframe, only a limited number of studies have so far analyzed the mental health consequences of the current pandemic. However, the evidence from very recent systematic reviews (9, 10) confirms higher levels of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of the study population, a higher psychological impact of COVID-19 is reported for females, for those having lower socioeconomic status, and for those at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 due to poor health or contact with COVID-19 patients (10).",

More specifically, we will focus on the prevalence of perceived stress during the first wave of the pandemic in Estonia, where the first COVID-19 case was confirmed on February 25, 2020 (11) . With 58 cases diagnosed, a state of emergency was declared by the government on March 12, 2020, to enforce appropriate measures to control the spread of infection. During the first wave, the 14-day incidence peaked on April 6 at 56.6 cases per 100,000 and after gradual decline in newly diagnosed cases, the state of emergency was ended on 17th May 2020 with 14-day incidence being 6.0 per 100,000 (Figure 1 ). By end of May 2020, \u223c5% of the population had been tested and fewer than 2,000 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed in total (11) . However, Figure 1 also illustrates the situation 10 months later when the ongoing second wave resulted in almost 2,000 new cases daily and the 14-day incidence rate was close to 1,500 per 100,000 as of mid-March 2021.",

Second, the emergency situation itself and the measures taken to contain the spread of infection (13) were unprecedented and affected the daily lives of all inhabitants.

The survey questionnaire was based on locally adapted version of WHO tool for behavioral insights on COVID-19 (14) with additional items on the presence of symptoms of upper respiratory infections, previous COVID-19 testing, selfrated health (SRH), and perceived stress. In total 4,606 responses were submitted during the 10-day study period between April 10 to April 20, 2020. After accounting for 558 cases who were unable to respond due to invalid email addresses, the adjusted response rate was 40.3%. Population weights based on age and gender distribution of the Estonian population were used to adjust for oversampling of youngest and oldest age groups and to compensate for the non-response. The study protocol was approved (no. 271, from April 8, 2020) by the Research Ethics Committee of the National Institute for Health Development.",

Also, the current stress prevalence is more than 2-fold compared with data from the previous economic recession in 2010 (17) . As economic recessions lead to rises in unemployment levels and reductions in staff and wages are correlated with an increase in mood disorders, anxiety, depression, and suicide (18) , it is very likely that both the direct epidemiological emergency and its wider social and economic consequences have already translated into an increase in mental health problems as suggested by a few recently published studies (19, 20) . The demographic patterning of stress indicates that some sociodemographic groups were more affected than others. Similarly to a recent study (21) , a distinct age gradient was found, with the highest stress being reported in the youngest age group, despite the evidence that COVID-19 presents a higher health risk for those aged 65 and older (22) . This also contradicts earlier evidence on the mental health effects of the economic crisis from Estonia in the late 2000's (23), when perceived depression had increased most in ages 35 and up. However, the causes and the consequences of both crises are very different. As the older generations have experienced stressful life events (e.g., the post war period, Soviet repression, the struggle for independence, and extreme economic difficulties during the 1990's) (24) , it is plausible that the current state of emergency with its unprecedented social distancing measures (25) could affect younger age groups the most. Such a negative psychological impact has also recently been demonstrated among undergraduates in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (26) . The gender differences in perceived stress found in our data are supported by earlier evidence that women are generally more vulnerable to stress-and fearbased disorders (27) . However, a range of other potential explanations could be relevant in the current context as well. Women more often work in healthcare, the service sector, and other high-risk occupations in the context of COVID-19. Several studies have shown higher levels of mental health problems in health care workers and in customer service during the current pandemic (28, 29) . Moreover, the school closures and social distancing measures could put additional strain on women due to increase in tasks related to childcare, housework and caring for the sick (30) . The higher stress prevalence seen in Estonians compared with other, mostly Russian-speaking ethnic groups is consistent with observed long-term trends in perceived stress and depression (17) . This could also suggest that the health communication during the current pandemic has not preferred the majority ethnic group over minorities.",

Similarly, those with average or poor SRH had 12% higher prevalence of excessive stress compared with respondents with good SRH. SRH is a valid estimate for overall health status that has strong predictive power for future health outcomes (32) .

However, some potential limitations of the study need to be addressed. First, the survey relied on a selfassessed, single-item measure of stress and anxiety. Although, it is not sufficient for a clinical diagnosis, it reflects the subjective presence of anxiety and stress-related complaints and allows comparisons with previous health surveys in Estonia. Second, due to the state of emergency, the survey was conducted using a web questionnaire only. Therefore, the representative sample of adults had to include only individuals with valid email addresses in the population registry database. Although, earlier studies (17) have shown that \u223c90% of individuals have valid email addresses in the population registry database, a potential selection bias cannot be fully excluded in our data. Third, the cross-sectional data do not allow us to establish causality per se. Despite this, the time anchoring of the dependent variable provides relevant estimates with respect to the time frame of the current the study. Moreover, the study protocol has been amended to allow additional data collection from the same sample, thus providing an opportunity for a longitudinal design in further studies. Fourth, due to the short data collection period, the response rate was modest (40.3%). Finally, despite the inclusion of different demographic, health-related, and behavioral variables, it is unlikely that the set of variables accounts for the total variance of the dependent variable. Thus, potential residual bias should be considered when interpreting the results. However, the large sample size and the use of population weights to reduce the potential non-response bias assure the representativeness of the data.",

Moreover, the long-term effects of current crisis are yet unknown.
