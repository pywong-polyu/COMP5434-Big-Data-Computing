            "text": "Although baicalein has been studied in various inflammation-related pathways, 20 how it interacts with inflammatory mediators is still largely unknown. A recent study reported that baicalein is a novel thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) inhibitor through binding to the N-terminal helix in TSLP to break the interaction between TSLP and TSLPR, inhibiting the TSLP/TSLPR signaling pathway. 21 TSLP is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine that acts as one of the central regulators of type 2 immunity and inflammatory diseases. 22 In response to various stimuli including microbial infection, mechanical injury, and endogenous cytokines, TSLP expression and release in epithelial cells are increased, 23 which in turn triggers the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, and TNF-\u03b1 of the innate and adaptive immunity, driving various pathological inflammation. [24] [25] [26] Notably, previous studies have shown that TSLP is involved in FK progression. Qingshan et al. reported that TSLP was highly expressed and secreted in Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) infected human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs), facilitating FK development via inducing caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis. 27 In addition, TSLP-activated dendritic cells could induce T helper type 2 (Th2) inflammation in mice with A. fumigatus keratitis. 28 Inhibition of TSLP could mitigate the severity of FK, and downregulate neutrophil infiltration and the expression of proinflammatory factors IL-6 and IL-8, controlling excessive inflammation caused by corneal injury, 29 which suggests TSLP could be a potential therapeutic target for FK treatment.",

Additionally, the membrane integrity was examined by PI staining, in which nucleic acids exposed from damaged or compromised membranes were stained by redfluorescent counterstain. An enhanced fluorescence intensity was observed in 0.25 mM baicalein-treated hyphae (Fig. 2M ) in comparison to the DMSO-treated group (Fig. 2L) , indicating baicalein may disrupt the membrane integrity of hyphae. Moreover, baicalein at 0.25mM significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of A. fumigatus at 48 hours (Fig. 2N) .

Compared with DMSO, baicalein treatment markedly reduced the ulcer area and corneal opacity, making the cornea more transparent (Fig. 3A) . Consistently, clinical scores in baicaleintreated groups were much lower than DMSO-treated groups (Fig. 3B) , which suggested baicalein treatment can improve the prognosis of mice with FK. In addition, plate count results showed that baicalein treatment significantly reduced the fungal load in A. fumigatus infected corneas in comparison to DMSO at five days p.i. (Fig. 3C) . We then examined whether baicalein treatment could affect neutrophil infiltration and activity using immunofluorescence and MPO assay. Compared with DMSO, baicalein treatment not only reduced the number of infiltrated neutrophils in the infected corneal stroma (Figs. 3D, E) , but also inhibited MPO activity level in corneas at three days p.i. (Fig. 3F) . Thus, baicalein may mitigate the severity of FK in mice with A. fumigatus keratitis through decreasing fungal load and inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and activity. MPO activity in baicalein-treated group was much lower than DMSO group at three days p.i. (F). All data are mean \u00b1 SEM, in which clinical scores were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test, and other data were analyzed by an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test (n = 6/group/isolate, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).",

Neutrophil infiltration is known to be essential in innate response against fungal infection, 50 promoting the release of various cytokines and chemokines to further attract immune cells to eliminate pathogens. However, the large number of proinflammatory factors and toxic substances released by neutrophils may result in continuous inflammation that causes cornea damage, even vision loss. 51 Thus, limiting the excessive inflammatory response is of significance for FK treatment. In the present study, we showed that baicalein treatment markedly mitigated the severity of FK in mice by reducing the ulcer area and corneal opacity, making corneas more transparent, which suggested baicalein may improve the prognosis of FK not only through inhibiting fungal load, but also via suppressing inflammatory response. Baicalein has been demonstrated to possess an anti-inflammatory effect in diverse diseases via various mechanisms. [52] [53] [54] For instance, baicalein inhibited LPSenhanced neutrophil infiltration and MPO activity to protect rats from acute lung injury. 53 Moreover, baicalein alleviated acute pancreatitis-caused pathological injury through dampening the NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and STAT3 signaling pathways. 55 Chen et al. reported that baicalein treatment improved histological and functional outcomes of traumatic brain .

TSLP knockdown reduced DC aggregation, maturation, and migration, and repressed Th2-attracting chemokines and cytokines to attenuate the inflammatory response in A. fumigatus-infected corneas, and alleviating the severity of FK. 28 In contrast, pretreatment of exoge-nous TSLP with A. fumigatus resulted in severe keratitis with increased neutrophil infiltration and higher levels of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, IL-6, and IL-8. 29 TLRs are located on the cell surface, recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to initiate antimicrobial immune responses. 59 Our previous studies have shown A. fumigatus infection induced an elevated expression of TLRs, 37, 60 and TLR-dependent induction of TSLP has been confirmed in HCECs in response to microbial components, 29,58 which provides evidence for the TLRs mediated cross-talk between FK and TSLP.",

Our study demonstrated that baicalein not only inhibited A. fumigatus-induced overexpression of TSLP and TSLPR in mouse corneas, but also alleviated TSLP secretion to corneal epithelium and stroma. Similar results were obtained in corneal epithelial cells, in which baicalein inhibited the upregulated expression of TSLP in A. fumigatus-infected HCECs. These results indicate baicalein may exert its anti-inflammatory activity through inhibiting the TSLP/TSLPR signaling pathway. To further understand the regulatory role of baicalein on the TSLP/TSLPR pathway, HCECs were pretreated with TSLP siRNA or rTSLP followed by A. fumigatus infection. The rTSLP-induced upregulated TSLP partially counteracted the inhibitory effect of baicalein on the expression of TSLP. Additionally, the mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly lower in the TSLP siRNA-treated group, while higher in the rTSLPtreated group than in the corresponding control, indicating the involvement of TSLP in A. fumigatus-induced inflammatory response. Notably, baicalein treatment significantly inhibited rTSLP-induced overexpression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. These results suggested that baicalein suppresses A. fumigatus-induced inflammatory response by inhibiting TSLP/TSLPR signaling.",
