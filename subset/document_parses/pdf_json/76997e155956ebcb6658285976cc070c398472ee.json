The problem is structured as an optimal control system for tracking a reference value, corresponding to the maximum usage level of a critical resource, such as ICU beds. However, instead of using conventional optimal control methods, RL is used to find optimal control policies. A framework was developed to calculate optimal cyclic lockdown timings using an RL-based on-off controller. The RL-based controller is implemented as an RL agent that interacts with an epidemic simulator, implemented as an extended SEIR epidemic model. The RL agent learns a policy function that produces an optimal sequence of open/lockdown decisions such that goals specified in the RL reward function are optimized. Two concurrent goals were used: the first one is a public health goal that minimizes overshoots of ICU bed usage above an ICU bed threshold, and the second one is a socioeconomic goal that minimizes the time spent under lockdowns. It is assumed that cyclic lockdowns are considered as a temporary alternative to extended lockdowns when a region faces imminent danger of overpassing resource capacity limits and when imposing an extended lockdown would cause severe social and economic consequences due to lack of necessary economic resources to support its affected population during an extended lockdown.",

As originally described in [2] and [3] , cyclic lockdowns are a control method in the epidemic control toolbox. During the first phase of the pandemic, stringent combinations of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) were applied by governments to slow down the exponential spread of the disease and reduce epidemic indicators to low values. We assume a lockdown is the combination of multiple NPIs, including stay-athome orders, school closures, and business closures, and that these NPIs are applied and released together. Across the world lockdown measures have generally been very successful and have helped save millions of lives as discussed in [4] and [5] . However, lockdowns have high economic and social costs, so in some regions it may be unsustainable to leave them in place for very long intervals, pressing governments to reduce restrictions. Yet the risk of new epidemic waves becomes high if the degree of unprotected social interaction increases too much during opening phases, which would require new deployment of lockdowns.",

Cyclic lockdowns can be used to buy time to strengthen other critical processes needed to control the epidemic, including testing, contact tracing, isolation facilities, hiring of necessary medical teams, expanding medical equipment stockpiles, and deploying unified and effective community education programs on required social practices, including use of masks and distancing.",

The tool comprises a simulation and optimization framework that integrates a dynamic epidemic model with an RL control agent. The tool helps answer questions such as: when would the first lockdown occur, what is the percentage of time spent in open and in lockdown mode, what is the average length in days for both the open and closed segments, and what is the maximum effective reproduction number [7] , , that would avoid lockdowns.",

The fixed rule applies a lockdown when the ICU beds in use exceeds a high ICU bed threshold and releases the lockdown when the ICU beds in use goes below a low ICU bed threshold. This approach has two disadvantages: on the one hand, it can cause very large ICU bed usage spikes that sometimes exceed the total ICU bed capacity and on the other hand it produces long lockdown cycles. We refer to this basic method as the baseline on/off control method and contrast our solution with it. Our implementation of the baseline on/off control method used the same value for both the high and low ICU bed threshold.",

The input control action is the epidemic's effective reproduction number [7] , , which can only take two values, for example 1.5 (open) or 0.7 (lockdown). This type of on/off control is also referred to as bang-bang control. Instead of using conventional optimal control methods to find an optimal control policy function for , we use RL as described in [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] . In contrast to conventional optimal control, RL does not require a model of the target system dynamics. With RL, a control policy function can be learned by an RL control agent interacting directly with the target system or with a simulator. In this case, although a dynamic model of the epidemic is available, it is used as a simulator and is decoupled from the RL control agent. This provides significant flexibility to modify either the simulation model or the RL control agent with minimal or no impact on each other. ",

A basic reward function (or cost function when minimizing) for a tracking problem is to use the ICU error value defined as the difference between number of ICU beds in use and the ICU bed threshold to produce a shaped reward, meaning that the higher the error the lower the reward (higher penalty) as expressed in rule (1).

Figures 3 to 6 illustrate the results of these experiments. Each of the figures has two rows of graphs. The first row (a, b, c) corresponds to a simulation of the epidemic with as the input control signal generated by the RL agent. The second row (d, e, f) corresponds to a simulation run with as the input control signal generated by the baseline on/off feedback control method. The first graph in each row shows the number of currently infected persons, I(t), which is used as the RL agent's state variable, the second graph shows the number of occupied ICU beds, ICU(t), and the third graph shows the daily value of the control input . A low , ( ) RSNTP-, indicates lockdown conditions and a high , ( ) NOPQ , indicates open conditions. All of the simulations were done over a time span of 270 days, except for ( ) NOPQ = 1.1, which was done for 365 days. As seen in figures 3.b -6.b, the RL agent succeeds in closely tracking the ICU bed threshold reference value with minimal or no overshoot in every case. In contrast, overshoot values with the baseline on/off feedback control method are very high for ( ) NOPQ values above 1.1. With ( ) NOPQ = 1.7, the maximum overshoot value is 3,520 (Fig. 3e) , or 176% the total ICU capacity of 2,000. With ( ) NOPQ = 1.5 the maximum overshoot value is 2,848 (Fig. 4e) , or 142% of the total ICU capacity. With ( ) NOPQ = 1.3 the maximum overshoot value is 2,100 (Fig. 5e) , or 105% of the total ICU capacity. High overshoots with baseline on/off control occur because the epidemic is a dynamic system with inertia in its response to inputs at the system's stages (compartments in the SEIR model). This inertia is caused by response delays to inputs in each of the stages. In the case of ICU beds in use, ICU(t), which is equal to 30% of H(t), requires any change in the input = ( ) to propagate through the Exposed, Infected, and Severe compartments (see Figure 2 ) which results in a combined lag of h j + h K + h z , which is equal to 11 days based on the model parameters used as listed in Table 1 . This means that if a lockdown input is applied, it will only start causing a decrease in ICU(t) at least 11 days after the lockdown starts. During this lag interval, ICU(t) will continue to grow at an exponential rate dependent on = ( ). This explains the large increases in offshoots with the baseline on/off control method as ( ) NOPQ increases.",

This results in an ICU(t) signal with small oscillations around the ICU limit reference value. The required on/off control signal to produce small ICU(t) oscillations needs to have much shorter cycles than cycles in the control signal generated with baseline on/off control or some other blunt control method. The RL agent does learn a policy that produces shorter cycles and its open/closed segment lengths are optimal according to the epidemic model state. The key patterns to highlight with RL-based cyclic lockdowns are first, that as the level of virus spread increases, represented by an increase in NOPQ , the control policy generates shorter open segment lengths to reduce transmission. The second pattern is that, except for ( ) NOPQ = 1.1, the total cycle lengths for each NOPQ level are almost the same, between 9 and 10 days and what changes is the open/closed ratio. The total cycle length value depends on the parameters of the epidemic model (compartment delays) and the NOPQ level. We observed two bands in NOPQ levels: ( ) NOPQ \u2264 1.1 and ( ) NOPQ > 1.1. These two bands result from the exponential growth characteristics of the epidemic and its model.

However, in addition to the technical control reasons for using short lockdown cycles there are economic and social reasons to favor short lockdown cycles versus long and stringent lockdowns. Long lockdowns cause severe negative impact on the economy, especially in regions where governments don't have the economic strength to provide adequate help to citizens and businesses affected by the lockdown. Short cyclic lockdowns, as discussed in [6] , reduce the negative economic impact because most businesses and informal economic activity could continue functioning by adapting to the short lockdown intervals.",

Then, the ICU limit value is selected and with these three values as inputs, a new policy model is trained and saved. The RL-agent, then loads the trained policy model and runs it with the simulator for an episode length in days that results in multiple lockdown cycles. Data is recorded as in figures 3c-6c. The policy signal produced by the RL agent is used to obtain the average lengths of the open and closed segments of a lockdown cycle. These segment lengths are used by a region's government to set up a lockdown plan over multiple cycles.",

This can be determined by comparing ( ) XR/YXS measured in the field with the calculated average , RXSR . If ( ) XR/YXS is lower, then a new ( ) NOPQ can be calculated with equation (5), a new policy model trained, and new open/closed segment lengths are obtained. When ( ) NOPQ decreases, the open/close segment times ratio increases. We refer to this pattern as downward staircase, because repeating it enables a stepwise reduction in the percentage of time closed. When reaching ( ) XR/YXS = 0.8 or lower, ( ) NOPQ obtained with equation (5) is 1.0 or lower, which indicates the epidemic is no longer expanding or is contracting, if the value is lower than 1.0, and therefore there is no longer need to perform lockdowns. In summary, the downward staircase approach can be used to evolve from short lockdown segments at high ( ) NOPQ levels to shorter lockdowns at lower ( ) NOPQ levels and eventually to ( ) NOPQ levels where no lockdowns are required.",

Under these circumstances, temporary cyclic lockdowns could be used as a bridge method to buy time for improving other processes needed to control the epidemic. When used in conjunction with other methods to reduce the virus spread, cyclic lockdowns can be applied in a downward staircase approach that helps to reduce ( ) NOPQ to safe levels close to or lower than 1.0.",

The other area is finding optimal controllers for the cyclic lockdown problem using conventional optimal control methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and comparing them with the RL-based solution.",
