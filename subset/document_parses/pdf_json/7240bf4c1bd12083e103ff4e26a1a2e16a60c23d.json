However, challenges remain in making data widely available, accessible, and useful towards improving population health. While traditional, government-supported data sources and comparable data are most often used to characterize social determinants, there are still capacity and management constraints on data availability and use. Conversely, privately held data may not be shared. This study reviews and discusses the nature, sources, and uses of data on SDH, with illustrations from two middle-income countries: Kenya and the Philippines. and scientific publications on social determinants using a search strategy in PubMed and a manual snowball search. We assessed data sources and the data environment in both Kenya and the Philippines. We found limited evidence of the use of new sources of data to study the wider SDH, as most of the studies available used traditional sources. There was also no evidence of qualitative big data being used. Kenya has more publications using new data sources, except on the labor determinant, than the Philippines. The Philippines has a more consistent distribution of the use of new data sources across the HEALTHY determinants than Kenya, where there is greater variation of the number of publications across determinants. The results suggest that both countries use limited SDH data from new data sources. This limited use could be due to a number of factors including the absence of standardized indicators of SDH, inadequate trust and acceptability of data collection methods, and limited infrastructure to pool, analyze, and translate data.",

There is the issue of availability; frequently, data are collected on paper, are in unintelligible formats, or are stored without direct or open access [10] . Furthermore, data sharing may not be valued or prioritized across sectors, national or international organizations, and academia. Fragile countries may have only minimal data collection resources, including infrastructure, which means that there are still a number of LMICs that are not following international standards for data collection and management and that not all have quality controls in place [11, 12] . This may be due to outdated laws or lack of national oversight agencies in those countries.",

            "text": "One of the limits in the use of new data sources in Kenya is the apparent lack of support from the government. The Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI) only shares official, not crowd-sourced or other type of data, while initiatives from different private organizations using other new data sources are not consolidated under a single state institution or program [34] . Limited governmental support also affects implementation and continuity of independent initiatives. Two such examples are given. First, Uwezo's annual, citizen-led assessments of the education system was originally supported by the Ministry of Education [35] , but these assessments ended in 2015 and were replaced by surveys [36] . Second, the Datashift study [35] claimed data were citizen-generated, but data collection was actually based on a scorecard filled out by parents. All this may explain why even a recent study [37] on fast internet in relation to employment does not use any new data sources and relies strictly on surveys [37] .",

Although we attempted to gather as many data sources as possible on HEALTHY determinants for each country, private sector data are not publicly available. In addition, the search concentrated on the application and use of data sources, not on conceptual models or proposals. Second, our study does not articulate the causal pathways and relationships that exist between the HEALTHY determinants and health. The relationship between these determinants and health is explored in the existing literature base that examines the association between a specific determinant and health. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, we assume as a given that the HEALTHY determinants do matter for health. Third, while for the most part the data sources are mutually exclusive, it is not always the case. For instance, citizen-generated data comes from a mix of several different sources. We have included it as a \"new\" data source because it is nontraditional in its involvement of CSOs and NGOs in data collection. Fourth, we did not assess the quality of the studies. Fifth, since the use of new data sources is relatively recent, the field is not yet developed to describe the full extent of their variety or to properly index them to allow for easy discovery. Finally, the lack of global SDH indicators and indexing descriptors may influence the amount of research in the field, and thus the search findings. WHO's SCORE initiative to standardize country health data does not include SDH measures and a proposal on indicators of government action on SDH is yet to be adopted. Similarly, only one region-Latin American-has expanded the variety of SDH descriptors to index publications [47, 48] . Therefore, our findings may not necessarily reflect the full amount of relevant studies that have been conducted.",

On the one hand, there is a limited number of standardized indicators of new data sources and SDH, and their corresponding search descriptors, which do not truly encapsulate their variety. On the other, the use of new sources on SDH is still in an incipient stage in the exemplar countries of this study.",

However, a lack for a global initiative towards reaching consensus also suggests we may expect delays in new sources of data on SDH being more adequately indexed. In addition, publications in journals from data informatics and related fields that are not indexed as SDH literature may hold a wealth of information on SDH that are not being leveraged. It is crucial that attention is directed toward making studies and their insights more readily accessible and thus applicable to decision-making and further research.",

It is important to stress that standardizing global measures for cross-country comparisons does not preclude the importance of contextualizing the use of new data sources to address information gaps according to the needs and conditions of a country.",
