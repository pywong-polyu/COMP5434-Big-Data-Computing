The surveys were pretested on educational leadership including content review and cognitive interviewing. Afterward, they were piloted using convenience sampling of ultrasound section faculty and residents at a single institution. The final surveys for learners and faculty included 20 and 18 questions, respectively (Supplemental Digital Appendices 2 and 3, at http:// links.lww.com/ACADMED/B182 and http://links.lww.com/ACADMED/ B183). Both surveys included questions about participant demographic characteristics (e.g., region of the country, year in training or practice), engagement, confidence in ability to acquire and interpret images, and satisfaction with ADAPT. The faculty survey also asked the amount of time spent in weekly preparation before and after curricular implementation. Surveys were sent by email on the last day of each month. We gave respondents 1 month to complete the survey and sent reminders biweekly. No incentives were offered for completion. This prospective, educational intervention research was reviewed and granted exempt status by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board. We collected deidentified data using the web-based database Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). Survey data were reported using descriptive statistics. Chi-squared tests were used to evaluate for differences in learner comfort in acquiring and interpreting images among those who did and did not perform clinical scanning. A Wilcoxon signedrank test was used to compare educator hours dedicated with ultrasound teaching before and after the intervention. We performed all quantitative analyses using Stata statistical software, version 16.1/IC (StataCorp TM, College Station, Texas).",

Designed to replace EM POCUS rotations during the COVID-19 pandemic, ADAPT is distinguished by preparatory work, virtual sessions, supplemental learning for learners, and teleguidance. During traditional image review, learner ultrasound images are reviewed asynchronously by faculty and comments are provided post hoc, creating limited opportunity for teaching and learning real-time image optimization. With teleguidance, learners scan themselves or others while an educator observes and provides live feedback on techniques and interpretation, allowing robust and personalized learning.
