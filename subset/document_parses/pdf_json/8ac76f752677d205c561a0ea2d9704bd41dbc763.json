            "text": "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the third zoonotic coronavirus identified in the last twenty years. Previously, four other known coronaviruses moved from animal reservoirs into humans and now cause primarily mild-to-moderate respiratory disease. The emergence of these viruses likely involved a period of intense transmission before becoming endemic, highlighting the recurrent threat to human health posed by animal coronaviruses. Enzootic and epizootic coronaviruses of diverse lineages pose a significant threat to livestock, as most recently observed for virulent strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and swine acute diarrhea-associated coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Unique to RNA viruses, coronaviruses encode a proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) that lowers point mutation rates to increase the viability of large RNA virus genomes, which comes with the cost of limiting virus adaptation via point mutation. This limitation can be overcome by high rates of recombination that facilitate rapid increases in genetic diversification. To compare dynamics of recombination between related sequences, we developed an open-source computational workflow (IDPlot) to measure nucleotide identity, locate recombination breakpoints, and infer phylogenetic relationships. We analyzed recombination dynamics among three groups of coronaviruses with impacts on livestock or human health: SARSr-CoV, Betacoronavirus-1, and SADSr-CoV. We found that all three groups undergo recombination with highly diverged viruses, disrupting phylogenetic relationships and revealing contributions of unknown coronavirus lineages to the genetic diversity of established groups. Dynamic patterns of recombination impact inferences of relatedness between diverse coronaviruses and expand the genetic pool that may contribute to future zoonotic events. These results illustrate the limitations of current sampling approaches for anticipating zoonotic threats to human and animal health.",

            "text": "In the 21 st century alone three zoonotic coronaviruses have caused widespread human infection: SARS-CoV in 2002 [1] , MERS-CoV in 2012 [2] , and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 [3] . Four other coronaviruses, OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 are endemic in humans and cause mild-tomoderate respiratory disease with low fatality rates, though they may cause outbreaks of severe disease in vulnerable populations [4] [5] [6] [7] . Like SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, these endemic viruses emerged from animal reservoirs. The origins of 229E and NL63 have been convincingly linked to bats, much like the 21 st century novel coronaviruses [8] [9] [10] . In a striking parallel, both MERS-CoV and 229E appear to have emerged from bats into camelids, established a new persistent reservoir, and then spilled over into humans [11] [12] [13] [14] . In contrast, the viral lineages that include OC43 and HKU1 originated in rodents [15, 16] , though very limited rodent sampling leaves us with a poor understanding of deep evolutionary history of these viruses. Given the short infectious period of human coronavirus infections, the establishment of endemicity was likely preceded by a period of intense and widespread transmission on regional or global scales. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is likely the fifth widespread coronavirus epidemic or pandemic involving a still-circulating virus, though the severity of the previous four cannot be reliably ascertained.",

In all three groups, we found clear evidence of frequent recombination resulting in closely related viruses exhibiting a high degree of divergence in discrete genomic regions. Recombination was particularly enriched around and within the spike gene. Across all three groups, recombination has occurred with uncharacterized coronaviruses lineages, indicating that coronavirus diversity remains considerably under-sampled and that rapid adaptations due to recombination may have unpredictable consequences for human and/or animal health. The potential for viruses to rapidly acquire novel phenotypes through such recombination events underscores the importance of a more robust and coordinated ecological, public health, and research response to the ongoing pandemic threat of coronaviruses.",

GARD uses DAIC-c to indicate the degree of fit improvement afforded by successive iterations, and this graph allows the user to easily determine when improvements become increasingly marginal, which is often accompanied by prediction of spurious breakpoints. Upon selection of a GARD iteration, the display switches to show the associated phylogenetic trees ( Figure 2E ).

However, this singularly consequential lineage remains under-sampled and its evolutionary history largely obscured. Most attention on these viruses to date has focused on the recent evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 with respect to Using IDPlot, we did not uncover evidence in support of the idea that SARS-CoV-2 arose via recombination, consistent with previously published work [38] . RaTG13 shows consistently high identity across the genome with the only notable dip comprising the receptorbinding domain in the C-terminal region of spike S1 (Figure 3A) , which is proposed to originate via either recombination or diversifying selection [38] . However, the limited sampling in the SARS-CoV-2-like lineage results in weak phylogenetic signals unable to distinguish between rapid mutational divergence and recombination producing the low ANI in the RaTG13 receptor binding domain. [43] and Orf8 deletions have been identified in numerous SARS-CoV-2 isolates as well [44] [45] [46] . In bat SARSr-CoVs intact Orf8 is typically though not always present but exhibits a high degree of phylogenetic incongruence. Additionally, the progenitor of SARS-CoV encoded an Orf8 gene gained by recombination [28, 47] .

Due to the apparent low virulence of OC43 and limited sampling of the lineage, these viruses receive relatively little attention outside agricultural research. However, this lineage has produced a highly transmissible human virus, can cause severe disease in vulnerable adults, and is poorly sampled [4] . An ancestral BCoV is believed to be the progenitor of the other currently recognized BetaCoV1 viruses with divergence dates estimated at 100-150 years ago for OC43/PHEV [48] and 50 years ago for HKU23 [49] . Recombination with other betacoronaviruses has been previously described for HKU23, so we excluded it from our analysis [50] . The closest outgroup to BetaCoV1, rabbit coronavirus HKU14 (RbCoV/HKU14) was reported to group closely with ECoV in some regions [51] , but no detailed recombination analysis of the relationship between these viruses has been previously described.",

Previous genomic characterization of ECoV suggested that it is the most divergent member of BetaCoV1 based on nucleotide identity and phylogenetic positioning of full-length Orf1ab. However, in the >10 kilobase Region 3 that accounts for ~1/3 of the entire genome ( Figure 4A ) ECoV exhibits the highest nucleotide identity to BCoV in our dataset (98.5%) (Figure 4A, S4D) , which is inconsistent with it having diverged earlier than OC43 and PHEV. The latter viruses are estimated to have shared a common ancestor with BCoV 100-150 years ago [48] , suggesting that all of the observed ECoV recombination has occurred more recently. Our discovery of recombinant regions of unknown origin suggest that unsampled viral lineages have occupied overlapping ecological niches with ECoV and presumably continue to circulate. Basal members of the subgenus that includes BetaCoV1 have been identified exclusively in rodents ( Figure   1B) , suggesting they are a natural reservoir for these viruses. Although relatively little attention has been directed to these viruses, studies of BCoV and ECoV cross-neutralization suggest population immunity to OC43 may provide only limited protection against infection mediated by these novel spikes [52] . Although no recent zoonotic infections from this lineage have been documented, the genomic collision of these viruses with yet-undiscovered viruses may warrant a reassessment of their potential to diversify the pool of potential pandemic coronaviruses.",

This automates and streamlines multi-step analysis with few barriers to use. Nevertheless, there are opportunities for further improvement. Analysis of recombination breakpoints implemented in GARD are of limited value for resolving unique breakpoints in close proximity, as observed surrounding and within SADSr-CoV and other spike genes, necessitating the use of small sets of sequences. Second, GARD is computationally intensive. It is configured as an optional step in IDPlot, so multiple sequence alignments and nucleotide identity plots can be rapidly generated in a local environment. However, for GARD analysis we relied on a high-performance computing cluster to expedite the process. In the future, we anticipate adding other, less intensive breakpoint prediction algorithms to the IDPlot options menu. Future advances in computational methods may also improve the ability to resolve unique breakpoints clustered in genomic regions that are recombination hotspots, most notably the spike gene.",

The relatedness of these viruses means they have had little time to diverge via mutation, but we find they are rapidly diversifying due to recombination, acquiring spike and accessory genes from unsampled viral lineages. These findings demonstrate that rather than a single threat to human health posed by SADS-CoV, there is a highly diverse reservoir of such viruses in an ecological position and with diversity reminiscent of SARSr-CoVs. We found a similar dynamic at play among BetaCoV1 which are under-sampled to an even greater degree and receive far less attention.

Our ability to anticipate threats from both groups would benefit from additional sampling, with BetaCoV1 being particularly undersampled. Increased surveillance at wildlife-livestock interfaces, including agricultural workers is needed for early detection of novel viruses coming into contact with humans. Due to recombination, prior infection with a virus such as OC43 cannot be presumed to be protective against even closely related viruses that can encode highly divergent spikes, as demonstrated in our analysis.
