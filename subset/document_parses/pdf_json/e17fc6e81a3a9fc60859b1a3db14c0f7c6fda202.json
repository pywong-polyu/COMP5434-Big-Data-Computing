Many new public safety rules were created in response to COVID-19, including mandated FM wearing in some youth sports like youth ice hockey. We hypothesized that FM wearing in youth hockey players obstructs the lower field of view and may impact safety. Youth hockey players (n = 33) aged 12.03 (1.6) years button press when they saw an LED on the floor turn on in two conditions (wearing FM or no FM) in random order. An interleaved one-up/one-down two-alternative-forced-choice adaptive staircase design was used. Visual thresholds were calculated for each condition and participant. The visual angle threshold (VAT) was determined using standing eye height and the linear distance from the tip of the skates to the visual threshold. Paired t-tests determined whether mask wearing changed the VAT. We modeled the probability a player could see the puck on their stick in four distinct scenarios to estimate the potential impact of FM wearing during hockey play. The average unmasked VAT (11.4 degrees) was significantly closer to the skates than the masked VAT (20.3 degrees) (p < 0.001). Our model indicated a significant reduction in ability to visualize the puck using peripheral vision when more upright while wearing a FM. FM wearing compromised their lower visual field, suggesting a downward head tilt may be necessary to see the puck. Playing ice hockey while wearing a FM may lead to unsafe on-ice playing conditions due to downward head tilt to see the puck.",

Vaccine distribution has begun and most adults and teenagers (but not children under 12) are eligible to receive the vaccine in the US (Centers for Disease Control Prevention, 2021) . Several studies have demonstrated that policies of universal masking contribute to preventing the spread of COVID-19 (Hendrix et al., 2020; Payne et al., 2020; Van Dyke et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend mask wearing for non-vaccinated individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and many institutions continue to have mask mandates, especially for non-vaccinated individuals. With the emergence of contagious variants, considerations other than disease transmission are relevant to decisions about universal masking in youth sports. This is highly relevant as winter approaches and there is a greater emphasis on indoor sports that were largely cancelled or required athletes to wear masks during play (Dergaa et al., 2021) .",

Restricting the peripheral visual field increased reaction times and has been linked to reduced overall sports performance in football and downhill skiing (Loopeker and Rowley, 2001; Ruedl et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2019) . Blocking the lower visual field promotes downward head tilt, which reduces how far ahead obstacles can be detected (Timmis and Buckley, 2012) . Blocking the lower visual field during walking may lead to a trip or fall. Obstruction of the lower visual field related to wearing a facemask may worsen balance for people with higher fall risk (Kal et al., 2020; Klatt and Anson, 2021) . Another arena where facemask wearing may have detrimental consequences related to increased risk for injury is the sport of ice hockey. Ice hockey was designated as a \"moderate or high-risk\" sport related to the potential for COVID-19 spread in several US states, and rules were developed for players/coaches/officials to wear facemasks (Maine Department of Economic Comminuty Development, 2021; MinnesotaHockey, 2021) . In some cases, wearing facemasks was mandated for any on-ice hockey activities at all age levels. However, not all states/countries adopted this mandate for players. Although most early evidence suggests that healthy individuals are only mildly impacted while wearing a FM during exercise (Shaw et al., 2020; Hopkins et al., 2021; Mapelli et al., 2021; Shein et al., 2021) , others have reported significant reductions in respiratory capacity in healthy adults L\u00e4ssing et al., 2020; Driver et al., 2021) . To date the impact of mask wearing on aspects of exercise or sports participation, such as player safety, has received little attention.",

            "text": "Ice hockey players wearing a FM may have reduced lower field of view and to facilitate seeing the puck may need to tilt their head down. Tilting the head downward reduces the \"look ahead\" window, effectively shortening the reaction time for contact avoidance (Patla and Vickers, 2003) . In fast moving contact sports like ice hockey, not being able to see your opponent soon enough because of downward head tilt may lead to more frequent body contact/checking which is the most common cause of player injury (Brust et al., 1992; Emery et al., 2011; Brenner et al., 2014; Mosenthal et al., 2017; Simmons et al., 2017) . The Hockey Equipment Certification Counsel Inc. promotes an education program titled \"Heads-Up, Don't Duck\" to specifically create awareness of the increased risk of cervical spine injuries when looking downward (HECC). Therefore, a scenario where ice hockey players tilt their head downward to play the puck due to a restricted lower visual field (from wearing a facemask while playing), may lead to unsafe on-ice conditions. Although it has long been known that blocking the lower visual field impairs walking ability (Marigold et al., 2007; Marigold and Patla, 2008) and reaction times in football and alpine skiing (Ruedl et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2019) , the extent to which wearing a mask blocks the lower field of view in the context of ice hockey is unknown. Here we report on whether mask wearing in youth hockey players significantly restricts their lower field of view. We hypothesized that youth ice hockey players would experience a significant reduction in the lower visual field when wearing a facemask. We additionally modeled the relationship between the FM induced reduction in the lower visual field and the ability to see a puck on their stick. We hypothesized that wearing a facemask would impair the ability of youth hockey players to use peripheral vision to see a puck on their stick.",

If required to wear a mask they indicated who provided the mask for them to use. Finally, participants who reported wearing a mask during practice or game play were asked, \"Do you feel you have to look down more with the mask on to see the puck than when you do not wear a mask?\" While wearing their hockey skates standing height, standing eye height, hockey stance eye height, and distance from the tip of their skates to the toe and heel of their stick were measured for all players except goalies.

This distance was determined to be achievable but sufficiently challenging to require continuous visual attention in early piloting. Participants were tested in two conditions (wearing a facemask or no facemask) in random order determined by a coin flip. Each condition consisted of 60 trials (paired audio cues and responses). An interleaved 2AFC adaptive staircase design was used with 30 trials per staircase (Levitt, 1971) . Each staircase included five trials with auditory cues intentionally paired with the LED remaining off to check for task attention (trials 3, 9, 17, 21, 25 for the descending staircase and 2, 10, 16, 22, 27 for the ascending staircase). The remaining 25 cues presented synchronous auditory and visual (LED) cues. The auditory cues were 300 ms 200 Hz tones from the internal speakers of the data acquisition computer at maximum volume (Dell Lattitude 7400, Dell, Inc.). The visual cues were white light LEDs turned on for a 200 ms duration. This supra-threshold stimulus duration was twice that needed for a visual discrimination task (Croker and Maratos, 2011) . We opted for a brief but supra-threshold visual stimulus as the hockey puck is never invisible. The inter-trial interval varied randomly between 1.5 and 2.5 seconds.",

The binary data (no = 0, yes = 1) were bootstrapped with 100 replications and fit to a psychometric curve. The mean of the bootstrapped psychometric fits was calculated as the threshold (in units of LEDs) for each condition and participant and corresponded to the 50% point of subjective equality (Levitt, 1971; Roditi and Crane, 2012) . The visual angle threshold was determined using standing eye height and the linear distance from the tip of the skates to the LED threshold. A paired t-test determined whether mask wearing changed the visual angle threshold. Hockey stance visual angle was determined using hockey stance eye height and the midpoint of the stick blade for all non-goalie players. To estimate the potential impact of mask wearing during hockey play, we modeled the probability a player would see the puck in several simulated conditions using Solver (Frontline Systems, Inc.). We created four normally distributed simulation models bootstrapped on the collected empirical data (mean and standard deviation). We ran 10,000 replications for each simulation. The four models used the visual angle threshold with mask and without mask as well as the calculated visual angle from eye height of the subject standing upright and in hockey stance with respect to the distance between the skates and the middle of the hockey stick. The models were run with logic, pairing conditions together to resemble four distinct possible outcomes simulating hockey playing: (1) masked paired with upright height (least ideal scenario), (2) unmasked paired with hockey stance height (most ideal scenario), (3) unmasked paired with upright height, and (4) masked paired with hockey stance height. Alpha was specified for each statistical comparison as \u03b1 = 0.05 as they were considered independent questions.",

Although not surprising, to our knowledge this has not previously been demonstrated in youth hockey players. These thresholds suggest that in a \"heads-up\" hockey stance, the lower visual field angular thresholds would allow most if not all tested players to visualize their stick blade only when not wearing a mask. When wearing a facemask, the fraction of time that the puck would be visible in the peripheral field of view is significantly reduced. Four of the non-goalie participants had a masked visual angle threshold larger than the visual angle from the eyes to the middle of the stick blade while in a hockey stance. Those four individuals would not be able to use peripheral vision to see the puck on the stick blade while skating with a mask on. Thus, to visualize the puck on the stick players must tilt their head down rather than relying on peripheral vision.",

It is unlikely that players maintain the exact hockey position height while in play on the ice. Our model conservatively accounts for this by examining the frequency the puck would not be visible given masking and stance criteria while holding the stick placement relative to the skates constant. While masked we expect the players to be able to see the puck using peripheral vision roughly 96% while in their hockey stance. The probability of seeing the puck when more upright is reduced to about 80%. Often during game play players skate in a more upright position than the hockey stance which is more analogous to the non-skating face off position. An important caveat to the interpretation of these models is that if the stick is not perfectly straight out in front of a masked player, the masked player may have to look down more often as the visual angle will shift closer to the visual threshold. Similarly, if the puck was held to the player's side the distance between puck and player would be shortened, further reducing visibility. Although we employed a conservative model to more closely link the visual angle thresholds to skating performance, additional studies are needed to examine on ice performance including both maintaining puck possession and avoiding body contact while masked.",

            "text": "Overall, the combined visual threshold results and modeling suggest that youth hockey players wearing facemasks would need to adopt head-down behaviors more frequently to see the puck. Head-down positioning increases the chance for player-to-player collision which is the primary cause of on-ice injury (Brenner et al., 2014; Black et al., 2016; Simmons et al., 2017) . Restricted peripheral vision has been shown to reduce reaction times for visual targets detection (Miller et al., 2019) . Hockey players with only slightly obstructed visual fields from protective equipment (face cages and face shields) also demonstrate slower reaction times to visual targets (Ing et al., 2002; Dowler et al., 2009) . Increased oculomotor variability for target tracking and gaze shifting was associated with more frequent high acceleration collision impacts in youth ice hockey (Kiefer et al., 2018) . The current results suggest that the on-ice use of FM in youth hockey may increase the risk for on-ice injury. The current results do not address potential for disease transmission during play, but highlight a previously unknown risk to player safety that has relevance to universal masking during participation in youth ice hockey. Ice hockey players appear to be special case population such that facemask wearing during participation may have unintentional effects that increase risk for injury.",
