This scoping review aimed to map the existing literature that examines self-management in people affected by cancer who were post-treatment from rural and urban areas. Methods Arksey and O'Malley's framework for conducting a scoping review was utilised. Keyword searches were performed in the following: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. Supplementary searching activities were also conducted. Results A total of 438 articles were initially retrieved and 249 duplicates removed leaving 192 articles that were screened by title, abstract and full text. Nine met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. They were published from 2011 to 2018 and conducted in the USA (n = 6), Australia (n = 2) and Canada (n = 1). None of the studies offered insight into self-managing cancer within a rural-urban context in the UK. Studies used qualitative (n = 4), mixed methods (n = 4) and quantitative designs (n = 1). Conclusion If rural and urban populations define their health in different ways as some of the extant literature suggests, then efforts to support self-management in both populations will need to be better informed by robust evidence given the increasing focus on patient-centred care.

Self-monitoring can be considered a specific self-management strategy that involves patient awareness of thought processes, activities and physical symptoms in addition to the measuring, observing, recording and tracking of signs and symptoms. In terms of cognitive factors, participants collected and critically appraised the information that they were given.

Information came from a range of sources such as health professionals, family, friends, support groups and the internet. Affective factors involved feelings of fear, anxiety, frustration, uncertainty and helplessness. However, these negative emotional responses facilitated a desire to learn about cancer and how best to manage it.

Equally, research comparing outcomes between rural and urban people affected by cancer has tended to focus on the post-diagnosis stages, as well as survival rates, and has yet to examine the influence of residency on longer-term survivorship outcomes, such as self-management post-treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 223, "end": 227, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 228, "end": 231, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 232, "end": 236, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 237, "end": 241, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 242, "end": 246, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 718, "end": 722, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 723, "end": 726, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 727, "end": 730, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 731, "end": 735, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 736, "end": 740, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 741, "end": 745, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 746, "end": 750, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Interestingly, eight of the nine articles used some form of qualitative methods, either in isolation or in combination with quantitative methods as a mixed methods design. Qualitative methods seem an appropriate choice to shed light on and explore the in-depth experiences of people affected by cancer; however, there is a considerable need for larger studies with increased sample sizes that utilise quantitative and mixed methods designs. Particularly, where geography is concerned, there is a need for research with a range of cancer types over several different regions so the results can be generalisable to wider rural and urban populations. Much of the research that was included focused on one specific location, with relatively small sample sizes, and in some cases with the same cancer type such as breast (n = 5) which limits the extent to which the findings can be inferred to other settings and population groups.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Only two of the included studies collected data from participants in urban areas, as well as rural [42, 47] . Whilst these two studies identified some of the similarities and differences with rural and urban populations in relation to 'self-management', they do not explicitly focus on 'self-management' as one of the primary variables under investigation. Indeed, self-management studies that compare between rural and urban with people affected by cancer are non-existent within the UK and international literature. With that in mind, researchers in psychosocial oncology should be encouraged to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on rural-urban residency to enhance their analyses. Whilst the studies in this review focus directly on rurality signpost to the perceived differences with rural and urban living when presenting their background and context, they do not collect and analyse data from urban populations in their own study which limits the extent to which we can consider these findings unique to the rural setting without a comparator group. Some of the existing American cancer research that has compared between the two on mental health [55] , health status and health behaviours [35, 50] have used official statistics to categorise and define rural-urban residence, and other researchers, where appropriate, should be supported to do the same. In fact, utilising the same methods for defining and measuring rural-urban status would support comparison between researchers, at the very least, on a national and regional level and promote wider collaboration in the field. Furthermore, interventions need to account for geography and the specific traits of rural and urban populations; therefore, cancer survivorship scholars should be encouraged to take note of this when designing and implementing interventions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 99, "end": 103, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 104, "end": 107, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1170, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1213, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1217, "text": "50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "With regard to the findings from the studies themselves, they identified the salient needs of those from rural areas and that emotional management seems to be a significant concern [45] . This is not surprising given that geographic and emotional isolation is often associated with rural living as seen in some of the wider literature [56, 57] . However, in contrast, it is argued that survivorship experiences are similar regardless of rural-urban residence with the exception of access to specialised survivorship services and resources being the primary difference, as well as a considerable challenge for those in remote locations [44] . A potential solution could be the use of IT and as digital technologies and e-health applications have the potential to support and address needs with rural populations who have been affected by cancer [46] . That said, for this to work, it would be dependent on internet access which can still be limited (or even non-existent) in very rural and remote locations. Indeed, recent work in the UK [58] with people affected by breast cancer suggests that an e-health app could be successful in facilitating peer support and coping strategies. At the same time, it has been shown that social networking does not always provide added benefit, and consideration needs to be given to what stage of the cancer journey this is delivered to the individual [4] . With that in mind, if future time and financial resources are to be invested in the design and utilisation of digital technologies to support health behaviours and self-management, academics and health professionals have a duty to ensure that these are designed and tailored to the needs of both rural and urban populations. Whilst this review was conducted prior to the global pandemic, COVID-19, some people affected by cancer might now feel particularly vulnerable, especially when confined to their homes as a consequence of cancer or other comorbid conditions. It is therefore likely that demand for digital support will increase regardless of geography, where people can learn from professionals and peers without the need for face-to-face contact.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 185, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 335, "end": 339, "text": "[56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 340, "end": 343, "text": "57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 635, "end": 639, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 844, "end": 848, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1041, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1391, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In one study exploring the differences and similarities between rural and urban living [47] , the findings challenge the widespread assumption about the perceived negative impact of rural living on health outcomes. Notably, some of the wider literature reinforces a range of characteristics belonging to rural communities that have the potential to benefit people affected by cancer [22, 23] . Perhaps, not surprisingly, a common theme in the literature is 'community' and research shows that access to healthcare might not be the most salient concern when it comes to the survivorship experience. Social and community support has specifically been accounted for in a framework for recovery of health and well-being in cancer survivorship [15] , and it has been posited that community support can differ depending on where an individual lives [22] . This study sheds light on the role of empowerment in rural communities and future researchers in the field should take note. However, the majority of their sample were female and had been affected by a breast cancer diagnosis where there might be more resources available to support recovery and self-management. Additionally, females tend to be more socially active and to seek other forms of social and emotional support compared with males. Nonetheless, the findings highlight some interesting traits of rural communities in relation to cancer survivorship that warrants further data collection with more diverse samples.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 87, "end": 91, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 383, "end": 387, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 388, "end": 391, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 739, "end": 743, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 843, "end": 847, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Whilst the methods and results from the scoping review identified a gap in the extant literature, notably, that no studies offered direct insight into self-managing cancer within a rural-urban context in the UK, the databases chosen ensured that a wide range of literature in relation to nursing, health and social care, mental health and the behavioural sciences was searched. However, the review was not without its limitations and the search strategy could have been extended to include additional databases such as the Rural and Remote Health Database via Informit Online, although the host institution did not have access at the time of the research. The grey literature was not searched as one of the primary objectives was to map the peer-reviewed academic research in this area. Although to gain a deeper understanding of the field, future reviews should consider exploring the subjectspecific grey literature. Given that this was not a full systematic review, the review protocol was not registered; however, this could have allowed for initial peer review of proposed methods and increased transparency and awareness of the research.
