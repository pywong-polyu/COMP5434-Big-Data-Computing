For many providers in Canada, the notion of private payment for medical care is foreign and uncomfortable. Providers may be unsure of how to undertake the conversation with consistency and may not have the time required to do so in a systematic way. Additionally, many pregnant immigrant women without medical insurance often receive inadequate prenatal care [6] . As Jarvis et al. (2019) reviewed, this population is more likely to present late in pregnancy for care, receive less prenatal testing, and to receive inadequate prenatal follow up. Poor prenatal care has been associated with poor birth outcomes including increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight [6] . This is further compounded by the differences in medicolegal protection for providers when treating uninsured patients. The Canadian Medical Protective Association's Governing Law and Jurisdiction Agreement was created to assist in 'establishing Canadian jurisdiction for any potential legal actions that may result from care or treatment provided by Canadian physicians or healthcare organizations to non-residents' [7] [8] . The complexity of all of these issues can be very difficult for care providers to navigate.",

There was a lack of standardized process to identify and appropriately coordinate medical care for this population. The Uninsured Prenatal patient population is often more complex with multiple social issues. In our opinion, this was a far more complex group to initially establish a consistent streamlined process for. As such, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology worked closely with Low Risk Provider groups within Calgary to establish a consistent and streamlined process for Birth Tourists arriving in Calgary. This process would require distinguishing Birth Tourists from other patients without provincial health insurance. Data Integration, Measurement and Reporting (DIMR), which is current standard of data extraction, does not separate birth tourists from non-birth tourists. Subsequently, we hoped these changes would help to better support Uninsured Prenatal patients. However, that process has not been streamlined to the same degree at this time.",

Starting in July 2019, all prenatal referrals in Calgary for patients without AHC coverage were redirected to a Central Triage (CT) office. This office was consistently run by one administrator with the support of a three member physician team. Patients were administered a questionnaire and subsequently triaged to a care provider based on patient preference, risk profile and city quadrant of residence. Care providers, with the exception of midwifery who had a separate process for billing of patients, then invoiced CT directly. Invoices were required to be consistent with what would have been billed to Alberta Health and were reviewed by the physician leads for the same e.g. excess modifier codes could not be billed. In addition to ensuring standardized payments for services, CT ensured that the Canadian Medical Protective Association's Governing Law and Jurisdiction form for all providers and Alberta Health Services was reviewed and completed as well as consent for information sharing among providers as well as Alberta Health (AH). Patients stayed in contact with CT with respect to when they would be leaving the country and timing of refund. In situations where English was not the primary language, language line or other translation services (through family or physician) was used. Refunds were issued once all invoices were received (approximately eight weeks postpartum). If a patient refused CT, we endeavored to follow up with how and where the patient received care.",

In alignment with both the Alberta Medical Association (AMA) and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA), patients were also able to pay for their fees individually following the service and care was never refused. The physician service fees for Birth Tourists were billed at a rate of five times the rate determined by AH in accordance with the Uninsured Services guidance document provided by the Alberta Medical Association (AMA) [8] . Service fees for uninsured patients were not above standard Schedule of Medical Benefits (SOMB) rates and deposits ranged from no deposit to $2500.

            "text": "Having a system in place to distinguish Uninsured Prenatal patients is of benefit to the patient and the provider. It provides a means to better identify and support those for whom health care coverage can be optimized and also allows an opportunity to better support the needs of the patient. The additional support required can be difficult for individual community providers to provide in isolation. Our process did not specifically have a role for social work and additional community supports. However, we do feel it would be beneficial to create a dedicated process to support Uninsured Prenatal patients not only in the acquisition of AHC but also the opportunity for the provision of community and social supports that may be required. Women with an undocumented status may delay prenatal care due to concerns of being deported, and as a result increase adverse outcomes. We feel this population would benefit from additional community support and discussion of ensuring safe treatment without the threat of deportation and also creation of a system where cost is not a barrier to accessing care. Birth Tourists represented 44% of patients seen by CT. Of these, 87% of Birth Tourists were identified by direct referral to CT. There may be a few explanations for nonreferral to CT. There is a complex network of care providers in Calgary which likely led to slow dissemination of the information regarding CT. There was some hesitancy from obstetrical providers to refer to CT perhaps due to pre-existing relationships or the feeling of obligation within communities with higher rates of Birth Tourism, the concern that there would not be a distinction between Birth Tourists and other Uninsured Prenatal patients, and the concern that patients may avoid care altogether. Through standardized communication we were able to address a common issue identified by providers: the fact that Birth Tourists were receiving incorrect and often varied messaging regarding costs associated with delivery, not only from their friends and online forums, but also from different obstetric providers in Calgary. Previously, the practice of different providers charging different fees for the same service led to 'deal making' between providers and Birth Tourists. Clear communication and collection of a standardized deposit in advance for physician services mitigated some of this problem. Many potential patients contacted the CT office from overseas prior to their arrival in Canada. Physicians did not have to collect payment in hospital or postpartum, which is often very difficult. It is concerning that 39% of patients did not pay the deposit. The reasons for this remain unclear and were not explored in the breadth of this study. Though some of these patients did ultimately pay for the physician service provided following the delivery, it was not clear to CT if all providers were paid and what amount. 83/102 (81%) of Birth Tourists had an encounter with an AHS Calgary Zone hospital. Of the remaining 19 patients (19%), 8 were lost to follow up. That is not insignificant and speaks to the need for greater administrative support to ensure that both mother and baby had access to care in a timely fashion. 5% of Birth Tourists identified that they would be self-referring to midwifery specifically for home birth or birth center delivery. Unfortunately, we were not able to capture the financial data with respect to cost of home birth versus birth center in such scenarios. Midwifery care is unique funding model in that there is a direct contract between AHS and the Alberta Association of Midwifery [9] . There are only a certain number of allocated 'spots' for patients as such there is a wait list for this model of care. It is possible that the number of patients who transferred to midwifery was in fact higher than 5% as Alberta does not have coordinated data for maternity care that includes home births. This may also provide some explanation for the 17 patients with no Regional Health Number. In addition to potentially delivering at home, they could also have delivered outside of the city or province or may have been an error in invoice creation in that it simply wasn't added. Due to the difficulty in consistent recording, we were only able to obtain information that one midwifery home birth required a subsequent NICU admission. An additional limitation noted in through our process with the separate process of fee collection and assessment by Midwifery. We feel it would be of benefit to all providers in patients to have one streamlined process for all providers as this avoids duplication and improves efficiency.",

This does have implications for the Canadian born child's ability to access Alberta Health care. Specifically, a person must make Alberta his/her home and be physically present in Alberta at least 183 days in a 12-month period (not including a tourist, transient or visitor). 17% of children born to mothers identified as 'birth tourists' received AHC with a third of those mothers still having unpaid bills for maternal care.

The $700,000 amount also did not capture the cost to the system for midwifery care or patients who subsequently left Calgary to deliver in a surrounding area. We are concerned that Birth Tourists may be leaving Calgary to find cheaper care in overburdened surrounding regions. This emphasizes the need for a standard provincial process to provide clear and transparent guidance to both patients and providers.

We propose to only issue CT refunds once a fully paid hospital invoice is shown. A further limitation of our financial analysis was that we did not include foreign parents hiring Canadian surrogates to carry a child who will leave the country. Another limitation of our study was that all out of country patients were not identified through the CT. These cases were often recognized through communication from ancillary care providers such as pediatrics asking for clarification on billing. Some out of country patients presented for the first time at delivery. There were also some out of country patients making individual arrangements with maternity care providers that also came to light when additional care providers asked for clarification regarding billing. Given the lack of a robust system of data collection, it is very possible that Birth Tourists and Uninsured Prenatal patients were missed.
