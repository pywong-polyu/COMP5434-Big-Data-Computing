Overall, the recordings supported a mixed cortical-subcortical pattern of myoclonic jerks (see figure1).

Alternatively, cortical and subcortical myoclonus may be related to post-infectious myoclonus, although this hypothesis is less likely in the absence of opsoclonus or ataxia. Finally, electrophysiological exploration documented cortical (abnormal long loop C-reflex) and sub-cortical (long duration bursts) myoclonus. We cannot thus exclude a combination with chronic post-hypoxic myoclonus with action and intention myoclonus of sub-cortical and cortical origin with possible additional metabolic origin in patient 4 with renal failure syndrome.",

Several pathophysiological mechanisms may be here hypothesized: (1) direct central nervous system damage by SARS-CoV-2 or post infectious/immune-mediated origin, (2) metabolic (renal failure) and post-hypoxic myoclonus, 4,5 no hypothesis exclusive of the other one.",
