Outbreaks of respiratory viruses such as adenoviruses, and 18 enteric viruses such as enteroviruses, Hepatitis A and noroviruses which can transmit by the faecal-19 oral route are sometimes linked to swimming pools but often owe to improper maintenance of 20 chlorine levels (Bonadonna & La Rosa, 2019; WHO, 2000) . In the UK, swimming pools are treated with 21 sodium hypochlorite to maintain a free chlorine level of 1.5-3 mg/l (ppm). The pH is also adjusted to 22 between 7.0 and 7.6 as the availability of active free chlorine decreases with increasing pH (PWTAG, 23 2020).

            "text": "Exposure to chlorinated water inactivates SARS-CoV-2. Water samples taken from a 69 swimming pool were modified in the laboratory to a range of pH and free chlorine values. A known 70 amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was added to duplicate water samples in a volume of 1 ml, incubated 71 for 30 seconds at RT and any remaining infectious virus then titrated by TCID50 on Vero cells. Residual 72 virus titres are shown as the mean and SD of duplicate TCID50/ml values. Successive experiments were 73 performed with varying free chlorine levels (a), varying pH (b), a range of both pH and free chlorine 74 levels (c), and an independent preparation of virus at a range of pH and chlorine levels (d). A PBS 75 control was included in each experiment to validate the infectivity of the virus input. Lower pH and 76 higher free chlorine levels resulted in greater inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. A pH of no more than 7.4 77 and free chlorine above 1.5 parts per million (ppm) resulted in at least a 3-log10 reduction in viral titre. Discussion 79 Swimming pools have reopened in the UK as of April 12 th 2021 and therefore present locations of 80 possible COVID-19 transmission. The likelihood of transmission events occurring in shared areas such 81 as changing rooms can be minimised with social distancing and hygiene measures around the pool but 82 different variables affect any risk associated with time spent in the water. Chlorination of swimming 83 pool water has been used for decades to mitigate any onwards transmission of pathogens between 84 swimmers. However, since the causative agent of COVID-19, the betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, 85 only emerged in late 2019, inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by chlorinated water has not yet been directly 86 demonstrated. Since viruses cannot replicate outside of a host, a transmission event via swimming 87",

The route by which any residual virus in swimming pool water 106 might infect another swimmer is not clear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in the air and also by direct 107inoculation. There is also a potential faecal-oral route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 (Guo et al., 108 2021). Our findings on the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to inactivation by swimming pool water 109 underscore the importance for those who maintain swimming pools to adhere to UK guidelines for 110 chlorination, and this should give confidence in the safety of bathers when in the water. Finally, we 111 stress that swimmers should continue to adhere to locally recommended social distancing rules both 112 in and out of the water. Figure  128 1d. Chlorine levels of the water samples were increased by addition of sodium hypochlorite and pH 129 was increased by addition of sodium carbonate or decreased using sodium bisulphate before 130 retesting. Inactivation experiments were performed within 30 minutes of water sample preparation 131 to minimise decay of chlorine levels. 132",
