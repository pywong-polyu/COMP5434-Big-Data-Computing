Historically, first time hospitalization rates for mental disorders linked to influenza may have increased by a factor of 2.6 in the 5 years following Russian Influenza and by a factor of 7.2 yearly during the 6 years after the Spanish Flu. 1 Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic may create a \"parallel pandemic\" potentially including disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that may follow intensive care unit admissions, disorders related to widespread social effects, and neuropsychiatric effects of the virus itself. Yet, more than 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic, the robust knowledge needed to inform policy and service delivery for mental health and mental disorders in Canada is not yet available. The purpose of this editorial is to provide a cautionary message about existing estimates, and to suggest strategies for generating better data during this pandemic, and beyond.",

Apart from the logistical challenges involved, there is the additional problem that the pandemic has disrupted health systems in ways that complicate interpretation of administrative data. Healthcare and patient adaptations to address the COVID-19 crisis (such as the transition to virtual care) may account for changes in utilization in unpredictable directions. For example, there is evidence that a reduction in referrals early in the pandemic may be followed by acceleration in the medium term. 2 There is thus a need to develop and expand infrastructure for collecting and managing health information and providing sophisticated and timely information. This must include the ability to disaggregate data to identify different segments of the population, such as racialized, marginalized, and indigenous populations. Indeed, this may be one of the most necessary learnings from this pandemic experience. 3 A US study reported that those with COVID-19 had increased incidence (HR ranged from 1.6 to 2.1) of first psychiatric diagnoses during the 14 to 90 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis compared with 6 other health conditions, 4 highlighting the utility of access to timely data.",

Need is also related to comorbidities, coping skills, personal resources, and so on. Mental disorders exist on a spectrum of severity. Given this context, information about the prevalence of mental disorders at best provides a starting point or bare minimum. Yet, no estimates of the prevalence of any mental disorders during the pandemic have appeared in Canada. Indeed, this lack of data is a global issue. Only a single study, conducted in the Czech Republic, used a structured diagnostic interview (the MINI) in repeated cross-sectional surveys (2017 and 2020) to assess prevalence before and during the pandemic. Increases of 2 to 3 fold in the point prevalence of anxiety disorders and depressive disorders, respectively, were reported. 5 A commonly measured parameter has been perceived mental health, measured using a single item. About 1 in 4 Canadians reported fair or poor mental health during the pandemic, compared to about 8% in the 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Whether and how such perceptions are related to need for mental health care is difficult to say.",

Such instruments are inexpensive and convenient to administer. The problem is that they were designed for screening. Consequently, they are intended to be sensitive (so that cases are not missed) but are not intended to be specific since a positive screen leads to further assessment, not a diagnosis. By design, they produce a high proportion of false-positive ratings and tend to overestimate prevalence. Predictably, systematic reviews of studies that assessed prevalence of anxiety and depression using such scales have reported high prevalence estimates, as high as 31.9% for anxiety and 33.7% for depression. 6, 7 In Canada, the Perspectives series of surveys by Statistics Canada included the GAD-7, but there are no comparable prepandemic population values against which to interpret the scores. Population-based studies from the United States and UK have reported elevated non-specific distress ratings in general population samples assessed before and during the pandemic. 8 An analysis of data collected from 3 cohorts 2 to 8 weeks into a COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands examined symptom changes from self-report ratings obtained before the pandemic in cohort members with and without prior diagnoses of mental disorders. While those with mental disorders had higher levels of symptoms during the lockdown, the largest increases in symptoms were observed in the groups without prior diagnoses. 9 Whether these increased symptoms reflect de novo occurrence of disorders or stress-related changes in is unknown.",

A likely explanation is that there has been a perceived need to answer questions quickly. Special funding competitions, routine use of pre-print platforms, special issues of journals, and an openness to expedited publication have been evident. Such measures may make sense in the context of a public health emergency. However, it creates a risk that low-quality evidence is produced and acted upon as if it were high-quality evidence. This is problematic, especially if such studies appear in high-impact journals and are highly cited. Many surveys using convenience sampling and abbreviated measurement strategies have appeared in top-tier journals during the pandemic and have subsequently made headlines in media outlets. If it is reasonable that the rules of peer-review and parsing of evidence must change in an emergency, it should not be forgotten that the scientific principles that shape research methodology and safeguard scientific validity do not change. The published results should be treated accordingly.",
