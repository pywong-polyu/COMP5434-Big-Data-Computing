Materials and Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a large tertiary care center where a 23-items web-based questionnaire was conveyed to sub-population of healthcare professionals, namely residents, medical students, and nurses. The questionnaire included demographic data, type, and duration of mask use. Voice outcome measures included the Voice Handicap Index (VHI)-10 questionnaire and the visual analogue scale for vocal effort and vocal fatigue. Results. A total of 178 participants answered the survey. One third had an abnormal score on the VHI-10 questionnaire, one third reported moderate to severe vocal fatigue, and 45% of the participants had moderate to severe vocal effort based on a visual analogue scale score. There was a significant association between the type of mask used and vocal fatigue (P = 0.044). No significant association was seen between the duration of mask used and the different voice outcome measures. Conclusion. Masking habits during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with a high prevalence of vocal fatigue, effort and abnormal VHI-10 score among residents, medical students, and nurses.",

            "text": "The novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had considerable impact on human life and healthcare, with more than 200 million diagnosed cases worldwide and 4 million deaths to date. 1 In order to decrease transmission and reduce the disease burden among healthcare workers (HCW), the centers of disease control and prevention recommended the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, respirators and face shields. 2 Various forms of face masks are currently used and these include surgical masks, cloth masks, N95 respirators and others. Surgical masks are recommended for routine care, whereas the use of N95 respirators has been advocated when performing high-risk aerosol generating procedures. 3 Due to the prolonged use of PPE, several adverse effects have been recorded, including discomfort, 4,5 dyspnea, 6,7 dizziness, 6 headaches 7,8 and most interestingly, voice disorders. 9, 10 The detrimental effects of face masks on speech and vocal effort have been thoroughly investigated. [11] [12] [13] [14] McKenna et al compared acoustic and perceptual voice measures with and without face masks, and showed a significant reduction in relative fundamental frequency and vowel articulation index, in addition to a significant increase in perceived vocal effort and cepstral peak prominence. 11 In another study, Karakgouni showed that almost 50% of individuals who wear face masks report difficulty being heard by their peers, while 70% need a louder voice to overcome the physical barrier set by masks. 13 These results are congruent with the investigation by P\u20ac orschmann et al, who showed that face masks generate a loss in sound transmission, directly impairing speech intelligibility and voice radiation. 15 Similar findings were highlighted by Goldin et al, who demonstrated that different types of masks attenuate sound intensity ranging from 3 to 4 dB to 12 dB at high frequencies. 16 All the above indicates that HCW who adhere to the PPE standard precautions and use various types of face masks are prone to phonatory disorders. 11 Resident physicians and nurses, as first responders in caring for patients in COVID-19 and other units, are particularly at a considerable risk in comparison to other healthcare workers. Similarly, medical students, although not commonly placed on COVID-19 patient care wards, still have repeated exposure to inpatient departments, placing them at an increased risk of contracting the disease. 17 The aim of our study is to investigate the impact of masking habits on phonation in this category of healthcare professionals, namely resident physicians, nurses, and medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors' hypothesis is that the use of face masks in healthcare workers leads to vocal fatigue and increase in vocal effort, which eventually manifests as phonatory handicap.",

            "text": "These findings suggest that resident physicians, nurses, and medical students are subject to vocal fatigue and distinctively need to put more vocal effort in comparison to healthcare workers in general. This can be ascribed to several factors. One factor is the attenuation of high frequencies in individuals wearing face masks, as they have been shown to act as acoustic filters and physical barriers for phonation and speech. 11, 15, 16, 19 Although the N95 respirators offer a superior form of protection, it has been suggested that they hinder sound transmission by 12 dB to 18 dB between 3 kHz and 7 kHz, when compared to surgical masks which hinder sound transmission by 4 dB to 6 dB. 15 Nevertheless, no significant association was found between the duration of mask use and the different voice outcome measures. The lack of statistical significance can be attributed to a low response rate of 12.6%, a recall bias by the participants when filling the survey and the lack of a comparison arm. Another reason for the increase in vocal effort, fatigue and VHI-10 score is the environmental noise level, which is considered a health hazard associated with a large number of morbidities among which is dysphonia. 20 Measures of sound levels on general wards, telemetry floors and ICU units have been found to be above average. These figures range from 44.6 dB to 55.1 dB in non ICU wards and 56.1 dB to 60.3 dB in ICU units, 21 which are values higher than those set by the World health organization (WHO) guidelines for hospital settings (35 dB in settings where patients are being treated or monitored). 22 In order to surpass noise pollution that is set by the hospital environment, we presume that HCW in general and residents, nurses and medical students in particular, adjust their phonatory behavior aiming to correct vocal intelligibility. The increase in phonatory effort can eventually lead to voice disorders. Auditory feedback also plays a paramount role in modulating the pitch and loudness of the speaker. It has been suggested by Schenck et al that smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS) is influenced by both loudness shifts and pitch shifts, which may be coupled to a mechanism that enhances speech audibility under states of altered acoustic feedback. 23 Therefore, a decrease in acoustic feedback is associated with an increase in the fundamental frequency and vocal intensity, which in turn lead to an increase in phonatory effort. 24 The increase in vocal fatigue and effort is commensurate with the high prevalence of abnormal VHI-10 among the participants of our study group. Based on the review of Titze et al, 25 the collision forces between the vocal folds during vocalization is one of the major stresses of phonation. An increase in phonatory effort, which is the clinical correlate of the phonatory threshold pressure, that is the pressure needed to set the vocal folds in vibration, is associated with an increase in intraepithelial stress, particularly at the \"striking zone,\" that is the mid-portion of the membranous vocal fold. 26 The increase in contact pressure secondary to an increase in \"vocal loading\" is in turn associated with alteration in vocal fold microvascular pressure, hence leading to submucosal lesions. 26, 27 Another contributing factor to the high prevalence of VHI-10 and VAS findings is the high prevalence of smokers in our study group. Nearly 28.65% of our participants have a history of smoking, compared to 16% of healthcare workers in the US, 28 and a 31% prevalence within the Lebanese population in 2011. 29 This may also explain the higher number of participants complaining of voice disorders in our study.",
