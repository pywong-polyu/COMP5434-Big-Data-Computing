Additional data were generated using the QSAR (Vega platform) as described above, but were of low reliability. As the results were insufficient for offering reliable ecotoxicological estimations, the assessment was extended with an innovative approach. A broader search on experimental ecotoxicity data on antiviral drugs provided information on 5 additional antiviral drugs that were used as source group for a pharmacodynamic-based read-across. The ecotoxicological information retrieved for the antiviral drugs was compiled in a metanalysis, deriving the distribution of tentative PNEC values for each aquatic taxonomic group. A tentative PNEC value was calculated for each retrieved experimental ecotoxicity data, according to the following procedure: An standard interspecies variability factor of 10 was applied to the chronic No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) and Effective Concentrations producing a 10% response (EC 10 s) measuring population relevant effects (reproduction or population growth rate). Additional assessment factors (also named extrapolation, uncertainty or safety factors) (Tarazona, 1997) were applied to other ecotoxicological endpoints, as follows. An assessment factor of 10 was used for extrapolations related to exposure duration (i.e. from short-term to long-term exposures); an assessment factor of 10 for extrapolations from lethality to population relevant sublethal effects, an assessment factor of 2 for the extrapolation between NOEC or EC 10 and EC 50 measurements for the same ecotoxicological endpoint and exposure duration, and an assessment factor of 1 for effects relevant at individual level but with moderate impact at population level. The innovative pharmacodynamic-based read-across was designed to compare the characteristics of the antiviral drugs included in the source group with those of the target group. The selected characteristics included the antiretroviral mode of action, the metabolic pathways, the in vitro toxicity profiles from the US ToxCast ",

The selection includes antiviral drugs, boosters and a group of miscellaneous drugs approved for other uses. The selected antiviral drugs are remdesivir (a nucleoside analogue prodrug), oseltamivir (a potent and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase, also known as Tamiflu), lopinavir (a second-generation protease inhibitor), darunavir (a second generation protease inhibitor) and umifenovir (a dual-acting direct antiviral and host-multitargeting agent). The pharmacologically active substances used as their pharmacokinetic boosters or enhancers are cobicistat and ritonavir. The miscellaneous group includes multitarget antiparasitic drugs approved for human treatment such as antimalarial (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine) and anthelmintic (ivermectin) substances, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin. Monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab and sarilumab) or adhesion blocking agents are assumed of low environmental concern as are expected to follow the metabolic and biodegradation processes of proteins and were excluded from this environmental risk assessment. Nannou et al., 2020) , thus the SimpleTreat model seems to be inadequate for predicting the WWTP fate for this group, and the estimations should be considered with caution. Table 1 summarises the main source, intermediate and final data for the selected medicinal products. Surface water is frequently used for drinking water extraction, and conventional treatment does not remove antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir (Simazaki et al., 2015) , thus human indirect exposure from drinking water should be also considered. The data results for the regional model based on population and river flow using the Madrid cosmopolitan region (Spain) as realistic worst-case confirms that the dilution factor of the receiving water plays a key role in the final predicted aquatic concentrations. As example, Table 2 provides the maximum PEC value obtained for the different models and scenarios for the metabolite hydroxychloroquine.",

Considering the data and the similarities observed among taxonomic groups, the application of an assessment factor of 100 to the algae EC 10 , resulting in a predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) value of 0.12 mg/L, seems appropriate and covers the sublethal effects observed in fish such as erratic swimming and loss of equilibrium, among others. There is no information on hydroxychloroquine (the less toxic metabolite of cloroquine), but QSAR estimations with moderate reliability predict that hydroxychloroquine is slightly less toxic than chloroquine for aquatic organisms; supporting the extrapolation of the chloroquine PNEC value to hydroxychloroquine. Most models predict maximum concentrations below the PNEC value, suggesting low concern except when the default dilution factor of 10, between wastewater and receiving system flows, cannot be achieved.",

Ivermectin is an agonist of several types of ligand-gated chloride ion channel receptors; increases the activity of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors or glutamate-gated chloride ion channels (Glu-Cl), which blockades the signal between neuron and muscle of parasite; the blood-brain barrier (BBB) secures vertebrate's GABA-sensitive neurons, resulting in a high sensitivity for invertebrates (Juarez et al., 2018) . This is confirmed by available risk assessments, that confirm moderate toxicity for fish and algae and extremely high toxicity for invertebrates, with a PNEC value of 0.03 \u00b5g/L based on chronic toxicity to Daphnia magna (Liebig et al., 2010) . The estimations based on the currently approved dosage as human antiparasitic drugs indicate a very high risk for aquatic invertebrates. A significant retention in the WWTP sludge is also expected, which will trigger a complementary risk for agricultural soils in case the of sludge reclamation as soil fertilizer considering the high sensitivity of soil invertebrates (Liebig et al., 2010) . Rodriguez-Mozaz et al., 2020), which is considered protective for minimizing the development of antibiotic resistance (Stanton et al., 2020) . According to our estimations, a potential environmental risk should be expected if the use rate is higher than 0.016% of the human population. In addition, it should be considered that the use in COVID-19 patients should be added to environmental emissions from current uses, which already represent an environmental concern in certain areas. COVID-19 treatments covering between 0.004% and 0.05% of the human population would duplicate current WWTP emissions.",

In the meantime a group assessment as presented could be used for supporting prioritisation and the identification of areas and situations of potential concern. ",

The default is 1% of the human population treated, which is insufficient for a therapeutic control of the pandemic; thus, additional levels of treatment medications were also considered. As in most cases the environmental emissions are expected to be treated by a Wastewater Treatment Plan (WWTP), the EMA scenario was complemented with a module covering the WWTP process. This module was based on the SimpleTreat 3.0 model described in the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) guidance document and also recommended in the draft EMA guidance. The log octanol/water partition coefficient (P ow ) value triggers the proportion to water and to sludge as volatilization was not relevant for any of the selected medicinal products. For the antiviral drugs, several studies have indicated negligible or highly variable degradation in WWTP(Leknes et al., 2012;Singer et al., 2014;",

However, when the elimination half-life is longer, the environmental emission is distributed through a number of days, and consequently the maximum Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) value depends on the actual elimination half-life and the dosage regimen (dose, interval and treatment duration). An additional module, considering the prescription conditions and time for elimination of the administered dose, was developed for increasing the realism when using for assessing environmental emissions during pandemic massive uses. Most proposed dosage regimen have a duration of about 14 days, Figure 1A presents the influence of the elimination half-life on the temporal distribution of environmental emissions following 14 days of treatments. Chloroquine and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine have longer elimination half-lives. The temporal environmental emission distributions for a single patient according to the therapeutic recommendations for hydroxychloroquine are presented in Figure 1B. This refined model was used to estimate the consequences on environmental emissions and final predicted concentrations in water for different therapeutic regimes. Figure 2 compares the results for simultaneous treatment of the entire human population, consecutive treatments in three or four groups, and for non-consecutive groups. The data results confirm that a proper selection of the dose regimen may reduce significantly the aquatic environmental concentrations of human drugs, and therefore could be considered as a possible risk mitigation option when needed.",

The NOEC the mg/L range, however sublethal effects have been reported at much lower concentrations, including effects on vertebrate grown, suitable for a PNEC derivation, with effects observed at 40-50 \u00b5g/L(Lorenz et al., 2009;LaLone et al., 2012). The reported NOEC values for these studies are 4 and 1\u00b5g/L, with LOEC/NOEL ratios of 10 and 50 respectively. These ratios are suboptimal for establishing a PNEC; and the margin of exposure (MoE) approach is more suitable for the risk characterisation. Using 40 \u00b5g/L as the Ecotoxicity Reference Point, a margin of 13.3 is observed for the maximum predicted concentration(Table 1) assuming 100% treatment of the population and similar toxicity for the parent and the metabolites. Considering that there is a wide coverage of taxonomic groups and that the use of dexamethasone is restricted to hospitalised patients requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation(Horby et al., 2020), this margin is sufficient for considering that the specific use of dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients does not have specific environmental concerns.Azithromycin, a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin, is included in the EU monitoring program under the Water Framework Directive, with measured median and maximum concentrations of 0.02 and 5 \u00b5g/L respectively(Loos et al., 2018) and measured levels in WWTP effluents between 0.05 and 0.6 \u00b5g/L (Rodriguez-Mozaz et al., 2020).
