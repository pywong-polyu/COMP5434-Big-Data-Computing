Its smooth evolution was mainly driven by two determinants: (i) the increasing pace of technology development; (ii) substantial changes in government regulations, which were made in order to align teleworkers to the same requirements that traditional workers had to fulfill in relation to their employers. As far as organizational workspaces are concerned, the so-called \"third spaces\" (situated between home and work) are typical for the second generation: co-working areas, innovation hubs, open workshops, living labs, start-up incubators, etc. [7] . Among the most evident advantages brought about by this working structure, we can mention the following: greater opportunities to access high-level technologies; low intensity isolation risks; diminishing trends of personnel expenses for employers (determined by low commuting costs or by delivering permission for employees to use inexpensive facilities); an enhanced sense of achievement regarding one's job and well-being, etc. [8] .",

From a technological point of view, there have been some relevant predictions in the literature that have painted a complex picture for the future: access to high-speed Internet through radio waves in conjunction with downsized transistors would determine the adoption of new ICTs, i.e., miniature devices (such as smartphones and other similar instruments) and would be able to access a large amount of information that has already preserved within clouds and networks [10] . Although this prognosis was made back in 1997, it is true nowadays, and it illustrates the real possibility of an employee to attend work away from their employer's premises, anywhere and anytime [11] . Thus, the third telework generation will entail smart or agile working, a procedure of pursuing everyday job obligations partially from the office and partially in a remote manner in order to meet the needs of employees who are seeking to harmonize their professional life with family responsibilities.",

Surprisingly, some authors have argued that the rapid proliferation of cheap and productive ICT devices alone was not able to foster high levels of telework adoption before the pandemic. Thus, other determinants such as personal views on job appropriateness, prestige or authority issues, the employers' willingness to apply new work arrangements, the peculiarities of the organizational culture, etc., appeared to have been as equally important as the technological developments [3] . However, most of the impediments that used to block telework adoption before COVID 19 were removed in the beginning of 2020, when governmental authorities from all over the world encouraged companies to promote telework in order to avoid workplace overcrowding.",

Another study conducted in the first part of 2020 [14] showed that the effects generated by the introduction of remote work vary to a large extent between economic sectors. Thus, in the case of countries and companies that had adopted telework before (Northern European countries), the transition was smoother, compared to other countries (Central and Southern European countries) [15] . Whether they are clients or employees in various sectors of activity, time has shown that young people or those who are already accustomed to this type of activity are the ones who adapt the most easily to distance work [16] .",

Several major benefitssuch as higher income for employees, lower labor costs for companies, the complete cutting down of employee commute time, etc.-derive from the accelerated rhythm of telework implementation. By conducting interviews with companies that have adopted telework, another study approaching a new work-from-home model emphasizes that since daily travel to work is no longer necessary, managers can hire talented people from various parts of the Globe [20] . However, at the local level, the implications are also remarkable, from the processes of dissolving companies (while adapting employees to peculiarities of telework) to fueling economic development supported by opportunities brought about by globalization and ITC advancements [21, 22] . On the other hand, some authors have argued that the COVID-19 pandemic was able to accelerate a phenomenon that would have materialized in any case; nevertheless, the sanitary crisis increased the disparities between the traditional and the digital economy, the excellent and the lowest-performing companies, the educated and uneducated employees, prosperous and underprivileged people, even at the country level [23, 24] .",

While there is a consensus in relation to the main determinants that impact the relationship between telework and organizational performance-such as the adjustability of work arangements; employee degree of self determination in conducting their work tasks; incresed protection against ilnesses; the diminishing trend of the operational costs of enterprises; the employment of appropriate communication tools; efficient organization of business operations, etc.-the assessement of their consequences and importance varies to a large extent from one author to another [55, 56] .",

Thus, the significant jump in the number of employees who started teleworking during the crisis demonstrated that, with the availability of adequate technology, communication instruments, and managerial restructuring strategies, significantly more jobs became \"teleworkable\" than previously estimated [11] . Due to the fact that working-from-home procedures had been accepted before the pandemic in this group of countries, the foundations for the new work arrangements (rather low contact with other people, small-level risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination, high degree of digitization, important job flexibility, etc.) were already met; therefore, work performance could be maintained at a constant level, while employees learned how to manage a pre-established schedule so that they could be able to successfully combine family problems and responsibilities with work tasks. This conclusion is in line with other recent empirical studies that demonstrate that the general increase in the degree of teleworker satisfaction raises the amplitude of their job commitment [58] [59] [60] .",

First, there was not a high prevalence of teleworking in the pre-COVID era (as described in paragraph 2), which made the mutation towards \"the forced telework mode\" more challenging, following sinusoidal trajectories in some cases [12] . Employees needed various work equipment they did not have in their possession at the moment that lockdowns began, so they required a certain number of additional training hours to bridge their ability gaps [11] . Consequentially, their level of satisfaction towards the quality and quantity of work submitted descended around the average values registered by the sample under analysis. On the other hand, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated as being higher in comparison with the level of the threat assessed by the employees from the previous group; such circumstances can be correlated with the fact that within this class of countries, teleworking from home before the pandemic outbreak was not widely accepted and that the activities normally carried out at work involved contact with other people to a large extent.",

On another train of thought, at the European level, two recent directives-The Work-Life Balance Directive and the Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive-are due to be fully applied by the EU countries by 2022 and address, inter alia, the protection of flexible work schedules for employees with children up to 8 years of age while implementing well established working time patterns [62] .",
