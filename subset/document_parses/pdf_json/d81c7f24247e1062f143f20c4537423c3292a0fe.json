Like other countries, it also effected the economy and people of Pakistan. According to the publicly reported data, the first case of novel corona virus in Pakistan was reported on 27th February 2020. The aim of the present study is to describe the mathematical model and dynamics of COVID-19 in Pakistan. To investigate the spread of coronavirus in Pakistan, we develop the SEIR time fractional model with newly, developed fractional operator of Atangana-Baleanu. We present briefly the analysis of the given model and discuss its applications using world health organization (WHO) reported data for Pakistan. We consider the available infection cases from 19th March 2020, till 31st March 2020 and accordingly, various parameters are fitted or estimated. It is worth noting that we have calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 \u2248 2.30748 which shows that virus is spreading rapidly. Furthermore, stability analysis of the model at disease free equilibrium DFE and endemic equilibriums EE is performed to observe the dynamics and transmission of the model. Finally, the AB fractional model is solved numerically. To show the effect of the various embedded parameters like fractional parameter \u03b1 on the model, various graphs are plotted. It is worth noting that the base of our investigation, we have predicted the spread of disease for next 200 days.",

For example in different times the human being suffered by different kinds of infectious diseases, like HIV, Ebola virus, bird flu, dengue virus, malaria, TB, hepatitis B and C, diarrhea, influenza, chicken pox and rubella disease etc. These infectious diseases affected humans as well as other animals. Beside this, these infectious diseases not only spread in human and animals but it also spread in plants like, Pine wilt disease, Moko diseases, sugar cane, orange rust, Karnal bunt diseases and Dutchelm etc. 1 . These pandemics not only affected the economy of the world but also caused many deaths of mankind. The study of these infectious diseases is very important to investigate the spread of infectious diseases and to find out the behavior of these infectious diseases on living organisms. To look for the possible available resources which help to detect these diseases and prevent from them. The duty of humankind is to create a healthy environment in which they live. The growth in human population is increasing with a great speed which also effect the environment. The nature of spreading of these viruses are different, some of them are fast spreading viruses while others are slow in spreading. In-spite of the spreading nature of these infectious diseases, they affected many humans as well as plants.",

            "text": "Fractional order modeling is quite important to understand the realistic situations of the dynamical models. Different researchers use different fractional operators to fractionalize their models. Like, Zhang 6 modeled the dynamics of COVID-19 in five different compartments and extended the model to the fractional order differentiation to capture different memories using fractional operators of singular and non-singular kernels. Shaikh et al. 7 investigated the spread of the deadly virus COVID-19 in India and fractionalized the classical model with Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) fractional operator. Baleanu et al. 8 reported the numerical solutions of CF time fractional model of COVID-19 with different compartments by using homotopy analysis transform method. Yadav and Verma 9 examined the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China through a dynamical CF fractional model with different classes and shown the effect of concentration of virus in the surrounding environment on these classes. Lu et al. 10 investigated the dynamics of COVID-19 in different high concentrated cities of China using Caputo fractional model with six different compartments. Rajagopal et al. 11 investigated the dynamics of COVID-19 in Italy using Caputo fractional model. They examined that results achieved through fractional model provides a closer forecast with the real data. Higazy 12 studied the spread of COVID-19 pandemic using SIDATHE fractional model with Caputo fractional operator. Besides this, fractional calculus is useful in various aspects of real-world problems such as Ozarslan et al. 13 The aim of present study is to investigate the dynamics and transmission of COVID-19 through SEIR model. Furthermore, we transformed the classical model by newly developed Atangana-Baleanu time fractional model. The purpose of using AB time fractional derivative is that it has non-singular and non-local kernel and it may predict the spread of COVID-19 accurately. Qureshi et al. 15 investigated the dynamics of diarrhea by considering AB fractional operator. They found that the diarrhea model under investigation estimates the real statistical data well enough when considered with the AB fractional order operator which has non-local and non-singular kernel. Bas and Ozarslan 16 investigated the analytical solutions of some dynamical models such as logistic equation, population growth/decay equation, blood alcohol model by considering AB fractional derivative. They concluded that AB fractional operator gives more accurate results to the derivative with exponential kernel. Bas et al. 17 analyzed the solutions of heating and cooling of building models by using the Laplace transform technique. They generalized their models by considering Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu fractional operators and by comparing their results, they noticed that AB-fractional derivative provides more precise results for the given models. They concluded that CF and AB fractional operators can better describes the dynamics of complex systems as compared to classical operators.",

Figure 2 depicts WHO reported cases of infected individuals for COVID-19. Figure 3 displays number of deaths confirmed by WHO due to COVID-19. Figure 4 highlights the total number of recovered individuals of COVID-19 in the selected period of time. Comparative bar chart and line plot of reported deaths and recovered individuals of COVID-19 has been shown in Fig. 5 . Figure 6 represents WHO reported cases for COVID-19. Figure 7 shows the comparison between real data from WHO verses present considered model. From the figure, it can be noticed that our model shows a strong agreement with real data collected by WHO. Finally, it is necessary to mention here that from Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, all these figures have been plotted for the data collected by WHO from 19th March 2020 till 31st March 2020. From the graphical analysis, one can observe that the rate of spread of COVID-19 in Pakistan in the above mentioned interval is very high as compared to the initial days. Moreover, to obtain the graphical results from the given model we have simulated the given iterative scheme through MATLAB software.

For this task, they divide the total population into different compartments. The solution of these systems may deliver an indication to health and other sectors that how severe the spread can be and what parameter is needed to control the spread of virus or disease under consideration. In the present article, we have taken SEIR model for the dynamics and transmission of COVID-19. We have also proved that the given model is bounded and invariant. Two equilibrium points DFE and EE are calculated for the steady state of the presented model. Furthermore, the basic reproduction number R 0 is calculated using next generation technique. Through stability analysis, we have concluded that the given model is locally asymptotically stable when R 0 < 1 . It means that by taking R 0 < 1 the total population tends to DFE and the disease will die out from the population. Additionally, we have generalized the classical SEIR model by applying the recently developed AB fractional model. The real data have been fitted for the classical model i.e. \u03b1 = 1 . For the fitted values given in Table 1 , we have approximated the basic reproduction number R 0 \u2248 2.30748 . A numerical scheme is adopted for the solutions of AB fractional model. After simulation of numerical scheme different graphical results have been obtained. We have considered the unit of time in days. Furthermore, the dynamics and transmission of COVID-19 is predicted for the next 200 days. A decrease is noticed in the infected class by decreasing the values of AB fractional parameter \u03b1 . As the infectious disease in not yet control in Pakistan as well as worldwide. We all know that the researchers and scientist are trying to find proper medical treatment or vaccination to control www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the spread of COVID-19. In future one may add the quarantine or vaccination or both the classes to the given model and show the effect of these classes on the spread of this deadly infectious disease. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

From the figure, we noticed that by increasing \u03b1 results to decrease the number of exposed as well as infected individuals and delays the time of reaching the maximum number in each compartment. Decreasing \u03b1 makes the curves of all population compartments flatter except susceptible class. Furthermore, it can be observed from the figure that we have predicted the (41)",
