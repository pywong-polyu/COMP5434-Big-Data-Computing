            "text": "\uf06c COVID-19's impacts on water quality were first studied with fluorescence technique. \uf06c One of the main pollution sources in study water body was identified. \uf06c Shutdown & production cutdown of industries due to the pandemic weakened pollution. \uf06c Fluorescent component's intensity reduced during the domestic and global pandemic. Abstract In 2020, a sudden COVID-19 pandemic unprecedentedly weakened anthropogenic activities and as results minified the pollution discharge to aquatic environment. In this study, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on aquatic environment of the southern Jiangsu (SJ) segment of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal (SJ-BHGC) were explored. Fluorescent component similarity and high-performance size exclusion chromatography analyses indicated that the textile printing and dyeing wastewater might be one of the main pollution sources in SJ-BHGC. The water quality parameters and intensities of fluorescent components (WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20)) decreased to low level due to the collective shutdown of all industries in SJ region during the Spring Festival holiday and the outbreak of the domestic COVID-19 pandemic in China (January 24th to late February, 2020). Then, they presented a gradual upward trend after the domestic epidemic was under control. In mid-March, the outbreak of the international COVID-19 pandemic hit the garment export trade of 3 China and consequently inhibited the production activities of textile printing and dyeing industry (TPDI) in SJ region. After peaking on March 26th, the intensities of WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20) decreased again with changed intensity ratio until April 12th. During the study period (135 days), correlation analysis revealed that WT-C1 and WT-C2 possessed homology and their fluorescence intensities were highly positively correlated with conductivity and COD Mn . With fluorescence fingerprint (FF) technique, this study not only excavated the characteristics and pollution causes of water body in SJ-BHGC, but also provided novel insights into impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on production activities of TPDI and aquatic environment of SJ-BHGC. The results of this study indicated that FF technique was an effective tool for precise supervision of water environment. southern Jiangsu; TN, total nitrogen; TP, total phosphorus; TPDI, textile printing and dyeing industry; TPDW, textile printing and dyeing wastewater; WQP, water quality parameter; WWTP, wastewater treatment plant 105 The Fmax variations of three fluorescent components of water body in WT 106 section from January 1st to May 15th in 2019 and 2020 are illustrated in Fig. 6. As 107 previously discussed, the WT-C1 and WT-C2 probably originated from the discharge 108 of TPDW. Thus, the variations of Fmax of WT-C1 and WT-C2 might be associated 109 with the production activities of TPDI. After entering January, in order to ensure that 110 products sales were not affected during the Spring Festival holiday, TPDI factories 111 would increase their production activities. Then, with the approaching of the Spring 112 Festival holiday, the workers returned to their hometown and the production activities 113 of TPDI began to decline. Thus, from January 1st to the beginning of the Spring 114 Festival Holiday, whether in 2019 or 2020, the Fmax of WT-C1 and WT-C2 reached a 115 peak value in fluctuations, and then began to gradually decrease. During the Spring 116 Festival Holiday, the Fmax of WT-C1(19/20) and WT-C2(19/20) showed a downward 117 trend. After the Spring Festival holiday, the Fmax of WT-C1(19) and WT-C2(19) 118 began to gradually increase due to the orderly recovery of TPDI production. However, 119 owing to the negative impacts of the domestic COVID-19 pandemic, the trough 120 period of WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20) lasted longer. The COVID-19 epidemic broke 121 out in China at the beginning of February in 2020 (Li et al., 2020b). In order to 122 prevent further spread of this epidemic, the holiday was prolonged to February 9th in 123 Jiangsu Province, during which all local industrial plants including TPDI plants was 124 imposed strict shutdowns. Correspondingly, the Fmax of WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20) 125 157 WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20) did not show a rebound trend, but gradually stabilized 158 and fluctuated. In mid-March, the WHO proclaimed that the COVID-19 epidemic 235 SJ-BHGC showed that the water body of downstream received more pollutants 236 comparing to upstream, which could more synthetically reflect the impacts of 237 anthropogenic activities on aquatic environment. Therefore, it was reasonable to 238 select the WT section which was located in the last sampling point downstream of 239 SJ-BHGC as the study section. Fluorescent component similarity and HPSEC 240 analyses demonstrated that the FDOM in water body of SJ-BHGC might be originated 241 from TPDW. The BS-Z area accounted for the higher contribution rate to FDOM in 242 water body of SJ-BHGC than BS-X and BS-Y areas. The temporal variations of , 2020.

            "text": "2020, an unexpected pandemic namely Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept the globe. Countries around the world adopted various positive policies to stop the spread of this pandemic, such as community isolation, school suspension, and work stoppage. Anthropogenic activities would release numerous pollutants to the environment, which were the main driving force for environmental pollution. The implementation of epidemic prevention policies would slow down anthropogenic activities and eventually minimize the input of pollutants to the environment. Liu et al. (2020b) reported that the concentrations of surface air pollutants in China significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparing to the same period in 2019, the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), PM 2.5 , and carbon monoxide (CO) decreased by 23.0%, 15.4%, and 12.5%, respectively, during January-March in 2020. With remote sensing technique, Yunus et al. (2020) found that the concentration of suspended particulate matter in the Vembanad Lake significantly declined by 15.9% during the shutdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the pre-shutdown period. The results from water surface temperature Sentinel-3 data illustrated poor and good water quality on the west coast of Tangier before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively (Cherif et al., 2020). However, what are the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on aquatic environment of China? To our best knowledge, few studies have reported that. The southern area of Jiangsu Province is one of China's economically developed 5 regions. It owns large population and intensive industries, which gives great pressure to aquatic environment. According to the statistics of Jiangsu Statistical Yearbook, the discharge amount of treated wastewater in southern Jiangsu (SJ) region was estimated to be 2.78 billion tons in 2018 (Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Statistics, 2019), ranking the forefront of China. The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal (BHGC) is the oldest and longest canal in the world (Li et al., 2020a). It starts from Beijing in the north and extends to Hangzhou in the south, passing through the four provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, as well as two cities of Beijing and Tianjin. In SJ region, the BHGC is the main receiving water body for wastewater discharge, which runs through Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou city, and connects the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake with a total length of 224 km. The water quality variations of BHGC could reflect the impacts of anthropogenic activities on aquatic environment. Thus, the southern Jiangsu segment of BHGC (SJ-BHGC) was reasonably selected as the study area for this research. Currently, the surface water monitoring network based on conventional water quality parameters (WQPs) has already been constructed in SJ-BHGC. However, the conventional WQPs could only reflect the pollution degree but not the pollution sources for water bodies, which did not meet the requirements of precise environment supervision (Shen et al., 2020, 2021). Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) is a spectrum that simultaneously describes changes of fluorescence intensity with excitation (Ex) and emission (Em) wavelengths. EEM spectrum can reveal the specific feature of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in water bodies, just 6 like painting \"fluorescence fingerprints (FFs)\" for them (Qian et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2021). Owing to the advantages of high sensitivity, strong pollution source identification ability, and fast response speed (Zhang et al., 2020), FF technique based on EEM spectra has received widespread attention in predicting water pollution accidents and tracing the pollutant sources (Carstea et al., 2016; Maqbool et al., 2020). In recent year, the online monitoring instrument (GSeeker \u00ae G-YSY(Z)-2000, China) which can automatically scan and record FFs in real time has already been employed in practical surface water monitoring for some sections of SJ-BHGC. Thus, by selecting a representative monitoring section in SJ-BHGC and analyzing the temporal variations in WQPs and FFs of this section before and after the epidemic, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on aquatic environment of SJ-BHGC can be intuitively revealed.",

The variations in conductivity, COD Mn , NH 3 -N, TN, and TP implied that the ions, organic matters, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents of water body along the SJ-BHGC might own the input and accumulation processes from upstream to downstream. 3.1.2 FF features of water body in SJ-BHGC The typical FFs of water body in SJ-BHGC at different sampling points are shown in Fig. S4. All FFs displayed the same peak location at Ex/Em = 230/340 (BS-Peak T) and 275/325 nm (BS-Peak B), which could be ascribed to tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like peaks, respectively (Yu et al., 2015; Yamamura et al., 2019).

The results of peak-picking analysis implied that 13 all water samples from SJ-BHGC presented similar FDOM features. By EEM-PARAFAC analysis, three fluorescent components namely BS-C1, BS-C2, and BS-C3 were identified and they consisted of Ex/Em pairs at 225(275)/315, 235(280)/340, and 255/445 nm, respectively.

            "text": "to answer this question, the main sources of FDOM in water body of SJ-BHGC must be first identified. In other surface water bodies of SJ region, several previous studies also found fluorescence features that were similar to those of water body in SJ-BHGC (Qiu et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018). Yin et al. (2020) stated that the main sources of FDOM in water bodies of SJ region were probably related to the discharge of TPDW. The TPDI is a traditional pillar industry in Jiangsu Province and SJ is the area with the highest TPDI density in China (Liu et al., 2017). There is approximately 0.2-0.3 billion tons of TPDW discharged into aquatic environment in SJ region per year (Xie and Ruan, 2013; Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Statistics, 2019). Hence, the ratiocination from Yin et al. (2020) seemed reasonable.However, they did not try to confirm their inference.The typical FFs of TPDW from Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou city are shown inFig. S5. For TPDW, two major fluorescent peaks were found at Ex/Em = 230/340 (TPDW-Peak T) and 275/325 nm (TPDW-Peak B), which were commonly ascribed to tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like peaks, respectively (Yu et al., 2015; Yamamura et al., 2019). The contour plots and Ex/Em loadings of two individual fluorescent components decomposed from our FF database of TPDW are presented in Fig. S6. Two fluorescent components, namely TPDW-C1 and TPDW-C2, located at Ex/Em = 220(275)/320 and 230(285)/340 nm, respectively. The fluorophores in TPDW-C1 and TPDW-C2 might be derived from tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like materials (Yu et al., 2015; Yamamura et al., 2019), respectively, and they were closely related to anthropogenic activities. By spectral comparison, the peak locations of BS-Peak T, BS-Peak B, BS-C1, and BS-C2 were all roughly consistent with those of TPDW-Peak T, TPDW-Peak B, TPDW-C1, and TPDW-C2, respectively, indicating that the TPDW might be one of the important sources of FDOM in water body of SJ-BHGC. As shown in Table 1, BS-C1 displayed desirable similarity with TPDW-C1 (0.96) at the \"identical\" level. BS-C2 was highly similar to TPDW-C2 (0.86) at the \"good\" level. It was favorable to see that BS-C1 and BS-C2 presented high similarities with fluorescent components of TPDW, but actually this was not a strong evidence to confirm that the TPDW might be one of the FDOM sources in water body of SJ-BHGC, since similar fluorescent components to BS-C1 and BS-C2 were also found in other natural and engineering environment (Murphy et al., 2011, 2014; Chen et al., 2017a; Lin and Guo, 2020). Thus, the FDOM compositions of TPDW and water body in SJ-BHGC should be investigated. In this study, the HPSEC coupled with fluorescence detector was applied to compare the apparent MW distributions between FDOM of TPDW and water body in SJ-BHGC. Their apparent MW distributions at specific Ex/Em wavelength are shown in Fig. 2. For C1 of JH-5, JH-4, JH-3, and JH-2, one major cluster with MW of 0.43-0.45 kDa and one minor cluster with MW of 1.40-1.50 kDa were eluted at 9.13-9.15 and 8.37-8.41 min, respectively. These apparent MW distributions were roughly consistent with those of C1 of TPDW from XRH, SQ, and SZ plants. In addition, another cluster with MW of 4.72 kDa in C1 of JH-5 was eluted at 7.64 min. One major cluster with MW of 1.59-2.01 kDa was separated at 8.20-8.33 min in C2 of all sampling points in SJ-BHGC. On both sides of this major cluster, JH-4, JH-3, and JH-2, respectively. The apparent MW distributions of C2 of JH-5, JH-4, JH-3, and JH-2 were similar to those of C2 of TPDW from XRH, SQ, and SZ plants. Moreover, there was a cluster with minor MW and long retention time (12.41 min) in C2 of JH-5. In fact, our previous study found that the FDOM source in TPDW was closely related to Dispersant MF, a kind of additive that was commonly used in TPDI (Cheng et al., 2018). For Dispersant MF, its FF (Fig. S7) and apparent MW distributions of FDOM (Fig. 2) were quite similar to those of TPDW and water body in SJ-BHGC. Interestingly, two distinctive clusters in FDOM of JH-5 (C1: 7.64 min and C2: 12.41 min) were also found in chromatogram of Dispersant MF. Dispersant MF consists of sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates, which owns strong solubility in water and cannot be removed during biological treatment (Altenbach and Gier, 1995). Although our previous research found that some chemical oxidation techniques such as Fenton oxidation and chlorination could effectively remove Dispersant MF from TPDW (Cheng et al., 2018), the popularity of chemical oxidation techniques in TPDW treatment plant of SJ region was not desirable due to the cost concerns. Thus, Dispersant MF is easily left over in the effluent and consequently discharged into water environment with TPDW. Municipal wastewater was another major pollution source in SJ region, which also contained tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like components. The FF and chromatogram of municipal wastewater are illustrated in Fig. S8 and Fig. S9. Detailed discussions about FF and chromatogram of municipal wastewater are presented in the Supplementary Material. It was obvious that the FF and chromatogram of municipal wastewater were quite different from those of water body in SJ-BHGC. In recent years, Jiangsu Province has started to put forward more stringent effluent standards for local municipal WWTPs (Qu et al., 2019). To response to the requirements of the government, many municipal WWTPs have reformed their wastewater treatment processes to enhance the removal rate of pollutants. For instance, BH and SH plants have already introduced the chemical oxidation techniques (chlorination and ozonation) into their wastewater treatment processes",

Fmax can be applied to quantitatively analyze the variation features of fluorescent components. The Fmax of each fluorescent component at different sampling points are illustrated in Fig. S10. Interestingly, the fluorescent components of water body along the SJ-BHGC exhibited a regular spatial variation characteristic, that is, the Fmax of BS-C1 and BS-C2 gradually increased from upstream to downstream. BS-C1 and BS-C2 were associated with anthropogenic activities (Yu et al., 2014). For a specific component, the difference in Fmax between any two sampling points is the fluorescence intensity increment for these two sampling points. According to the administrative division of China, the entire SJ-BHGC can be divided into three sections, namely BS-X (JH-1 to JH-3), BS-Y (JH-3 to JH-4), and BS-Z (JH-4 to JH-5). By calculating the ratio of the fluorescence intensity increment of these two components in different areas along the SJ-BHGC to the total fluorescence intensity increment (TFmax), the contributions of anthropogenic activities in different areas to FDOM input in water body could be estimated. For the entire SJ-BHGC, TFmax was the difference between the Fmax of JH-1 and JH-5. The TFmax values of BS-C1 and BS-C2 were 1.79 and 1.61, respectively. For BS-C1, the contribution rates of BS-X, BS-Y, and BS-Z area were 5.1%, 29.2%, and 65.7%, and for BS-C2 were 11.8%, 13.0%, and 75.2%, respectively. Chen et al., (2016) reported that the TPDI number of BS-X, BS-Y, and BS-Z area accounted for approximately 1%, 10%, and 27.5% of the total number of TPDI in Jiangsu Province, respectively. The quantitative relationship of TPDI in these three areas were consistent with the trends of their contribution rates for BS-C1 and BS-C2. This consistency and the finding that the FDOM in water body of SJ-BHGC might mainly originate from the discharge of TPDW collectively provided a reasonable explanation for the variation tendencies of FDOM in water body along the entire SJ-BHGC.It could be found that the water body along the SJ-BHGC owned the identical FDOM features. Fluorescent component similarity and HPSEC analyses revealed that the TPDW might be one of the main pollution sources in water body of SJ-BHGC. In addition, the WQPs values and fluorescent component intensities basically showed upward trends from upstream to downstream, which might be caused by the input and accumulation of pollution sources along the canal. Therefore, comparing to the upstream, the water body of downstream received more pollutants, which could more comprehensively reflect the impacts of anthropogenic activities on aquatic environment.

It is obvious that the industrial wastewater is one of the nonnegligible pollution 9 sources in SJ-BHGC. The decline of industrial activities might reduce the discharge 10 amount of industrial wastewater and consequently result in the improvement of water 11 quality. Before the end of the Spring Festival holiday, the WQPs of 2019 and 2020 12 showed a series of similar variation trends. In mid or late January, almost all WQPs 13 displayed an upward trend and reached the peak value. During this period, it was 14 common for many industrial plants to improve their production in order to ensure that 15 their product sales would not be affected during the Spring Festival holiday. Hence, 16 the discharge amount of industrial wastewater might increase and would in turn cause 17 WQP values to maintain at a higher level or show an upward trend. The SJ region is a 18 labor-intensive area with a great number of migrant workers. When the Spring 19 Festival holiday was coming, these workers returned to their hometown one after 20 another, which reduced the production of industrial plants. As a result, the values of 21 all WQPs showed a significant downward trend in the week before the Spring Festival 22 holiday. During the Spring Festival holiday, the WQP values continued to decrease or 23 remained steady at low level. In this time, the industrial plants in SJ region were all 24 basically in the state of work stoppage. The reduction of discharge amount of 25 industrial wastewater might cause the values of WQPs to continue to decline or 26 fluctuate at low level. 27 After the end of the Spring Festival holiday, the WQPs of 2019 got rid of the 28 downward or low-level fluctuation trend and gradually began to increase or fluctuate 29with high level due to the orderly recovery of industrial production in SJ region.",

From the end of January to the beginning of February in 2020, the COVID-19 confirmed cases 32 continuously increased in China (Li et al., 2020b). To block the spread of the 33 COVID-19 epidemic, all provinces in China implemented the policy of work stoppage. 34 After the Spring Festival holiday, the Jiangsu Province announced that the industrial 35 plants should continue to shut down until February 9th. Kalbusch et al. (2020) 36 confirmed that the industrial activities possessed the greatest reduction in water 37 consumption and the variations of water consumption in residential category was not 38 significant during the lockdown of the COVID-19 epidemic. These results suggested 39 that the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic would significantly change the discharge 40 amount of industrial wastewater, which might give positive impacts on water quality. 41 Therefore, it could be observed from Fig. 4 that the values of turbidity, conductivity, 42 COD Mn , NH 3 -N, TN, and TP continued to decrease or remained stable at low level in 43 this time. After February 10th, the domestic COVID-19 pandemic was still severe. To 44 carry out the various epidemic prevention policies announced by the Chinese 45 government, many workers could not return to SJ region immediately, which enforced 46 the production of industrial plants still remained at low level. Hence, the values of several WQPs did not show a rebound trend. For instance, from February 10th to 48 February 17th, the values of conductivity, COD Mn , and NH 3 -N still gradually 49 decreased and those of turbidity and TN fluctuated at low level. At the beginning of 50 March, the domestic epidemic was basically under control, and the production of 51 industrial plants in SJ region gradually recovered. In this time, the values of turbidity, 52 conductivity, COD Mn , and TP presented an upward trend and those of NH 3 -N and TN 53 still remained at low level. Through the above analyses, it could be found that the 54 water quality of WT section was improved during the outbreak of the domestic 55 COVID-19 epidemic, which might be caused by the collective weakening of production activities for all industries in SJ region. 57 In mid-March of 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the 58 COVID-19 was a new global pandemic, marking the outbreak of the COVID-19 59 pandemic in the world (Salgotra et al., 2020). The outbreak of the international 60 COVID-19 pandemic gave a huge impact to global trade, and the SJ region was no 61 exception. Affected by the global pandemic, many commodities produced in SJ region 62 encountered poor sales. As a result, the production of many industrial plants declined 63 again. Correspondingly, it seemed that the WQP values should present a downward 64 trend. However, this was not the case. After mid-March, different WQPs showed a 65 completely different trends, including rising, falling, and fluctuating. The WQPs 66 reflect the overall concentration of a certain type of pollutant that is affected by 67 multiple pollution sources in water body. The outbreak of the international COVID-19 68 pandemic gave impacts with different levels to the production of various industries, 69 which led to changes with different levels in wastewater discharge patterns for 70 different industries. That was to say, under the influence of the outbreak of the global 71 COVID-19 pandemic, the changes of discharge amount and compositions of various 72 industrial pollution sources were discrepant. Therefore, the variation trends in WQPs 73 that were associated with various pollution sources were not necessarily the same. 74 Obviously, the temporal variations of WQP values did not intuitively reflect the 75 impacts of the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic on aquatic environment of 76 WT section, which needed to be further studied by other techniques.",

The total export trade volume of Jiangsu Province's garment 162 industry is similar to its total domestic trade volume, and accounts for about 20% of 163 the total export trade volume of China's garment industry (Jiangsu Provincial Bureau 164 of Statistics, 2019; General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of 165 China, 2020). As a downstream industry of TPDI, the garment industry is one of the 166 major industries in China's export trade. When the export trade of China's garment 167 industry faced the negative impacts, the requirements of apparel products would 168 decrease and consequently the production activities of TPDI in Jiangsu Province were 169 forced to decline. According to the statistics of China's General Administration of 170 Customs in 2020, the export trade volume of China's garment industry decreased by 171 24.8% and 30.0% in March and April, comparing to the same period in 2019 (General 172 Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China, 2020). Hence, the 173 production activities of TPDI in Jiangsu Province was inhibited, which might lead to 174 the decrease of discharge amount of TPDW. As a result, the Fmax of WT-C1(20) and 175 WT-C2(20) decreased and fluctuated at low level during March-April, 2020. In 176 summary, the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic shrunk the garment export 177 trade of China and therefore led to the decline of production activities of TPDI in SJ 178 region, Thus, the intensities of WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20) decreased again. 179 In this study, by tracking the variations of fluorescence signals that were 180 associated with TPDW, FF technique revealed that how the domestic and global 181 COVID-19 pandemic affected the production of TPDI, the discharge pattern of TPDW, 182 and the water environment of WT section. Obviously, FF technique owned strong 183 abilities in identifying pollution sources and tracking their variations, which could be between Fmax of different fluorescent components and WQPs 188 In view of the simplicity and quickness of FF technique, if fluorescence intensity 189 is highly correlated with WQPs, FF may be used as a surrogate for WQPs in water 190 quality assessment, which can improve supervision efficiency of water environment. 191 Although the relationships between WQP values and fluorescence intensity for some 192 surface water bodies have been investigated in previous studies (Qiu et al., 2012; 193 Sgroi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 194 2020), the relative results are not appropriate to give references to the water body in 195 WT section since the compositions and characteristics of various water bodies are 196 different. To explore the feasibility of using FF as a routine monitoring indicator to 197 reflect water quality, the correlations between Fmax and WQPs of water body in WT 198 section were carried out. The data sources involved in correlation analysis were WQP 199 values and Fmax in 2019 and 2020. Results are presented as the form of heat map, 200 which are shown in Fig. 7. In addition, the p values that revealed significant level for 201 each relationship are tabulated in Table S6. The criteria for describing the strength of 202 the correlation were consulted from the previous studies (Overholser and Sowinski, Fig. 7 The correlations between Fmax of different fluorescent components and WQPs of water 206 body in WT section. 207 208 The Fmax of WT-C1 was highly positively correlated with conductivity 209 (r=0.7375, p<0.01) and COD Mn (r=0.7354, p<0.01) under the significant level.210 Similar correlations were also discovered between Fmax of WT-C2, conductivity 211 (r=0.7183, p<0.01), and COD Mn (r=0.8041, p<0.01). All WQPs did not evidently 212 show a high positive correlation with the Fmax of WT-C3. Since the fluorescence 213 signal was closely related to dissolved organic matters (DOMs), it was common to 214 observe the favorable correlations between fluorescent components and COD Mn (or 215 COD Cr ) in surface water bodies (Carstea et al., 2016; Sgroi et al., 2017; Yang et al., 216 2018; Tang et al., 2019). Zhu et al. (2020) found that the intensity of tryptophan 217 like-component (Ex/Em = 232(274)/338 nm) would present high positive correlation (r>0.700) with conductivity in surface water if the apparent MW of DOM in water 219 body was less than 10 kDa. The r value between the Fmax of C2 and conductivity 220 implied that the apparent MW of DOM in water body of WT section might be 221 relatively low. In general, correlation analysis indicated that the Fmax of C1 and C2 222 might be good indicators for conductivity and COD Mn of water body in WT section. 223 Another interesting result was that the Fmax of WT-C1 and WT-C2 displayed a 224 very high positive correlation under significant level (r=0.9165, p<0.01), which 225 implied a high homology between WT-C1 and WT-C2. High homology between 226 different fluorescent components meant that they might be originated from a common 227 source (Chen et al., 2017b; Tang et al., 2019). As previously discussed, the fluorescent 228 components WT-C1 and WT-C2 might be mainly derived from the FDOM of TPDW. 229 The high homology between WT-C1 and WT-C2 further supported this aimed to investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on 234 aquatic environment of SJ-BHGC. The variations of WQPs and FFs along the WQPs indicated that the water quality was improved due to the collective shutdown 244 of all industries in SJ region during the outbreak of the domestic COVID-19 pandemic. 245 The temporal variations of FFs implied that the intensities of WT-C1(20) and 246 WT-C2(20) significantly decreased during the outbreak of the domestic and global 247 COVID-19 pandemic, which might be related to the shutdown of TPDI in SJ region 248 and the great loss of international apparel trade, respectively. Correlation analysis 249 indicated that the Fmax of WT-C1 and WT-C2 might be applied to predict the 250 conductivity and COD Mn of water body in WT section. Comparing to WQPs, FF 251 technique more explicitly revealed how the domestic and global COVID-19 pandemic 252 affected the aquatic environment, which provided novel insights into water quality 253 variations of SJ-BHGC during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, FF technique 254 also discovered valuable characteristics and pollution causes of water body in 255 SJ-BHGC, which could be considered as a powerful tool for water quality monitoring 256 and water pollution tracing of SJ-BHGC.257 258Declaration of conflicting interests259    The authors declare that we have no known competing financial interests or 260 personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this was funded by the Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development",
