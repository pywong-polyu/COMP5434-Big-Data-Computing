Motivated by a compelling museum case study, and by what we perceive as a lack in indoor trajectory research, we combine aspects of state-of-the-art semantic outdoor trajectory models, with a semanticallyenabled hierarchical symbolic representation of the indoor space, which abides by OGC's IndoorGML standard. We drive the discussion on modeling issues that have been overlooked so far and illustrate them with a real-world case study concerning the Louvre Museum, in an effort to provide a pragmatic view of what the proposed model represents and how. We also present experimental results based on Louvre's visiting data showcasing how state-ofthe-art mining algorithms can be applied on trajectory data represented according to the proposed model, and outline their advantages and limitations. Finally, we provide a formal outline of a new sequential pattern mining algorithm and how it can be used for extracting interesting trajectory patterns.",

In this regard, mobile devices offering location-based services (e.g. way-finding, contextualized content delivery) are becoming an invaluable tool for museums, since they provide them with access to an unprecedented wealth of visitors' movement data. Similar opportunities have appeared in other domains of indoor human mobility such as shopping malls, sports and concert arenas, hospitals, airports, universities [30] . For big museums in particular, the collected visit datasets can be very large, due to the daily tracking of tens of thousands of visitors. Moreover, depending on the implemented system, contextual/semantic data and indoor environment-related data can be gathered in addition to the positional data. What is more, in many cases the localisation process may suffer from imprecision, as it is being altered by the museum's architecture, especially when it has not been originally designed for housing art collections. This places the movement analysis problem in the field of Big Trajectory Data analytics.",

This type of research differs considerably in indoor environments, mainly due to interior architectural components constraining (or otherwise affecting) the way people move. For example, an indoor trajectory model has to consider multiple ways of entering a room, floor changes, specific locations of building entrances/exits, sensor coverage gaps due to obstacles, sensor detection area overlaps due to different floors, movement data of varying spatial granularity, and other challenges. In addition, indoor trajectory analytics may gain from avoiding cumbersome calculations over geometric representations of space and objects within it, that are typical of outdoor environments. Instead, operations such as intersection, containment, and proximity can be simplified in order to prioritize the non-geometric aspects of movement [28] , instead of metric aspects typically focused on Euclidean distances from potential targets.",

As identified by Peuquet in [47] and further explored in [5, 6] , there are three fundamental sets pertinent to movement, representing the where (set of locations), when (set of instants or intervals), and what (set of objects) of spatiotemporal data. This is true across applications as well as across application domains. Distinguishing between semantics of time, semantics of places, and semantics of moving objects (MOs), in addition to the semantics of movement itself, could empower a synergistic interplay between different types of semantics. Such semantic information can be derived either from the MO's environment or from external data sources. It can then be used to add a meaningful dimension to raw Big Trajectory Data. Unfortunately, semantic trajectory models have -to a large extent -targeted outdoor settings.",

For example, a MO does not traverse as long traveling distances, nor does it reach as high speeds, when indoors. Therefore, a museum visitor might still be visiting, whether standing in front of a particular painting or steadily walking across a hall full of paintings, and a shopping mall client might still be shopping, whether standing in front of a specific product stand or steadily walking across retail corridors. Thus, the distinction between walking and standing still is not nearly as useful as the distinction between stops and moves typically found in outdoor trajectories. On the other hand, the adoption of some modeling approaches, such as the segmentation of trajectories into episodes and the use of semantic annotations, seems to be promising for indoor environments as well.",

These goals mainly concern the improvement of the visitor experience, the managerial decision making, and the visitor crowd management processes. For all three types however, the indoor context and the semantic aspect of movement remain key modeling elements. By intertwining the model of visitor trajectories with a model of the museum space, an individual visitor may enjoy personalized location-based services such as a dynamic itinerary update based on the congestion levels in the exhibition spaces. At the same time, the museum management may optimize emergency evacuation routes, taking into account each visitor's profile (e.g. reduced mobility). Such goals can only be achieved if the trajectory model is actually aware of the indoor network topology as well as aware of the contextual information regarding the space (e.g. congestion level, function), the visitor (e.g. demographics, guide usage), and the movement itself (e.g. resting, being lost).",

The proposed model makes use of a standardized indoor space modeling framework, instead of modeling space on a 2D coordinate reference system, as is typically the case. It integrates semantic annotations at different levels in order to allow a detailed description of the movements. Moreover, the model is developed with the Big Trajectory Data mining and analysis task support in mind. To achieve this, we first run existing pattern mining algorithms on trajectory data following a SITM-based formalism, and we identify their advantages and limits with respect to the expressiveness of SITM. Finally, we propose corresponding improvements to be integrated in new trajectory pattern mining algorithms.",

Its core module considers an indoor space as a set of non-overlapping cells that represent its smallest organizational/structural units: S = {c 1 , c 2 , ..., c n }, c i \u2229 c j = \u2205. Technically, IndoorGML describes a hybrid indoor space model since it captures the topological information of cells as well as an optional quantitative description of their spatial characteristics. The cell space and the topological relationships among its objects are represented by one or more Node-Relation Graphs (NRGs), simplifying complex spatial relationships based on graph theory concepts [36] and the Poincar\u00e9 duality in particular. More specifically, a cell (e.g. room) becomes a node and a cell boundary (e.g. a thin wall) becomes an edge. If cell boundary semantics are also taken into account (e.g. doors, walls, ramps) then a connectivity and/or an accessibility NRG may be derived as well. Connectivity suggests that there exists an opening in the common boundary of two cells. Accessibility additionally suggests that the opening can be crossed by the MO.",

Each NRG is treated as a separate graph layer. Nodes belonging to different layers are connected via inter-layer joint edges. While intra-layer edges represent either adjacency, connectivity, or accessibility relations between non-overlapping cells, joint edges denote potential locations where a physical object might actually reside. Therefore, given that a physical object may be in only one cell of each layer at any given point in time (called the active state), joint edges express all the valid active state combinations (called overall states) and are derived by pairwise cell intersection. Equivalently, a joint edge represents any of the eight binary topological relationships derived by the n-intersection model [20] , except for disjoint and meet, because a physical object can not simultaneously coexist in two cells that are completely disjoint or simply touch each other. In Fig. 1 for example, if a visitor is inside the hall represented as node 5 in layer i+1, then the joint edges suggest that he can only be in either 5a, or 5b, or 5c in layer i.",

In [31] , the authors define an IndoorGML hierarchical graph as a direct adaptation of the hierarchical graph definition of [58] . The overlap relation is excluded from the joint edges of a hierarchical graph, which are explicitly mentioned to represent equal, coveredBy and inside relations. For instance, in Fig. 1 , nodes 1, 2, and 3 in layer i+1 would be assumed to connect via three joint equal edges to their counterparts in layer i, while nodes 4 and 5 would be assumed to connect to nodes 4a, 4b and 5a, 5b, 5c respectively, via joint coveredBy edges. However, the authors only provide some general partitioning criteria for how to properly choose which hierarchical levels to include in the model, such as splitting cells that have multiple properties or that are too big. On the same matter, in [18] the authors recognize that spatial cell subdivision may be driven both by the architectural structure of the building and by the function of space. They propose a categorization of specific criteria to automate this procedure: geometry-driven criteria (e.g. split if some cell dimension surpasses a certain value), topology-driven criteria (e.g. split depending on which cells a cell is connected to before/after the split), semantics-driven criteria (e.g. split depending on what type of cells a cell is connected to) and navigation-driven criteria (e.g. split if a cell has both walkable and non-walkable parts). Despite the fact that they focus on furnished 3D indoor spaces, their categorization can also be useful for 2D representations of space, but the specific splitting mechanism may differ considerably from case to case.",

In the same work, a purposefully generic way of semantically segmenting a trajectory into stops and moves was also established, leaving its implementation to be specified at the application level. For example, Alvares et al adopted in [3] the previous model and defined stops based on temporal stay value thresholds. Similarly, Bogorny et al adopted in [9] the conceptual trajectory model from [55] and associated stops with important visited places, before extending it with fundamental data mining concepts (in the form of classes, attributes, methods) in order to support the tasks of frequent patterns, sequential patterns, and association rules. Thus, it defined a semantic trajectory as a sequence < I 1 , I 2 , ..., I n > where each I k represents a stop or a move having a spatial and a temporal dimension.",

Their framework exhaustively categorizes the types of information that can be represented by movement data. First, it breaks movement down to its most essential elements: the set of locations S (space), the set of time units T (time instants or intervals), and the set of objects O (physical and abstract entities). The elements of these sets may have properties represented as spatial, temporal, or thematic attribute values, which in turn may involve other elements of S, T , O. Within this framework, movement in general can be seen as a collection of spatial events, represented by the mapping \u03c4 : T \u2192 S (single mover) or \u03bc : O \u00d7 T \u2192 S (multiple movers). Semantic modeling is however not addressed, apart from dynamic thematic attributes which represent any attribute available in the movement data or \"any other existing or conceivable thing\".

Even the basic concept of episodes can be viewed as a generalization from stop-move segments to more diverse and heterogeneous semantics. In addition, such semantics have largely concerned outdoor contexts, as made evident by the terminology (e.g. traveling objects [55] ) and definitions introduced. On the contrary, a model for semantic trajectories in indoor environments needs to at least consider the building's topology and space semantics. The interior of buildings is typically divided into clearly delimited spatial entities such as rooms, halls, corridors, floors. This physical segmentation already holds a considerable amount of semantic information. Naturally, more types of semantics can be expected to become relevant given the increasing interest in context-aware location based services and applications (e.g. context-aware museum guidance [34] ).

For the indoor space representation, an important modeling decision is whether G is directed or not. Although IndoorGML does not explicitly assume either case, it considers undirected edges in all of its examples. As far as intra-layer edges go, we can think of adjacency and connectivity as being symmetric relations. However, accessibility is not symmetric since often indoor movement is only unidirectionally possible due to technical, safety or other limitations. In Fig. 1 for example, Room4 (Salle des\u00c9tats) houses the Mona Lisa and accommodates a vast number of visitors on a daily basis. To facilitate their flow, entering it from Room2 is often prohibited by the museum personnel while exiting it that way is allowed. Therefore, we assume directed accessibility NRGs. As far as joint edges go, while overlap and equal can be thought of as symmetric binary relations, contains and covers can not. Therefore, we also assume directed joint edges (as can be seen in Fig. 2 ). If we wanted to simply model intersection non-emptiness, instead of the specific nature of the relation, then undirected joint edges would suffice.",

In that case, thanks to the transitivity of parthood (isomorphic to set inclusion) in classical mereology, each layer hierarchy only needs to connect to other layers or layer hierarchies at the lowest possible level, since an equal or overlap relation between two nodes means that an overlap relation also holds between any two of their respective predecessors. Related to this, our graph representation assumes that the indoor area designated by each node is fully covered by the areas represented by its child nodes, discussed in more detail in Section 4.2.",

For example, is a floor fully covered by the rooms it contains? Similarly, is a room fully covered by the RoIs it contains, or are there coverage gaps as in Fig. 1 ? Although not explicitly stated, the IndoorGML standard and related works (e.g. [31] ) adhere to a full space coverage assumption. We consider the same to be true in our model. This has the advantage that accessibility relations need only be captured at the lowest possible level of the hierarchy, from where they can be exhaustively inferred for the higher levels. For example, if we assume that each Louvre wing's floor (parent node) is fully covered by its zones (child nodes), then the zone-level accessibility topology is enough to automatically deduce the floor-level one. The reason is that, if two floors contain no zones that are directly accessible one from the other, then neither can these floors be reciprocally directly accessible.",

In our model, we do not make this often unrealistic (e.g. for proximity detection devices [42] ) assumption. Simply put, if at some point the MO is not detected anywhere, then its position is considered to be unknown and open to further estimation.

Therefore, when a visitor transitions from the Beatrice d'Este RoI to the Battle Scene RoI (Fig. 7) , his/her trace is briefly lost, because the two regions are disjoint and thus not directly accessible from each other. If deemed necessary to address this, a complement node representing the spatial area of the room excluding the areas of all its RoI children nodes, may be added to the RoI NRG. It is then up to the application-level Fig. 7 Indicative RoIs contained within two ground floor thematic zones logic to infer whether the visitor is in the remaining area of the room or if for a while he left the room altogether. Obviously, the RoI topology can play a critical role in determining this. An alternative approach would be to simply switch to a geometric representation at the intra-room level and encode the RoIs' surfaces in it, effectively adopting a hybrid indoor space representation [1] . Despite its advantage of increased precision, this approach would need to rely on a correspondingly precise data acquisition infrastructure. Which of the two approaches is preferable depends highly on the particular case. It may well be enough even to simply assume the visitor's presence in the room containing the last known RoI detection, until further re-appearance in another RoI.",

For instance, we know that the visit beginning in zone \"N-2:P\" is normal because this is one of the Louvre's entrance zones (either through the glass pyramid or through the Richelieu passage). In general, validation against entrance/exit nodes allows us to distinguish truncated visits from complete visits. This can be represented as an entrance class of nodes. As another example, zones \"D-1:DS\" and \"D0:DS\" represent the big Daru staircase which also serves as a resting place for visitors [65] . This can be semantically represented as a particular staircase class of nodes. Therefore, what might seem as an inexplicably long time spent transitioning from one floor to another, can now be appropriately interpreted and treated. More generally, the Louvre contains numerous eponymous staircases which can even be appreciated as artworks by themselves (e.g. HenryII, HenryIV, Lefuel, Mollien, du Midi, de la Colonnade). These can be spatially captured as nodes in the zone-layer NRG, instead of as edges (appropriate for smaller or less significant ones). Another type of space semantics, zone admissibility, can function as a criterion for dividing the example's main trajectory into three episodes: Such semantics may be either explicitly given in the form of additional data, or derived from the spatiotemporal movement data. For example, we may explicitly know that the visitor bought a normal ticket, or we may derive it from the fact that he entered the permanent but not the temporary exhibition, which is hosted in zone \"N-2:E\" and requires a separate ticket. Similarly, we may explicitly know the visitor's interest in ancient Greek art as stated in the mobile application's profile section, or we may infer it from the proportionally larger amount of time spent in the respective zones.",

For instance, in the trajectory example of Fig. 10 , the segment consisting of tuples 1-5 corresponds to entering the Louvre's permanent exhibition space. However, the part of it consisting of tuples 1-3, corresponds more specifically to buying a ticket, and can therefore also meaningfully stand on its own. More generally, we may wish to model situations where one or more episodes (e.g. \"buy ticket\") are contained within a broader episode (e.g. \"enter exhibition\"), in turn taking place within an overarching episode (e.g. \"see Mona Lisa\"). There may even be multiple such containment instances within the same trajectory, as in the example of Fig. 10 , where tuples 17-19 correspond to \"exiting the museum\" premises, whereas tuple 19 alone corresponds to \"shopping\" for gifts and souvenirs.",

An exception is the Arts D\u00e9coratifs Europ\u00e9ens zone (\"R+1:ADE\") on the +1 floor of the Richelieu wing being the second most visited zone, but at the same time much larger than most others. Finally, as evident from its light color in Fig. 11 , the +2 floor is considerably less visited than the rest. This spatial imbalance of visitor attendance during the first half of 2017 may still be relevant today. After a record-breaking attendance of 10.2 million visitors in 2018 [39] , the Louvre Museum implemented an online time-slot booking system which helped spread its 9.6 million visitors in 2019 [40] throughout the day, but not throughout the exhibition spaces. For instance, the Leonardo da Vinci temporary exhibition has recently managed to attract over a period of four months more than 1 million visitors [41] in zone \"N-2:E \" alone. Therefore, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and as museums resume operation post-containment, an attempt at re-balancing the attractiveness of the different areas could be envisaged, although more direct measures such as, limiting the daily number of visitors, modifying visitor reception processes, and regulating more heavily the visitor flow, are certainly easier to implement in the short term and expected to produce more controllable results.",

Then, MiSTA recursively performs either enlargement (i.e. adding a new element to the last item of the prefix) or extension (i.e. adding a new element to the prefix) projections. The actual temporal annotations of the input TASs (called dataset points) are used to build corresponding hyper-cubical influence areas in the annotation space.

Next, they are merged and partitioned into disjoint hyper-rectangles, which allows all prefix occurrences whose corresponding dataset points do not contribute to any dense region to be deleted before any new projection. Consequently, if a T-sequence contains no useful prefix occurrence, it can be deleted as well. Finally, the projection process itself stops when less than supp min T-sequences remain.",

This assumption does not induce any changes in the MiSTA algorithm itself. -Instead of attributing each temporal annotation to the transition between two consecutive items, we attribute it to the duration of stay in the first item, which represents the spatial entity of departure.

Extracting Louvre visitor trajectory patterns Before the actual mining process, we need to first pre-process the original trajectory dataset and tranform it into TAS form. First, we filter out any zone detection record with duration equal to 0. This leads to the deletion of 2,135 out a total of 20,245 records. Secondly, in 1,080 of those cases, the previous and the subsequent (to the deleted one) zones actually coincide, which constitutes further indication that the deleted zones are indeed errors. We merge those into a single zone in order to avoid any identical items appearing consecutively in the input TASs. Thirdly, we filter out all trajectories containing less than 3 zones. We opt for a low threshold value, taking into account the coarse spatiotemporal granularity of the available trajectory data, as well as their length distribution being left-skewed (Fig. 3) . Finally, even though SITM can represent temporal gaps in the trajectories, MiSTA does not allow for gaps in the sequences. Therefore, we need to either erase all periods of visitor non-detection, or assume that the visitor is actually continuously located in the last known zone until he is re-detected in a different one. Given that the duration values are on the low side of what would normally be expected for a museum, we adopt the second approach as more realistic.",

As expected and confirmed by the curve's push to the right (Fig. 13) , taking into account the detection gaps in the original trajectory dataset increases the values of the temporal annotations in MiSTA's input TAS dataset. After trying out lower (i.e. stricter) and higher (i.e. more relaxed) values, we opted for \u03c4 =117 sec, equal to the median zone stay duration value. In practice, this means that MiSTA will count a projected pattern's occurrence in the input TAS data only as long as all of the corresponding annotations differ by less than 2 minutes. Table 3 contains the frequent TAS patterns of length equal to 3, enabling us to derive additional insight compared to the purely sequential approach of Section 4.3. Interestingly, all four patterns involve two types of movement taking place in two different parts of the museum, both characterized by a floor-switching back and forth type of behavior. In addition, they do not take place in the busiest parts of the museum like the ones identified in Section 4.3, which means that their support values are not much higher than their \u03c4 -support values. However, due to the fact that MiSTA involves a lossy step of merging frequent annotation intervals, we do not report any specific \u03c4 -support values because there is no approximation guarantee other than their being higher than supp min =5%. Instead, we include the contiguous sequence support which corresponds to requiring direct transitions only. We notice that the two patterns in the Arts d\u00e9coratifs europ\u00e9ens and Sculptures France Marly zones of the Richelieu wing (\"R+1:ADE\" and \"R0:SFM\") are almost always contiguous, whereas the two patterns in the Antiquit\u00e9s\u00c9gyptiennes zones of the Sully wing (\"S0:AE\" and \"S+1:AE\") more often include intermediate transitions. Also interestingly, the former two patterns contain more restricted duration intervals than the latter two, which suggests that visitors spend a more specific amount of time in that part of the Richelieu wing. Further interpretation of the reported time intervals is outside the scope of this illustrative experiment. Finally, we report on a few important implementation details. First, MiSTA counts each TAS pattern only once per input TAS, even when it appears multiple times in the same input TAS. In some application cases, this may not be the most desired way to calculate \u03c4 -support, particularly true for datasets containing long episodic trajectories. Secondly, as already explained, due to how \u03c4 -containment is defined [24] , the TAS patterns reported by MiSTA are not necessarily contiguous. In such case, the corresponding annotation describes how long the visitor stayed in all of the zones combined, leading up to the next zone in the pattern. Again, a contiguous variation may be interesting depending on the case. Thirdly, since MiSTA's annotations were originally designed to describe the transitions and the last item of each TAS is not followed by any transition, the duration of stay in the last zone of any trajectory is lost during its transformation to an input TAS. Technically, this issue can be easily solved by adding an \"EXIT\" item at the end of each TAS. This does not alter the mining output, apart from adding any frequent trajectory-ending patterns that contain the newly included interval.",

If trajectories are represented using SITM or any other sequence-based model, then a subset of those techniques relevant to sequential pattern mining [23] becomes particularly interesting in the Big Trajectory Data context. Typically, such techniques distribute the dataset in order to perform the counting step in parallel, although the candidate search space may also be split instead [7] . It actually depends on the specific dataset and the specific computing framework, which approach is most suitable, due to factors such as load balancing and communication costs. Even the type of method plays an important role as for example pattern growth methods have smaller memory footprints than candidate generation methods [4] . For example, sub-datasets of very different structure may be formed and cause some of the locally executed pattern mining methods to suffer in terms of computational cost. For instance, the MiSTA algorithm [24] used in Section 5.2 is very sensitive with respect to the length of the input TASs, which is why the trajectory dataset needs to be carefully split. Alternatively, the search space can be split thanks to the prefix-projection exploration mechanism.",

Our indoor space representation differs mainly in that it requires a static hierarchy of three basic layers (building, floor, room) and proposes two more typical layers (building complex, intra-room region of interest), thus avoiding ad-hoc subdivisions of space. Over this space representation, we introduced a semantic indoor trajectory model called SITM, by coupling each visitor's sequences of presence intervals in symbolic indoor areas, with semantic annotations and flexible concept definitions.",

Also, modeling virtual instead of physical trajectories could be compelling in the museum domain, where an attention-based interpretation of visitor movement can be even more important than one based on physical presence. Furthermore, with respect to the analysis of semantic trajectories, we plan to implement our proposal of combining the temporal and multidimensional aspects of sequential pattern mining methods, also adding topological information in the mining process, in order to derive interesting indoor mobility behaviors. Also, we plan to test parallel versions of our algorithms in order to scale up the analysis. With regards to the Louvre case in particular, it is interesting to account for the problem of data sparsity by restructuring longer indicative visits from the actual fragmented zone sequences.",
