In this work we investigated personal optimism and collective pessimism as psychological processes that contribute to hampering vs. promoting the demand for redistribution. Our prediction was that support for redistribution would require both a pessimistic economic outlook at the collective level and the perception of being economically disadvantaged. In two studies, one of which pre-registered, Italian participants (Study 1: N = 306; Study 2: N = 384) were led to feel relatively poor or rich, rated their perceived control over either their personal or the nation's future and estimated either personal or national economic and general future risks. To measure support for redistribution, participants were invited to allocate their desired level of taxation to each of the five tax brackets included in the Italian personal income tax. Results showed that participants were optimistic about their personal future, but pessimistic about the fate of their nation. This difference was explained by respondents' greater perceived control over personal future than over the nation's future. Importantly, greater pessimism about national economic risks led to greater support for progressive taxation only for participants who felt relatively poor.",

For instance, the 2020 annual report of Oxfam, entitled \"Public Good or Private Wealth\", proposes to \"end the under-taxation of rich individuals and corporations\", to \"tax wealth and capital at fairer levels\", to \"stop increasing economic inequality people tend to focus more on the individual [45] . This focus on the self rather than on the collective may make people unrealistically optimistic, thus discouraging them from demanding redistribution. On the contrary, we will demonstrate experimentally that a pessimistic economic outlook at the collective level, combined with the feeling of being disadvantaged, can motivate individuals to embrace redistribution policies. A pessimistic economic outlook is typically interpreted as undesirable by economists, as it encourages precautionary saving at the expense of spending [46] [47] [48] . Overall, indeed, when their views about the personal and national economic situation (commonly referred to as consumer confidence) are optimistic, people tend to increase spending; conversely, when these same views become pessimistic, expenditure, which many experts consider the driving force of any national economy, decreases [46] .",

            "text": "Unlike economists, social psychologists, at least under some circumstances, can look positively at a pessimistic outlook, in that it may be the driving force of social change. For instance, according to relative deprivation theory [49] , to predict responses to wealth and income inequalities we must consider people's subjective interpretation of their lot in life. The theory posits that feelings of relative deprivation depend on three types of social comparisons that people make: interpersonal (whereby people feel that they are personally deprived relative to others), intergroup (whereby people feel that their ingroup is deprived relative to another group), and past/present comparisons (whereby people feel that they, or their ingroup, are deprived relative to the past). Research has long demonstrated that feelings of relative deprivation, especially those based on intergroup comparisons, increase the likelihood of collective action aimed at promoting social change and redressing inequality [50] [51] [52] . The relation between relative deprivation based on intergroup comparisons and collective action targeting redistribution policies, however, is by no means linear and can be moderated by third variables, such as system-justifying beliefs [53, 54] . Nonetheless, requests for redistribution are difficult to imagine unless one feels deprived and is pessimistic about the future.",

The same principle seems to apply to support for redistribution policies in the economic realm. For instance, Ravallion and Lokshin analyzed responses of 7000 Russian adults surveyed in 1996 [56] . According to these survey data, support for governmental redistribution was stronger among citizens who put themselves on the low end of the social and economic ladder and expected their welfare to decline in the near future. Support for redistributive social policies was found to be higher even among those respondents who were wealthy according to objective indicators but perceived that their economic situation had deteriorated relative to the past and, at the same time, were pessimistic about the future. By contrast, a negligible demand for redistribution emerged among citizens who perceived themselves to be well-off and expected to be better-off in the future.",

Conversely, citizens who considered that the economic shock they had experienced in 2008 was temporary and were optimistic about the economic situation in the near future did not show support for progressive taxation. Overall, these findings show that only people who feel deprived and believe that things will get worse support redistribution, probably because they expect to benefit the most from redistributive policies.",

Drawing from the concept of relative deprivation, the first precondition is dissatisfaction with current personal economic situation, regardless of one's objective socio-economic status. The second crucial precondition is a person's expectation for the future: only a pessimistic economic outlook seems to motivate people to demand social programs aimed at redressing wealth and income inequalities. At the same time, however, these results raise an interesting question. How is it possible that many people continue to maintain a positive outlook on themselves and their future prospects even in the light of increasing wealth and income inequalities, of the relative impoverishment of a large part of the population, and after experiencing major economic crises such as the one of 2008?",

For example, across three experiments with samples from different countries (i.e., Spain, Australia and the United States), S\u00e1nchez-Rodr\u00edguez and collaborators manipulated the degree of economic inequality in a fictional society [45] . Results show that high economic inequality enhanced the perception that people in society are more independent, more involved in exchange relationships, more likely to prioritize their personal goals, more competitive and less cooperative. In contrast, low economic inequality triggered the perception that societal norms encompass interdependence, involvement in communal relationships, and the prioritization of group goals. Therefore, with increasing of economic inequality, people tend to focus more on themselves rather than on the collective. This matter is important. The focus on the self may indeed make people unrealistically optimistic, possibly discouraging them from demanding redistribution.",

First, people reason quite distinctly about themselves and the collective, showing a very stable optimism regarding the future of their personal situation but pessimism about the future of the collective (i.e., their country or the world). Second, especially in countries with high levels of economic inequality people tend to focus more on themselves rather than on the collective. This confirms that, making them unrealistically optimistic, the focus on the self may trigger people's fear of being hurt by redistribution policies in the future, thus hampering the demand for such policies. Conversely, making them pessimistic by shifting their focus on the collective may be a crucial (but still under-researched) requirement for people to support redistribution.",

There are many cognitive and motivational reasons for why people maintain an exaggerated positive outlook at their personal future even in the face of disconfirming evidence. These include selective information processing (beliefs are updated faster in response to positive than to negative information [65] ), differential mentalizing (positive future events are envisaged in greater detail and as closer in time than negative events [65] ), and the fact that being optimistic about the future may be adaptive, as it reduces stress and anxiety, ultimately benefitting physical and psychological health and survival [84] . All these mechanisms contribute to producing personal optimism that is resistant to change. An additional process is a person's perceived control over outcomes [85] , which, we believe, is particularly informative not only about personal optimism per se, but also about the asymmetry between personal optimism and collective pessimism.",

In line with this interpretation, personal optimism is particularly strong for events that are believed to be under personal control. For instance, people tend to show greater personal optimism about events they perceive to be more controllable, such as car accidents or alcohol and drug dependence, but less so about events such as heart attack, cancer, or being victimized by burglary, that are typically perceived as uncontrollable, or more difficult to prevent [64, 88] . Moreover, research has shown that personal optimism is particularly pronounced in countries such as the U.S. and Canada, where personal responsibility and control are deeply ingrained in culture [87, 89] . Thus, both comparisons between types of risks (i.e., controllable vs. uncontrollable) and between countries confirm that personal optimism is, in large part, a reflection of underlying (illusory) control beliefs.",

It is logical that people envisage to have greater control over their personal fate than over that of their nation or the world (i.e., the collective). Hence, if the driving force of personal optimism is perceived personal control over events, then collective pessimism may be due to the fact that people view events of a collective character as only to a minimal extent under their personal control. In line with this assumption, it has been demonstrated that collective pessimism increases with increasing spatial distance between the object of evaluation and the self. For instance, people are more optimistic about the future of their local community than about that of their nation or the world [90] . If we assume that personal control decreases with increasing spatial distance from the self, these findings would support the explanation based on perceived personal control. Together, the above literature suggests that the difference between personal optimism and collective pessimism may be explained, at least in part, by the fact that people perceive greater personal control in the former than in the latter case.",

One way to reduce wealth and income inequalities is to raise more tax revenue from those most able to pay. However, despite rising levels of wealth and income inequalities, in many developed countries the richest are still undertaxed [91] and public support for redistribution through more progressive taxation is very low [92] . For example, in Italy the top rate of personal income tax is 43% compared to 72% in 1975, and current legislative proposals aim at further reducing or even eliminating progressivity of personal income tax (i.e., flat tax). Therefore, to investigate support for concrete redistribution policies aimed at redressing wealth and income inequalities, in the present work we focused on progressive taxation. Specifically, we invited participants to allocate their desired level of taxation to each of the five tax brackets included in the Italian personal income tax (i.e., the IRPEF).",

Specifically, support for more progressive taxation requires both the perception of being economically disadvantaged and a pessimistic economic outlook at the collective level. In order to investigate these two mechanisms and their interactive effects, we pursued two goals. First, we aimed at showing that the asymmetry between personal optimism and collective pessimism is explained in large parts by perceived personal control. To test the role of personal control, we activated either a personal or collective mind-set and invited participants to rate their personal control over either their own future (personal mind-set) or the nation's future (collective mind-set). We then assessed personal optimism and collective pessimism by asking participants to estimate either personal or collective expected economic risks (e.g., risks related to future economic problems or future salaries). In addition to specific economic risks we also assessed general risks both at the personal (e.g., the risk of getting involved in a car accident) and collective level (e.g., the risk that a powerful earthquake will hit Italy). We expected to find personal optimism and collective pessimism both for economic and general risks. However, we predicted that only economic (but not general) risks would be related to redistribution. Our specific hypotheses were that: Hypothesis 1. Participants would perceive greater control over their own future than over the nation's future.",

We assumed that a pessimistic economic outlook at the collective level (i.e., collective economic pessimism) would trigger a preference for more progressive taxation only among individuals who feel economically disadvantaged in the society. As discussed in the introduction section, considerable evidence shows that redistributive policies are supported more strongly not only by citizens who actually are, but also by those who feel economically disadvantaged [93] [94] [95] . Since poor and rich people differ on an unknown number of variables other than wealth and income, in the present work we decided to manipulate relative economic hardship vs. prosperity experimentally. We restricted our samples to individuals with the same income range (1200-1800 Euros per month) and invited participants to provide information about their socio-economic situation. Then, we led participants to feel relatively poor or well-off, by informing them that, on the basis of the collected information, their socio-economic status was low vs. high. We therefore predicted that: Hypothesis 4. Support for progressive taxation would be an interaction function of feeling relatively poor (vs. well-off) and being in a collective (vs. personal) mind-set. Thus, greater pessimism about collective (vs. personal) economic risks would lead to greater support for progressive taxation only for participants who felt relatively poor.",

Those who agreed to participate in the study were scheduled for an appointment and then visited by the experimenter at their homes, where they completed the relevant tasks individually on a laptop computer. A total of 355 participants completed the survey. The sample consisted of 159 men (45%) and 192 women (55%), including 305 (87%) employees, 43 (12%) self-employed, and 3 (1%) retired persons. Participants were all Italians and their age ranged from 27 to 72 years (M age = 45.79, SD = 10.57). Most respondents had a high school diploma (n = 153; 44%) or a university degree (n = 160; 45%), whereas 38 participants (11%) had the lowest formal qualification. All participants had a personal monthly income ranging from 1200 to 1800 euros. We decided to limit the personal monthly income of our sample to this range because, according to a recent national study [97] , Italians' average monthly income is around 1500 euros. Importantly, we believed that the more homogeneous our sample was with respect to monthly income range, the more the manipulation of participants' socio-economic status would be likely to be effective, as this allowed us to avoid the potentially confounding variables that typically covary with individuals' actual socio-economic status (e.g., political orientation, tax attitudes, system justification). Recruits volunteered in the experiment without monetary compensation. Participants performed the relevant tasks in the same order as presented below. Procedure. After consenting to participate in the study, respondents filled out one of the 4 surveys, depending on the randomly assigned condition. The surveys were divided into three sections and included the same measures in the same order. In Section 1, participants rated their current mood and provided information about gender, age, level of education, and profession. To assure a fairly homogeneous sample with respect to income, our plan was that only respondents with a personal monthly income between 1200 and 1800 euros would be eligible for the study. Therefore, participants were invited to indicate their personal monthly income on one of two 5-income range scales. Both scales included the \"1200-1800 euros\" range. However, depending on the manipulated socio-economic status condition to which participants had been assigned to, the \"1200-1800 euros\" range was the second (i.e., low socio-economic status condition) or the fourth (i.e., high socio-economic status condition) income range of the scale. If a participant marked the \"1200-1800 euros\" income range, continued the experiment. Conversely, if a participant selected a different income range, the survey would be interrupted, the participant fully debriefed, thanked and then dismissed. Subjects eligible for the study then provided data on family size, composition and basic characteristics of its current members. Next, they were informed that the software would calculate their socio-economic status on the basis of the collected information. Immediately afterwards, participants were shown a picture of a social ladder with 10 rungs and learned that the software had placed them on the third (i.e., low socio-economic status condition) or the seventh rung (i.e., high socioeconomic status condition) of the social ladder.",

Each scale included 5 income ranges. However, in the low socio-economic status condition, the 1200-1800 euro-range was the second (i.e., up to 1200 euros, 1200-1800 euros, 1800-2400 euros, 2400-3000 euros, more than 3000 euros), whereas in the high socio-economic status condition it was the fourth euro-range of the scale (i.e., 0-300 euros, 300-700 euros, 700-1200 euros, 1200-1800 euros, more than 1800 euros). Moreover, to increase participants' focus on the place of their personal income on the scale, a different background color was used to highlight each of the 5 ranges, with nuances varying from red (first and lower income range), over orange and yellow (second and third), to light and dark green at the upper part of the scale (fourth and fifth income range). Therefore, in the low socio-economic status condition the background of the 1200-1800 euro-range was colored orange, whereas in the high socio-economic status condition it was colored light green. The manipulation is reported in S1 Fig. After indicating their personal monthly income, participants provided information on family size, composition of its current members (i.e., number of family members below 18 years of age) and the number of people contributing to the family income.

The aim of the comparative strategy is to find out whether people think that their risk of experiencing a negative event is lower (or higher) than the average peer' s risk, not whether their risk is lower (or higher) than the actual risk. To investigate comparative risk estimates, participants may be asked for a \"direct\" comparison, in which they judge whether their own risk is smaller, greater, or the same as their peers' risk, or for an \"indirect\" comparison, providing separate risk estimates for themselves and others. In the present work, we assessed personal optimism and collective pessimism using the \"direct\" comparative method. Therefore, we created a brief scale including 7 hypothetical events referring, depending on condition, either to personal (the individual participant) or to collective risks (the nation). Of these, 4 events, which were of primary interest to our study, were economic risks. These events were identical, but framed so as to refer either to personal or collective risks (i.e., personal economic risks: \"Being able to manage economic problems\"; \"Needing to ask for a loan to pay off a debt\"; \"Getting a very good salary\"; \"Job loss or getting fired\"; collective economic risks: \"Number of families in Italy with economic problems\"; \"Number of families in Italy asking for a loan to pay off a debt\"; \"Number of families in Italy relying on a very good salary\"; \"Number of families in Italy without income because of job loss or dismissal\"), depending on the randomly assigned mind-set condition. The remaining 3 events were, depending on condition, either personal (i.e., \"Getting divorced\"; \"Being in a car accident\"; \"Developing drinking problems\") or collective (i.e., \"A grave flood hitting Italy\"; \"A powerful earthquake hitting Italy\"; \"Solving problems of waste in Italy\") general risks. The two versions of the scale are reported in S1 File. For each event, respondents indicated the probability that it may happen to them personally (vs. Italy) in the next twenty years, compared to the average of persons of their same age and sex (vs. the average of OCSE nations) on scales ranging from -3 (absolutely below average) to +3 (absolutely above average), with 0 as the midpoint (within the average). Thus, participants either rated each risk for themselves compared to other Italians or for Italy compared to other OECD countries. One item related to general risks (i.e., \"Solving problems of waste in Italy\") and 3 items related to economic risks (i.e., \"Successfully managing economic problems\"; \"Getting a very good salary\"; \"Number of families in Italy relying on a very good salary\") referred to positive events and were reverse coded. Scores were then averaged into single indexes of economic risks (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .73) and general risks (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .64).

Participants were exposed to a table showing the current five tax brackets of the IRPEF, the tax rate for each of the 5 brackets, and a brief practical example aimed at helping participants to understand how IRPEF works. The table was described as follows: \"According to the current Italian tax system, Italians are subjected to a progressive personal income tax called IRPEF, which includes five tax brackets. As you can see in the example, each of the five tax brackets is subjected to a tax rate that increases with increasing of one's personal income, and ranges from 23% (for the first tax bracket) to 43% (for the fifth tax bracket) of the personal income\". Immediately afterwards, participants were presented with five rows representing the current five tax brackets of the IRPEF, and required to allocate, for each bracket, the tax rate that they regarded as ideal.

Average agreement with the assigned condition was not reliably different in the low socio-economic status (M = 2.83, SD = .81) and the high socio-economic status condition (M = 2.92, SD = .81; F < 1.05, p > .30), thus suggesting that the manipulation of participants' socio-economic status had worked as intended. Therefore, analyses were conducted on a final sample of 306 respondents.",

To test the fifth hypothesis, a moderated mediation model was conducted to investigate whether personal control and economic risks mediated the relation between mind-set condition and progressivity of taxation, further considering manipulated socio-economic status as a moderator of the relation between participants' perceived economic risks and scores of progressivity of self-generated taxation (PROCESS, Model 87; [98] ). Therefore, progressivity of taxation was entered in the model as the criterion variable. Mind-set condition was used as predictor, whereas personal control and economic risks were modeled as centered serial mediators, respectively. Manipulated socioeconomic status was included as a moderator. In line with results reported above, mind-set condition predicted personal control, b = -.89, t = -5.75, p < .001, and economic risks, b = 1.76, t = 14.78, p < .001. Personal control was a reliable predictor of economic risks, as well, b = -.11, t = -2.64, p < .009. Therefore, for participants in the collective, but not personal, mind-set condition personal control was reduced. Reduced personal control, in turn, increased participants' estimates of future economic risks. However, when mind-set, personal control, economic risks, manipulated socio-economic status, and the interaction between economic risks and manipulated socio-economic status were entered simultaneously in the model predicting participants' scores of progressivity of taxation, the expected interaction between economic risks and manipulated socio-economic status was only close to reaching conventional levels of significance, b = 1.53, t = 1.77, p = .07, \u03c9 = .15; 95% CI [-.01, .43].

In exchange for course credit, students of an introductory course of Psychology e-mailed to neighbors, acquaintances, etc. an invitation to take part in a study aimed at investigating individuals' beliefs about future everyday life events. Those who agreed to participate in the study received via email the link to the study URL where they signed the consent form and then performed the experimental tasks. In total, 209 men and 256 women completed the on-line survey and provided their consent to use their data. As in our first experiment, the sample included only participants who (in Section 1 of the survey) indicated to have a personal monthly income ranging from 1200 to 1800 euros. Also, in line with the exclusion criteria specified a priori, 15 participants were excluded because they had provided illogical responses on the taxation task (indicating a 0 tax rate for all 5 tax brackets or indicating tax percentages that went up and down across brackets). Additional 15 respondents failed the manipulation check (i.e., did not correctly remember which place on the social ladder they had been assigned to), and 51 participants (11%) did not agree at all with the assigned position on the social ladder (personal agreement).",

            "text": "Although most citizens desire greater economic equality in their countries and would personally benefit from strategies aimed at transferring wealth from richer to poorer members of society, they often fail to support concrete redistribution policies to achieve this goal [12, 13] . Over the last years, the increasing levels of wealth and income inequalities in practically all developed nations [100] and their detrimental effects on society [101] have led many social scientists to draw attention to a number of psychological factors that contribute to inhibiting support for policies aimed at redressing economic inequality [19, 27, 29, 42] . With the aim of contributing to this growing body of research, in the present work we decided to change perspective and to address possible conditions that may facilitate rather than hamper the demand of redistribution. We therefore proposed and tested a model according to which people will support concrete redistribution policies if two conditions are met: a) They are dissatisfied with their current personal economic situation, regardless of their objective socio-economic status, and b) they take a pessimistic economic outlook at the collective rather than personal level. Two distinct lines of research stimulated and then converged on our reasoning. According to the first, demand for social change is more likely when people feel relatively disadvantaged [51] . The second line of research suggests that change (redistribution, in our case) requires the awareness that things-in the absence of action-will get worse [55, 57] . Typically, this kind of pessimistic outlook occurs when individuals think about the collective's future (e.g., the fate of their nation or of the world), but not when they envisage their own personal future [76] . People indeed tend to be overly positive and optimistic about their personal future [65] , because, they feel, it is under their own control [86] . Drawing from this evidence, we developed a model according to which a collective mind-set should foster a pessimistic outlook, which, in turn, should result in concrete demand for redistribution, but only when individuals feel economically disadvantaged.",

First, in both studies we found that people, quite logically, believe to have greater control over their personal future than over the future of their nation. Second, in line with prior literature [76, 77] , participants felt overly optimistic about their personal future, whereas they felt pessimistic about their collective future, as a nation. Specifically, our results show that comparing themselves or their nation to similar other individuals or nations, participants rated possible economic and general risks in the future as less likely for themselves, but as more likely for Italy. Third, across two studies we found that the asymmetry between personal optimism and collective pessimism regarding economic risks was driven by differences in perceived personal control over events of a personal and a collective character. This finding extends prior work on the role of perceived personal control over events in the unrealistic optimism bias [64, 87] by demonstrating that personal control is a psychological mechanism that can help not only to explain differences between cultures [87] and between types of possible events of a personal character [88] , but also to account for the striking contrast in risk perception between events at the personal and collective level.",

In both studies results revealed a significant interaction between manipulated socio-economic status and mind-set, showing that a personal vs. collective mind-set was irrelevant for participants led to feel relatively well-off. Conversely, mind-set played an important role for those led to feel economically disadvantaged: only participants in the low socio-economic status condition indeed proposed higher progressive taxation when in a collective than in a personal mind-set (see also pooled data analysis).

Importantly, although participants were objectively in the same income range, subjective socio-economic status was successfully varied by providing them a fictitious feedback about their relative standing in the social and economic ladder.

Our findings show that people were unlikely to support redistribution if they had an overly optimistic vision of the economic future, which is exactly what happens when they think about their personal (rather than collective) risks (see optimism bias; [64] ). Therefore, it seems clear that any communication intended to promote support for redistribution policies in the population will be more effective in creating positive engagement by shifting people's attention from the personal to the collective level. In this way, besides promoting the idea that things may get worse and hence that change is needed, it may become also easier to affect beliefs about future risks faced by the community at large. In fact, whereas personal optimism is very stable over time, the collective pessimism fluctuates greatly and is susceptible to external factors such as media coverage [90] .",

On the one side, it remains unclear why control beliefs mediated the relation between mind-set condition and expected economic, but not general, risks despite the fact that participants perceived greater control over personal than over collective risks in both cases. On the other side, even in the case of economic risks, we can not exclude the possibility that additional mediators may have played a role. Drawing on literature, perceived control seemed to be the most plausible psychological mechanism that could explain the asymmetry between personal optimism and collective pessimism [64, [86] [87] [88] [89] . However, many mechanisms contribute to producing personal optimism [84] and, therefore, an exhaustive analysis aimed at identifying the true mediator would have to rely on diagnostic tests of mediation against other candidates that we did not assess in the present work. For example, individuals are more optimistic about their personal than their collective future also because they feel it is under their own personal responsibility [89] . It is possible that this and possibly additional psychological processes may have contributed to the relation between mind-set and expected economic and general risks above and beyond personal control. Therefore, we deem it necessary for future research to extend the present findings investigating other psychological mechanisms in addition to personal control.",

            "text": "Second, the driving idea of our work was that people will support redistribution policies if they take a pessimistic economic outlook at the collective level and if they feel relatively poor. To test our model, we manipulated participants' socio-economic status (high, low) and mindset (personal, collective). However, one could argue that, in the absence of a no-mind-set control condition, our experimental design does not allow to disentangle with certainty whether it is collective pessimism that makes relatively poor participants more prone to support redistribution policies, or whether personal optimism inhibits their support for redistribution. Although we acknowledge this limit, a comparison with those who felt relatively rich (see pooled data analysis) suggests that both processes may be operating, given that those who felt poor showed less support for progressive taxation than the \"rich\" counterparts in the collective, but more support in the personal mind-set condition. Thus, support for progressive taxation of participants who were made to feel relatively poor were greatly polarized. On the one side, collective pessimism motivated those who felt poor to endorse concrete redistribution strategies. On the other side, although not originally hypothesized, personal optimism hampered their wish for tax-based redistribution. In line with prior theorizing [18] , it is plausible to argue that those who felt relatively poor and were considering their personal (rather than collective) risks, either made stronger internal attributions or justified the system more, resulting in less support for redistribution. It is up to future research to investigate the exact underlying reasons of this polarized view on progressive taxation among the poor. Another extension of our collective vs. personal mind-set manipulation may be to manipulate the optimistic or pessimistic outlook directly, for instance by informing participants that things will (or will not) get worse collectively (or personally). However, such information-based manipulations are often insufficient to induce changes in tax preferences [25] . It therefore remains to be seen whether information-based interventions work as well or better than the indirect approach chosen here, in which people generate their own (optimistic or pessimistic) outlook. Our work, as well as literature, suggests that it is the focus on the collective per se that makes people pessimistic about the future, and it is the focus on the self per se that makes people unrealistically optimistic about the future, thus increasing and reducing, respectively, support for redistribution among the relatively poor. A systematic comparison of the two approaches may be useful both from a theoretical and applied point of view.",

Our choice was driven by the fact that progressive taxation has received increasing attention in recent years [57, 104] and has been shown to have tangible effects on people's well-being and happiness [105] . Moreover, among the various existing forms of progressive taxation (e.g., income, property, consumption), income tax is the one that citizens are most familiar with. Solely for explorative purposes, in Study 2 we included, as an additional measure of support for redistribution, attitudes towards two types of taxes specifically targeting top earners (personal income and luxury goods). However, no significant effect emerged of either manipulated socio-economic status or mind-set on this variable, possibly because participants had overall rather positive attitudes towards this type of taxation. Therefore, to fully grasp the generality of the phenomena investigated here, we encourage future research to extend our model to other types of taxes (e.g., inheritance tax that is particularly suitable for increasing social mobility), as well as to other forms of redistribution.",

For instance, it is close to the OECD average and to the OECD Europe average in GDP [106] . These features made Italy an ideal nation for our within-OECD comparison developed to assess collective economic and general risks in Study 1. Although in Study 2 participants assigned to the collective mind-set condition compared Italy to other countries with similar geographical and social characteristics, overall, the two experiments yielded very similar results, thus suggesting that the specific comparison was not essential.

            "text": "Finally, the fact that our second study was run during one of the peaks of the Covid-19 pandemic may have affected our results in unknown ways. Many researchers have observed \"anomalous\" responses to surveys administered during the pandemic, so this possibility can not be excluded with certainty. In particular, participants may have experienced worse mood and less control over their lives during the pandemic. Also, the very issue of economic inequality may have become less central due to the overwhelming health concerns that took center stage in the media (and in people's minds) at that point in time. Comparing pre-experimental mood across studies, we observe a slightly better mood among participants of (pre-Covid) Study 1 (M = 6.53, SD = 1.84) than among those of Study 2 (M = 6.21, SD = 1.78), although differences were small considering the 1-10 scale on which mood was assessed. However, participants in Study 2 reported a somewhat greater sense of control (M = 4.91, SD = 1.33) than those in (pre-Covid) study 1 (M = 4.54, SD = 1.42), Thus, there is no consistent pattern that would suggest that responses in Study 2 may have been negatively impacted by the massive disruption experienced during Covid-19. More importantly, the similarity of result patterns obtained in study 1 and Study 2 (during Covid-19) for all hypotheses, including the complex moderated mediation model, argues against a reliable interference of Covid-19 in this set of studies.",

In contrast, the model presented here suggests that this strategy would make people overly optimistic about future, which in turn would hamper their desire for redistribution. Ironically, the focus on one's personal future may reduce rather than increase citizens' motivation to seek greater equality. Thus, the quest for redistribution requires the \"pessimism of the intellect\" without which the need for change would not become apparent. Or as stated by Gramsci in a letter to one of his brothers in December 1929: \"I am pessimistic in reasoning, but optimistic in my will. In any circumstance, I consider the worstcase scenario, to set all reserves of will in motion and be able to break down the obstacle\".",
