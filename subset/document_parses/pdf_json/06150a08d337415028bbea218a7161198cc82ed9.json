Within the education system, the teaching mode drastically changed to adapt to the social distancing restrictions due to the pandemic. Consequently, teachers have been facing challenges associated with remote learning in addition to those of the pandemic. The aim of the present study was to assess the psychological state among teachers at two stages: prepandemic (November 2019) and during the pandemic (Information regarding demographic data, depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS-21), and burnout syndrome (MBI-ES) was collected using validated questionnaires. Results showed a significantly higher scores as well as a higher prevalence in the DASS-21 and the MBI-ES scales, on the second measurement taken during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period and the first evaluation during the pandemic. During the second evaluation on pandemic stage, female teachers of \u226545 years of age with a college-level of education, 11 years of teaching experience, and currently teaching at preschools and primary schools were significantly associated with higher anxiety, stress, EE, and burnout scores. In addition, female teachers aged \u226545 years reported higher PD and PA scores. Finally, an association between burnout syndrome and depression was identified in the evaluations carried out during the pandemic considering both the total sample and the analysis per gender. The study shows that teachers' mental health has been negatively affected by the pandemic. Efforts from the education system and health authorities are crucial to design and implement strategies to improve teachers' mental health during the fight against COVID-19.",

Anxiety is a psychological and physiologic state characterized by cognitive, somatic, emotional, and behavioral components, which acts as a protective factor against worry over a future unwanted event, or fear of an actual situation (Chand & Marwaha, 2022) . Depression is a mood disorder characterized by a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in activities that were previously enjoyable and pleasurable. Depressive symptoms include sadness, irritability, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, guilt, and suicidal ideation (Busse & Duman, 2008) . Burnout syndrome is a socio-psychological phenomenon of emotional, motivational, and physical exhaustion as a result of chronic occupational stress. It is characterized by long-term emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal and professional achievements (Maslach & Leiter, 2016) . Previous studies have suggested a relationship between burnout syndrome, depression, and anxiety (Caballero Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2015; Lopes Cardozo et al., 2012; Pereira-Lima & Loureiro, 2015) . It is possible that individuals who are more prone to experiencing higher levels of anxiety (trait anxiety) are also more likely to develop burnout as well (Koutsimani et al., 2019) . Also, a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms was observed in persons with burnout syndrome, contributing to the onset of depressive disorders (Vasconcelos et al., 2018) .",

First, Mexico has no prior experience in implementing a massive and abrupt use of technology in education (D\u00edaz-Barriga, 2020) . Second, despite the efforts to improve network connectivity in the country, it continues to be a problem due to the lack of affordable country-wide access, which leads to difficulties for the students and teachers to access virtual classrooms (INEGI, 2019) . To tackle the connectivity issue, some teachers have decided to travel dozens of kilometers to deliver didactic material to students who have limited or no internet access (Hern\u00e1ndez, 2020; Reporte Irapuato, 2020; Vega, 2020) . This situation has contributed to higher levels of stress among teachers. The physical, mental, and emotional stress can be substantial leading to the development of mild to severe psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, stress, and burnout syndrome (Dragano & Lunau, 2020; Lizana et al., 2021) .Third, despite government efforts to train and support teachers to adapt to distance learning settings, only a few teachers have the required skills to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) (D\u00edaz-Barriga, 2020) . Therefore, shifting to online teaching has been an unfamiliar and challenging task for teachers across the country.",

The strategy involves voluntary and gradual resumption of face-to-face classes adhering to hygiene and social distance measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The implementation of such measures for the safe return to school is considerably challenging due to the lack of human and financial resources, inadequate infrastructure (e.g., small classrooms that hinder the implementation of social distancing), and scarce technical equipment (Berlanga et al., 2020) . Despite the difficulties that schools and universities encounter, preparations are being made using the available resources (Universidad de Colima, 2021; Universidad de Guanajuato, 2021; Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, 2021) .",

For instance, when teachers experience high levels of stress during an emergency, students could be negatively affected. This phenomenon is known as stress contagion (Oberle & Schonert-Reichl, 2016) . The combination of high workload and lack of support and resources can lead to increasing levels of occupational stress. In such situations, teachers may become more reactive and use punitive classroom management strategies negatively affecting the classroom environment leaving students' emotional needs unmet. When students exhibit troublesome behaviors, the level of stress in both students and teachers increases leading to a negative classroom environment and the risk of burnout syndrome in teachers (Jennings & Greenberg, 2009) .",

Specific tests were used to compare frequencies (chisquare) and means (repeated measures ANOVA) to determine whether the DASS-21 and MBI-ES scores differed significantly across time points. Associations were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Data were analyzed with SPSS v26 software for Windows, and p < .05 value was considered statistically significant.

            "text": "In this longitudinal study, the psychological state of teachers in Mexico was examined from before the pandemic throughout the pandemic period considering two-time points during the pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, teachers experienced a clear deterioration of their mental health and reported higher levels of burnout syndrome. In both age groups, an increase in moderate, severe, and extremely severe levels in DASS-21 scores was observed. Furthermore, the reports of burnout syndrome were higher during the pandemic and significantly more pronounced in the \u226445-years old group. Interestingly, a higher level of PA during the pandemic was reported by teachers in both age categories. Both female and male teachers experienced moderate levels of depression, severe anxiety, moderate stress, medium levels of PA, high DP and EE after 16 months of the pandemic. It is important to notice the sample size difference per gender in which a larger number of female teachers (71.23%, n= 775) compared to the number of male teachers (28.77%, n= 313) was observed. However, such difference reflects the recent statistics of the population of teachers in Mexico. According to the National Survey of Occupation and Work conducted in 2020, 69.9% of the teachers in Mexico are female while 30.1% are male (INEGI, 2021) . Even though the sample is a fair representation of the teacher's population in the country, for the purpose of critically analyzing the findings per gender, the sample size difference in the male and female groups should be kept into consideration. Therefore, the interpretation of the gender analysis should be cautiously done as the findings per gender observed could be due to the sample size difference. A larger sample size in the group of male teachers would be needed to have a better understanding of the impact of the pandemic per gender.",

One of the most frequently reported stressors affecting teachers in Mexico includes the challenge to contact and reach their students (Esc\u00e1rzaga et al., 2020) . Teachers have made a colossal effort to reach students and make sure that they receive the school activities as some students have no access or limited internet access (L\u00f3pez Corral & Acu\u00f1a, 2020) . Not being able to contact the students is a source of emotional distress for teachers because they do not know what is happening in the students' lives at these difficult times of the pandemic (Esc\u00e1rzaga et al., 2020; Mart\u00ednez Barradas, 2021) . Also, the low assignment completion rate (<60%) (Esc\u00e1rzaga et al., 2020) and the need for keeping students engaged (Romo Rojas & Mora, 2020) contribute to the deterioration of the teachers' psychological state.",

Our results show that both female and male teachers exhibited a similar burnout profile; that is, high DP and EE, and low PA.

This trend could be related to the pandemic-driven drastic change in the work dynamics and the inclusion of technologies, which teachers were not familiar with. The new work settings forced teachers to spend considerable time sitting while teaching and adapting their activities and materials to virtual platforms. An international study conducted between March and May 2020 with 173,426 people showed that the high levels of stress experienced by the participants were associated with the participant's age, preference to be alone, and the experience of drastic changes in their lifestyle (Contreras-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2020; P\u00e9rez-Gay Ju\u00e1rez et al., 2020; Yamada et al., 2021) .",

For instance, the findings of our study could be used as a foundation 1) to design interventions aiming at improving mental health and preventing burnout syndrome in teachers and 2) to open a dialog with the government and the education system authorities to create awareness on the problem and to provide support and training to teachers across the country. As teachers' mental health state has suffered a significant decline during the pandemic, universities, psychologists, government and education system authorities should join efforts to provide psychological, technical, and educational support to reduce mental health problems and burnout syndrome in teachers.",

Exploring suitable intervention options such as remotely-delivered, self-administered, and digital interventions (Strudwick et al., 2021; Gorenko et al., 2021; Budhwani et al., 2021) that could mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on teachers' mental health is recommended as the next step to tackle the problem that our study presented. From the policy-making point of view, the government and education system authorities should join efforts to provide self-care strategies, resources, equipment, and training to reduce the stress that teachers experience due to the challenging shift to distance learning. Finally, teachers' mental health should be closely monitored to take action (e.g., referral to professionals, recommending taking sick leave, etc.) and prevent further deterioration of their mental health.",

Therefore, one of the limitations of the present study is that it only included teachers from some central regions and the west coast of the country. Samples from different states could provide a wider picture of the mental health state among teachers at a national level. Another limitation of the study is that no questionnaire was used to collect information about the sources of emotional distress. Asking teachers about the stressors they are facing during the pandemic would have given a clearer picture of the problem and insight to take immediate actions to diminish the negative impact of the stressors. Finally, the difference in sample size between the female and male groups of teachers is another limitation of the study. A larger sample size in the group of male teachers would be needed to have a better understanding of the impact of the pandemic per gender.",

Taking care of the mental health and wellbeing of teachers will bring benefits to their school communities as well as to their own families. Furthermore, tackling the mental health issues that teachers experience would prevent the development of more serious mental disorders.
