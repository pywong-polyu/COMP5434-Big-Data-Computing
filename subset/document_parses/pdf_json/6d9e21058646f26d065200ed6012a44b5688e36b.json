These possibilities arise by adopting different analytic approaches. The heterogeneity among these approaches and in particular the heterogeneity in results they produce are challenging for follow-up studies, including replication, validation and translational studies. Furthermore, they complicate the interpretation of findings with wide-spread relevance. Here, we take the example of statistical epistasis networks derived from genome-wide association studies with single nucleotide polymorphisms as nodes. Even though we are only dealing with a single data type, the epistasis detection problem suffers from many pitfalls, such as the wide variety of analytic tools to detect them, each highlighting different aspects of epistasis and exhibiting different properties in maintaining false positive control. To reconcile different network views to the same problem, we considered 3 network aggregation methods and discussed their performance in the context of epistasis network aggregation. We furthermore applied a latent class method as best performer to real-life data on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and highlighted its benefits to increase our understanding about IBD underlying genetic architectures.",

The most popular genetic variants in these studies are Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). In this paper, the main question of interest is how to derive unified conclusions from GWAIS with SNPs that have been typed out on the same dataset, yet with different analytic tools or protocols. The motivation for this question is multi-fold. In Bessonov et al. [2] , it was demonstrated that slightly different GWAIS analysis protocols may lead to highly different analysis results. At the same time, different analytics are believed to highlight only particular aspects of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits under investigation. Hence, in order to aid in generating robust genetic interaction findings, that can be used as input to replication and experimental validation studies, there is a need for novel approaches to prioritize interactions obtained by different analytic workflows [32] . To our knowledge, the presented study is the first that explores the utility of network aggregation in deriving an aggregated statistical epistasis network across different epistasis detection analysis protocols.",

The adjacency matrix \u03b8 with probability 3/d that a pair of nodes is connected was computed via huge.generator.

Then, a precision matrix was calculated from the adjacency matrix and was used to compute a covariance matrix in order to create the generating data.

We first applied the graphical lasso estimator (glasso option in the function huge) on the data of 200 samples and 50 nodes that we previously generated. The employed function carries out undirected graph estimation using a lambda sequence of size 10 to control the regularization. It returns a list of precision matrices corresponding to the lambdas. Second, the function huge.select was applied to select the regularization parameter. We applied the stability approach to regularization selection (stars), which selects the optimal network by variability of subsamplings and gives a supplementary estimated network by merging the corresponding subsampled networks using the frequency counts. Then, to actually build a partial network, we randomly selected 50% of the edge values of the estimated graph and kept them as is. The remaining edge values were set to zero, i.e. representing the lack of interaction between corresponding nodes. This selection of 50% of the edges was performed five times, to give rise to 5 partial networks. Several variations to the baseline network were considered as detailed in Fig. 2 . For each of the considered configurations we created 1,000 replicates. We highlight that the partial networks constructed in this way are in line with the hypothesis that statistical epistasis networks (SENs) derived from multiple analytics only partially reflect a true underlying interaction network (Fig. 1 ).

Then, additional QC measures were taken, specifically related to large-scale GWAIS, as motivated in Gusareva and Van Steen [10] . In particular, only common variants (MAF > 5%) and those in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p-value > 0.001) were considered. Also, we pruned out SNPs that were in Linkage Disequilibrium (LD r 2 > 0.75) with the option \"--indep-pairwise 50 5 0.75\" in PLINK [25] . Since this LD filtering is based on sliding windows, LD was not tested exhaustively among all possible pairs. This may induce redundant epistasis signals due to LD and requires taking additional measures post interaction analysis (see Sect. 4.1). Lastly, to enrich the data for known risk loci, all risk SNPs described in Liu et al. [20] were included. In addition, we adjusted phenotypes to correct for population structure using the top 7 principal components. These adjusted phenotypes were obtained as residuals from a logistic regression model by subtracting model-fitted values from observed phenotype values. Submitting the phenotype adjusted traits to analytic tools may reduce power but is a pragmatic choice when the analytics do not accept covariates or explanatory variables other than the SNPs under investigation. Overall, the obtained dataset contained 38,225 SNPs and 66,280 individuals, partitioned in 32,622 cases and 33,658 controls.",

Given a set of edges and several networks, aggregation process was used to partition edges into two clusters [7] , edge present or not, based on edge similarity across partial networks. The variables to assess similarity are the value of the edges in the different partial networks. The input matrix for clustering takes edges for rows and partial networks for columns. Matrix entries are 1 when an edge is present and 0 otherwise. First we selected one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms, k-means, using the function kmeans in R [26] . In particular, the kmeans function was applied to group the edges such that edges within the same cluster were as similar as possible, whereas edges in different clusters were as different as possible in order to maximize intra-cluster similarity, and minimize inter-cluster similarity. The algorithm of Hartigan and Wong [11] was applied. The total within-cluster variation was set as the sum of squared Euclidean distances between edges and the mean of edges in this cluster, called center. Each edge was associated with a cluster so the total within-cluster variation is minimized. In practice, two edges were picked randomly as cluster center. Then, each edge was assigned to their closest center based on the Euclidean distance. For each cluster, the center was updated by computing the mean values of all the edges in the cluster. The process was repeated 10 times to iteratively minimize the total within-cluster variation. Second, we used the Latent Class Modelling (LCM) approach for clustering with the R [26] function poLCA [19] . It allows a dataset to be partitioned into exclusive groups called latent classes. The main latent class model is P (y n |\u03b8) = S j=1 \u03c0 j P j (y n |\u03b8 j ) where y n is the observation n (edge pair) of the variables (partial networks), S is the number of clusters (2) , and \u03c0 j is the prior probability (random) of belonging to cluster j. P j is the cluster specific probability of y n given the cluster specific parameters \u03b8 j . Expectation-Maximization algorithm was used to maximize the latent class mode log-likelihood function with poLCA. The output included a vector of predicted cluster memberships for each edge.",

In our approach no normalization was performed and the partial networks were iteratively updated with information from the other networks to build an aggregated graph via the R library SNFtool [34] and the function SNF therein. We then set the diagonal of the aggregated adjacency matrix to 0. Since the outputted consensus network was continuous, it was binarized again by testing a variety of thresholds ranging from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.01 and selecting the threshold with maximal performance (simulation setting dependent). An edge was considered to be present in the final aggregated network if and only if the optimal threshold was surpassed.",

A too small number of nodes (here below 50) or a too high number of nodes (here above 100) shows to be suboptimal for both LCA and k-means. For SNF, the less nodes, the more beneficial the aggregation is, although its F1 gain is still the smallest of the 3 considered aggregation methods (Fig. 2C) . The results of Fig. 2C may have repercussions for \"true\" epistasis networks that would be too large in terms of numbers of SNPs. Part of the problem can be alleviated by deriving gene-based SENs from SNP-based SENs. In fact, to date, there is little evidence that the number of gene-based interactions would be extremely large, especially when ruling out spurious interactions due to major gene effects. The situation may be different for other interactome networks such as protein-protein interaction networks. Furthermore, with the SNF algorithm, F1 gain decreases with the inclusion of more partial networks in the aggregation process (Fig. 2D) . In contrast, with k-means, the F1 gain increases as the number of partial networks varies from 5 to 20, whereas it remains stable with LCA when at least 10 networks are aggregated. Such information is relevant to have an idea about the number of epistasis networks (e.g. derived from different analytic protocols) to include in the aggregation process, with minimal loss of information compared to the \"true\" (unknown) underlying epistasis network. Notably, in real-life it is expected that non-random heterogeneity exists between partial epistasis networks. Not properly accounting for this may jeopardize the reliability of the aggregated network. Unfortunately, intrinsic differences between epistasis detection tools are often hard to assess based on the supporting literature that underlies each tool: to date there is no consensus about sufficiently advanced gold standard in silico datasets on human interactomes. Hence, a pragmatic way to deal with different forms of heterogeneity is to act at the level of the epistasis networks themselves, and includes accommodating potential scale differences in SEN edge weights across networks. We are currently working on a strategy around a notion of statistically significant differences between (groups of) SENs and clustering that combines the ideas of consensus clustering with meta clustering [4] .",

As LCA performed best in Sect. 4.1, we applied it to combine 3 statistical epistasis networks for IBD, after further manipulation of the networks. We reduced the size of the networks while minimizing spurious edges. In particular, SNP pairs where both SNPs resided in the HLA region were deleted, as for this region it is notoriously hard to distinguish between main and additional non-additive effects [30] . Significant SNP pairs exhibiting strong LD (r 2 > 0.75) were eliminated as well. The resulting SENs are depicted in Fig. 3 . The LCA aggregated SEN counts 193 nodes, 203 interactions and 12 modules. The size of the largest connected component (LCC) is 163. To address the question whether the aggregated network gives added value over the contributing SENs to understanding underlying genetic architectures of IBD, we carried out several pathway enrichment analyses. To this end, we first mapped all SNPs of the LCA aggregated network to genes. This was done location-wise with FUMA [36] and its function SNP2GENE : SNPs were mapped to a gene whenever the SNP was located in that gene's region, i.e. including 10kb before and after the gene. Second, we ran pathway over-representation analyses of LCC containing at least 3 SNPs in R [26] using the library clusterProfiler [38] and the function enrichKEGG.

For linear regression and MB-MDR the same 5 significant pathways were detected. This larger overlap between MB-MDR and linear regression is not surprising as neither of these methods involved a pre-screening, in contrast to epiHSIC. Also, filtering or not increases the heterogeneity in epistasis results [2] . The 5 pathways referred to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, JAK/STAT signaling pathway, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Th17 cell differentiation and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation and were already linked to IBD in earlier work [5, 8, 23] . Pathway enrichment analysis applied to the LCA aggregated SEN identified 12 significant pathways, including the 5 mentioned before. Therefore, in this case study, aggregation highlighted more pathways than the union of the pathways detected with each epistasis detection method. Note, that epiHSIC network contributed to the aggregated network. In fact, without including it, the LCA aggregated SEN lost 5 nodes, 1 module and 2 enriched pathways. The 7 unique pathways to the LCA aggregated SEN were viral protein interaction with cytokine, C-type lectin receptor, TNF, Yersinia infection, allograft rejection, intestinal immune network for IgA production and autoimmune thyroid disease. They seemed to be coherent with earlier work in relation to IBD [14, 18, 27, 33] .",

            "text": "Genetic interactions, beyond effects of independent SNPs or genes, can further unravel the genetic underpinnings of human complex diseases. Such interactions contribute to epistasis, which has grown into a more general theory and applications framework for the analysis of interactions across and between multiple omics data. Many methods have been created to understand the true role of these interactions but findings are often inconsistent. This is in part due to different analytic protocols for epistasis detection giving rise to, at best, partially overlapping results. To this end, we first summarized the results of epistasis analyses in networks with nodes representing SNPs and edges representing binary evidence for a statistically significant interaction between corresponding SNPs. We second investigated the utility of network aggregation methods built on unsupervised machine learning to reconstruct the \"true\" disease underlying epistasis network. Unsupervised machine learning techniques have been used before in different contexts to unravel disease associated biological knowledge, for instance to derive multimodal biomarker signatures of disease risk [28] , to identify subphenotypes for asthma [37] , or to provide a molecular reclassification of Crohn's Disease [22] . Here, we used it to predict epistasis network links via the aggregation of partial networks. Our simulations revealed that Latent Class Analysis (LCA) outperformed k-means and a customized version of Similarity Network Fusion. We furthermore applied LCA to data for inflammatory bowel disease and underlined the benefits of an aggregated network via pathway enrichment analyses performed on the largest connected component of aggregated and contributing networks. These enrichment analyses revealed 7 pathways that could not be detected with either of the 3 considered statistical epistasis detection models. This pilot study suggests the potential of network aggregation in epistasis research and the need to investigate the added value of between-network heterogeneity in advanced network aggregation algorithms.",
