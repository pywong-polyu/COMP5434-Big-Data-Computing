DNA polymerases select against NTPs by using steric gates to exclude the 2\u2032OH, but RNAPs have to employ alternative selection strategies. In singlesubunit RNAPs, a conserved Tyr residue discriminates against 2\u2032dNTPs, whereas selectivity mechanisms of multi-subunit RNAPs remain hitherto unknown. Here, we show that a conserved Arg residue uses a two-pronged strategy to select against 2\u2032dNTPs in multi-subunit RNAPs. The conserved Arg interacts with the 2\u2032OH group to promote NTP binding, but selectively inhibits incorporation of 2\u2032dNTPs by interacting with their 3\u2032OH group to favor the catalytically-inert 2\u2032-endo conformation of the deoxyribose moiety. This deformative action is an elegant example of an active selection against a substrate that is a substructure of the correct substrate. Our findings provide important insights into the evolutionary origins of biopolymers and the design of selective inhibitors of viral RNAPs.",

RNA polymerases (RNAPs) synthesize RNA from ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), whereas DNA polymerases (DNAPs) use 2\u2032-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (2\u2032 dNTPs) to synthesize DNA. The RNA building blocks precede the DNA building blocks biosynthetically and possibly also evolutionarily 1, 2 . Messenger RNA molecules function as information carriers in a single-stranded form, whereas ribosomal, transfer and regulatory RNAs adopt complex three-dimensional structures composed of double-stranded segments. The doublestranded RNAs favor A-form geometry where the ribose moiety of each nucleotide adopts the 3\u2032-endo conformation (Fig. 1a) . In contrast, DNA functions as a B-form double helix, where the deoxyribose of each nucleotide adopts the 2\u2032-endo conformation (Fig. 1a, b) . Hybrid duplexes between the RNA and DNA transiently form during transcription and adopt an A-form geometry because conformational preferences of the RNA strand outweigh those of a more flexible DNA strand. The sugar moieties of NTPs and 2\u2032dNTPs equilibrate freely between the 3\u2032-and 2\u2032-endo conformations in solution with the overall bias typically shifted toward the 2\u2032-endo conformers 3 . However, both NTPs and 2\u2032 dNTPs typically adopt the 3\u2032-endo conformation in the active sites of the nucleic acid polymerases 4 .",

Most DNAPs use bulky side-chain residues in their active sites to exclude the 2\u2032OH of NTPs (reviewed in ref. 8 ).

Single-subunit RNAPs (e.g., mitochondrial and bacteriophage T7 and N4 enzymes) are homologous and structurally similar to DNAPs. However, single-subunit RNAPs lack a steric gate and use a conserved Tyr residue to discriminate against 2\u2032dNTPs 9, 10 . Tyr forms a hydrogen bond with the 2\u2032OH group of the NTP ribose ( Fig. 1c) 11, 12 but mediates the selectivity by inhibiting the binding and incorporation of 2\u2032dNTPs 9, 13 . It is hypothesized that the formation of the Tyr-2\u2032OH hydrogen bond upon the binding of NTPs counteracts an inhibitory interaction of the Tyr with another residue or a water molecule 10 .

The combined structural evidence (reviewed in ref. 16 ) suggests that the 2\u2032OH group can make polar contacts with three universally conserved amino acid side chains: \u03b2\u2032Arg425, \u03b2\u2032Asn458, and \u03b2\u2032Gln929 (numbering of the Escherichia coli RNAP). \u03b2\u2032Arg425 and \u03b2\u2032Asn458 belong to the active site cavity and can interact with the 2\u2032OH of NTPs in the open and closed active site (see below), whereas \u03b2\u2032Gln929 is contributed by a mobile domain called the trigger loop (TL) and can only transiently interact with the 2\u2032-and 3\u2032-OH of NTPs in the semiclosed active site [17] [18] [19] (Fig. 1d) . Closure of the active site by the folding of two alpha-helical turns of the TL positions the triphosphate moiety of the substrate NTP inline for an attack by the 3\u2032OH group of the RNA and accelerates catalysis~10 4 fold 20-23 . However, most structures of RNAP complexes with NTP analogs feature a semi-closed active site where the TL is helical up to \u03b2\u2032 Met932 (refs. [17] [18] [19] ) (Supplementary Table 1 ). Partial folding of the TL establishes contacts between \u03b2\u2032Gln929 and the ribose moiety and stacking of \u03b2\u2032Met932 with the nucleobase (Fig. 1d ) but is insufficient to promote catalysis (3\u2032OH \u2192 \u03b1P distance 5.4 \u00c5 18 ).",

The concentration series data allowed the estimation of k cat and the Km (Michaelis constant) for GTP and 2\u2032dGTP. We then supplemented the concentration series with time-courses of GMP and 2\u2032dGMP incorporation obtained using a rapid chemical quench-flow technique with EDTA as a quencher. EDTA inactivates the free GTP and 2\u2032dGTP by chelating Mg 2+ but allows a fraction of the already bound substrate to complete incorporation into RNA 30, 31 . The EDTA quench experiment is thus equivalent to a pulse-chase setup and provides information about the rate of substrate dissociation from the active site of RNAP. A global analysis of the concentration series and EDTA quench experiments (i) allowed the estimation of the K D for GTP dissociation from the active site and (ii) suggested that the K D for the dissociation of 2\u2032dGTP from the active site approximately equals the Km for 2\u2032dGMP incorporation (see Supplementary Note).

The structure displayed a well-resolved electron density of 2\u2032 dCTP and \u03b2\u2032Arg425 closely approaching the deoxyribose moiety (Figs. 6, 7, Table 3 , and Supplementary Fig. 8a ). 2\u2032dCTP was observed in the pre-insertion conformation that was unsuitable for catalysis because the \u03b1-phosphate was located 5.7 \u00c5 from the 3\u2032OH of the RNA primer. The electron density was consistent with the interaction between the \u03b2\u2032Arg425 residue and the 3\u2032OH group of the deoxyribose in the 2\u2032-endo conformation. While the resolution of the structure was insufficient to unambiguously determine the conformation of the deoxyribose, the 3\u2032OH of the 2\u2032endo conformer was positioned to hydrogen bond with up to three RNAP atoms (Fig. 6a) , whereas the 3\u2032OH of the 3\u2032-endo conformer fitted into the omit map could only form a single hydrogen bond (Fig. 6b) . Considering that 2\u2032dNTPs intrinsically prefer the 2\u2032-endo conformation in solution and when bound to RNA template in a non-enzymatic system 3 , these observations suggest that 2\u2032dCTP predominantly adopts the 2\u2032-endo conformation upon binding to the open active site of RNAP (TL unfolded, see below). Indeed, the 2\u2032-endo 2\u2032dCTP is intrinsically more favorable than the 3\u2032-endo conformer and can form more favorable interactions with the amino acid residues in the open active site.

To test if the unavailability of the 3\u2032OH group was indeed responsible for the destabilization of the TL folding, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of the initially transcribing complex of the T. thermophilus RNAP with 3\u2032dCTP at 3.0 \u00c5 resolution. The structure displayed a well-resolved density of 3\u2032dCTP and \u03b2\u2032 Arg425 closely approaching the 3\u2032-deoxyribose moiety ( Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 8b ). 3\u2032dCTP was in the pre-insertion conformation unsuitable for catalysis because the \u03b1-phosphate was located 5.6 \u00c5 away from the 3\u2032OH of the RNA primer. The overall pose of 3\u2032dCTP was similar to that of CMPCPP: the 3\u2032deoxyribose likely adopted a 3\u2032-endo conformation and the 2\u2032OH group interacted with \u03b2\u2032Arg425. However, the TL was completely unfolded, supporting our hypothesis that the unavailability of the 3\u2032OH group was alone sufficient to significantly destabilize the folding of the first helical turn of the TL.",

Accordingly, \u03b2\u2032Arg425 could inhibit the incorporation of the 2\u2032dNMP solely by slowing down the initial steps of the TL folding, by sequestering the 3\u2032OH group and preventing its interaction with the TL \u03b2\u2032Gln929. To test this hypothesis, we determined the incorporation rate of 3\u2032dGMP by the WT RNAP ( Supplementary Fig. 2c) . We found that the k cat for 3\u2032dGMP incorporation was only 5-fold slower than the k cat for GMP incorporation and 10-fold higher than the k cat for 2\u2032dGMP incorporation (Table 1 ).

Accordingly, we reasoned that the preferential selection of the catalytically inert 2\u2032-endo conformers of 2\u2032dNTPs and the deformation of the catalytically labile 3\u2032-endo conformers of 2\u2032dNTPs by \u03b2\u2032Arg425 were likely the major factors behind the slow incorporation of 2\u2032dNMPs.

Indeed, the TL is partially folded in most structures with ribonucleotide substrate analogs (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Table 1 ) [17] [18] [19] [20] , yet was completely unfolded in the structures we obtained with either 2\u2032dCTP (Fig. 5c) or 3\u2032dCTP (Fig. 5d) . However, we found that the rate of the 3\u2032dGMP incorporation by E. coli RNAP was 10-fold faster than the rate of the 2\u2032dGMP incorporation (Table 1) . Notably, the T. thermophilus RNAP also incorporates 3\u2032dNMPs faster than 2\u2032 dNMPs 22 . These results suggested that the sequestration of the 3\u2032 OH group by \u03b2\u2032Arg425 could account for no more than a 5-fold out of its 50-fold overall inhibitory effect. Similarly, the effects of the \u03b2\u2032Q929M substitution were inconsistent with the idea that the 3\u2032OH capture by \u03b2\u2032Arg425 could alone account for the slow rate of the 2\u2032dNMP incorporation. If that were true, the \u03b2\u2032Q929M variant should be relatively insensitive to the absence of the 2\u2032OH group. However, the opposite was true: \u03b2\u2032Q929M was only 2-fold slower in incorporating GMP than the WT RNAP, but 10-fold slower in incorporating 2\u2032dGMP. We propose that \u03b2\u2032Gln929 competes with \u03b2\u2032Arg425 for the 3\u2032OH group of the 2\u2032dNTP substrate: \u03b2\u2032Arg425 favors the catalytically inert 2\u2032-endo conformer (Figs. 5d, 6a, and  7c) , whereas \u03b2\u2032Gln929 favors the catalytically labile 3\u2032-endo conformer (Fig. 5c) . As a result, \u03b2\u2032Gln929 is more important during the incorporation of 2\u2032dNMPs than NMPs.",

In multi-subunit RNAPs, 3\u2032OH facilitates the TL folding via the interaction with \u03b2\u2032 Gln929 (ref. 18 ), whereas in viral RdRps, 3\u2032OH initiates the closure by sterically clashing with Asp238 (poliovirus RdRp numbering) 38 . In both classes of enzymes, 2\u2032dNTPs adopt a 2\u2032-endo pose wherein the 3\u2032OH is misplaced and cannot readily facilitate the closure of the active site, explaining low reactivities of 2\u2032 dNTPs. However, 3\u2032dNTPs are better substrates than 2\u2032dNTPs also for viral RdRps 30 suggesting that the low reactivity of the 2\u2032-endo 2\u2032dNTPs additionally relies on C4\u2032-geometry-dependent effects (see above), which lead to a suboptimal conformation of the triphosphate moiety, a suboptimal geometry of the transition state, or both.",

            "text": "Multi-subunit RNAPs and viral RdRps converged on using the 2\u2032-endo binding pose to discriminate against 2\u2032dNTPs. In doing so these enzymes accentuate the intrinsic preferences of 2\u2032dNTPs to retain the inert 2\u2032-endo conformation upon binding to the Aform template in the non-enzymatic system 3 . However, the exact implementations of the selection mechanisms are distinct. In multi-subunit RNAPs, the 2\u2032-endo pose is stabilized by the 3\u2032OH/ \u03b2\u2032Arg425 attraction, whereas in viral RdRps, the 2\u2032-endo pose is imposed by the 3\u2032OH/Asp238 steric clash 38 . Multi-subunit RNAPs employ the conformational selection and preferentially sample the catalytically labile 3\u2032-endo conformers of NTP and the catalytically inert 2\u2032-endo conformers of 2\u2032dNTPs. In contrast, viral RdRps likely rely exclusively on the induced fit 30 and bind the catalytically inert 2\u2032-endo conformers of either NTPs or 2\u2032 dNTPs. Following the initial binding, only NTPs can efficiently isomerize into catalytically labile 3\u2032-endo conformers, ultimately repositioning the Asp238 and switching the RdRp active site on 38 . These principal differences in the substrate selection mechanisms can be potentially exploited for the concept-based design of sugar-modified substrate analog inhibitors of viral RdRps such as Remdesivir, one of few drugs currently available for COVID-19 treatment 39, 40 .",

            "text": "In summary, our data show that the universally conserved Arg residue plays a central role in selecting NTPs over 2\u2032dNTPs by the multi-subunit RNAPs. When NTP binds in the RNAP active site, its ribose adopts the 3\u2032-endo conformation that positions the 3\u2032 OH group to interact with the universally conserved Gln residue of the TL domain and promotes the closure of the active site, whereas the triphosphate moiety can undergo rapid isomerization into the insertion conformation leading to efficient catalysis. The interaction of the conserved Arg residue with the 2\u2032OH of the NTPs selectively enhances their binding more than 100-fold and renders RNAP saturated with NTPs in the physiological concentration range. In contrast, the interaction of the conserved Arg with the 3\u2032OH of the 2\u2032dNTP substrates shapes their deoxyribose moiety into the catalytically inert 2\u2032-endo conformation where the 3\u2032OH cannot promote closure of the active site and substrate incorporation is additionally inhibited by the unfavorable geometry of the triphosphate moiety. The deformative action of the conserved Arg on the 2\u2032dNTP substrates is an elegant example of active selection against a substrate that is a substructure of the correct substrate.",

The docking was performed using 12 simultaneous computational threads; 20 binding poses were recorded for each run. Binding poses involving Watson-Crick pairing between the substrate and the template DNA (templated poses) were manually selected and extracted for further analysis (Supplementary Table 3 ). Our initial docking trials revealed that docking of nucleoside monophosphates produced the most robust and quantitatively interpretable results. Thus, the docking algorithm failed to recover templated poses for nucleosides without phosphate groups. The docking algorithm also failed to position the triphosphate moiety to coordinate metal ion number two and instead attempted to maximize its contacts with the protein. As a result, the recovered conformations of the triphosphate moieties differed from those observed in crystal structures. Considering the high impact of the triphosphate moiety on the ligand binding score and our assessment that the triphosphate moiety was docked incorrectly, we opted to limit the systematic investigation of the interaction between RNAP and the sugar moieties of nucleosides to docking nucleoside monophosphates.",
