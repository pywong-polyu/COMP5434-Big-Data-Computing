For data collection and analysis, several custom-made python scripts were used.

A DT learns its structure by partitioning the training dataset into bins using a series of splits, each performed after identifying the most prevalent split-variable using information gain or Gini impurity index metrics. Splitting variables are used in defining the structure of the tree that is made up of nodes. Each node splits the dataset into branches. There are several algorithms for designing DTs such as CART, ID3, C4.5, CHAID etc. The CART algorithm [5] is a binary classification technique that utilises the Gini index of heterogeneity to determine the information gain of each variable and accordingly decide which variables to be used to split the dataset.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 844, "end": 847, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Decision Trees"}, {"text": "The main advantages of DTs lie in their simple interpretation and visualization capabilities, and the need for little data preparation.

Two of the most common oversampling techniques are Random oversampling (RO) and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). RO is easy to implement and involves the minority samples in the data being replicated randomly until the proportion of majority class is achieved. The SMOTE technique generates artificial samples from the minority class by combining several minority-class instances that are similar. That is, for each minority instance, it introduces a synthetic new sample by utilizing information from the minority-class nearest-neighbours instances.

Data was automatically extracted from TripAdvisor, with an algorithm developed in python that scrapped the reviews, and included: Username, Rating of hotel, Date of stay, Feedback date, Country of origin, Past contributions, Confidence votes, Review. To estimate each country's purchasing power, the GDP per capita index was used, using data from the World Monetary Fund. The variable is expressed in US dollars and was standardized in a scale from 0 to 100. Similarly, for the cultural values of each reviewer, the Hofstede website was used, associating each cultural dimension to a value in a scale from 0-100, based on country of origin.

The rationale for using a sentiment classifier instead of the actual review's rating in Trip Advisor, lies in evidence [22] suggesting that reviewers tend to refrain from giving low scores to hotels unless their experience is extremely negative. In this study [22] for instance they examined whether reviewers from collectivist-leaning societies (valuing tradition and helping each other) tend to write fewer excessively negative reviews than those from individualistic societies. They found that despite being marginally positive in ratings, reviewers use negative connotations in narrative descriptions that indicate dissatisfaction. To avoid this problem, we opted for a sentiment classification approach rather than using the reviewer's ratings alone. The two trained sentiment models used for this task were Textblob (based on Naive Bayes) and Vader [17] , which are popular classifiers with satisfactory precision and recall scores. Both models were used in an ensemble manner to improve our confidence in the results. A python script automatically utilized the Textblob and Vader models and averaged their results.

These represented 70% of the dataset that monopolised the GDP and culture scores. Therefore, to minimize the bias from this majority group, a random sample was selected from the UK group to equate the maximum number of reviews from other tourists' groups. The resulting dataset included a total of 10,3K reviews. The STM topic modelling approach is subsequently used to associate reviews with key thematic topics identified from the whole dataset. To learn the topic model, reviews had to be pre-processed further. During this step, irrelevant information was eliminated through the sub-steps of stop-word removal, tokenization, stemming. Stop-words refer to words providing little or no useful information to text analysis and can hence be considered as noise. Common stop-words include articles, conjunctions, prepositions and pronouns. Tokenization refers to the transformation of a stream of strings into a stream of processing units, referred to as tokens. Thus, during this step reviews were converted into a sequence of tokens, by choosing n-grams (phrases composed by n words in length). The Stemming process involves converting words to their root form. After data pre-processing, the STM topic modelling approach was employed. Extracted topics were inspected based on prior domain knowledge; therefore, expertise in the field under investigation was required to make the necessary connections. The identification of the recommended number of topics (k) was based on the model's semantic coherence and exclusivity for each model and topic [35] . The recommended value for k from this process was 10. Manual inspection of the resulting topics followed to identify possible topic merges into super-topics to reduce the dimensionality of the model further. This yielded the six super-topics of Table 2 . Each review was then associated with super-topics based on the results of the trained model and the topic merges.

Several studies examined mainly the impact of culture on review generation [21, 22, 34] , therefore this work provides a contribution by combining other exogenous and endogenous variables. The case study used to elaborate this method refers to Cyprus as a popular tourist destination and the data collected span the years 2009-2019. The results indicate that the three determinants of sentiment polarity in reviews are firstly, issues with cleanliness and staff professionalism that emerge from topic analysis, and then the cultural dimensions of indulgence and power distance. Based on the most prevalent rules from the DT and the cases that fall under each one, Cypriot hotels seem to have failed to satisfy tourists from Romania and Greece when issues with cleanliness emerge and the Power distance is relatively high. In contrast, when issues with Cleanliness alone emerge, tourists from the UK are more likely to be dissatisfied. Current hotel services cannot satisfy adequately tourists from these countries and, hence, destination marketing managers need to either improve their service or concentrate on tourists from other countries such as Australia, Switzerland and Netherlands that have higher GDP than Cyprus or have low levels of indulgence (<45) and are more likely to be satisfied. Tourist origin countries with positive results with regards to service quality and staff are, Israel, Lebanon and Greece, meaning that staff attitude and professionalism can affect their overall sentiment by 12% and 8% (Israel, Greece/Lebanon) compared to tourists from other countries with much lower positive sentiments. The main findings align with evidence from other studies indicating that consumers from countries with lower purchasing power provide low ratings to hotels. This is also consistent with evidence that power distance affects reviews polarity, supported by theory highlighting that in countries with high power distance, consumers often feel superior to service providers in the social hierarchy [20] and less tolerant with service quality, while they tend to give low service evaluations. Results from this work also highlight that other cultural traits from Hofstede, such as individualism, tend to be related to tourist review sentiment, while the topics that are associated with highest sentiment are those about hotel services. Limitations of this work reside in the quality of the data collected and issues pertaining to fake reviews that might affect the results. Our future work aims to filter out these reviews and examine if the effect of the aforementioned variables alters in any way the main conclusions of the current study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 268, "end": 272, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 277, "end": 280, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2211, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Towards an understanding of inequity", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Adams", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1963, "venue": "J.
