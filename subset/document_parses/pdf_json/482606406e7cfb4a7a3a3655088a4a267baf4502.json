We've identified 40 topics that are characteristic of hypertext media, after that, we used an ensemble of two graph-based methods using outer sources for candidate labels generation: candidate labels extraction from Yandex search engine (Labels-Yandex); candidate labels extraction from Wikipedia by operations on word vector representations in Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA). The results of the algorithms are label's triplets for each topic, after which we carried out a two-step evaluation procedure of the algorithms' results: at the first stage, two experts assessed the triplet's relevance to the topic on a 3-value scale (non-conformity to the topic/partial compliance to the topic/full compliance to the topic), second, we carried out evaluation of single labels by 10 assessors who were asked to mark each label by weights \u00ab0\u00bb -a label doesn't match a topic; \u00ab1\u00bb -a label matches a topic. Our experiments show that in most cases Labels-Yandex algorithm predicts correct labels but frequently relates the topic to a label that is relevant to the current moment, but not to a set of keywords, while Labels-ESA works out labels with generalized content. Thus, a combination of these methods will make it possible to markup e-hypertext topics and create a semantic network theory of e-hypertext.",

This defines with the standardization of e-hypertext connections between source and target text, which are used to extend the information and confirm the identity of the source text.

As a result, this approach allows you to automate the creation of hypertext media systems through topic clustering of texts.

            "text": "As a rule, topic modelling does not imply assignment of topic labels as an obligatory intrinsic operation. However, labelling may evidently enhance linguistic interpretability of generated topics. There are various solutions to the problem of label assignment. Topic labelling requires automated or manual choice of candidate labels which are expected to be unigrams or multiword expressions with general meaning correlating with the meanings of topic words. The most evident ways of label assignment are the choice of the first word (or n first words) of a topic as a label or manual label assignment (e.g., [12, 13] ). Those methods can hardly be used to form a solid baseline procedure for the following reasons. The first word (or n first words) of a topic may be inconsistent as topic labels: the ordering of words within a topic does not necessarily reflect hierarchical structure of the lexicon. On the one hand, topic words are expected to establish numerous paradigmatic (synonymic, hyponymic and similar relations, e.g., zavodppedppi tie (plant -enterprise), komandacbopna (group -national team), matqqempionattypnip (match -championship -tournament), toplivoneft , benzin (fuel -oil, gasoline), etc.), syntagmatic (e.g. depnykomplekc, icpytanie (nuclear -complex, test), cenavypacti (price -grow), etc.), epidigmatic (derivational) relations (e.g., obvin tobvinenie (accuse -prosecution), cledctviecledovatel (investigation -investigator), ppoizvodctvoppoizvoditel (manufacture -manufacturer), neftneft no (oil -oil (attr.)), etc.). On the other hand, their ordering within a topic can not be strictly defined in terms of abstractness-concreteness or taxonomic relations (hypernym vs. Hyponyms, holonym vs. Meronyms, etc.). Moreover, the first words in a topic may be polysemous (e.g., akci , cledctvie (campain, investigation) etc.), that depreciates them as possible topic labels. As for manual label assignment, this procedure relies upon on the intuition of researchers and annotators, it requires involvement of experts as annotators in case of domain-specific corpora processing (e.g. medical, legislative, etc. texts) thus it may bring subjectivity into empirical results. At the same time, human expertise remains a significant step in evaluation of topic labelling results.",

Our recent investigations are aimed to fill in the gap. In this study we used an ensemble of two graph-based methods using outer sources for candidate labels generation [24] : a) candidate labels extraction from Yandex search engine with their further ranking by TextRank (this is a graph-based model that takes into account the value of the each graph's vertex depending on how many links it forms) [25, 26] ; b) candidate labels extraction from Wikipedia by operations on word vector representations in Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) model [27, 28] . These procedures comprise two stages: candidate extraction and ranking. Both methods are compatible with any topic models and were tested on LDA from scikit-learn [29] for the corpus of Russian encyclopedic texts on linguistics. Experimental results and their evaluation proved that both methods are applicable. Candidate labels extraction from Yandex provides more consistent labels, although this algorithm turned out to be time-consuming (search engine imposes restrictions to the number of queries from an IP per minute) and hard to reproduce (the output may be adjusted to informational preferences of particular users). Losses in the quality of labels generated by Yandex-based algorithm are explained by the unstability of the external source. Candidate labels provided by ESA seem to be less general (in most cases they correspond to hyponyms of topic words), however the given approach is not time-consuming and provides reproducible results due to the stability of Wikipedia dump. Losses in the quality of labels in case of ESA labelling procedure deal with the specific content of the external source. Thus, the ensemble of two labelling methods could counterbalance and mitigate their drawbacks.",

At the stage of candidate extraction the first 10 topical words for each topic form a separate query to Yandex. The output of the query consists of top 30 titles for documents retrieved by the search engine. The list of titles is transformed into a continuous text which is subjected to preprocessing, namely, stop-words removal and lemmatization which is performed by pymorphy2 [30] . At the stage of candidate ranking a text is converted to an oriented graph G = {V, E}, where V is a set of nodes corresponding to lemmata, and E is a set of weighted edges marked by values of co-occurrence frequency within the text. Two nodes are connected by an edge if they occur together in a context window [\u22121, +1]. Further TextRank values are calculated for all nodes of the graph. Lemmata obtaining higher scores are considered as more significant, while edges getting larger weights imply strong semantic relations in word pairs. The algorithm was adjusted so that it could generate not only single word labels, but also multiword expressions. We introduced morphosyntactic patterns Adj+N, N+N, N+prep+N, etc., which were used to extract key phrases, each of them was assigned a TextRank value calculated as a sum of weights for each component.",

Wikipedia is converted to a term-document matrix, its cells containing TF-IDF values showing association strength in word -concept pairs.
