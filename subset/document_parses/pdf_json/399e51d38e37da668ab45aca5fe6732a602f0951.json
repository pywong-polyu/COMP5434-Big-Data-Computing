Students shared perspectives on Twitter about their engagement, and research data was collected from their tweets posted between March and May 2020. A total of 124,810 tweets were analysed using MAXQDA quantitative and qualitative tools. The findings indicate that students' engagement with learning and assessment was affected by the challenges of the sudden shift in learning mode and alterations in assessment methods. Open communication between students and faculty are essential for ensuring shared understanding and acceptance. Additionally, departmental support and mediating between students and faculty members is necessary and should be a priority in cases where communication is lacking. Results are discussed in relation to current literature, research implications, and future directions.",

            "text": "Social media sites allow users to share news, information, knowledge, ideas, facts, beliefs, and opinions-in negative, positive, or neutral ways-about products, events, and issues. Zou et al. (2018) suggest that Twitter is an important microblogging platform in people's daily lives. Social media platforms like Twitter are open spaces for students to share their learning experiences, emotions, and stories, and to discuss their concerns (Chen et al., 2014) . The availability of students' insights on social media provides a new lens through which educational researchers can explore their experiences in an informal environment not controlled by a classroom or institution (Chen et al., 2014) . Students' digital footprints provide a valuable source of information about their perspectives and experiences, which can help educational institutions improve those experiences and the quality of instruction. Various traditional methods have been used to collect data from students and explore their experiences in a controlled, structured way, including surveys, interviews, focus groups, and classroom observations (Chen et al., 2014) . However, social media analytics of unstructured data provide a less restricted view of users' insights, experiences and opinions during national disasters, crisis management, product marketing, health campaigns and learning experiences (Al-Rubaiee et al., 2016; Hiltz et al., 2011; Stieglitz et al., 2018) . In this way, useful data can be obtained to understand users, support them, and provide different experiences/services that will more appropriately meet the targeted groups' needs (Stieglitz et al., 2018) . Analysing unstructured Twitter data is one method of attaining such insights.",

The change was rapid in Saudi universities, which already had an online platform (Blackboard) in place. The week of the shift was the second mid-term week in Saudi universities; teaching resumed, but there were many stirring questions about unfinished examinations. Saudi university students protested on Twitter, which is a popular platform for sharing opinions in Saudi Arabia, against these rapid changes in teaching, learning, and assessment. Students not only shared content, but also documented their experiences using screenshotted pieces of evidence (departments' and lecturers' announcements, private messages, group messages, and emails with professors and lecturers). In response to this unexpected transition, the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) encouraged a move towards alternative assessment methods. This study documents students' reports of their engagement with learning and assessment between March and May 2020. Social media analytics will enhance the current understanding of how students use social media to share their experiences. The findings will be useful for researchers and policymakers who are interested in determining the factors that affect students and how to improve their experiences.",

However, the student engagement construct and its dimensions have been conceptualised in various ways (Appleton et al., 2008; Fredricks et al., 2004; Jimerson et al., 2003) . The term has also been broadly applied to include school engagement, academic engagement, educational engagement, engagement in the classroom, and engagement in schoolwork. The present study draws from Fredricks et al. (2004) , who have established that student engagement is a multifaceted construct that can be explored from behavioural, emotional, and cognitive engagement dimensions. Cognitive engagement is defined as students being self-regulated-invested in using metacognition strategies and putting in the effort necessary to study complex ideas. Emotional engagement reflects students' effective engagement (positive and negative emotions) with the classroom, teachers, and school. Behavioural engagement is defined as student participation inside and outside the classroom-getting involved in learning and submitting required work. Several measures have been developed to measure these engagement dimensions, such as student self-reports (the most common form), teacher questionnaires and ratings of their students, interviews, and individual and classroom observations (Fredricks et al., 2004) .",

Early signs indicate that the impact of the pandemic on education, emotions, and mental health are noticeable (Alateeq et al., 2020; Ara\u00fajo, 2020; Sahu, 2020) . Recent studies related to COVID-19 have explored the impacts of the pandemic on university students and staff, revealing that international students are concerned about their education, their well-being, and the impacts of travel suspension on themselves and their families (Zhai and Du, 2020) . They are also worried about the impact of the virus on their studies (Cornine, 2020) and future employment prospects (Wang et al., 2020) , and such worries have raised stress levels amongst medical students, especially females (Al-Rabiaah et al., 2020) . University students, in general, are experiencing psychological issues, such as depression, stress, and anxiety. Cao et al. (2020) have identified the COVID-19-related stressors that have affected Chinese college students during the pandemic: fears of getting sick, worries about family, economic stressors, worries about education, and concerns about assessment performance. Researchers in these studies have also stressed the importance of monitoring student and staff mental health during this crisis to lessen its emotional impact, and they have concluded with suggestions about establishing psychological services to care for vulnerable groups, provide guidance, and suggest coping strategies to help students manage stress.",

Their findings suggest that challenges to online learning and assessment included academic dishonesty, a lack of infrastructure, achievement of the learning outcomes, and students' commitment to submitting assessments. Similarly, Sharadgah and Sa'di (2020) explored the perceptions of faculty members in a Saudi university towards how well Saudi higher education institutions were prepared for virtual assessment during the lockdown period and investigated the challenges of implementing online assessments for formative and summative purposes. They collected perceptions from 96 faculty members via an online survey. Their findings suggest that faculty members were not prepared for online assessments. They believed that the courses' learning outcomes could not adequately be assessed online, as this was not the intention of the coursework, nor had they been trained for such a shift. They also found the lack of assessment security infrastructure to be a great limitation that defeated the purpose of assessment and raised academic integrity issues. Therefore, they recommended that the university provide the teaching faculty with professional development regarding e-assessments and invest in assessment security software.",

The studies conducted during the initial phase of the pandemic were based on surveys with predetermined items and views. Some focused on many identified aspects concerning the pandemic's impact on students. Other research considered only one side of the issue, such as the emotional dimension (effective engagement) or the perspectives of teaching staff. In these cases, data collection was not restricted to students and demanded no effort from them to participate. Rather, these studies collected the unstructured data the students shared via trending hashtags, attempting to make their voices heard. Therefore, more studies are needed to fully document these educational experiences, as well as the alternations in teaching, learning, and assessment practices during COVID-19 and the impact they have had on educational systems in different contexts (Toquero, 2020) .",

A total of 219,000 tweets were collected using keywords such as assessment, evaluation, university, study, exam, exams, homework, assignment, assignments, education, and continuous assessment. Tweets were also gathered from popular hashtags such as (#howwasyourexamtoday? # ), Saudi universities' hashtags, and MOHE mentions (@mohe.sa). The MAXQDA software was used to clean the data by excluding retweets, duplicates, quote tweets, and irrelevant tweets (e.g., ads and spam). Only unique Twitter users were selected in the analysis to avoid bots and spam. Finally, 124,810 original tweets written in Arabic were included in the analysis (Fig. 1 ).",

To make this process manageable, and to have an overview of the data, the researcher created a word cloud for each month (top keywords) and a word list for all months.

The researcher then collected a minimum sample of 100 tweets for each category, and, in total, 700 tweets were analysed and coded.

            "text": "The results suggest that students' engagement (cognitive, behavioural, and effective) with learning has been considerably impacted by online assessment. Online learning has become an online assessment crisis. Phase 1 of Saudi Arabia's shift to online education occurred in March, halfway through the semester, when the lockdown was in place. This was a confusing phase for students and universities, as the sudden shift required major readjustments. Universities' hashtags were trending as students started to share their experiences, and 'pressure' was the top keyword in March. The three main sources of pressure were coursework, lectures, and the COVID-19 lockdown period of uncertainty, which caused considerable stress and anxiety (see Table 1 ). In their tweets, students reported that since the shift to online learning had been announced, they found themselves trying to cope with the situation. For example, they had to navigate accessing stable internet connections, using a laptop to reach their courses, and finding a quiet space at home to participate in lectures. They were also busy with heavy loads of assignments, projects, research papers, presentations, and unfinished mid-term examinations that needed to be rescheduled. In addition to assessments, lectures were rescheduled for some courses as professors shifted their morning classes to afternoons or evenings. Some professors tried to cover too much of the curriculum in a short period, which led to students feeling overwhelmed and overloaded with information they could not digest. Students reported that their learning was impacted by the fast delivery of the course content, information overload, difficulty in following and understanding professors, exhaustion and tiredness from attending back-to-back lectures, and the need to work on several assignments and projects for different courses. These issues were compounded by stresses stemming from family, life, work, and health and financial issues (e.g., job losses and salary cuts), all of which heightened the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.",

Whole group support was also available when the exam was fixed to be taken at a certain time and when it was open for 24 h. Students even asked their peers, who had already taken the exams, for the answers. The following tweet illustrates this method: 'On a day where there was cheating, don't ask me how my exam went because of course everyone got full marks'.

The exam duration may have been decreased due to the professors thinking that less time was sufficient given the new weight of the exams (20%), or perhaps they sought to prevent their students from cheating. The MOHE guidelines suggested a weight of 20% for the final examinations, but they did not make suggestions regarding exam duration, which was left to the discretion of professors and departments. Students praised and appreciated professors who left exams open for 24 h, thereby allowing students to take the exams at their own convenience, avoid rush hours, and make two attempts to access the exams if necessary. As one student shared, 'We have two attempts and 24 h to complete our exam in 60 min. Swear to God our university did the best [happy teary face and heart emojis]'.",

Other professors did not follow these guidelines, which led to difficult and stressful student experiences.

The students in Thompson's survey reported three concerns: 1) Cognitive disengagement, including an inability to focus and a loss of desire to learn, as well as behavioural disengagement due to the inability to see professors or peers. 2) Delivery of the lectures, with a lack of standardisation in online course delivery. They called for more structure and standardisation (i.e., a mandatory system for all professors to follow). 3) Online assessments, which might negatively impact their grades. The students' most frequent complaints were about online tests. These findings coincide with the concerns tweeted by students in the present study.",

Previous research has reported that online learning and assessment cause considerable challenges for students, particularly with their emotional engagement. An increasing number of reports stress the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' effective engagement. Stress, anxiety, and depression are among students' top challenges (Al-Rabiaah et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zhai and Du, 2020) . This result has been confirmed in studies concerning the impact of COVID-19 on students' mental health in Spain, China, and Saudi Arabia (Alateeq et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Odriozola-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2020) . In the Saudi context, Alateeq et al. (2020) explored the mental health of students in Saudi general and higher education. They found that university students were more impacted than intermediate and secondary school students. The sources of stress university students reported were associated with curricula, parental issues, feelings of loneliness, and worries about their future and performance in examinations. Similar to the present study, 58% of the participants were angry about issues beyond their control.",
