Briefly, the chromatographic system was composed of an Agilent 1260 series quaternary pump (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to an Agilent 1260 fluorescence detector (FLD) and a Varian 500-MS Ion Trap (IT) mass spectrometer (MS), equipped with electrospray ion source (ESI) operating in negative mode [ESI(-)]. A TSKgel Amide-80 column (3.5 \u00b5m, 2.1 \u00d7 150 mm; Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) was used as stationary phase. A T-connector was fitted out of the chromatographic column and the effluent was split to the FLD and the MS. 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile (A) and 1% formic acid in water (B) were used as mobile phase. Gradient elution was as follows: 0 min, 90% A; 20 min, 80% A; 25 min, 80% A; 45 min, 35% A; 51 min, 35% A. Column was left to re-equilibrate to initial conditions for 9 min. Flow rate was 200 \u00b5L/min and injected volume was 20 \u00b5L. Regarding FLD parameters, excitation wavelength was set at 231 nm and fluorescence emission at 320 nm. The MS parameters were as follows: spray chamber temperature, 50 \u2022 C; nebulizer gas pressure, 25 psi; drying gas pressure, 25 psi; drying gas temperature, 385 \u2022 C; needle voltage, \u00b1 4500 V; spray shield voltage, 600 V. Mass spectra were acquired in negative mode in the spectral range 150-2000 Da. Being the standards of oligomeric PACs not commercially available, PAC-B2 dimer was used as standard reference compound for PACs quantification. The calibration curve was built in the range 8.5-85 \u00b5g/mL with a linear regression, as follows: y = 14.756x + 9.8284 (R 2 = 0.9998). LOD = 0.5 \u00b5g/mL, LOQ = 5 \u00b5g/mL.",

Qualitative results from HPLC-MS n phytochemical screening of both larch bark powder and LBE are reported in Table 4 . Several tentatively identified metabolites are here reported in larch bark for the first time. Overall, the phytochemical profiles of larch bark powder and LBE were not completely matching, being some metabolites detected in either one or the other matrix. This is due to the higher concentration of metabolites in LBE, that allows to detect a higher fraction of compounds from the HPLC-MS data. On the other hand, in view of the complexity of the plant material, extraction of the bark powder using a single solvent (MeOH in this case) leads to a selective extraction of certain compounds, leading to a different composition of the extract respect to the raw matrix. In general, a higher percentage of flavonoids and phenolic acids was identified in the bark powder, together with catechin and its isomer epicatechin, a stilbene derivative and fatty acids ( Table 4 ). Characteristic phenols of larch bark were also detected, namely the spiropolyphenols larixinol and epilarixinol [3] . On the other hand, apart from larixinol and epilarixinol, other two spiropolyphenols characteristic of Larix species [3] were detected in LBE.

Water and ethanol were used as solvents because they are considered natural, environmentally friendly (green solvents), nontoxic and food-grade [34] , and these are important aspects to consider while developing natural extracts with potential pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications. In all the extracts obtained, PAC-B were reported as major compounds, while other phenolic constituents such as flavonoids and catechins were more abundant in extracts obtained with 40 \u2022 and 60 \u2022 ethanol [3] . Here, the laboratory-scale maceration protocol was transferred to a pilot plant-scale for a larger industrial application. Based on our previous results [3] and in order to preserve extraction efficiency reducing as much as possible the environmental impact, 40 \u2022 ethanol was maintained as extraction solvent, and the extraction yield was 10%.",

The tested LBE dosages fell within the dosage range that could be considered safe for oral ingestion, as demonstrated by the cytotoxicity assay in vitro on alveolar epithelial cells and in rats monitored for 15 days after a single LBE ingestion (2000 mg/kg body weight). Data from antibacterial assays showed that LBE was more effective in inhibiting the growth of MRSA, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa than GSE, suggesting its potential application as active ingredient for the prevention of respiratory-tract infections. GSE was chosen as comparison due to its documented antibacterial activity against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive species [35] [36] [37] , and because this natural extract is currently used in food supplements and nutraceuticals despite there are doubts about the chemical constituents responsible of these effects. In fact, although a recent publication indicates that the flavonoid naringin together with other unidentified phenolic compounds could be responsible, at last in part, of the antimicrobial activity of GSE [37] , older works reported the detection of quaternary ammonium salts preservatives such as benzethonium [38] [39] [40] and benzalkonium chlorides [41] in commercial GSE, which have been claimed to be formed by chemical conversion of GSE polyphenols during its production [35] . However, there is a general scientific disagreement about the supposed chemical pathways leading to the production of such ammonium quaternary salts from natural constituents of grapefruit seeds, considering also that the methods of GSE production are proprietary and have not been completely specified [42] . Furthermore, there is no clear evidence that these compounds are responsible of the antibacterial activity of GSE. Nevertheless, despite all these issues and the lack of exhaustive characterizations of GSE bioactives [26] , this natural extract is commercially available and currently used in formulations for human use.",

After extraction of larch bark, we performed the characterization of PACs profile and total phenolic content in the dry extract by using HPLC-FLD-MS. The extraction procedure allowed to concentrate almost six times the total PACs content in the dried bark, reaching an amount of almost 16% w/w in the final extract. Monomers and higher MW oligomers (i.e., pentamers and hexamers) contributed the most to this amount, representing the 5.12% and 5.28% w/w of the final extract, respectively. Regarding the composition in type-A and type-B PACs, the extraction procedure allowed to reach a PAC-A/PAC-B ration in LBE of 0.10, compared to 0.17 in the dried larch bark. In LBE, type-B PACs represented the 90.72% of total PACs, being dimers and trimers the most representative oligomers (Relative abundance = 49% and 23.19%, respectively). The abundance of PACs in LBE and the peculiar PAC-A and PAC-B oligomers distribution could in part explain the observed antibacterial activity against MRSA, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. PACs from larch (L. gmelinii) have shown to effectively inhibit the growth of S. aureus at a MIC of 1.75 mg/mL [18] . In the same study, the authors showed that larch PACs could exert their effect on S. aureus by altering several morphological properties of the bacterial membrane, as well as increasing the membrane electrolytic transportation, binding to DNA grooves to form complexes, and affecting energy metabolic systems and protein expression [18] . B-type PACs have also been associated to the antimicrobial activity of different bark, wood, stems and leaves extracts from Uncaria tomentosa against both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa [43] , while the high PACs content of PACs-enriched grape-seed extracts has been associated to their bacteriostatic activity against P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus spp. [44] , S. pyogenes, and H. influenzae [45] .",

Major contributors were gallic acid derivatives (1.57%) and phenolic acids, accounting for 1.66% w/w of LBE. Together with the high PACs content, the phenolic composition of LBE could explain, at least in part, the antibacterial activity observed in vitro. In fact, gallic acid derivatives, phenolic acids and flavonoids have all been reported to exert effective antimicrobial activity against different bacterial species [46] [47] [48] , among which several affecting the upper respiratory tract [49] . More specifically, the flavonoid isoquercitrin has been recently reported to significantly reduce the activity of staphylocoagulase, a virulence factor of S. aureus considered a promising target for the treatment of S. aureus infections, and to reduce the bacterial burden, pathological damage, and inflammation of lung tissue in mice [50] . Another flavonoid identified in LBE, rutin, has been already reported as antimicrobial agent, and in vitro antibacterial activity against S. aureus and P. aurigenosa has been documented [51] . Also stilbene derivatives have shown to exert antimicrobial activity against respiratory tract pathogens, as in the case of piceatannol, for which the activity against S. aureus (MIC = 25 \u00b5g/mL) has been reported [52] . Overall, although these preliminary data can partially associate the antibacterial activity of LBE observed in vitro to its chemical composition, further studies are required to correlate specific constituents to the efficacy against different bacteria.",

In this study, LBE was produced in an industrial pilot plant using an environmentally-friendly extraction method, suitable for the production of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical grade extracts. The ethanol/water mixture and the extraction protocol employed allowed us to obtain a LBE with an amount of PACs almost six times higher than obtained from dried bark powder, reaching 15% w/w. The high amount of PACs could be considered as the main contributor to the observed antibacterial activity of LBE, together with other phenolic compounds that were identified, namely the flavonoids isoquercitrin and rutin, and the stilbene piceatannol 3 -O-glucoside. In conclusion, the LBE obtained with an environmental-friendly extraction procedure represents a sustainable source of valuable bioactive compounds, and antimicrobial assays confirmed that this bio-waste could be a promising antibacterial ingredient for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.",
