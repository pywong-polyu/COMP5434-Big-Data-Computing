Among the more than 400 samples, we found molecular evidence of virus in most sample types, especially the nasopharygeal (NP), saliva, and fecal samples, but the prevalence of molecular positivity among fomites and aerosols was low. The agreement between NP swab and saliva positivity was high (89.5%, Kappa 0.79). Two NP swabs collected from patients on one and seven days post-symptom onset had evidence of infectious virus (2 passages over 14 days in Vero E6 cells). In summary, the low molecular prevalence and lack of viable SARS-CoV-2 virus in fomites and air samples implied low nosocomial risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission through inanimate objects or aerosols.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] Similarly, an existing body of observational coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) studies and related experimental research work suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by aerosols and may travel greater distances than two meters, similar to SARS-CoV-1 in 2003/04. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Further, fecal-oral transmission has been deemed possible as well. 12 However, more information is needed to clearly define the above mentioned transmission pathways, particularly in clinical settings where the protection of health care professionals is critical while personal protective gear is in shortage.",

Similarly, a hospital study conducted in Wuhan, China observed no SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 44 aerosol samples and a strikingly low positivity among fomites (1.3%). 36 ",

Hence, smaller aerosolized particles were more likely to be captured by our study as compared to larger ballistic droplets. However, surfaces, likely contaminated by larger droplets near the patient, were sampled via the surface swabbing. The study had a number of limitations. As has been previously documented, viral loads are highest shortly after symptom onset and the median length of time from infection until viral clearance is estimated to be nine days. [22] [23] [24] [25] Hence, it is plausible that a number of the studied COVID-19 patients were not shedding A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 15 virus as readily as they were early in their disease course. It is also possible that therapeutic interventions may have reduced virus transmission as eight (40.0%) of subjects were co-enrolled in clinical trials. We also acknowledge that we used dry cyclone aerosol samplers, which are not as well-suited for viable virus collection when compared to liquid collection medium-based bioaerosol samplers as exemplified by a study capturing infectious SARS-CoV-2 2 and 4.8 meters from patients with the VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water-vapor condensation principle. 10 Further, while the long bioaerosol sampling time (4 hours) intended to capture the temporal variability of viral emissions from the patients, it may also have decreased the viability of infectious virus. 13 However, we have previously captured viable virus using the NIOSH samplers, albeit in settings with high levels of viral contamination, such as live bird markets in Vietnam and China. 38, 39 We also acknowledge that the study has a relatively small sample size and the patients were not randomly selected. Hence patients may not be ",

Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 virus culture work was performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at the Duke Regional Biocontainment Laboratory. Specimens with molecular evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection were inoculated onto Vero E6 cells in two passages by transferring 250 \u00b5l of supernatant at 7 days postinoculation for a total 14 days of incubation. Cells were monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE) every 48 hours. The cells and supernatant harvested 14 days postinoculation were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by molecular assay. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed when (i) CPE was detected in inoculated wells and (ii) SARS-CoV-2 was detected in inoculated wells by real-time RT-PCR, at least two Cts below the original sample. The SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA) was used as the positive control in these passages. Mock infections, performed with media only, were maintained in parallel throughout the observation period.
