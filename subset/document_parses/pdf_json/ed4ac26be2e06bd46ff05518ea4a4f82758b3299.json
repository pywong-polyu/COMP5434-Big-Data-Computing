Assessing available data and the evolution of the completeness of the data compiled based on demographic techniques and other available data sources is of great importance for countries and for having timely and disaggregated mortality estimates. In this paper, we assess whether it is reasonable, based on the available data, to assume that there is a sex difference in the completeness of male and female death records in Peru in the last 30 years. In addition, we assess how the gap may have evolved with time by applying two-census death distribution methods on health-related registries and analyzing the information from the Demographic and Health Surveys and civil registries. Our findings suggest that there is no significant sex difference in the completeness of male and female health-related registries and, consequently, the sex gap currently observed in adult mortality estimates might be overestimated.",

When CRVS systems are not implemented or are not robust enough for the construction of reliable health indicators, household surveys and population censuses are alternatives (AbouZahr and Boerma, 2005) . These information sources, however, lack the required details for some policy-specific situations. For example, several of the Sustainable Development Goals are directly related to causes of deaths, which require reliable information on individual cause of death following the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) (Naghavi et al., 2010) . In addition, CRVS systems are able to produce health and mortality indicators that are continuous and at a smaller scale at relatively lower costs, which contributes to monitoring health outcomes in remote and vulnerable areas (The University of Melbourne, 2019) .",

For some LAC countries, death counts from administrative records have only recently become available for statistical purposes, disaggregated by age and sex (Mikkelsen et al., 2015) . Even when these data were available, they could contain inconsistencies in cause-of-death information, age groups, usual residence, or place of registration (Faijer, 1994; Mikkelsen et al., 2015) . Mortality assessments in LAC countries in the past were performed mostly using indirect methods which rely on summary indicators computed from household surveys or population censuses-such as under-5 mortality-and model life tables (Palloni, 1981; Moultrie et al., 2013) , although there is a significant difference across countries and CRVS systems (Palloni et al., 2016) .",

In this sense, the progress of the CRVS system's performance in the country was classified as slow (Mikkelsen et al., 2015) . Nevertheless, the country has made substantial efforts to improve the CRVS systems over the last decade . Although the CRVS system in Peru is considered incomplete, its health-related data, which are published periodically by the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica e Inform\u00e1tica (INEI), or National Institute of Statistics and Informatics, is a continuous series by age and sex that spans over three decades. Combining this information with the most recent Population and Housing Census in the country (INEI, 2017) allows us to evaluate the relative completeness of registries for the last decades by sex and regions. 1 This analysis is useful to shed light on the relative completeness of the health-related registries in the country and regions, and to assess the differential completeness of the registries by sex, illuminating with real data the possible evolution of the sex gap in adult mortality in the country. Despite the recent estimates of completeness of death registration by sex (Piscoya-Diaz and Queiroz, 2010) , not much has been discussed about the trends in sex differentials in death registries from the health information system or in the evolution of the sex gap in adult mortality over the last decade in Peru. 2 The main objective of this paper is to assess the death registration relative completeness (DRRC) by sex over the last three decades in Peru for national and subnational levels. Then, the impact of the estimated DRRC sex differentials on the magnitude of Peru's observed mortality sex gap is evaluated. The observed trend in the sex gap is compared across multiple data sources and methods of mortality estimation. In this regard, data from the civil registry, Ministry of Health, and national demography and health surveys are used. Finally, a discussion on the sex differential in adult mortality in Peru is presented, considering the existing evidence on the sex gap, highlighting the importance of using existing CRVS data in developing countries to assess mortality differentials.",

Among the related causes of death, significant excess male mortality is observed in young adulthood (15-24) (Nathanson, 1984) due to external causes and in late adulthood (50-70) (Preston, 1976; Nathanson, 1984) due to cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer, among other factors.",

Three of these methods are largely used in DRRC estimation: (1) generalized growth balance (Brass, 1975; Hill, 1987) ; (2) synthetic extinct generations (SEG) (Bennett and Horiuchi, 1981) ; and (3) the adjusted version of the synthetic extinct generation method corrected by relative census coverage estimated from the general growth balance method (combined GGB-SEG) (Dorrington et al., 2008; Hill et al., 2009) . The rationale of each of these methods is briefly described in the following paragraphs. Brass (1975) proposed the growth balance equation to assess population completeness in stable populations closed to migration. This equation states that the entry rate at each age group x and over ( N (x)/N (x+) , where N(x) is number of members to age group x and N (x+) and members of age groups x and over is equal to the constant growth rate r (stability assumption) plus the exit rate from the population aged x and over ( D(x+)/N (x+) , where D(x+) is the number of deaths to population aged x and over. Considering a death record completion level C and observed deaths D * , we can estimate DRRC level by the ratio D * (x+)/D(x+).",

Net migration estimates can be used for adjusting population counts in DDM, but this approach should be considered with caution, since net migration estimates are difficult to precise (Moultrie et al., 2013) . However, it is still recommended to take into account the possible biases generated when these assumptions are not met. The migration issue is generally treated by adjusting the selection criteria of age groups to compute DRRC levels. Hill et al. (2009) recommends computing the average of GGB and SEG methods using the age range 30+ and 65+ when migration is seen to affect the estimation procedure-it is not recommended to use much older age groups (75+) due to age-misreporting issues. Other approaches consider the use of a hybrid version of GGB and SEG methods: Murray et al. (2010) suggest using SEG for age range 55 to 80, GGB for 50 to 70, and GGB-SEG for 50 to 70, Hill (2017) recommends the age range from 5 to 65 for GGB and 50 to 70 for SEG; and Glei et al.

Thus, the dates were estimated from the variables on age at death, years since siblings' death, and date of interview. Also, data for the years 2016 and 2018 presented high missing counts for the sampling weights of female respondents (96% and 94% missing, respectively), and the information of sibling histories for these 2 years were not considered in the analysis. For the other years ranging from 2009 to 2019, the sampling weights of female respondents did not present missing values (detailed information on ENDES's sample size and missing values for the specific variables are available in Appendix A).",

In Latin America, few countries have information technology systems in which the standardization and harmonization of birth and death registries are done at the moment of the event registration, resulting in a single and harmonized database, as in Chile, for example. Brazil and Mexico, such as Peru, also have two databases for death registration: one from civil registration records and the other from health records.

We computed the estimated sensitivity analysis intervals with the minimum and maximum values computed from the 20 possible age selection combinations we presented in the methodological section and their respective mean values. The relative completeness of death registration of MINSA data in Peru has shown a stagnant or worsening performance in the period from 1993 to 2017. Female deaths had a mean relative completeness from the GGB-SEG method of 84% in 1993-2007 period (ranging from 81 to 87%), which reduced to 79% in the 2007-2017 period (ranging from 74 to 88%). For males, those values were 80% (ranging from 76 to 85%) and 79% (ranging from 72 to 90%) respectively. Therefore, mean estimates and sensitivity analysis intervals do not suggest significant sex differences in completeness of death registration in MINSA data. The wider sensitivity analysis intervals for the last intercensal period might be related to greater migration flows in the country. The sex difference at the subnational level need to be interpreted with caution due to differential internal net migration flows by sex, which means that the sex difference in the relative completeness estimated might not be real but an artifact of the biases produced by the method due to sex-differences in the net migration flows across regions. Areas from higher socioeconomic strata (located in the coastal areas of the country) are among those with the highest DRRC levels (Tacna, Lima, and Callao). These results might reflect the unequal distribution of health services, infrastructure, and wealth throughout the country (Huynen et al., 2005) .",

Overall, WPP 2019, GBD, and LAMBdA estimates present higher levels of adult mortality for both males and females during the entire period analyzed . Estimates from MINSA, SINADEF and RENIEC data are lower than these estimates, as expected, because these data are known to be incomplete, but all series show internal consistency throughout the years. The data bars named \"MINSA GGB-SEG\" and \"MINSA SEG\" correspond to the Ministry of Health data series adjusted for relative completeness using the sensitivity analysis interval values presented in Tables 3 and 4 , as estimated with the combined GGB-SEG and SEG methods. The series adjusted by SEG method present lower values than the reference estimates, but they are getting closer to GBD and WPP 2019 estimates over the last years than the GGB-SEG method. So, the series adjusted by the SEG method are closer to WPP 2019 and GBD reference estimates. Furthermore, we also present the estimates computed from ENDES survey household deaths and sibling histories. This last method is known for underestimating mortality (Masquelier, 2013) and its results must be seen with caution. Although the levels of these estimates are much lower, they present a trend in time by sex that is consistent with the other estimates. This trend is not followed by our unadjusted estimates using data from MINSA, SINA-DEF, RENIEC, and the ENDES survey, or the MINSA series adjusted by GGB-SEG and SEG methods. ENDES results of household mortality inquiry present estimates of sex gap ranging from 2.10 in 2015.5 to 3.40 in 2016.5. The estimates using Ministry of Health data (MINSA and SINADEF) show an oscillatory but decreasing trend in the sex gap until the beginning of the availability of SINADEF. The interval estimates obtained by adjusting MINSA data by the sensitivity analysis interval of completeness of death registration levels present results between GBD estimates and unadjusted MINSA estimates from 2010 to 2018, within the range of 2.00 to 3.25 years of sex gap in life expectancy at age 15. Even at the highest levels of estimated DRRC, the estimated sex gap in life expectancy at age 15 is below 3.75 in the last intercensal period.",

First of all, it is not possible to assume that all assumptions of the death distribution methods (population closed to migration, absence of age misreporting, and constant death registration completeness among all age groups) are met. Even though a combination of age ranges was provided to show the possible adjustments to the data and the sensitivity of estimates for breaking these assumptions, for estimating official mortality rates in the country one should define a specific age group selection and implement more testing for the violation of the methods' assumptions. Also, when estimating mortality rates for age 60 and above, it is important to take into account adjustments for old age mortality misreporting (Preston et al., 1999; Palloni and Pinto-Aguirre, 2011) . In this paper, it is assumed that old age misreporting is similar for males and females, and so it would not significantly affect the sex gap in life expectancy at age 15, but it can affect the level of e 15 for each sex (see Table 8 in Appendix B). The old age adjustment can be driving the differences in the levels of life expectancy encountered in our estimates and LAMBdA and WPP 2019 estimates if the assumptions are not being met. In conclusion, for official life table estimation in Peru, the recommendation is to analyze old age misreporting and to adjust the data accordingly. ",

The complexity underlying mortality estimates and the range of data and methods available can be noted in this work. Peru has two CRVS data sources: health records from the Ministry of Health (MINSA) for longer age-sex time series; and civil registration records from the civil registration office (RENIEC), which has age data from 2016 on. The two data sources varied considerably in the number of deaths recorded from 2005 to 2019 and users need to have caution when compiling mortality statistics for the country doing a detailed quality assessment of the sources. Recently, MINSA have developed the National Death Information System (SINADEF), a promising database created to unify and harmonize death registration records, enhancing data quality and coverage .",

However, the completeness estimates are not significantly different between males and females. These results are in tandem with previous studies for the region that did not find striking differences in the levels of completeness by sex (Gonzaga et al., 2018; Peralta et al., 2019) .",

Our results suggest that the gap in life expectancy at age 15 in Peru in the last decade is between 2 and 3.75 years (considering estimates from both GGB-SEG and SEG), which could be higher because of old age misreporting, contrasting with the 5.25 years presented in the 2019 revision of WPP for the 2015-2020 period.",

For instance, the decision regarding which data should be used to estimate mortality rates, RENIEC (civil registry) or MINSA (health records), is not straightforward, because it depends of data availability and data disaggregation. The civil registration system is a multi-stage process that often involves multiple arms of government (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Interior, National Statistics Office) which entails a complex flow of data across the different steps of vital event notification, registration and certification (of cause of death). Having well-structured and interconnected information systems is a challenge and needs consistent institutional integration, data quality assessment and political will for being able to gather all deaths occurring in the country.",

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the importance of strengthening CRVS systems for building capacity to monitor the direct and indirect impacts of the disease across the country. Analyzing the quality of CRVS data, either by observing the trends of the registries through time at the national and subnational levels, assessing the completeness of death records with demographic methods, or even using the data for analytical purposes, helps with the diagnosis of problems in death recording at the local level and promotes the enhancement of data capacity and data utility in the country. Discrepancies between health information system and the civil registration data need to be continuously evaluated and studied to guide progressive enhancement to the system. Building up solid and resilient death registration systems is key to advancing the country's efforts to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.",
