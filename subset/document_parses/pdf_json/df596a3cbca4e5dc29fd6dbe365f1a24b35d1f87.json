            "text": "Prior research developed Reassortment Networks to reconstruct the evolution of segmented viruses under both reassortment and mutation. We report their application to the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 virus (S-OIV). A database of all influenza A viruses, for which complete genome sequences were available in Genbank by October 2009, was created and dynamic programming was used to compute distances between all corresponding segments. A reassortment network was created to obtain the minimum cost evolutionary paths from all viruses to the exemplar S-OIV A/California/04/2009. This analysis took 35 hours on the Cray Extreme Multithreading (XMT) supercomputer, which has special hardware to permit efficient parallelization. Six specific H1N1/H1N2 bottleneck viruses were identified that almost always lie on minimum cost paths to S-OIV. We conjecture that these viruses are crucial to S-OIV evolution and worthy of careful study from a molecular biology viewpoint. In phylogenetics, ancestors are typically medians that have no functional constraints. In our method, ancestors are not inferred, but rather chosen from previously observed viruses along a path of mutation and reassortment leading to the target virus. This specificity and functional constraint render our results actionable for further experiments in vitro and in vivo.",

It is maintained in migratory waterfowl and can infect many species including humans, birds, pigs, horses, and other animals. The virus genome contains eight segments that code for 10 or 11 proteins. Three segments encode the polymerase complex: basic polymerase 2 (PB2), basic polymerase 1 (PB1), and the acidic protein (PA). The nucleoprotein segment (NP) encodes a protein that binds to viral RNA. The matrix segment (MP) encodes two proteins: a structural component of the viral capsid and a membrane ion channel. The nonstructural segment (NS) encodes a protein essential for cellular RNA processing and transport. Two other segments, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), encode viral surface glycoproteins responsible for host cell entry and exit, respectively [7] , [8] . The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes determine the viral subtype, designated HxNy, where x is one of 16 known hemagglutinin subtypes [9] and y is one of nine known neuraminidase subtypes [7] .",

It is important to describe many of the low-level implementation details to allow other researchers to appreciate the complexities of this project and pursue its applications and extensions. In particular, we cover the details of data gathering and processing that were necessary to create the database that is at the center of this work. The issues of parallel computation, both on a distributed memory commodity cluster as well as on a shared-memory massively multithreaded supercomputer are also covered, as the reassortment algorithm could not be run in an acceptable amount of time without these. Finally, the presentation of output as \"in-trees\" that capture both mutation and reassortment is important for interpretation and evaluation of our results.",

We use \"end-space free\" alignments [21, Section 11.6.4]. Such alignments ignore any missing bases at the ends of the input strings, which are due to sequencing artifact. When computing distances, we needed to account for symbols other than A, C, T, G, that represent ambiguous bases [22] . This issue is described in detail in the online Supplemental Material, Appendix F. The number of fully sequenced (all eight segments known) influenza A viruses in www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ genomes/FLU as of 15 October 2009 was 5,016. Thus, we needed to carry out 8 \u00c2 \u00f05;016 \u00c2 5;017\u00de=2 % 101 \u00c2 10 6 alignments. The memory requirements in this case are modest, as the length of an influenza segment is <2;500 bases, implying dynamic programming matrices of size <10 7 . Furthermore, the 101 \u00c2 10 6 alignments are completely independent and thus trivial to parallelize.",

Only the i and k loops need to be parallelized since the number of viruses \u00bc 5;016 and this results in enough parallelism (5;016 2 computations) to keep the machine busy. Thus, the s loop is not parallelized. The readfe(.) (wait until full, then read and set empty) (writeef(.) (wait until empty, then write and set full)) functions lock (unlock) their arguments (which are individual words) so that multiple threads can safely and correctly update them. Although expressed as functions, these are really machine operations that are executed in one clock cycle, leading to very efficient, fine grained synchronization. This behavior is possible because the Cray XMT supercomputer has special synchronization bits with each memory location. An illustration of synchronization is provided in the online Supplemental Material, Appendix H. Notice how variables are declared only in the scopes where they are used.

This is necessary to get useful information from our reassortment network. This is because the algorithm searches for shortest paths in terms of sums of edge weights. If a high threshold (or no threshold) is used, all evolutionary paths will be only a few edges long, thus obscuring fine grained information on mutations and reassortments. If a zero threshold is used, no path will be found (as the target will be disconnected from the rest of the graph). For our 5,016 virus, 35 stage problem, we found that 500 was a choice of threshold that gave useful information. This phenomenon is discussed in Section 5.4 and Fig. 8 of our previously published paper [19] .",

In addition to the constraints stated in Section 4.1, we used a reassortment overhead of 10 units to suppress trivial, small distance reassortments that would otherwise clutter up our paths. Such reassortments are indistinguishable from point mutations and drive interesting large-distance reassortments out of the 35-stage range of our experiment. The overhead is incorporated by adding 10 units to the reassortment edges of our network.",

A reassortment with A/swine/HongKong/NS29/2009, which has low distance (160) for the NA segment results in a virus that is very close to the target. Furthermore, the years of the three viruses in each possible reassortment are obviously consistent (as a result of constraints built into the reassortment network). Finally, most of these viruses are remarkably close to each other, as Table 3 demonstrates. This distance matrix gives the absolute distances (sums of the segment-wise distances) between all pairs of bottleneck viruses. The four H1N2 viruses are very close to each other as are the two H1N1 viruses. Tables 4 and 5 show the shortest paths from our run, organized by number of edges and permit us to identify unusual events. We would expect the path length to increase with the number of edges in a path across paths and within paths and this does, in general, happen. However it is noticeable that the weight of the shortest path for edges \u00bc 2 in Table 4 is remarkably small. This path starts in A/duck/ NC/91347/01, a virus that we have already noted, in Section 5.3, as being oddly similar to the bottleneck viruses (though only having a single path through it). Olsen et al. [32] described this strain in 2003 and showed that it has great similarity with swine origin viruses. Similarly, for paths with three edges, A/swine/OH/511445/2007 (not a bottleneck) has an unusually low distance to the target, compared with other viruses with the same number of edges.",
