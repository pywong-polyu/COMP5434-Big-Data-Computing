In this approach, all interactions among all components in a system are described mathematically and computed models are established. These in silico models encode and test hypotheses about mechanisms underlying the function of cells, the pathogenesis, and pathophysiology of disease and contribute to the identification of new drug targets and drug design. The development of in silico models is facilitated by rapidly advancing experimental and analytical tools that generate information-rich, high-throughput biological data. Bioinformatics providing tools for pattern recognition, machine learning, statistical modeling, and data extraction from databases contribute to in silico modeling. Dynamical systems theory is the natural language to investigate complex biological systems demonstrating nonlinear spatiotemporal behavior. Most of the in silico models aim to complement and not replace experimental research. Experimental data are needed for parameterization, calibration, and validation of in silico models. Typical examples in biology are models for molecular networks, where the behavior of cells is expressed in terms of quantitative changes in the levels of transcripts and gene products as well as models of the cell cycle. In medicine, in silico models of cancer, immunological disease, lung disease, and infectious diseases complement conventional research with in vitro models, animal models, and clinical trials. This chapter presents basic concepts of bioinformatics, systems biology, and their applications in in silico modeling and reviews its applications in biology and disease.",

Bioinformatics is a key tool to analyze the huge data sets obtained from these techniques. The computational analysis of global gene expression profiling at the mRNA or protein level has shown that previously unsuspected genes may be associated either with muscle development or growth and may lead to the development of new molecular indicators of tenderness (Hocquette et al., 2007) . Gene expression profiling has been used to document changes in gene expression, for example, following infection by pathological organisms (Meade et al., 2006) , during the metabolic changes imposed by lactation in dairy cows (Loor et al., 2005) , in cloned bovine embryos (Somers et al., 2006) and in various other models.",

Those in the field claim that it represents a shift in perspective toward holism instead of reduction. Systems biology brings in the aspect of complex systems to cell biology. The fundamental guiding principle of the field of systems biology is that of studying the cell as a whole entity and not merely in parts or isolation. It treats the cell as one functional component with a highly efficient integrated machinery of molecular interactions causing activation of cellular interactions which lead to effects in tissues and organs that subsequently manifest in physiological functions. This integrated understanding makes systems biology truly interdisciplinary combing fields of biology, mathematics, physics, computer science, and electrical engineering.",

In other words, models can be deductive or inductive. If the prediction is necessarily true given that the model is also true, then the model is a deductive model. On the other hand, if the prediction is statistically inferred from observations, then the model is inductive. Deductive models contain a mathematical description, for example, the reaction\u00c0diffusion equations that make predictions about reality. If these predictions do not agree with experiment, then the validity of the entire model may be questioned. Mathematical models are commonly applied in physical sciences. On the other hand, inductive models are mostly applied in the biological sciences. In biology, models are used to describe, simulate, analyze, and predict the behavior of biological systems. Modeling in biology provides a framework that enables description and understanding of biological systems through building equations that express biological knowledge. Modeling enables the simulation of the behavior of a biological system by performing in silico experiments, that is, numerically solving the equations/rules that describe the model. The results of these in silico experiments become the input for further analysis, e.g., identification of key parameters or mechanisms, interpretation of data, or comparison of the ability of different mechanisms to generate observed data.",

These in silico models complement traditional in vivo animal models and can be applied to quantitatively study the behavior of a system of interacting components. The advent of highthroughput experimental tools has allowed for the simultaneous measurement of thousands of biomolecules, opening the way for in silico model construction of increasingly large and diverse biological systems. Integrating heterogeneous dynamic data into quantitative predictive models holds great promise to significantly increase our ability to understand and rationally intervene in disease-perturbed biological systems. This promise-particularly with regard to personalized medicine and medical intervention-has motivated the development of new methods for systems analysis of human biology and disease. Such approaches offer the possibility of gaining new insights into the behavior of biological systems, of providing new frameworks for organizing and storing data and performing statistical analyses, of suggesting new hypotheses and new experiments, and even of offering a \"virtual laboratory\" to supplement in vivo and in vitro work.",

Thus mathematically sophisticated but biologically useless models often arise because of a lack of biological input, leading to models that are biologically unrealistic or address a question of little biological importance. On the other hand, models may be biologically realistic but mathematically intractable. This problem usually arises because biologists unfamiliar with the limitations of mathematical analysis want to include every known biological effect in the model. Even if it were possible to produce such models they would be of little use since their behavior would be as complex to investigate as the experimental situation. These problems can be avoided by formulating clear explicit biological goals before attempting to construct a model. This will ensure that the resulting model is biologically sound, can be experimentally verified, and will generate biological insight or new biological hypotheses. The aim of a model should not simply be to reproduce the biological data, and indeed often the most useful models are those that exhibit discrepancies from the experiment. Such deviations will typically stimulate new experiments or hypotheses. An iterative approach has been proposed, starting with a biological problem, developing a mathematical model, and then feeding back into the biology. Once established, this collaborative loop can be traversed many times, leading to ever-increasing understanding.",

This is achieved by using a level of mathematical abstraction that needs a minimum of biological information to capture all physiologically relevant features of a cellular network. For example, ideally, for in silico modeling of a molecular network, knowledge of the network structure, of all reaction rates, concentrations, and spatial distributions of molecules at any time point is needed. Unfortunately, such information is unavailable even for the best-studied systems. In silico simulations thus always have to use a level of mathematical abstraction, which is dictated by the extent of our biological knowledge, by molecular details of the network, and by the specific questions that are addressed. Understanding the complexity of the diseases and its biological significance in health can be achieved by integrating data from the different functional genomics experiments with medical, physiological, and information on environmental factors and computed mathematically. The advantage of mathematical modeling of disease lies in the fact that such models not only shed insight as to how a complex process works, which could be very difficult to infer an understanding of each component of this process but also predict what may follow as time evolves or as the characteristics of particular system components are modified. Mathematical models have generally been utilized in association with an increased understanding of what models can offer in terms of prediction and insight.",

However rarely these methods have been integrated with a large cell\u00c0cell communication network in a complex tumor microenvironment. Recently, an interesting effort of in silico modeling was described, in which the investigators integrated all the intercellular signaling pathways known to date for human glioma and generated a dynamic cell\u00c0cell communication network associated with the glioma microenvironment. Then, they applied evolutionary population dynamics and the Hill functions to interrogate this intercellular signaling network and execute an in silico tumor microenvironment development. The observed results revealed a profound influence of the microenvironmental factors on tumor initiation and growth and suggested new options for glioma treatment by targeting cells or soluble mediators in the tumor microenvironment (Wu et al., 2012) .",

In certain circumstances, the degree of the acute inflammatory response may result in pathologic manifestations, namely, SIRS, sepsis, and multiple organ failure. Further research is needed for the appropriate management of these states. Despite longstanding efforts, there has been uniform difficulty in translating the results of basic science research into effective therapeutic regimes. It has been suggested that this difficulty is due in part to a failure to account for the complex, nonlinear nature of the inflammatory process of which SIRS/MOF represents a disordered state. In silico modeling seems to be a promising research approach in this field. Indeed, in silico modeling of inflammation has been applied in an effort to bridge the gap between basic science and clinical trials. Specifically, both agent-based modeling and equationbased modeling have been utilized (Vodovotz et al., 2008; Geris et al., 2010) . Equation-based modeling encompasses primarily ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). Initial modeling studies were focused on the pathophysiology of the acute inflammatory response to stress, and these studies suggested common underlying processes generated in response to infection, injury, and shock. Later, mathematical models included the recovery phase of injury and gave insight into the link between the initial inflammatory response and the subsequent healing process. The first mathematical model of wound healing dates back to the 1980s and early 1990s. These models and others developed in the 1990s investigated epidermal healing, repair of the dermal extracellular matrix, wound contraction, and wound angiogenesis. Most of these models were deterministic and formulated using differential equations. In addition, recent models have been formulated using differential equations to analyze different strategies for improved healing, including wound VACs, commercially engineered skin substitutes, and hyperbaric oxygen. In addition, agentbased models have been used in wound healing research. For example, Mi et al. (2007) have developed an agent-based model to analyze different treatment strategies with wound debridement and topical administration of growth factors. Their model produced the expected results of healing when analyzing for different treatment strategies including debridement, release of PDGF, reduction in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and increase of TGF-\u03b21. The investigators suggested that a drug company should use a mathematical model to test a new drug before going through the expensive process of basic science testing, toxicology, and clinical trials (Mi et al., 2007) . Indeed, clinical trial design can be improved by prior in silico modeling. For example, in silico modeling has led to the knowledge that patients who suffered from the immune-suppressed phenotype of late-stage multiple organ failure and were susceptible to usually trivial nosocomial infections demonstrated sustained elevated markers of tissue damage and inflammation through 2 weeks of simulated time. However anticytokine drug trials with treatment protocols of only one dose or 1 day had not incorporated this knowledge into their design, with subsequent failure of candidate treatments.",

Even after the preinfection stage, the environment still modulates the hos-t\u00c0agent intersections. For example, the ability (and thus the related parameters) of the agent to multiply and/or harm the host are continually influenced by the host's environmental conditions, and in a similar way, the host's defense against the adverse effects of the agents are modulated by host's environmental conditions. But somehow, not so many of these parameters have been included in in silico infectious disease models in the recent past. A few examples of these parameters are host's ambient temperature, host's ambient atmospheric humidity, altitude, host's light\u00c0dark cycle, etc.",

(2005) have documented (through their paper Replication dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in chronically infected mice) a successful in silico modeling of infectious diseases (specifically, tuberculosis). In their in silico modeling of tuberculosis in mice, the researchers investigated both the static and dynamic of host\u00c0pathogen/agent equilibrium (i.e., mice-mycobacterium tuberculosis static and dynamic equilibrium). The rationale behind their study was that a better understanding of host\u00c0pathogen/ agent interactions would make possible the development of better antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (as well as provide similar a understanding for the cases of other chronic infectious diseases). They modeled different types of host\u00c0pathogen/agent equilibriums (ranging from completely static equilibrium, all the way through semidynamic, down to completely dynamic scenarios) by varying the rate of multiplication/growth and the rate of death of the pathogen/agent (M. tuberculosis) during the infection's chronic phase. Through their in silico study (which was also verified experimentally), Mu\u00f1 oz-El\u00edas et al. (2005) documented a number of remarkable findings. For example, they established that \"viable bacterial counts and total bacterial counts in the lungs of chronically infected mice do not diverge over time\" and explained that \"rapid degradation of dead bacteria is unlikely to account for the stability of total counts in the lungs over time, because treatment of mice with isoniazid for 8 weeks led to a marked reduction in the viable counts without reducing the total count.\"",

Among the amyloid proteins, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides (A\u03b242 and A\u03b240) are known to form aggregates that deposit as senile plaques in the brains of AD patients. The process of A\u03b2 aggregation is strongly nucleationdependent and is inferred by the occurrence of a \"lagphase\" prior to fibril growth that shows a sigmoidal pattern. Ghosh et al. (2010) dissected the growth curve into three biophysically distinct sections to simplify the modeling and to allow the data to be experimentally verifiable. Stage I is where the prenucleation events occur whose mechanism is largely unknown. The prenucleation stage is extremely important in dictating the overall aggregation process where critical events such as conformation change and concomitant aggregation take place, and it is also the most experimentally challenging to decipher. In addition to mechanistic reasons, this stage is also physiologically important as low-molecular weight species are implicated in AD pathology. The rate-limiting step of nucleation is followed by growth (stage II, Fig. 22 .1). The overall growth kinetics and structure and shape of the fibrils are mainly determined by the structure of nucleating species. An important intermediate along the aggregation pathway, called \"protofibrils\" have been isolated and characterized that have propensities to both elongate (by monomer addition) as well as to laterally associate (protofibril\u00c0protofibril association) to grow into mature fibrils (stage III in the growth curve).",

What are the challenges in in silico modeling of infectious diseases? 4. What are the three types of cancer models discussed in the chapter? 5. Discuss the parameters considered for in silico modeling of infectious diseases.Answers to short answer questions 1. The template-based transcriptional control network reconstruction method exploits the principle that orthologous proteins regulate orthologous target genes. In this approach, regulatory interactions are transferred from a genome (such as a genome of a model organism or well-studied organism) to the new genome. 2. The ultimate goal of in silico modeling in biology is the detailed understanding of the function of molecular networks as they appear in metabolism, gene regulation, or signal transduction. 3. There are two major challenges in modeling infectious diseases: a. Difficulty in finding the most appropriate set of parameters for the in silico modeling of infectious diseases is often a challenge. b. Understanding the results from all the complex interactions of parameters considered. 4. There are three types of cancer models. Continuum models: In these models, extracellular parameters can be represented as continuously distributed variables to mathematically model cell\u00c0cell or cell\u00c0environment interactions in the context of cancers and the tumor microenvironment. Discrete models: These models represent cancer cells as discrete entities of defined location and scale, interacting with one another and external factors in discrete time intervals according to predefined rules. Hybrid models: These models incorporate both continuum and discrete variables in a modular approach. 5. There are three types of parameters considered for in silico modeling of infectious diseases:Answers to yes/no type questions 1.
