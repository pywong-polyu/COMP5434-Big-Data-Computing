            "text": "There is a global trend of insufficient physical activity (PA) in adolescents, putting their current and future health at risk [1, 2] . Specifically, 81% of adolescents are reported to be insufficiently physically active worldwide, meaning that they do not reach the WHO's recommendation of 60 min of PA a day [1] . In support of this, a recent paper reported that 56% of girls and 44% of boys in Bosnia and Herzegovina perform insufficient PA [3] . It is well known that sufficient PA decreases the incidence of various chronic diseases, including metabolic, respiratory and cardiac diseases, and numerous forms of cancer [4] . Thus, it is of great importance to promote PA during adolescence, as this is a critical period for establishing behavior patterns and personal lifestyle choices [5] . What is more, there is firm evidence that health habits during adolescence track into adulthood, with low PA tracking better than high PA [6] . A Finnish study found that adolescents with low PA had a higher probability of being smokers in adulthood, which is an additional detriment to health [7] . Not surprisingly, numerous studies have focused on the identification of the determinants and factors that affect PA in adolescents, in order to develop specific strategies for PA promotion [8] [9] [10] .",

In general, adolescents' PA is positively associated with male gender, perceived activity competence, intentions to exercise, previous childhood PA, social support, family cohesion, the families' high socioeconomic status, and opportunities to exercise [13] . Conversely, an inverse relationship with PA has been recorded for increased age, smoking, unhealthy diet, depression, and sedentary behavior after school and on weekends [9] . Interestingly, studies have evidenced a positive association between sedentary activities related to school (i.e., doing homework, reading, studying) and PA, indicating that specific correlations may exist between scholastic factors/academic achievement and PA in adolescence [14, 15] .",

Similarly, higher school grades predict higher PAL in adolescents from the USA [15] . While there is certain evidence that PA positively influences cognitive capacities [17, 18] , it is also theorized that adolescents with better academic achievement and better school behavior are more likely to assume positive health behaviors, including the importance of being physically active. Indeed, adolescents who spend time improving their academic performance and are more productive during their leisure time are more likely to spend time doing PA [14] . Adolescents who productively spend their after-school time doing homework and studying have better time-management skills and, thus, can better create time for PA. On the other hand, individuals who spend time engaging in other sedentary behaviors (e.g., watching TV, playing video games) are reported to be less physically active and more involved in health-risk behaviors [14, 19] . However, the associations between academic achievement and PAL are not conclusive; a study on Chinese adolescents has evidenced no association [20] , while a study on Korean adolescents evidenced a negative association [21] between these factors. Therefore, the problem should be further examined, and special emphasis should be placed on the possible cultural differences that may have caused such inconclusive results.",

Numerous strategies for reducing the incidence of infection have been implemented, with social distancing measures being the most notable. Most places where many people can gather (e.g., schools, universities, sports facilities) were closed [22] . Therefore, as movement opportunities decreased, studies consistently reported a decrease in PALs among adolescents globally [23] [24] [25] , including in Southeastern Europe [26, 27] . Not surprisingly, studies investigating PAL and changes in PAL during the COVID-19 pandemic have also aimed to determine the factors that influence PA, through comparison to investigations undertaken in \"regular\" circumstances.",

In support of this, active adolescents decreased the intensity of the PA more than their less-active peers [31] . Furthermore, environmental factors influenced PAL significantly, as adolescents from urban environmental settings decreased their PAL to a greater extent compared to their rural peers [29, 32] . This was related to the higher access to sports facilities among urban adolescents in normal circumstances, and the closure of those facilities during the pandemic. Conflict with parents was negatively associated with PA, as parents who were in conflict with their children were not able to efficiently encourage their children to be physically active during the pandemic [24, 28] . Moreover, a recent study evidenced that pre-pandemic sports participation and fitness status was positively associated with PALs during the pandemic, which was explained by the better physical literacy of children involved in sports, and their motivation to stay physically active even in \"irregular\" circumstances, such as COVID-19-imposed lockdowns [28] .",

However, no study so far has documented the influence of scholastic factors on PAL in this challenging situation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of scholastic factors (i.e., academic achievement, behavioral grade, school absences) on PAL in adolescents from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, and to evaluate their possible influence on changes in PAL which occurred as a result of the imposed measures of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that students with better academic achievement generally act more responsibly towards themselves and their success. Furthermore, we theorized that they will act more responsibly towards their health, they will have the knowledge and awareness of the importance of PA for their health, and that scholastic factors would be protective against PA decline in adolescents. We were of the opinion that the results of this study would be applicable to the development of targeted campaigns against the known and widespread decrease of PAL in adolescence, not only in the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also during other health crises, weather crises, environmental crises, or other situations where there may be limited movement opportunities.",

The adolescents filled the PAQ-A on two occasions: first, before the lockdown period (baseline PAL), and second, during the lockdown period (follow-up PAL). The PAQ-A is a self-administered questionnaire designed for adolescents from 14 to 19 years old, which includes questions regarding PA during the last 7 days [33] . The PAQ-A consists of nine items assessing the frequency of participation in different types of PA (i.e., PA during physical education classes, school recess, free play, sports). The results of each item and the total score are scaled from 1 to 5, representing low to high PAL, respectively [34] . In this study, we observed the crude results of PAL at the baseline (PALBL), and PAL at the follow-up (PALFU). Next, the crude PAL was also observed as a binomial variable with two categories: results lower than 2.73 were classified as insufficient PAL, and results higher than 2.73 were marked as sufficient/normal PAL, as previously suggested [34] . Further, to quantify the changes in PALBL and PALFU, we calculated the crude numerical difference between these two values (PAL\u2206 = PALBL \u2212 PALFU). Next, we calculated the relative changes in PAL between the baseline and follow-up (in %) using the following calculation: PAL\u2206% = (PALBL \u2212 PALFU)/PALBL \u00d7 100. For the purpose of later statistical calculations, the participants were ordered according to their PAL\u2206%, and then grouped into two groups (0-50th percentile, and above). The participants with a greater relative decline of PAL (in the above-50th percentile group) were the \"high-risk group\", while those in the first 50 percentiles were the \"low-risk group\". Such dichotomization allowed us to calculate the logistic regression for PAL\u2206% as a binomial criterion.",

However, this was not unexpected, as previous studies on similar samples of high-school students were inconsistent with regards to associations between academic achievement and PAL. Studies on Canadian, American, and Norwegian high-school students found that adolescents with higher school grades had higher PALs [14, 16, 37] . The authors explained their results by assuming that individuals who are more committed to school duties have better self-discipline and time management skills, and consequently make more time for PA. Additionally, intelligent students with good academic achievement were thought to need less time for studying, and thus have more time for PA [38] . On the contrary, a study on adolescents from Korea showed a negative association between academic achievement and PAL [21] , which was supported by Coleman [39] , who argued that this negative association is due to the belief that high PA drains children's energy and has a debilitating effect on academic attainment. Similar to our study, a study on high-school students from England found no associations between school grades and PAL [40] . There could be several possible explanations, such as cultural differences and environmental situations, but the authors of that study explained such findings by the type of school. They investigated students from one \"good\" school that enrolls mainly good students; thus, academic grades clustered towards the higher end, restricting the variability within the academic scores. It can be assumed that the type of school could have affected the associations in our study as well.",

Our investigation included adolescents from different schools that are known to vary in the demands of their academic program (unlike the previously discussed English study of Daley and Ryan [40] ). This means that children with average academic achievement in a high-quality school would most likely have excellent achievement if they were students in a less demanding school program. It implies that academic achievement expressed by GPA cannot be objectively compared between different schools. As a result, the previously established explanation for the association between academic success and PAL (i.e., more intelligent children need less time for academic duties and have more free time for being physically active) cannot be applied in our investigation. As it was noted that students from different schools are not comparable based on grades, the Matura exam at the end of high school education was implemented in the country to improve the objectivity of academic achievement [42] . However, in our study, we used GPA, as we included students from first to fourth grade who had not completed the Matura exam yet.",

Thus, in previous studies on similar samples of students from southeastern Europe, it was noted that behavior grades are the strongest predictor of SUM (smoking, alcohol, drugs) [35, 36] . Specifically, studies have noted that adolescents with poor behavior grades have a higher risk of engaging in health-risk behaviors [35, 43] . Therefore, we initially assumed that there would be associations between behavior grades and PAL (as a specific type of health-risk behavior); however, this was not the case. The most likely reason for this is that behavior grades are given based on subjective evaluations and perceptions of students' behavior [20] .",

Therefore, children with poor behavior grades are often those children who partake in health-risk behavior (such as SUM, especially smoking). This can be explained by the theory that health-risk behaviors often occur together; that is, one behavior often leads to another [44] . Related to this, adolescents who are not good at school may be in non-controlled social environments, and may be more socially influenced by peers involved in undesirable and problematic behaviors [35] . At first glance, it seems that there should also be a link between poor behavior grades and low PAL (which is also a health-threatening behavior). However, low PAL, cannot be considered an undesirable behavior, because it can be caused by some \"objective\" factors such as obesity, socioeconomic status, depression, screen time, and other sedentary behaviors, which are generally not related to a non-controlled social environment, which is regular determinant of SUM [45] . This most likely explains the lack of association between behavioral grade and PAL, irrespective of previous findings where a poor behavioral grade was associated with other health-threatening behaviors in adolescents.",

In brief, as schools were closed and adolescents shifted to attending online school classes during the COVID-19 lockdown, they had to create new daily routines, including attending online classes, studying, and involvement in other non-school activities (e.g., exercise and other forms of PA). As adolescents who perform better in school under normal circumstances tend to manage their life more efficiently [14, 37] , it could be expected that they would also be capable of doing so even during the pandemic period. Furthermore, those students might possess better physical literacy, which gives them confidence and self-esteem for being physically active even in a different space and with limited equipment for practicing sports or exercising [54] .",

Indeed, the studies performed so far have demonstrated positive correlations between educational level and higher HL in Australia and Denmark [56, 57] . Furthermore, HL affects students' understanding of information regarding the significance of health, and the ability to make proper health decisions [58] . It was also noted that students with higher HL tend to adopt numerous behaviors which are beneficial to their health, including PA [59] , which has additionally been supported by studies showing that adolescents with higher levels of HL have higher PALs [60, 61] .",

For example, a Finnish study found that adolescents with higher academic achievement had better HL, and more frequently participated in sports activities [61] . Similarly, it was noted that HL mediates the association between educational achievement and PA in older participants from Denmark [57] . Hence, it is reasonable to assume that adolescents with higher school achievement can better understand the importance of PA for their health, and therefore may strive to be sufficiently physically active. It is possible, then, that the adolescents with higher academic achievement in our study possessed better HL skills and recognized the importance of maintaining their PAL during the pandemic in order to preserve their health. Only adolescents with adequate HL skills are likely to be able to find, understand, and use the information regarding the influence of PA on their health. Thus, it was expected that adolescents with better HL would be more likely to strive to maintain their PAL during the pandemic, based on the information on the positive influence of PA on the immune system (i.e., PA boosts the immune system and improves the cardiovascular and respiratory system, which is important for fighting against COVID-19 and preserving health in general) [62] . The stated explanation was actually supported by recent studies, in which physical literacy was found to be a factor of significant influence on PAL during lockdown [28] . Given the similarity between HL and physical literacy [63] , the positive influence of HL on PAL (and GPA as a measure of overall educational success) is logical.",

Logically, if we assume that adolescents with poor behavior grades are prone to health-risk behaviors and do not take care of their health [43] , it could be expected that those adolescents would not make an effort to maintain regular PAL during the lockdown (irrespective of their PAL before pandemic). Further, it was noted that students with higher academic achievement attain better school behavioral grades [20] . Therefore, it could be assumed that adolescents with higher behavior grades will also have better knowledge of the importance of maintaining PAL during the lockdown. Likewise, our finding that adolescents with better school behavior succeeded in maintaining PAL during the pandemic could be explained by more pronounced responsible behavior, in this case towards themselves and their health, irrespective of the unfriendly conditions and environment children experienced during the lockdown.",

Additionally, the used questionnaire for PA assessment did not evaluate the intensity of PA, which could display in more detail the situation with changes in PA. Furthermore, this study used the complete PAQ-A questionnaire, with the possibility that some questions are not applicable for the lockdown period. However, we did include the full questionnaire, as we initially collected all of the data and continued in the same way during the lockdown. In this research, the PAQ-A results were clustered into two groups, which undoubtedly allocated participants with similar results into opposed groups. In future studies, division into three groups is therefore suggested. This study emphasized the problem of differences in \"school quality\" in the analysis of the associations between educational achievement and different criteria, which limited the ability to discuss the obtained results in this context.
