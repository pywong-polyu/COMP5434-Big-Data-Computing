By the end of October 2020, Iran reported up to 490 COVID-19-related deaths per day (COVID-19 Resources, 2020) . The virus with its epidemic danger forced health care authorities to act. Specifically, to decrease the risk of spreading further the virus and to cause further deaths and severely infected people, health authorities imposed confinements. To this end, health authorities legislated temporarily to close borders, schools, universities, cultural and sports events, and to disallow gatherings in open spaces.",

To illustrate, results of the \"Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)\" Survey showed that home confinement had a negative effect on PA intensity levels (Ammar et al., 2020) ; mean physical activity levels decreased, sitting time increased, and eating behavior got unhealthier (more frequent and higher-caloric food intake). During the confinement, eating-disordered behavior increased, and physical activity levels decreased in both the general population and in individuals with eating disorders (Phillipou et al., 2020) . Lower educational levels and the lack of using online tools were associated with lower physical activity levels (Constandt et al., 2020) . Longitudinally, physical activity levels and sleep quality decreased, and emotional issues increased among a smaller sample of Chinese students (Zhang et al., 2020) . However, previous results on the association between physical activity patterns and confinement conditions were not uniform. Among 1,098 adults, 40.5% of modestly active people got even more inactive, 22.4% of active people got less active, whereas 33% of modestly active people got more active, and 40.3% of active people got even more active (Lesser and Nienhuis, 2020) . Furthermore, inactive people reporting higher outdoor physical activity engagements also reported lower anxiety scores, compared with inactive people remaining physically inactive.",

From the current literature on team sport physical activity patterns during the confinement, the only study retrieved so far (Constandt et al., 2020) showed that physical activity levels decreased among those adults who used to exercise with friends in a sports club. This result suggested that team sport participants decreased their PA levels, when compared with PA levels before the confinement.

The concept of \"exercise is medicine\" reflects such knowledge (Gerber et al., 2016) . As such, to illustrate, among a sample of females with major depressive disorders, higher expert-paced PA intensity levels improved positive mood more intensively, compared with self-paced PA intensity levels (Meyer et al., 2016) . Given this background, it was conceivable that a confinement-related change in PA levels was associated with a decrease in mood.

Second, following the concept of a healthy mind in a healthy body, we assumed that changes in physical activity patterns would be associated with changes in mood states. Third, based on previous studies (Sareen et al., 2013; Pieh et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) , we assumed that compared with male participants, female participants would report lower physical activity levels. We hold that the present findings might be of practical and clinical importance to assist adults more thoroughly during the confinement.",

Furthermore, physical activity indices before and during the confinement were unrelated to current mood states. The present pattern of the results expands upon previous research in that we showed that a COVID-19-related confinement had a very modest impact on participants' physical activity indices and that such physical activity indices were unrelated to participants' mood states. We hold that these results are of practical importance: Against mainstream and mostly media-driven assumptions, confinement had a spurious to modest impact on adults' physical activity patterns and mood states among Iranian adults attending team sports activities. This is the research question asked, if physical activity indices changed during the confinement, and data did not fully support this assumption: While physical activity intensity decreased, physical activity frequency increased among male participants, and remained unchanged among female participants. Accordingly, the present data are not in accord with those data reported elsewhere (Ammar et al., 2020; Caputo and Reichert, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) ; rather, the present data match with the results of those studies, which were unable to find meaningful changes in physical activity indices due to the confinement (Constandt et al., 2020; Lesser and Nienhuis, 2020; Tornese et al., 2020) . Given this, we hold that the present study has the potential to counteract the general and often media-driven assumption of a dramatic negative impact of the confinement on adults' life. Our results do match those observed among 1,098 Canadian adults (Lesser and Nienhuis, 2020) : While 40.5% of modestly active people got even more inactive during the confinement, 33% of inactive people reported that they got much more active. Similarly, while 22.4% of the active adults got less active during the confinement, the opposite was true for 40.3% of the active people. Among the 13,515 adults under 55 years, inactive people got more active during the confinement (Constandt et al., 2020) . In contrast, participants who were used to exercise with friends in a sport club and not using online tools reported decreased physical activity indices. Here, we note that the present results are even more impressive, when we consider that exclusively adults attending team sports were included in the study: By definition, attending team sports requires physical activities with other people, which is against the confinement rules of social distancing, closed sports institutions, and staying at home. The quality of the data does not allow a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of respecting social distancing and current confinement rules. Given this, though highly speculatively, it is conceivable that at the time lapse of data gathering, confinement rules were adapted to that current context of danger. Similarly, it is also conceivable that people wanted to counterbalance possible unpleasant effects of confinement on general health such as weight gain, increased eating behavior (Phillipou et al., 2020) , and impaired mood.",

            "text": "With the first hypothesis, we assumed that changes in physical activity patterns would be associated with changes in mood states. This hypothesis is based on the extant literature, which showed both correlative and causal associations between higher physical activity indices and a more favorable psychological functioning (Stubbs et al., 2018b; Vancampfort et al., 2018; Schuch et al., 2019) . However, the present data did not confirm this assumption: Correlation coefficients between physical activity indices and mood states were trivial and spurious ( Table 4 for males, Table 5 for females, and Table 6 for the total sample). To illustrate, about 3.6% of the variance of the physical activity indices explained the variance of mood states, while, complementarily, about 95.6% of the variance of mood states remained unexplained. Furthermore, while some correlation coefficients were statistically significant (p < 0.05; see Tables 4-6), such p-values were due to the large sample size, but not to a \"true\" meaningful association. Given this, physical activity indices and mood states were unrelated. While again the quality of the data does not allow a deeper understanding of the underlying social and psychological mechanisms, the present data are in line with those of a previous study: Opdal et al. (2019) were unable to find meaningful associations between changes in physical activity indices measured objectively with activity trackers and mental distress among a sample of 676, 16.5 years old adolescents over a time lapse of 2 years. Furthermore, as mentioned in the Introduction section, Iran reports a high prevalence rate of COVID-19-related death and infected people (COVID-19 Resources, 2020) . Accordingly, it is conceivable that participants' mood states were more tightly related to health concerns of their social environment.",

Accordingly, objective physical activity assessments would have allowed to compare subjectively and objectively gathered physical activity patterns and to detect possible differences. Second, only adult participants willing and able to comply with the study requirements (access to the Internet, literacy, and team sports activities) completed the survey; given this, a biased selection of participants cannot be ruled out. We also note that participants remained physically active during the COVID-19 confinement, despite the fact that team sports activities were not possible. Accordingly, it is conceivable that participants of the present study were particularly motivated and self-efficient to keep their physical activity indices unaltered.",

Fifth, we focused on adults of team sports; it is possible that adults with individual sports activities would have provided another picture of the results. Sixth, although data collection of the present research was performed only 2 months after the COVID-19 pandemic official report in Iran, a longitudinal design would have allowed to describe causal relationships between physical activity pattern and mood states. Finally, at the time of data collection, international sanctions imposed to Iran led to severe economic problems, which, in turn, impacted negatively on people's quality of life.",
