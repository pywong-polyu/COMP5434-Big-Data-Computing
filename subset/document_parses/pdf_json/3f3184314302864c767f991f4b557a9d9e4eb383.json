The initial 27 development and characterization experiments are presented along with proof-of-concept 28 studies for the vaccine candidate UB-612. UB-612 consists of eight components rationally 29 designed for induction of potently neutralizing antibodies and broad T cell responses 30 against SARS-CoV-2: the S1-RBD-sFc fusion protein, six synthetic peptides (one 31 universal peptide and five SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides), a proprietary CpG TLR-9 32 agonist at low concentration as an excipient, and aluminum phosphate adjuvant. Through 33 immunogenicity studies in Guinea pigs and rats, we optimized the design of 34 protein/peptide immunogens and selected an adjuvant system, yielding a vaccine that 35 provides excellent S1-RBD binding and high neutralizing antibody responses, robust 36 cellular responses, and a Th1-oriented response at low doses. In challenge studies, UB-37 612 vaccination reduced viral load and prevented development of disease in mouse and 38 non-human primate challenge models. With a Phase 1 trial completed, a Phase 2 trial 39 ongoing in Taiwan, and additional trials planned to support global authorizations, UB-612 40 is a highly promising and differentiated vaccine candidate for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 44 spread globally since its origin in 2019, causing an unprecedented public health crisis that 45 has resulted in greater than 4.7 million deaths worldwide. Many vaccines are under 46 development to limit disease spread and reduce the number of cases, but additional 47 candidates that promote a robust immune response are needed. Here, we describe a 48 multitope protein-peptide vaccine platform that is unique among COVID-19 vaccines. The 49 advantages of our approach are induction of both high levels of neutralizing antibodies as 50 well as a Th/CTL response in the vaccinated host, which mimics the immune response 51 that occurs after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that our vaccine is 52 immunogenic and effective in preventing disease in several animal models, including AAV-53 hACE-2 transduced mice, and both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Importantly, no 54 immunopathology was observed in the lungs of immunized animals, therefore showing 55 that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) does not occur. Our study provides an 56 additional, novel vaccine candidate for advancement in clinical trials to treat and prevent 59 A novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-60 CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of a cluster of cases of the new coronavirus 61 disease 2019 (COVID-19), in Wuhan China, in December 2019 [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has 62 caused over 229 million cases of COVID-19 and greater than 4.7 million deaths worldwide 63 as of September 21, 2021 [2]. In response to this unprecedented public health crisis, many 64 vaccine platforms are under development, including inactivated virus, recombinant 65 adenovirus-based vectors, recombinant proteins, and nucleic acid approaches. This paper 66 describes a novel multitope protein-peptide vaccine candidate. The UB-612 vaccine is 67 unique in that it has been developed specifically to address the need for a vaccine that 68 elicits a strong, neutralizing antibody response targeting the receptor binding domain 69 (RBD) of the Spike protein while simultaneously stimulating T cell responses to conserved 70 peptides derived from three structural proteins: S2 subunit of Spike, Membrane (M) and 71 Nucleocapsid (N) of the virus. UB-612 elicits high levels of neutralizing antibodies in 72 addition to a Th1 prone immune response. Unlike some other full-length S protein-based 73 vaccines, the RBD-focused antibody responses induced for UB-612 vaccine can avoid 74 any potential antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in the lungs [3,4].",

One study found that the IgG response to S protein declined rapidly in 96 >90% of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals within 2-3 months [15,16]. Additionally, a 97 neutralizing response against the S protein alone is unlikely to provide lasting protection 98 against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants with mutated B-cell epitopes [17]. 99 However, other studies have shown relatively stable antibody titers for up to 3-4 months 100 after SARS-CoV-2 infection [18,19]. Memory T cells to SARS-CoV-1 were also shown to 101 persist 11-17 years after the original SARS outbreak in 2003 [20,21]. Because the vast 102 majority of reported CD8+ T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are located in the 103 ORF1ab, N, M, and ORF3a regions [22], while only three are present in the S protein, we 104 included Th/CTL epitopes from highly conserved sequences derived from all three 105 proteins (S, nucleocapsid, N and membrane, M) of SARS-CoV-2 [23-30] in the design of 106 our UB-612 vaccine. Page 6 of 55 To enhance the immune response of the antigen portion (S1-RBD-sFc), we added 108 our proprietary peptide UBITh\u00ae1a to the Th/CTL peptide mixture. UBITh\u00ae1a is a 109 proprietary synthetic peptide with an original framework sequence derived from the 110 measles virus fusion protein (MVF) modified to allow accommodation of multiple MHC 111 class II binding motifs. In previous studies, attachment of UBITh\u00ae1a to a target \"functional 112 B epitope peptide\" derived from a self-protein rendered the self-peptide immunogenic, 113 thus breaking immune tolerance [31]. Proprietary CpG oligonucleotide (CpG1) [32] at low 114 concentration is included as excipient to bring the rationally designed immunogens 115 together through \"charge neutralization\" to stabilize the Th and CTL peptides by dipolar 116 interactions between the negatively charged CpG1 molecule and positively charged 117 peptides. In addition, activation of TLR-9 signaling by CpG is known to promote IgA 118 production and favor the Th1 immune response [33]. The UBITh\u00ae1a peptide is 119 incorporated as one of the Th peptides for its \"epitope cluster\" nature to further enhance 120 the antiviral activity of the SARS-CoV-2 derived Th and CTL epitope peptides 121 UB-612 includes, in addition to the recombinant S1-RBD-sFc fusion protein, CTL 122 and Th epitope peptides selected from immunodominant S2, M and N regions known to 123 bind to human MHC I and II molecules. Most reactivity to Spike protein comes from CD4+ 124 T cells, and there is only one reported dominant CD8+ T cell epitope in the S protein, 125 which resides within the RBD [22]. The smaller M and N structural proteins are recognized 126 by T cells of patients who successfully controlled their infection [22,29]. The five Th and 127 CTL epitope peptides are selected from sequences of S2, M and N proteins of SARS-128 CoV-2, while the UBITh \uf0e2 1a is a proprietary T helper peptide adapted from measles virus 129 fusion (MVF) protein. This results in balanced B cells (induction of neutralizing antibodies) 130 and Th/CTL responses in a vaccinated host. This mixture of S1-RBD-sFc and Th/CTL Page 7 of 55 peptides is designed to elicit T cell activation, memory B cell recall and effector functions 132 similar to those elicited after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. 133 Finally, to further improve the immune response, UB-612 is formulated with an 134 aluminum phosphate (Adju-Phos\u00ae) adjuvant, which promotes Th2 responses via the 135 nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) 136 inflammasome pathway. Additionally, it has pro-phagocytic and repository effects with a 137 long record of safety and the ability to improve immune responses to target proteins in 138 many vaccine formulations [34,35].",

In a live virus assay, 313 sera taken one week after the 3 rd dose (Day 77) demonstrated potent neutralization or D614G strains (Fig 7D and 7E ). Animals were challenged on Day 77 with SARS-CoVthat high titers of neutralizing antibody titers were achieved against live virus Wuhan strain 325 on Day 50 (3 weeks after the 2 nd immunization for both the 30 \u03bcg and 100 \u03bcg doses of 326 UB-612) (Fig 8B) and also against the B.1.617.2 Delta variant (Fig 8C) , though a drop in 327 titer of 2-fold for the 30 \u03bcg dose and 1.5-fold for the 100 \u03bcg dose was seen for Delta as 328 ",

We showed that our vaccine elicited 418 high levels of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-prone immune response that protected 419 animals challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2, without induction of UB-612 vaccine immunogen was designed to contain an S1-RBD-sFc fusion 427 protein plus five synthetic Th/CTL peptides for class I and II MHC molecules derived from428 SARS-CoV-2 S2, M, and N proteins. For Th/CTL epitope design, we employed the 429 \"Epitope Prediction and Analysis Tools\" (http://tools.iedb.org/population) to identify the 430 desirable CTL T cell epitopes. Th/CTL epitopes from highly conserved sequences 431 derived from all three SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, N and M) proteins were identified through 432 an extensive literature search and epitope analysis [22,29]. Five peptides within these 433 regions were selected for inclusion in the UB-612 immunogen and subject to further 434 designs. Each selected peptide contained Th or CTL epitopes with prior validation of MHC 435 I or II binding [51] and exhibited good manufacturability characteristics (optimal length and 436 amenability for high quality synthesis). These rationally designed Th/CTL peptides were 437 further modified by addition of a Lys-Lys-Lys tail to each respective peptide's N-terminus 438 to improve peptide solubility and enrich positive charge for use in vaccine formulation [32]. 439 UBITh\u00ae1a, a proprietary synthetic peptide with an original framework sequence derived 440 from the measles virus fusion protein (MVF) was added to S1-RBD-sFc to enhance the 441 immune response. Aluminum phosphate (Adju-Phos\u00ae, InvivoGen) adjuvant was also 442 added to further promote Th2 responses. These components were mixed with CpG1, 443 which binds the positively (designed) charged peptides by dipolar interactions and also mass of S1-RBD-sFc protein is about 50 kDa. To construct the vector expressing the 451 recombinant fusion protein, the cDNA sequence encoding the S1-RBD-sFc protein (Fig 452 1B) was synthesized, digested, and then ligated into Freedom\u00ae pCHO 1.0 vector (Life 453 Technology) to obtain the pCHO S1-RBD-sFc expression vector. The cDNA sequence transfections of CHO cells for GP and rat immunogenicity studies. Three forms of cDNA 456 fragments for S1-RBD-sFc, S1-RBDa-sFc and S1-RBD-Fc fusion proteins were designed 457 for transient expression in ExpiCHO-S system for target protein production. The cell 458 culture was harvested 12-14 days post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation and 0.22-459 \u03bcm filtration, and purified by protein A chromatography.
