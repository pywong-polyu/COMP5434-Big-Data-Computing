Specifically, during a pandemic, ineffective communication between authorities and citizens can hinder the prompt adoption of preventive measures, impairing community recovery. How information is disseminated both between officials and citizens and among citizens requires further research [1] , especially given the explosion of risk campaign messages, user-generated content, and complex dynamics of (mis)information dissemination are enabled by ICTs and social media [2, 3] . Therefore, it is vital to understand how to encourage the sharing of official information among citizens, especially information generated by agencies that are staffed with science personnel to review health-related data in a scientific manner.",

Information from an authoritative source (i.e., the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute of Health (NIH), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) is defined as official information in this study. A better understanding of official information sharing allows more timely and proactive responses for enhancing the efficiency of crisis management. On the other hand, unofficial information includes pandemic information from unofficial sources such as online forums, ordinary citizens, or alternative news. Although unofficial information is less likely to be verified than official information, these sources do not necessarily contain false information, and similarly, an official source does not necessarily mean that the information is accurate. Since only approximately 20% of U.S. news consumers seek the latest information about COVID-19 from CDC, NIH, and FDA [5] , this study aimed to uncover the mechanisms behind the sharing of official versus unofficial information. Such an understanding would allow health authorities to facilitate the dissemination of authoritative information and enhance the effectiveness of their crisis communication.",

The findings can shed light on how to improve communication practices, taking both top-down practices and peer communications into account simultaneously. While models predicting sharing of information do exist, this study considered the mechanisms underlying the sharing of unofficial information alongside the sharing of official information. More importantly, there has never been a time when health communication has been so politicized, such that Pew data have shown that Americans form divergent attitudes towards organizations such as the WHO and CDC, with Democrats trusting CDC and WHO and Republicans distrusting both organizations [7, 8] . Our study examined how individuals' predispositions, types of COVID-19 information-seeking behaviors, and emotions toward the pandemic, taken together, affect their sharing behaviors of official and unofficial information about the pandemic, adopting the O-S-O-R model. The findings can offer insights that will help health organizations to meet the information needs of users by promoting official content on the risks of the pandemic.",

During the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, health and science experts held different opinions about whether and when one should wear a facemask.

The model has been widely employed in political communication contexts and recently applied to the health communication context [17, 18] . Political communication literature guided by the model often theorizes the individual's political orientation as the O 1 variable and political participation or efficacy as the response (R) variable. Previous health communication studies using the O-S-O-R model have examined audience perceptions (e.g., concerns, perceived severity, and perceived susceptibility) and knowledge of a health issue as the preorientation variable, attitudes toward the issue or the health practitioners and agencies involved as the O 2 variable, and the desired behavioral change with regard to the issue as the response variable. Adopting the O-S-O-R model, this study examined how audiences' political orientation and trust in Trump (O 1 ) affected their COVID-19 information seeking from news media or peers (S) and their emotions toward the pandemic (O 2 ), which further led to their information-sharing behaviors (R). In other words, multiple predictors are expected to act on information-sharing behaviors simultaneously (see Figure 1 ). ",

Given the politicized nature of the COVID-19 pandemic [22] , political orientation is likely to influence individuals' evaluations of the health crisis and, in turn, their informationseeking and -sharing behaviors. During the crisis, Republicans have been found to believe that the death toll was lower and social distancing was less necessary than Democrats [22] . Although most official agencies called for social distancing measures, such as cancelling public events and working from home [23] , Republicans were found to believe less in these measures than Democrats [22] . Overall, Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to believe that the media were exaggerating the risks of COVID-19 [24] . Research has consistently confirmed that politically conservative Americans tend not to perceive the COVID-19 pandemic as a health priority, and thus are less motivated to seek information from liberal news media than conservative news media. This is because liberal news media typically portray the pandemic as a critical public health threat and suggest the importance of preventive actions. Since conservatives tend to believe that the media has exaggerated the risks of COVID-19 [25] , they were anticipated to seek less information from attitude-conflicting sources (i.e., liberal news media) and more information from alternative information sources, such as people from their surroundings (i.e., family and friends). Hence, we hypothesized the following: H1: Political conservatism relates (a) negatively to seeking information from liberal relative to conservative news media (i.e., liberal (vs. conservative) news media) and (b) positively to seeking information from peers.",

Further, support for Trump was found to relate positively to individuals' beliefs on whether the COVID-19 threat was exaggerated [27] .

They can determine the type of information shared. Even though anxiety and anger are both regarded as negative emotions, they have been found to drive different attitudes and behaviors [39] . Research has shown anger to be a form of aversion, closely related to emotions such as disgust and contempt [40] . Anxiety, on the other hand, has been shown to be more closely related to emotions such as depression [40] . According to Marcus et al.

[45] , findings on the motivational effects of anxiety are mixed. In political communication literature, Berger [46] found a positive relationship between anxiety and information sharing, but Lerner and Keltner [47] found anxiety to be associated with withdrawal, which discouraged engagement. In risk-communication literature, Jin et al. [48] found anxiety to be associated positively with disaster information-sharing behaviors, with individuals seeking not only to express their emotions but also to cope with their stress by communicating with people they know intimately. Indeed, people often experience anxiety when they face an imminent threat [49] , leading them to adopt protective behaviors [50] , and scholars have generally found a close relationship between risk perception and anxiety [51] . In the pandemic context, anxiety should drive sharing of both official and unofficial information, as both allow people to cope with their stress, connect with those who might provide beneficial information and social support, and determine useful protective behaviors for the potentially threatening circumstances. As anxiety should not prompt differences in information sharing, we assumed that anxiety is positively related to both official and unofficial information sharing. Further, people with more exposure to information tend to have more opportunities to share; hence, we hypothesized: H3: Information seeking through (a) liberal relative to conservative news media and (b) peers relates positively to anxiety.",

According to Hasell and Weeks [52] , an easy way to channel anger is to share information; if people are angry with a target, they are likely to share negative information to discredit or punish that target. Health crisis literature shows that an individual's anger at a health provider can drive his or her acceptance and dissemination of unofficial information [53] . For example, Han et al. [54] found that in South Korea, the public's anger was positively associated with their acceptance of COVID-19 rumors, while in China, anger-inducing rumors about the pandemic (e.g., how it was managed) triggered people's dissemination of the rumors on social media [55] . In this study, we expected that if people were angry with the government's response to the pandemic, they would share unofficial but not official information about the pandemic with others to challenge the government's action.",

Hence, the proposed model recognizes the mediating effects of an individual's pre-existing orientation on the consequences of media content exposure [16] . In particular, anxiety and anger can differentially mediate the effects of people's predispositions on their distinct information-sharing behaviors. For example, due to the attributional nature of anger [57] , those of certain political orientations can share unofficial information out of anger (but not anxiety). Moreover, those of certain political orientations may be driven by anxiety to share official information [58] . Indeed, liberal media users were found to relate positively to preventive behavior engagement [59] . Given that no prior studies have used the O-S-O-R model to distinguish between official and unofficial information sharing, a research question was posed to address the mediations among the different components for official versus unofficial information sharing.",

An online panel of respondents were recruited through Qualtrics (N = 856). To ensure a sample that closely resembled the demographic distribution reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, quota sampling in terms of gender, age, and education was performed. Given that the recruitment of female participants aged 65 or above and holding less than a high school degree was difficult, the quotas for participants holding less than a high school degree were reduced to 6% from 13% and distributed equally across the other education groups. A sample of 856 was recruited. The sample was comparable with the U.S. national population in terms of gender (51.

The lack of full information and personal control over the pandemic might have led people to cope with their stress by relying on professional health authorities. As suggested by Marcus et al. [39] , threatening circumstances are likely to drive anxiety. When faced with a threat such as new to humankind such as COVID-19, individuals who experience a lost in personal control [44] share information as a protective behavior [50] when they are motivated to solve the problem [67] . Our findings add support to the positive relationship between anxiety and information sharing [46, 48] . More importantly, this positive relationship was found to rely only on official information rather than unofficial information as a strategy. As people cope with anxiety about a new (unfamiliar) pandemic that could be lethal, they tend to communicate with others they know via sharing information from authoritative, official sources even though the pandemic situation is highly politicized. These sources allow the intake of information from the major health authorities (CDC, NIH, and FDA) responsible for containing the pandemic in the United States.",

According to Duffy et al. [4] , people who perceive a higher level of risk are expected to share more information as they will likely perceive information, official or not, to be useful and relevant to their friends and family members. As liberal media consumption was found to be associated with higher levels of anxiety [59] , the increase in related risk perceptions could trigger anxiety among readers. By sharing information to others, one can protect people in one's social networks and combat the pandemic by encouraging others to cooperate with the official response measures. It is therefore not surprising to find that liberal (vs. conservative) news media consumption triggered information sharing via anxiety.

Communication professionals can also provide key opinion leaders (e.g., famous social media influencers, credible political elites, and favorable celebrities) with credible information and encourage them to share such beneficial information with their own networks [70] . Second, an appropriate amount of anxiety may benefit public health by fighting COVID-19 on the societal level due to people's increased sharing of official health information, even though it is unwise to purposefully elicit anxiety. Communication managers can inform individuals on ongoing pandemic management via accurate and transparent information to maintain a certain level of anxiety, which in turn drives official information sharing. Such an insight could be useful in understanding the seeking and sharing of pandemic information during the pandemic, including the vaccine information that came later in 2021. Finally, crisis specialists and government communication managers should be aware of and act to minimize the anger resulting from poor or indifferent crisis actions and communication to be experienced by audiences in order to discourage unofficial information sharing, especially malicious rumor mongering.",

Second, the data were collected in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which the findings from this specific context can apply to other scenarios, crises, and countries demands further investigation. Third, while a model was generated with variables placed sequentially in line with extant theorizing, this study utilized a cross-sectional design, and causation cannot be guaranteed. Studies with panel data should be implemented to complement the current findings. Finally, respondents may not have accurately reported their frequency of official and unofficial information sharing.

Borrowing from the O-S-O-R model, our findings highlight not only the different roles of anger and anxiety but also the importance of audiences' predispositions in driving information sharing in cyberspace. In particular, anger toward the U.S. government's outbreak response was found to associate with unofficial information sharing, while anxiety was associated with official information sharing. Our finding on the relationship between anger and unofficial information sharing potentially contributes to the research on misinformation consumption and sharing by highlighting the roles of particular discrete emotions in driving unofficial information sharing. The findings also reveal the need to investigate different kinds of information sharing given the mix of government-public communication and citizen-tocitizen communication in the current media ecosystem. Informed Consent Statement: Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.",
