Methods. e survey was a population-based cross-sectional eye health study conducted 2019-2020. Cluster sampling was used to randomly select local (Emirati) and expatriate (non-Emirati) Dubai residents aged 40 years and older. Ocular examinations were conducted in selected eye clinics to determine the visual acuity (VA) and cause(s) of VI if any. Trained nurses, optometrists, and ophthalmologists did the examinations. VA was measured using ETDRS visual chart. e World Health Organization VI and blindness definitions and classifications for the cause(s) of VI were used. Results. A total of 892 participants were included in the final analysis. e mean age [SD] was 52.09 [9.48] years, with 55.8% as males. Prevalence of presenting mild, moderate, and severe VI was 4.7% (2.94-7.11%), 1.8% (0.78-3.5%), and 0% for Emiratis, and 3.6% (2.06-5.76), 1.6% (0.63-3.21), and 0% for non-Emiratis, respectively. Four Emirati participants were blind, with a prevalence of 0.9% (0.25%-2.28%). Men had lower likelihood of VI than women (odds ratio [OR] (95% CI): 0.42 (0.24-0.77)) after adjustment for covariates. Diabetes (OR (95% CI): 1.91 (1.04-3.52)) was an independent risk factor for VI. Higher education level was associated with a lower likelihood of VI (OR (95% CI): 0.34 (0.13-0.89). Leading causes of VI among Emiratis were uncorrected refractive error (52%) and cataract (17.2%). Glaucoma, optic atrophy, and absent globe were the causes of blindness. Conclusions. Prevalence of VI is comparably low with leading causes readily treatable. An effective strategy to improve spectacle correction and cataract services would reduce the VI burden.",

Although the age-adjusted prevalence of VI and blindness had decreased over the past three decades, the absolute number of people with VI and blindness continues to increase. is suggests that progress in disease control is not keeping pace with demand, and more challenges are expected with the continued rapid global population growth and aging [4] . In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the first \"world report on vision\" to draw attention to the increasing need for eye care, and called for coordinated, concerted global action toward strengthening eye care in health systems and collecting key indicators for eye health in member states [5] .",

Based on the proportion of 40 years and older and the assumed proportion of people with VI in each stratum, the sample size was shared into the 4 population strata. For each stratum, a specified number of clusters were allocated and randomly selected by probability proportional to size. All 165 clusters were selected across the four population strata. In each selected cluster, households were randomly chosen from the database of residents with the Dubai Statistics Center, to yield the needed sample size for the stratum.

Prevalence for all severities of VI has been reported to be higher in females than in males of the same age group, mainly in lowincome and middle-income countries [27, 28] . Consistent findings were observed in the current study although logistic regression could not confirm gender as a risk factor among the Emiratis. e factors contributing to this disparity are complex and can be attributed to both biological and social factors [27] . Major eye problems are associated with aging, with women generally having longer life expectancies, and more likely to survive to develop vision problems [28] . Life expectancy of UAE women (79.2) is higher than that of men (77.1) [29] .

Priority should be given to these two conditions given the reversibility and ease in treatment especially for URE, which constitutes about 50% of the causes of VI in this study. With recent increasing myopia prevalence globally, especially among younger individuals, [34] the risk of VI caused by URE may increase correspondingly in this young demographic population. In addition, the burden of cataracts and the need for effective cataract surgery are projected to increase due to increasing aging populations [35] . Government and public health agencies should therefore plan and implement strategies to address these likely future health challenges, especially the increasing health access disparity for some categories of expatriates like the laborers, a common feature for affluent communities like Dubai. However, this study could not adequately demonstrate this inequity because the study stopped before the inclusion of the large number of laborers planned to be studied.",
