The pandemic coronavirus with its catastrophic effects is now a global concern. Forecasting of COVID-19 spread has attracted a great attention for public health emergency. However, few researchers look into the relationship between dynamic transmission rate and preventable measures by authorities. In this paper, the SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered) model is employed to investigate the spread of COVID-19. The epidemic spread is divided into two stages: before and after intervention. Before intervention, the transmission rate is assumed to be a constant since individual, community and government response has not taken into place. After intervention, the transmission rate is reduced dramatically due to the societal actions or measures to reduce and prevent the spread of disease. The transmission rate is assumed to follow an exponential function, and the removal rate is assumed to follow a power exponent function. The removal rate is increased with the evolution of the time. Using the real data, the model and parameters are optimized. The transmission rate without measure is calculated to be 0.033 and 0.030 for Hubei and outside Hubei province, respectively. After the model is established, the spread of COVID-19 in Hubei province, France and USA is predicted. From results, USA performs the worst according to the dynamic ratio.

First of all, the number of infected patients is needed to be confirmed. According to datasets from the National Health Commission of China and reports by the Health Commission of Hubei province, the number of infected people was 41 in Hubei province and the first day was set up as January 11. For the data out of Hubei province, January 20 is set up as the first day. Furthermore, the number of infected individuals on the first day is 21. For the initial exposed individuals, it is difficult to estimate the number of exposed individuals due to medical techniques. Some researchers thought that the rate (infected: exposed) is about 13%. According to the experience, the rate is set to be 10%. Initial exposed number of Hubei province is therefore set to be 210 and it is equal to 410 for outside Hubei province. No individual recovers from the disease on the first day. All initial removal individuals are therefore set to be zero. There is no way or method to define the average number of individuals who an infected individual meets, so r 1 is set to be a value ranging from 0 to 10 according to the value used in SARS. Because the exposed individuals have a big opportunity to meet others by close contact because of the incubation period. r 2 is set to be within [0, 35] . At last, the transmission rate from the exposed individuals to infected individuals \u03b1 is set from 0 to 0.6. In addition, with the help of the least square method, other unknown parameters are optimized to fit the real data, which is shown in Table 2 . Because there is a big difference between Hubei and outside Hubei provinces in respect of control measures, we estimate the accumulated infected individuals and effective reproduction number R e in terms of Hubei and outside Hubei provinces. Based on the dataset, the model is fitted by simulation. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the fitted and predicted data of Hubei and outside Hubei provinces, respectively. From Fig. 2 , the spread of epidemiological virus is controlled at the start of March because of fewer new cases in Hubei. It is also found that on January 20, there are fewer infected individuals from Fig. 3 . Furthermore, the fitted parameters are obtained and shown in Table 2 . Firstly, the transmission rate without measures \u03b2 0 is equal to 0.033 and 0.030 for Hubei and outside Hubei provinces. Thus the virus in Hubei has a larger probability to infect other individuals. The same rule is suitable for the transmission rate from the exposed individuals to infected individuals \u03b1. Fig. 4 shows the effective reproduction number R e with passage of the time in Hubei and outside Hubei provinces, respectively. From Fig. 4 , R e is decreased slightly before January 23 due to the increase of the treatment. Then R e declines suddenly because authorities implement several control measures and individuals are alerted to prevent epidemiological virus. Measures and treatments result in decreasing effective reproduction number with the passage of the time. Fig. 4 shows that virus is about to fade way in May in Hubei province. Also from Fig. 4 , virus outside Hubei province is going to die out earlier due to secondary or third generation of virus.
