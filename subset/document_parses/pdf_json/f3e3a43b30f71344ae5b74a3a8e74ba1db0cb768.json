Aiming to overcome these concerns, yet preserving the effectiveness of sanitization against enveloped viruses, we assessed the antiviral properties of the Probiotic Cleaning Hygiene System (PCHS), an eco-sustainable probioticbased detergent previously proven to stably abate pathogen contamination and AMR. PCHS (diluted 1:10, 1:50 and 1:100) was tested in comparison to common disinfectants (70% ethanol and 0.5% sodium hypochlorite), in suspension and carrier tests, according with the European UNI EN 14476:2019 and UNI EN 16777:2019 standards. Human alpha-and beta-coronaviruses hCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2, human herpesvirus type 1, human and animal influenza viruses, and vaccinia virus were included in the study. The results showed that PCHS was able to inactivate 99.99% of all tested viruses within 1-2 h of contact, both in suspension and on surface. Notably, while control disinfectants became inactive within 2 h after application, the PCHS antiviral action persisted up to 24 h postapplication, suggesting that its use may effectively allow a continuous prevention of virus spread via contaminated environment, without worsening environmental pollution and AMR concern.",

COVID-19 has in fact spread worldwide, causing at the moment over 244 million confirmed cases and 4.96 million deaths [1] . The SARS-CoV-2 infection is mostly transmitted via respiratory droplets, but the virus has been reported to persist up to days on inanimate hard surfaces, at least in controlled laboratory conditions [2, 3] , suggesting a potential contribution to transmission of infection through direct contact with surfaces and fomites contaminated by droplets or other body fluids [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Although fomite transmission is difficult to prove definitively [10] , a few cases have been reported [11, 12] and infection risk has been evaluated linked to possible hand-to-fomite transmission [8, 13, 14] .",

Its action, based on the biological properties of selected probiotic Bacillus species contained in an eco-friendly detergent, stably reduced resistant pathogens (\u221280%) [16, 22, [45] [46] [47] [48] and associated infections (\u221252%) [44, 46] , and also had a relevant positive impact on antimicrobial consumptions (\u221260%) and therapy costs (\u221275%) [46] . Based on these observations, here we assessed the PCHS antiviral efficiency on different enveloped viruses known to be able to persist long on surfaces, namely human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2, HSV-1, type A influenza viruses of human (human H3N2) and animal (avian H10N1 and swine H1N2) origin, and the modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), this virus being the most resistant among enveloped viruses and for this reason mandatorily included in the European standard procedures used to assess the antiviral properties of disinfectants. The assays were carried out in vitro, following the European standard norms for suspension and surface tests [49] , testing both the decontaminating and preventing activity of PCHS in comparison with standard disinfectants.",

Indeed, both procedures prescribe the use of non-enveloped viruses and only MVA among the enveloped ones (since it is considered the most resistant enveloped virus); however, since our study aimed to analyze the enveloped viruses potentially able to persist on surfaces and similar to SARS-CoV-2, we included, beside MVA, the human coronaviruses hCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2, the human herpesvirus HSV-1 and three human/animal type A influenza viruses. Three different concentrations of PCHS were tested, including a lower one that is used for routine cleaning (1:100 dilution) and two higher concentrations (1:10 and 1:50 dilutions), comparing their activity with that of 70% EtOH and 0.5% NaClO, two common disinfectants indicated for decontamination during the pandemic.

However, detergent's long-lasting action on surfaces is difficultly attributable to surfactants only, and we hypothesized that the production of enzymes by the PCHS-Bacillus strains spread on the treated surface may be responsible for the continuous action. Accordingly, the analysis of the enzymes produced by the three PCHS-derived Bacillus species (B. subtilis, B. pumilus and B. megaterium) revealed several enzymatic activities potentially able to degrade the virus shell components, including lipids, protein, and sugar residues. Consistent with this, the Bacillus genus is reportedly known as one of the most important bacterial sources of enzymes with remarkable properties, such as high resistance to extreme temperatures, pH, organic solvents, and oxidizing agents. Bacillus enzymes have been long used in medicine, biofilm destruction, animal feed, agriculture, degradation of feathers, wool, and hair [69, 70] , thus supporting their ability to also degrade the outer virus components. Indeed, such activities have been previously associated with an effective 99.9% reduction of microbial contamination [71] , suggesting that they may be relevant also against viruses. In addition, the bacteria belonging to Bacillus genus possess sporulation capacity that renders them resistant to harsh environmental conditions and usable in concentrated detergents, which makes them interesting for medical and industrial purposes. Lastly, PCHS is a lowcost affordable system, which is also important from a cost-saving perspective [72] , and renders it potentially applicable in several non-sanitary environments, including schools, offices, public transportation, as well as in low-income countries. Of note, the UNI EN 14885:2018 indicates two types of disinfection in human medicine: a fast one (within 5 min) for critical patient area, and a slow one (within 1 h) for the other areas [73] . To this regard, PCHS would provide a slow disinfection, but its stable 24 h decontaminating activity suggests that it may long protect the treated environment, meeting also the recent indications of CDC regarding the possibility, in the absence of people with confirmed/suspected COVID-19, that a daily cleaning can be sufficient to remove the virus from surfaces and maintain a healthy facility [19] . For non-healthcare environments it would however be relevant to test PCHS effectiveness also in the presence of high organic soil (\"dirty\" conditions), as non-sanitary spaces may have higher amounts of organic matter compared to the hospital space. Moreover, since dry biofilm is an increasing problem on surfaces, it would be of interest to test the action of PCHS on this microbial body. Finally, it will be interesting to expand the analysis also to non-enveloped viruses, to assess the eventual antiviral action against those more resistant viruses.",
