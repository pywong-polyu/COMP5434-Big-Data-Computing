Anaesthesiologists usually use ultrasound for nerve blocks, vascular puncture and emergency screenin, of the chest and abdomen. Given potential delay in obtaining examinations including chest radiography for patients under airborne isolation, portable ultrasonography is useful to quickly assist in the diagnosis of conditions such as pleural effusion and pneumothorax. 6 PPE, especially purifying respirators, can preclude procedures such as auscultation. Ultrasonography can also be used in airway evaluation and determination of TT depth. 15 5 Fast response resuscitation team Based on experience during the SARS outbreak, 6 fast response resuscitation teams were organised in some hospitals in Wuhan made up mostly of anaesthesiologists. Members of the resuscitation team stayed on call near the isolated area. During initial resuscitation efforts by the first responder, fast response resuscitation team members would don PPE and take charge of the resuscitation. Like the airway management cart, the resuscitation cart was equipped with modular medicine and equipment to avoid unnecessary traffic. The team size is typically minimized to four to avoid unnecessary viral exposure. Clinical anaesthesia During the outbreak of COVID-19, the most important consideration for clinical anaesthesia is infection control. By 10 February 2020, most hospitals in China accepted emergency cases only. However, recently elective surgeries have increased rapidly. Besides, Wuhan, many other areas could also have many infected people. Thus, anaesthesiologists play an essential and demanding role in the preoperative evaluation of COVID-19 infection risk (Supplemental Digital Content 2 shows a fast triage flow chart).

In the care of COVID-196 patients, anaesthesiologists are vulnerable to both infection and mental health problems.

The heavy workload and discomfort of wearing PPE for long durations can worsen the depression. Healthcare workers in high-risk clinical settings such as SARS units had substantially more post-traumatic stress symptoms.17 On 13 February 2020, the CSA established a platform to provide psychological support for healthcare providers, especially for front-line anaesthesiologists and their families. Over 20 psychologists provided consultations for anaesthesiologists who took care of COVID-19 patients. Continuous update of information on COVID-19. Clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the COVID-19 outbreak were provided to anaesthesiologists in order to improve quality of care and to address their sense of uncertainty and fear. The CSA and Chinese Association of Anaesthesiologists (CAA) issued and updated a series of practice recommendations and consensus guidelines, covering facility organization and anaesthetic care during the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia. One of the most recent was expert recommendations for anaesthesia and infection control in elective surgeries during recovery after outbreak 7 . The CSA also established a platform for information on COVID-19 patient care 18 . The most frequently asked questions about COVID-19 are continuously collected and answered. Online discussion of anaesthesia care by experts and front-line anaesthesiologists. The CSA and CAA organised online discussions on topics including airway management, infection control and medical care of specific populations, such as the parturients, during the outbreak of COVID-19. Experts with experiences in H1N1, SARS and Ebola management and front-line anaesthesiologists were invited into the discussions. In conclusion, Chinese anaesthesiologists were essential to various critical aspects of the response to the outbreak of COVID-19.
