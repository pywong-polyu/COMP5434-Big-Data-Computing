These devices periodically monitor the user's vital signs and generally have a short battery life. This work introduces ODIN, a model for optimized vital signs collection based on adaptive rules. Analyzing vital sign values requires preciseness, so the adaption of these collected data allows a personalized analysis of the user's health condition. The comparison with related works indicates that ODIN is the only model that presents context-aware-adaptive vital signs collection. The implementation of a prototype allowed to perform three evaluations of ODIN. The first evaluation used simulations in different scenarios, with the adaptive approach increasing battery life by 119% through the analysis of input data compared to data collection without adaptivity. The second evaluation applied the prototype to a database of real physiologic data, which allowed reduced data collection when the user has regular vital signs. This reduction optimized battery consumption by 66% compared to collection without adaptivity. Finally, the third evaluation applied ODIN through an Arduino and a heart rate monitor (Polar H7). The average power saved across mobile devices was 21%. Consequently, the adaptive strategy presented in this work allows the optimization of computational resources during the collection and analysis of vital signs. This optimization occurs because of the reduction in energy expenditure and the reduction in the amount of data that needs to be collected and stored.",

The model identified possible stressful situations, allowing the commander of the mission to track the physiological data of their subordinates. Habib et al.

The evaluation consisted of a collection of employee signal measurements within a company. The constant collection of vital signs helped monitor employee stress levels to avoid accidents in the workplace. Said et al.

The alerts were based on a previously parameterized limit. Swaroop et al. (2019) presented the design of a real-time health monitoring system that stores patients' health parameters. The data can be made available to a medical practitioner as an alert and for monitoring a specific health condition. Yin et al. (2019) proposed a self-adjustable domain adaptation (SADA) strategy to prevent unlabeled health data. The paper enlarged the database of ECG and radar data with actual records acquired from several testers. Utilizing unlabeled data, SADA combined self-organizing maps with transfer learning to predict labels. Finally, SADA integrated the one-class classification with domain adaptation algorithms. Pazienza et al. (2020) investigated the most suitable machine learning (ML) technique for the prediction of clinical risk classes of a continuously monitored patient in a particular condition where a limited number of vital parameters are available. Casalino et al. (2020) proposed a mobile health solution to self-measure the blood oxygen saturation through a smartphone camera. This work allow the users to monitor their blood oxygen saturation at home without the use of medical devices. Due to COVID-19 where people must reduce social contact, this work contributes to the social distancing. Choi and Shin (2018) developed a personalized service for healthcare using IoT devices, and personal health records (PHR) to store user health data. This service can determine risks in real-time. Finally, Hassan et al. (2019) proposed a hybrid real-time monitoring framework for users with chronic diseases.

These vital signs were chosen based on data collected on a triage process when a patient goes to a hospital (Kuriyama et al. 2017) . Odin also collects data from the smartphone accelerometer of the user. The following sections detail model's architecture, the multi-agent approach, besides the organization and elaboration of rules.

If the vital signs values go outside of the pre-established regular thresholds, the agent changes the periodicity of the collection of the sensor to a higher frequency. If these values continue to move away from the regular values, the waiting time between collections is further reduced. In contrast, the closer the values are to regular levels, the longer the waiting time is between collections. The collection reaches the maximum waiting time when the values are within the regular threshold. All these changes are made automatically by the Adaptivity agent.",

If the user has a wearable device with more than one type of vital signs sensor, one or more of these sensors can be defined as Main Sensors (MS) and the remainder as Secondary Sensors (SS). This allows an SS to be triggered only when an MS is outside of the threshold of regular vital signs. The C A will automatically start or pause an S S according to the user's physiological context. If the connection with the server is not available, the data is stored in a local cache. Once the connection is reestablished, the agent sends the previously cached data to the server. Figure 3 illustrates the rules represented using a flowchart based on event, condition, and action. The event is based on the collection of vital signs, and the condition is then checked through inference in rules. This inference occurs in three stages. The first stage verifies the user's condition, i.e., at rest or in movement, whereas the second verifies the user's profile by identifying the person's age (e.g., adult, child, or elder) and gender (Sp\u00e5ngfors et al. 2019) .

To mitigate these problems, the ODIN app was used in conjunction with a wearable device in an indoor location. There was a moment when Alan was in a stressful situation, and the app alerted both Alan and his supervisor Josh. Josh and Jessica, even though they do not work all the time in factory environments, also mapped their stress levels during the day. As they move between all environments, it is feasible for them to leave the environments with a higher incidence of stress to normalize their physiological data. The users' location information includes the room temperature and noise level. Therefore, in a situation where a user's vital signs are outside the normal threshold, ODIN begins to collect this data. When the user returns to normal vital sign thresholds, the app adapts again to only acquire physiological data. In the case of an accident at work, one of the employees can indicate the location of the accident so a rule can be created where more data is collected when the users approach a risk area. This allows other interested parties to understand the factors that caused the accident and even prevent new operators from suffering damage due to a problem that has already occurred.
