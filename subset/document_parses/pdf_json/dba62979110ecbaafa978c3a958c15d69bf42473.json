This past year also will be remembered as the year in which the SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of our lives and professional activities and impacted (or changed, sometimes in good ways) our ability to collaborate and detect or respond to invasions. This incredible year is the backdrop for the 2020 Highlights in Medical Entomology. This article highlights the broad scope of approaches and disciplines represented in the 2020 published literature, ranging from sensory and chemical ecology, population genetics, impacts of human-mediated environmental change on vector ecology, life history and the evolution of vector behaviors, to the latest developments in vector surveillance and control.",

The effects of the pandemic on our field have been profound and will likely play out for years to come, as a result of demands on public health stakeholders' time (and in some cases, funding) being diverted to the COVID-19 response, and the broader implications of the impact on researcher's wellbeing and time. Reduced ability to continue with laboratory and fieldwork will affect research output in coming years, potentially with a shift to reviews and other types of analytical publications that are more conducive to working-from-home. Due to demands on the health care system, it is also possible that reported case numbers of vector-borne diseases will appear to dip. Repercussions of people spending more time in and around their home due to stay-at-home orders on vector-borne disease transmission are still unclear. Studies that have reported effects of lockdowns on dengue transmission appear to be quite variable (Brady and Wilder-Smith 2021) . Control and elimination programs of vector-borne diseases will be affected to varying extents (Toor et al. 2021) . In other words, challenges to medical entomology have only become more pronounced.",

This pathogen can be vertically transmitted from female ticks to their offspring, but much of the transmission ecology remains unclear, including the relative importance of vertical and horizontal transmission. In Ixodes pacificus (Cooley and Kohls) populations in California, the infection prevalence was found to increase with each life stage from 0.11% in larvae to 8.74% in adults, pointing to the importance of horizontal transmission in this region (Sambado et al. 2020) . The potential importance of vertical transmission from a public health perspective was noted by Han et al. (2021) , who investigated the prevalence of infection with B. miyamotoi and the density of infected ticks in Wisconsin and Massachusetts. Despite a lower prevalence of infection, the greater density of larvae suggests this life stage may pose a significant risk of exposure to this pathogen, depending on their contact rate with humans, potentially affecting the seasonal risk profile of this emerging pathogen.",

In Delaware, this tick was first reported in 2013, but a recent study there found established populations in three counties, with decreasing densities along a north-south gradient, and 21% infection prevalence with Rickettsia parkeri (Maestas et al. 2020 ). The population genetic structure of newly established populations of this species in Virginia indicated that different populations were genetically distinct, with little evidence of gene flow among them, pointing to multiple distinct introductions leading to establishment (Benham et al. 2021 ).

For instance, in recent years they have displaced I. scapularis as the most commonly encountered tick in New Jersey. These ticks were found to have a high prevalence of Rickettsia amblyommatis infection, a bacterium of unknown pathogenicity which may be implicated in milder cases of spotted fever group rickettsial disease (Egizi et al. 2020a ). The body of knowledge related to the invasive Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neuman), also has continued to expand. A comprehensive laboratory study evaluated the ability of this species to acquire and transmit the agent of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Rickettsia rickettsii. Larvae and nymphs were shown to become infected after feeding on infected guinea pigs, carry the infection transstadially across life stages, and transmit to na\u00efve hosts, suggesting further assessment under field conditions will be necessary to evaluate to what extent this species may become involved in R. rickettsii transmission cycles (Stanley et al. 2020) . Insight into the possible origins of H. longicornis populations in the United States came from a study investigating mitochondrial cox1 sequences of populations from nine states in the Unites States and several countries that potentially might have served as sources. The haplotypes found present in the United States all clustered with other known parthenogenetic phenotypes, and a northeast Asian source appeared most likely (Egizi et al. 2020b ).",

(2020) explored the evolutionary relationship of populations of Aedes aegypti formosus (continental populations with a broader host range) and Aedes aegypti aegypti (populations from outside Africa) to aegypti group species found in islands of the Indian Ocean. This analysis suggests that an ancestral Stegomyia lineage diversified in the Indian Ocean islands around 16 million years ago, and that this group was basal and gave rise to Ae. aegypti s.s. in continental Africa (Soghigian et al. 2020) . Further insights into the evolution of anthropophagic behavior in Ae. aegypti came from a study that investigated the host choice of this species for human versus other animal odor and tied this to environmental factors at the 27 sites in sub-Saharan Africa from which populations were assessed. The majority of the variation in host preference was related to the intensity of the dry season and, to a lesser extent, human population density, pointing to a reliance on water storage by humans in strongly seasonal environments as a potential selective force behind anthropophily in this species (Rose et al. 2020 ).",

Six distinct lineages were identified and tested for dissemination and transmission efficiency of the chikungunya virus. Two of these lineages, that were dominant in La Reunion and the Mediterranean region, showed greater levels of vector competence, highlighting that in newly invaded areas, the public health outcomes may be affected by the source of origin (Vega-Rua et al. 2020) . Gains also continued to be made in our understanding of the environmental and land use factors driving receptivity for invasion. In a study making use of data from 338 trap sites in New York State, the authors found that areas associated with low-and medium-level development, as well as low proportions of deciduous cover, were more likely to have increased numbers of Ae. albopictus, whereas the effects of precipitation on Ae. albopictus abundance was positive at lower levels, but then found to switch to a negative relationship above a threshold of ca. 70 mm during the preceding 28 d, perhaps due to flushing of habitats (Kache et al. 2020 ).",

How the proportion of hosts fed upon affects the vectorial capacity of Culiseta melanura (Coquillett) for Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) was investigated by West et al. (2020) . They found that spikes in equine cases of EEEV occurred in May and June in Florida, while their estimates of VC were highest from June to August (when abundance peaked). The peak in cases appeared to coincide with the increasing proportions of blood-fed and parous C. melanura and host use that included a mix of birds, reptiles, and mammals (West et al. 2020) . Whether and how these observed discrepancies were due to this being a zoonotic virus, with the possible involvement of additional bridge vectors, is worthy of further study.",

            "text": "Nectar and bloodmeals serve different purposes for mosquitoes, trigger different metabolic pathways, and are shunted to different parts of the digestive tract, yet how mosquitoes tell these meals apart at a sensory level is not well understood, particularly given that glucose is a component of blood. A study using calcium-imaging identified four distinct neuron classes in the stylets of Ae. aegypti, which respond to specific components of blood and to glucose only when in the presence of other blood components. Further, these stylet neurons did not respond to nectar-specific sugars (Jove et al. 2020). Likewise, the sensory processing involved in nectar-source seeking remains understudied. This topic was addressed in a study using Ae. aegypti and other Aedes spp., and the orchid Platanthera obtusata, which is visited and pollinated by mosquitoes. P. obtusata was found to emit a blend of volatiles that included a pronounced level of nonanal, whereas other closely related orchids which do not elicit visitation by mosquitoes had odor profiles dominated by lilac aldehyde. Using calcium-imaging Lahondere et al. (2020) were able to show that both these volatiles activate antennal lobe glomeruli and that the ratio in which these occur appears to determine attractiveness and allow for discrimination between floral sources. Given the potential to harness mosquito's nectar-feeding habit for control or surveillance purposes, there is great value in improving our understanding of when, where, and how likely different species are to engage in this behavior. The rate at which Ae. albopictus feeds on sugar under field conditions in the northeastern U.S. was investigated. Approximately 42% of female Ae. albopictus were fructose positive, and positivity was greater when environmental conditions were dry and in locations where flowering plants were more abundant (Fikrig et al. 2020) . Sugar feeding under field conditions by Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) and Ae. aegypti was investigated in southern Texas (Olson et al. 2020 ). For Ae. aegypti, the sugar content of mosquitoes was greater from autumn collections than for those from the summer, suggesting a seasonal difference in sugar-feeding behavior. Overall approximately 43% of female Ae. aegypti were fructose positive, adding to the evidence that in certain environments this species does frequently feed on sugar.",

A literature review of survival estimates for field populations cautioned that different methodologies for estimating mosquito survival from field-collected populations can lead to different biases, and sometimes large differences in survival estimates (Matthews et al. 2020) . Another enduring question is whether and how infection with pathogens changes mosquito behavior and physiology. One such aspect, how infection changes mosquito behavior when exposed to repellents, was addressed using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Across all studies, the authors found a 62% reduction in repellency attributable to pathogen infection of the vector, but this effect was strongly dependent on several factors, including mosquito age and the pathogen studied. Notably, Plasmodium and dengue did not show an effect on repellency, whereas infection with Edhazardia aedis, Zika virus, or Sindbis virus did (Lajeunesse et al. 2020 ).",

Interest is growing in understanding how the transmission ecology of multivector and multihost systems differ, and what these repercussions mean for surveillance and control. Differences among members of species complexes are also being studied. In Chicago, which experiences persistently high West Nile virus transmission, the host selection and genetic makeup of Culex pipiens (L.) complex mosquitoes was investigated during July and August in 2012. The vast majority (99%) of bloodmeals in this study came from avian hosts, with both northern cardinals and American robins being bitten more frequently than their abundance would suggest. There was a modest amount of introgression between Cx. pipiens f. pipiens and f. molestus, as well as between Cx. pipiens f. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus (Say), but no evidence was found that hybridizations led to differences in feeding patterns (Kothera et al. 2020) . Differences in responses to host volatiles were shown between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens molestus in laboratory behavioral assays comparing attraction to headspace volatiles of magpies, chickens, and pigeons, with or without CO 2 . Although the addition of CO 2 to the headspace volatiles led to an increase in responsiveness by Cx. quinquefasciatus, this was not the case for Cx. pipiens molestus, suggesting these species have developed different host-seeking strategies (Spanoudis et al. 2020) . The role of Culex species also was investigated in Andalusia, Spain, where both West Nile virus (WNV) and avian malaria are transmitted by Cx. pipiens, Culex perexiguus Theobald, and Culex modestus Ficalbi. The authors developed a multispecies R 0 model and used field-collected data to determine species-specific contributions to the transmission that suggested Cx. perexiguus was the main driver of WNV transmission in this region, whereas the R 0 of Plasmodium was higher when Cx. pipiens was present in the mosquito community (Ferraguti et al. 2020) . A reanalysis of mosquito and malaria surveys from Kilifi, Kenya, assessed various components of vector diversity and how this affected malaria transmission. There was a positive relationship between anopheline species richness and malaria prevalence in humans, and community composition influenced malaria prevalence as well, where a high ratio of Anopheles arabiensis Patton to Anopheles gambiae Giles led to a decrease in prevalence (Hoi et al. 2020 ).",

Another approach where this behavior could play a role is in microbial forms of control, where nectar-feeding could potentially be a means to transfer bacteria to mosquito populations. Asaia spp. have been investigated for their use in paratransgenesis, the genetic modification of this bacterium to impede the competence of mosquitoes for specific pathogens. A recent study isolated Asaia spp. from plants and mosquitoes in Senegal, and demonstrated that mosquitoes could inoculate flowers with Asaia, and subsequently these plants could transmit the bacterium to mosquitoes through nectarfeeding (Bassene et al. 2020) . The use of Wolbachia continues to show promise as a dengue control mechanism. In a field trial performed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the potential to use the wAlbB strain of Wolbachia for dengue control was investigated. Ae. aegypti carrying this strain were released at 6 sites with endemic dengue, and the persistence of Wolbachia and human dengue incidence were monitored (Nazni et al. 2019) . The prevalence of Wolbachia in mosquitoes rose quickly, and remained stable in some sites, while others required additional mosquito releases. Dengue incidence was estimated to decrease by approximately 40% following the releases (Nazni et al. 2019) . A newly detected vertically-transmitted symbiont, Microspodia MB, was found to be present in An. arabiensis populations in Kenya, and laboratory studies indicate infection with this microsporidian limits the development of Plasmodium falciparum, suggesting it could be investigated as an additional malaria control measure (Herren et al. 2020) .",

With developments in Cas9 and guide RNA technology, major steps toward this goal are being taken. A gene drive strain was developed for An. gambiae which targets the cardinal gene and results in a red-eye phenotype. In small cage trials introduction of gene-drive males led to the full establishment within 6-10 generations, and, importantly, there were no fitness costs found (Carballar-Lejarazu et al. 2020) . Other transgenic approaches include the development of an autosomal sex ratio distorter. This was tested in a 4-month experiment in large indoor cages with overlapping generations to measure fitness costs associated with the transgene (in addition to the effects on sex ratio), which were present. Model simulations based on this suggested the transgene would be lost from populations within several years (Pollegiono et al. 2020 ).",

Additional work on the molecular basis of circadian rhythms is likewise advancing. For instance, a study of the regulation of circadian rhythms in diurnal and nocturnal mosquito species [Ae. aegypti and Anopheles coluzzii (Coetzee & Wilkerson)] found differences in daytime light avoidance behavior, and PERIOD proteins cycled in opposite phases between two species of mosquitoes, suggesting these circadian clock protein phases may underlie differences in nocturnal and diurnal behaviors (Baik et al. 2020) . Human changes to light patterns and disruptions of normal circadian rhythms due to 'artificial light at night' (ALAN) affect a wide range of animals. For Ae. aegypti, it appears ALAN may increase their tendency to bite humans at times when they normally would not, at least in laboratory cages (Rund et al. 2020) . Simulated artificial light at night was found to considerably reduce the induction of diapause in Ae. albopictus. In urban field sites, although populations showed differences in diapause induction in early September, later on, all populations reached high levels of diapause, suggesting that the effect of artificial light may be minimized due to vegetation or other factors (Westby and Medley 2020) .",

            "text": "Other natural occurrences, such as inland flooding, are likely to occur more frequently with climate change and with changes in land use. Effects of such events on arboviral disease risk are not well understood. In a statistical analysis of Ross River virus (RRV) cases in New South Wales, Australia, it was found that Spring and Summer flooding in certain climate zones led to an increase in the probability of a summer RRV outbreak (Tall and Gatton 2020) . Effects of increasing temperatures have been studied extensively for malaria and dengue, but much less so for arboviruses transmitted in temperate settings. For WNV, a study that used trait-based models predicted peak transmission around summer temperatures of 24-25\u00b0C, which matched county-level data on West Nile disease incidence (Shocket et al. 2020) . This suggested that with increasing temperatures, climate effects on transmission will be strongly location-dependent and either positive or negative. The effects of temperature on adult mosquito survival differed in interesting ways from tropical vectors that have been assessed previously, with a linear decline in survival as a function of increasing temperature (Shocket et al. 2020) . In Coastal California, the use of spatio-temporal machine learning algorithms identified inhibitory, promoting, and transitional temperature bounds, and found that parts of the state where summer temperatures passed the transitionary zone more frequently saw the greatest expansion of West Nile positive mosquito pools over a ten-year period (Skaff et al. 2020 ). This could potentially help further pinpoint areas where climate change could lead to future increases in WNV transmission. Similar temperaturedependent models of vectorial capacity also may be used to understand variation in urban settings, where a mosaic of green space and impervious surface can lead to fine-scale temperature-driven variation in vector-borne disease risk. This was illustrated in Athens, GA, for Ae. albopictus, where urban areas with patches of trees led to the highest predicted vectorial capacity, a result of buffering in such areas against more extreme day-and night-time temperatures, resulting in temperatures that stay more closely to the thermal optimum of this species (Wimberley et al. 2020).",
