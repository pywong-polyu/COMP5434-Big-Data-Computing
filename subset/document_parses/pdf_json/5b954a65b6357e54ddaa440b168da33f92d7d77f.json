These smart mobility services thus need to be very well protected against a variety of security threats, such as intrusion, jamming, and Sybil attacks. One of the frequently cited attacks in smart mobility is the jamming attack. In order to detect the jamming attacks, different anti-jamming applications have been developed to reduce the impact of malicious jamming attacks. One important step in anti-jamming detection is to cluster the vehicular data. However, it is usually very time-consuming to detect the jamming attacks that may affect the safety of roads and vehicle communication in real-time. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient big data clustering model, coresets-based clustering, to support the real-time detection of jamming attacks. We validate the model efficiency and applicability in the context of a typical smart mobility system: Vehicular Ad-hoc Network, known as VANET.",

            "text": "Nowadays, smart mobility has become a critical transportation infrastructure [9, 38] in smart cities as it provides a variety of mobility services, such as relieving the traffic congestion in cities and providing better access to public transport. In [1] , smart mobility is described as: \"The use of ICT in modern transport technologies to improve urban traffic\". Likewise, in [42] , it is defined as: \"local and supra-local accessibility, availability of ICTs, modern, sustainable and safe transport systems\". Thus, smart mobility can be considered as a management strategy that produces decisions based on the collected data [9, 31] from vehicle-to-anything communications, such as vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-toinfrastructure, vehicle-to-pedestrian, and infrastructure-to-pedestrian [43] . For instance, a road infrastructure monitoring system uses e-bikes proposed in [25] to support municipal transportation activities. Further, an image processing application based on deep learning has been integrated into e-bikes to facilitate the detection of road anomalies such as litter and damage of roads. It can be seen that smart mobility is a fruitful domain that integrates different up-todate techniques such as the autonomous driving Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. In [21] , a vehicular interface notation has been developed to help older customers of smart vehicles to control their driving experience better and improve their cognitive ability. Similarly, in [40] , a machine learning system has been proposed to exploit data from autonomous vehicles and external IoT data sources to predict pedestrian's next movement steps using real-time trajectory. The suggested solution ensures safety in urban environments by enhancing autonomous driving efficiently in local public transport services. The recent works indicate that smart mobility is driven by data-intensive processes focused on managing people's mobility and personalizing transport solutions according to the specific needs of cities [8] . On the other hand, smart mobility advances the transport services and quality of citizens' life in smart cities [16, 17, 29] .",

In this attack, a jammer regularly sends repeated signals to interfere with the communication between vehicles in the affected network area, where the target vehicles think that the state of the channel is still busy. Consequently, they cannot send or receive packets that can be carrying important information, such as weather and accidents. In other words, when jamming occurs, the sender may send packets. However, the receiver might not be able to receive all the packets sent by the sender. Thus, the failure of receiving or disseminating these packets can lead to the insufficiency of the VANET.

            "text": "The concept of big data clustering is very important in smart mobility since it contributes to improving the sustainability, scalability, and reliability of smart mobility systems [5] , such as associating mobile nodes into groups, ensuring the stability of channel access management, traffic safety, and QoS Assurance. Many jamming detection approaches in VANET have exploited the advantages of clustering algorithms by collecting jamming measurements and then accurately grouping them into the cluster [6, 32] . For example, in [15] , a novel jamming detection framework was proposed to detect the presence of a jammer in hierarchical cluster-based wireless sensor networks. The proposed anti-jamming detection method also exploits the benefits of the unsupervised hierarchical algorithm for achieving energy efficiency by re-clustering, overcoming network issues (i.e., reducing the communication overhead), decreasing collision, and improving throughput. Similarly, in [23] , a jamming detection solution was developed by leveraging the K-means algorithm, which is one of the most commonly used partitioned clustering algorithms in Big Data Analytics. This work reflects the benefits of using clustering algorithms in VANETs, where the advantages of kmeans are used to differentiate intentional cases from unintentional jamming ( Table 2 ). The collected jamming measurements are grouped into the interference cluster accurately, and then the specific characteristics of each attack are extracted. Thus, the unsupervised method is aimed at determining whether jamming occurs due to a malicious jammer or whether it is caused unintentionally. Consequently, if jamming is correctly identified as interference, vehicles can preserve their communications either by changing their channel or by temporarily altering their route. Likewise, in [4] , a multi-cluster localization (M-cluster) algorithm and an x-rayed jammed-area localization (X-ray) algorithm were successively developed based on fuzzy c-means and K-means to deal with the multi-jammer localization problem in WSNs, which could launch collaborative attacks. In [34] , the advantages of K-means were used to predict the number of multiple jamming attackers and ensure the preset functions of VANET. In [33] , an anti-jamming method based on fuzzy c-means was proposed to determine the localization and number of jamming attackers. Accordingly, the cluster analysis process simplifies data manipulation by finding similar structures in the data and classifying each object according to its nature. As a result, vehicles can adequately avoid malicious jamming attacks, decrease their collisions, and preserve their communications [27, 28, 30] .",

Moreover, coresets not only can reduce the data scale while keeping the original data distribution [11, 24] , but also can be used for improving the quality of clustering [18, 37] . For Example, ProTraS [37] is a coreset construction algorithm that aims at generating a data sample to deal with big data clustering problems [2, 3] . The main idea of ProTraS is to select a representative point based on a probability of cost reduction. Given an > 0, for each iteration of the algorithm, it adds a new representative into a group of the sample with the highest probability of the cost reduction. When the cost drops below a threshold, which depends on , the algorithm stops. The algorithm finds the nearest group for points that are not yet assigned to any group of the current sample. The point among them is determined to be the new representative if it is farthest in its group and has the highest probability. That means, the representative selected by ProTraS is the farthest-first traversal item of a given group. As a result, this coreset construction algorithm leads to enhancing the quality of clusters that are required for ensuring the accuracy of the Big Data Analytics outcomes [2, 3] .",

Next, the produced clusters are positioned as points, and all samples are linked with the nearest cluster and adjusted; then, the process overuses the new adjustments until the desired result is achieved. Thus, this algorithm is easy to implement, efficient in terms of its computational costs, and offers easily interpretable clustering results.",

For that reason, we have evaluated the quality of the obtained clusters both with and without the application of the coresets method. We used the improved versions of K-means (i.e., fuzzy c-means) to evaluate how coresets could influence the quality of the clusters by using a list of metrics. For instance, the Dunn index (DI) is used as an internal evaluation metric to determine how well each sample lies within its cluster. A higher DI indicates better clustering. Likewise, we used a second internal metric, named the Davies-Bouldin index (DBI), to evaluate how well the clustering has been done by using the quantities and features inherent to the selected database. A lower DBI indicates better clustering. Figure 2 represented the mapping of the SNIR time evolution. One can see that the sample size is reduced from 25,000 to 479 due to the application of the coreset. Consequently, the time analysis process is also reduced. Thus, the combination of the coresets with clustering algorithms could help the anti-jamming applications to learn quickly from the approximated data that represent the original data source. As a result, they can detect the presence of constant jamming attacks rapidly.",

DBI (Fig. 3a) and DI (Fig. 3b) achieved better values with the coresets compared to the original application of clustering algorithms. Further, DBI and DI reflect how well each sample lies within its cluster. Accordingly, the integration of the coresets with k-means and its improved versions increases the quality of clusters. Besides, K-means shows better efficiency than k-means++ and Fuzzy c-means in term of time. However, we noticed that the application of the coresets supports Fuzzy c-means to proceed quickly compared to its regular time process.

In other words, the anti-jamming applications can detect the presence of the viral constant jamming attack and cope with it in real-time, which is a good starting point not only for enhancing the security mechanisms adopted by anti-jamming applications but also for supporting the other detection attack systems based-clustering that have to deal with viral attacks in real-time.",
