            "text": "Food access, stability and utilisation are key dimensions of food security at an urban scale. When the majority resided in rural areas, and lived predominantly agrarian lifestyles, it made sense for the state to govern food security through national agricultural ministries, focusing predominantly on the availability dimension of food security. With the transition to a majority urban world, coupled with the food security challenges currently experienced in urban areas, specifically in Africa, these historical policy and governance structures are increasingly inadequate in responding to essential food and nutrition needs. Problematically, urban areas, and specifically urban managers, cite unfunded mandates, and absent authority, as the reasons for not engaging food and nutrition governance responses. This paper argues that this is a false position. Drawing on recent data from household food security and poverty surveys, the paper calls for new and expanded planning and design approaches at the urban scale. The paper argues that spatial planning and urban design principles and actions provide an immediate and effective means through which to engage urban food system questions. Importantly these actions are essential to the transition from the current piecemeal project responses to urban food system inadequacies. Food sensitive planning and urban design is offered as a specific approach that could assist in programming food system-related challenges at the urban scale, responding to conceptual, analytical, organisational and design related dimensions of planning, and in so doing offering a longer term, systematic response to urban food insecurity.",

            "text": "South Africa is predominantly urban, with more than two-thirds of its population residing in urban areas. These urban areas are diverse, ranging from the conurbation that is the greater Johannesburg, to smaller towns and even sprawling peri urban settlements, some of which are legacies of South Africa's Bantustan and apartheid planning systems. Additionally, in South Africa many consume inadequate, nutritionally poor diets. Food insecurity is a structural issue, one that requires an encompassing policy and strategic planning response. The current largely agrarian focus of food security policy misses both the urban demographic profile, but also the changing nature of the food system. All spheres of government carry an obligation to progressively realise the Right to Food. For many South Africans, this right is yet to be realised. Problematically, South Africa's policy architecture effectively mandates national and provincial governments the role of enabling food access, and as such, ensuring the attainment of the Right to Food. This means that for urban areas, programming food security responses, and ensuring the realisation of the Right to Food and Nutrition is seen as a so-called unfunded mandate.",

It argues that local governments have powerful tools at their disposal to effectively ensure the realisation of the Right to Food, and food security. These tools, specifically spatial planning, are not currently understood to have a food component.

In order to highlight the urgency and importance of a specific urban focus, the paper then provides some detail on the state of food insecurity in South Africa and Cape Town (with reasons for the selection of Cape Town as a case study site). In order to reiterate the importance of the right to food and the obligations placed on local government, the paper briefly expands on how the right to food applies at the urban or local scale. The paper then concludes with a brief overview of food sensitive planning and urban design. The paper does not attempt to offer specific action steps, but rather presents the concept of FSPUD in broad terms, leaving it to planners and urban managers in specific contexts to operationalise such activities. While using the term FSPUD, it is appreciated that planning and urban design are not necessarily the same thing. In South Africa, and in many other African cities, \"spatial planning happens at a variety of scales through plans and policies prepared by planners and policy drafters. Urban design happens at a smaller, precinct scale that typically, doesn't include policy\" (Faragher, 2021 ).",

Despite the current absence of systemic urban food related considerations, cities and the food system have always been connected (See Steel, 2008) . Food and cities connect in multiple ways, and yet, most policy and governance responses view cities simply, as recipients of food produced in rural or even peri urban areas. The flows of food into cities shape how markets function, how household purchase, prepare and consume food, but also other considerations such as waste, the food economy, both formal and informal and a variety of food-related considerations.",

Because of the specific trajectory of SARS-CoV-2, spreading from the first reported cases in Wuhan, China, to other large, well-connected urban centres in the world, and then from there to smaller towns and finally to rural areas, \"a pattern known as hierarchical diffusion\" (Mosely, 2020) , the high urban prevalence and the scale of serious illness in South African cities requires far greater attention.",

Speaking of infrastructure specifically, Pieterse et al (2015) go on to suggest that the infrastructure that is developed in African cities in the next 20 years will define the developmental trajectory of the continent well into the future.

When these factors are considered in the context of how infrastructure and services impact food security, effectively casting that impact in concrete for the next 30-100 years, far greater consideration, and urgency in policy and planning, is required. This attention also needs to be linked to place-where the subsequent multi-dimensional drivers of food insecurity and place intersect in what is referred to as the food environment. The limited \"poverty equals possible food security\" lens has problematic implications as the poverty focus obscures any consideration of the wider systemic factors that impact food security. Building on the PMBEJD and recent increases of food insecurity that emerged as a result of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 lockdown, it is argued that the Statistics South Africa (2019) figures grossly under-estimate food insecurity. The StatsSA figures may capture a measure of hunger, but hunger and food insecurity are very different. The SADHS and SAN-HANES figures offer stark insights into the nutritional deficits and the resultant dietary-related consequences of these deficits. These are issues that play out differently at different scales. Disregarding one of these scales, particularly the urban scale, leaves significant gaps in the policy and planning responses.",

From qualitative interviews, this practice was explained as being due to supermarkets being used to access key staples, generally non-perishable foods, where buying in bulk offers benefits. These are the food types that can be easily stored for extended periods of time. For most of the daily and more frequent purchases, the informal sector is central to the food access strategies of the poor, where over half the lowest income tercile respondents mentioned frequenting spaza shops at least five times a week, and a large proportion of these same respondents reported frequenting street vendors on a weekly basis . \"For most things, they come here every day, so our items are small, for use on the day\" (Respondent 4.23.7, 2019). Clearly while the supermarket is frequented and used by most Capetonians, other food access points are also used, and used very differently, often in response to home and neighbourhood infrastructure provision. Food choices correlate directly to the lived reality of households. While income frequencies (monthly, weekly or daily) would influence this, other factors such as access to storage, energy access and its reliability, and refrigeration all drive food choice and choices about the point of food access. Clearly, many factors beyond those of just income poverty, contribute to food insecurity and impact food access. These factors are linked to infrastructure, spatial planning and urban design. Figure 2 presents the results drawn from the multi-dimensional poverty tool, the Lived Poverty Index (LPI), used in the same Cape Town survey . The LPI includes all income categories, and as a result, is mediated by the very regular access to services of the wealthier income groups. The LPI highlights the fact that access to income remains a challenge. This is however not the only limitation faced by these households. Over and above income poverty, the LPI provides insights into other drivers of poverty, drivers that have a direct impact on food security.",

These infrastructure aspects, all reported at the household scale, impact household food related outcomes directly. Constrained access to energy, both electricity and the different forms of cooking fuel, mean that households make strategic decisions on the types of foods prepared, often resorting to more processed and faster cooking food types. A further essential consideration relating to electricity access is its role in food preservation. Without electricity refrigeration is generally absent. This means that households strategically orientate their food purchases around such limitations. As a result, foods purchased often include processed foods that have a longer life (such as processed staples).",

Infrastructure impacts many factors including costs, hygiene and supply chain processes. A question seldom asked in the debates around the nutrition transition and rise of NCDs in South Africa is what role energy, water and other infrastructure access plays in this transition? Clearly, food insecurity is directly linked to place and factors other than just food production or poverty.

Policy located within a department, whose primary mandate is food production, results in a particular view of food security needs, but also a predominant perception of where the food insecure may reside, the rural areas of the country.

This obligation does not rest solely on national and provincial governments; it also applies to and binds local government. This food security, and by extension food system, obligation is further reinforced by the food system-related obligations placed on urban areas, or local government, through schedules 4 and 5 of the same constitution (see De Visser, 2019; Republic of South Africa (RSA), 1996) . However, despite this broader and encompassing obligation, the absence of both a policy mandate (as opposed to a legal mandate derived from the Constitution), and a fiscal mandate, through state provided funding to programme food security responses, means that food security remains a so-called \"unfunded mandate\" in the eyes of most local government actors (see Battersby et al., 2014) .",

A scan of many of these notes that city-scale strategic engagement in the food system is largely absent, bar some mention of urban agriculture projects or the \"formalisation\" of hawkers and traders. In South Africa, planning is implicated in the emergence of unsustainable and unhealthy urban food system patterns, while at the same time, planning has the tools to facilitate more inclusive and nurturing food system responses (Battersby, 2017) . However, it remains largely ignorant of its deep impacts on the food system (Battersby, 2017) . The absence of a definitive, proactive, integrated and pro-poor strategy focusing explicitly on the informal sector in Cape Town is a key example of the absence of deliberated food system planning (Skinner & Haysom, 2016) . It is through planning that opportunities for a more inclusive food system lie, where the integration of direct food system interventions and the embedding of food considerations into planning decisions are most evident. These needs are essential because \"improved access to and utilisation of food is essential to current and future generations. With cities at the centre of our civilisation, it will become increasingly critical for food to be centrally reflected in the planning of urban areas\" (Stamoulis et al., 2018: vi) .",

In addition, supermarkets are important sites of property transactions and development, which can often undermine other food retail livelihoods in urban areas (Teppo & Houssay-Holzschuch, 2013) . Changes in food consumption are associated with how urban space is used in terms of travel time constraints leading to dietary changes, driving a nutrition transition (Popkin, 1998) . The \"big food transition\" is linked to the preceding transitions, and to wider agro-food system changes (Igumbor et al., 2012; Monteiro & Cannon, 2012) , suggested by Hawkes (2006: 1) to be \"the convergence towards poor quality obesogenic diets\".

Importantly, it is not just Northern cities that have been engaging in foodaligned planning actions.

Nascent processes are evident but how can planners effectively engage the urban food system? Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) as a concept was first devised in 1990s in Australia and arose as a response to the challenge of how to design for resilience as a result of the converging impacts of population growth and climate change, specifically in relation to the need for sustainable urban water resource management and the protection of water habitats and environments (Wong & Brown, 2009) . This was in the context of severe water quality, quantity and drainage challenges in Western Australia (Gluckman, 2017) . The conceptual entry point was the assertion that the overall water system, and its complexity, had been disregarded in favour of a disproportionate focus on perfecting efficiency of only one dimension of the system, around water supply (Wong & Brown, 2009 ). WSUD positions water as the driver for the planning of ecologically sustainable cities and aims to optimise the synergy between the urban built environment and the urban water cycle.

Given this paper's considerations of the utility of FSPUD in the South African and African contexts, the paper draws on FSPUD as a concept. Due recognition is given to the fact that this merging of disciplines, and scales of governance, could create contextual challenges. It is appreciated that \"spatial planning happens at a variety of scales through plans and policies prepared by planners and policy actors, whereas urban design happens at a much smaller, precinct scale but typically, doesn't directly include policy\" (Faragher, 2021) .

            "text": "Required is a general transition to Urban Food Planning. Ilieva (2016) suggests that there are four essential practices evident in food system planning. These include conceptual practice, analytical practice, organisational practice and the design practice. This is important for the reason that when used as an organising and urban governance tool, integrating food governance and planning can be seen as being disproportionately aligned to the design component (both urban and policy design), with other essential components lost. Understanding the full extent of the urban food system challenge, assuming responsibility for these issues at the urban scale in the first place, and carefully considering the organisational and governance processes needed to support, and manage, sustained and equitable food system change is key to the FSPUD concept. These different practices are expanded on in Table 2. FSPUD provides a tool to apply a systemic response to the urbanisation of food security and food system challenges, and the governance thereof, connecting food to urban management and functions. This is important because once plans are implemented; management of the plans requires a different organisational response. In general, South African cities have adequately robust plans but gaps exist in the implementation thereof. There are a number of processes and mandates (and responsibilities) of local government into which food can be inserted. Food Sensitive Planning and Urban Design facilitates the inclusion of other components, in the South African case, informed by the likes of SPLUMA and other land use governance dictates. For FSPUD to hold any viability in South African and African cities, it needs to serve both the formal and informal elements of the food system and food system functioning. As Fig. 1 demonstrated, for many of the poorer households in the Cape Town case, the informal food retail sector is an essential point of food access. Represented in an admittedly linear manner, and accepting that the formal and informal binary is seldom clear cut, Table 3 offers a sense of the extreme differences between formal and informal planning. It also demonstrates how formalised planning may allow for some certainty and systemic engagement, but given the significant role that informal \"planning\" plays in the food system, this demands very different forms of engagement and planning.",

In the Cape Table 2 Urban food planning as a field of conceptual, analytical, design, and organisational practices (source: adapted from Ilieva, 2016: 16) Town case, the tensions between development and the retention of peri urban farmland (Battersby et al., 2014) , the inability of the city to offer details on supermarket expansion and the locating of informal vending areas in well-located sites (Peyton et al., 2015) all demonstrate sites where the municipal planning competence and food systems intersect. These examples also highlight how an absent food planning view can have unintended consequences (Pothukuchi & Kaufman, 1999) . Examples of sites where FSPUD can be applied, but also, where the intersections between formal and informal planning processes intersect are evident in sites such as taxi ranks and transit interchanges, where formal planning intersect with informal retail (Park Ross, 2019), as well as in collaboratively organising and structuring places of food trade (Dobson & Skinner, 2009 ). This presents a real operational challenge to planners and other urban governance actors. Context, politics, urban needs and the everyday actions of planners and urban managers need to engage the questions, even tensions, of insurgent (informal) planning and structured (formal) planning in ways that maximise benefits and governance for all. This is a clearly understood Southern urban challenge and one through which food offers some opportunities.",
