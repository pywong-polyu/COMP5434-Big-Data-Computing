In parabolic flight, blood and fluids shift along the body axis toward the cranium during the simulation of zero-G (1), echocardiography showed that the heart becomes more spherical.

On the systemic level, there are changes in hemodynamic and neuroendocrine regulation that exert indirect effects on the myocardium [4] . In control right ventricle, cardiac 8 muscle fibers are connected to each other through the intercalated disc, which ensures force transmission and transduction between cells and allows the myocardium to function in synchrony. Intercalated disc possesses an intrinsic ability to sense mechanical changes, to achieve a biochemical response that results in molecular and cellular changes in cardiomyocytes. This becomes of particular importance in cardiomyopathies, where the heart is exposed to increased mechanical load and needs to adapt to sustain its contractile function [5] . The mechanosensing and transduction at the intercalated disc can occur mostly through conformational changes in proteins of the adherens junctions complex: a change in the cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins [6] . In simulation microgravity condition, rat ventricular cardiomyocytes appeared more separated from each other and were slightly smaller in size, exhibiting focal disorganization of muscle fibers and some degenerating cardiomyocytes, of which the nuclei had become pyknotic or disappeared [7] . Our experiment results suggested that simulation microgravity did not increase the significant right ventricle hypertrophy due to the increase of redistribution of the body fluid. However, a part of the right ventricular myocardium caused depopulation of cell interval. In most area of simulation right ventricular wall, the intercalated disc has no significant variation in H.E. staining images. However, the STAT3 signaling protein were abnormal accumulated in intercalated disc in simulation heart, this phenomenon did not appear in control rats.",
