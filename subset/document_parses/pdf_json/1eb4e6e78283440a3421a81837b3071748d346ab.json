Methods: A cross-sectional survey targeting OTO-HNS program directors (PD) was created and disseminated via email to PDs on May 28th 2020. Descriptive analyses of the 19-question survey was performed, and free text responses for certain suitable questions were thematically categorized into groups determined to be relevant during analysis. Results: Twenty-nine of 123 solicited PDs (23.6%) completed the survey. Nineteen (65.5%) respondents indicated they would not host away rotations (AR) in 2020, and 9 (31.0%) reported that they would consider away rotators without home programs. Regarding the historical importance of AR, 21 (72.4%) PDs stated they were either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important in evaluating candidates. Sixteen (55.2%) PDs stated that virtual interviews would impact their ability to properly gauge candidates and 12 (41.4%) were unsure. Eight PDs (27.6%) stated their evaluation of candidates will likely change, with a shift toward an increased reliance on letters of recommendation, research involvement, and clerkship grades. The large majority of PDs-25 (86.2%)-were not worried that the COVID-19 pandemic would affect the abilities of new interns beginning in 2021. Conclusion: Virtual interviews and engagement activities will mostly supplant sub-Is and AR for the 2020-2021 OTO-HNS application cycle. Surveyed PDs largely believe these will be insufficient in providing a comprehensive assessment of candidates, and will similarly limit applicants' ability to gauge residency programs. Criteria utilized to evaluate students is expected to change.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] As a response, medical students have begun to apply more broadly, with a recent survey showing that candidates submit a median of 60 applications through the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS), the centralized service through which applicants and programs communicate for matching into residency in the United States. 7 Furthermore, there is evidence that interviews are being amassed among relatively few applicants, 8 resulting in potentially worse match outcomes for both students and programs. 9 The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced a dramatic transformation in healthcare in an attempt to protect both patients and providers. 10, 11 These changes have extended to medical education, with recent recommendations by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and otolaryngology governing bodies encouraging restricted student-patient interactions, recommending against away sub-internships (aways) at outside medical institutions, and urging for virtual residency interviews. 12, 13 The impact on the 2020-2021 (henceforth referred to as 2020) application cycle remains unclear, though traditional methods of ascertaining an applicant's candidacy will undoubtedly be altered.",

Consequently, applicants hoarding even more invitations may limit the diversity of matriculants, and possibly affect the OTO-HNS applicant match rate and program fill rate. Alternatively, though no PD indicated they would interview fewer applicants, considering limitations in ability to distinguish applicants from one another in a virtual setting, more thorough interviewing of fewer applicants may be beneficial in informing the rank process. Regardless, our findings highlight that, absent application or interview caps or some form of program preference signaling, interviewing the same or fewer number of applicants may lead to match inefficiencies. 16, 17 To complement virtual interviews, virtual activities including virtual facility tours, question and answer sessions with faculty, and virtual chats with residents have all been considered (Figure 3) .",

            "text": "While our findings are derived from the views and experiences of OTO-HNS PDs, these findings may be germane to other competitive surgical subspecialties facing similar challenges in light of COVID-19. Commentary articles offering prospective guidance from surgical subspecialty leaders for navigating the 2020 application cycle had anticipated many of the challenges highlighted in our study. Importantly, the risk of limited exposure available to both applicants and programs was raised early, although these concerns were offered without the benefit of cross-sectional data. 19 Identification of students without home OTO-HNS programs as being particularly vulnerable in the upcoming cycle was also reported early during the pandemic, and our data highlighting the importance of aways and of letters of reference from established mentors in the field of OTO-HNS in the upcoming cycle is in agreement with this. 20 The major limitation of this study is response bias. While an effort was made to contact all otolaryngology programs nationally, it is possible we captured a sample not representative of all otolaryngology residency leadership. This was also evident in our response rate, which only captured about 23.6% of all PDs, potentially limiting the generalizability of our results. However, this may be partially mitigated by fairly clear consensus among some survey questions. We were also limited by the answer choices posed, though we attempted to alleviate this by thematically grouping free text responses. Still, not everyone chose to elaborate in the free text box, and the nature of free text prevents assessing how many participants believe in a thematic option. For example, that 4 of 29 (13.8%) respondents report they will have difficulty assessing applicant fit with the program does not mean that 86.2% do not.",

Virtual interviews and engagement activities are likely to be implemented, and away rotations, although previously highly emphasized in evaluating candidates, will mostly be eliminated. Surveyed PDs largely believed these limitations would hinder their ability to gauge applicants, and similarly assumed applicants will be limited in their ability to assess residency programs. Although candidates may theoretically be able to attend more interviews, most PDs are not currently planning on increasing interview capacity. PDs reported that criteria used for applicant evaluation may change this year, with particular reliance on letters of recommendations.",
