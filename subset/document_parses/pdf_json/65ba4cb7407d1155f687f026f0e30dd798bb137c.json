            "text": "The world health organization estimates that more than a quarter of the human population is infected with parasitic worms that are called helminths. Many helminths suppress the immune system of their hosts to prolong their survival. This helminth-induced immunosuppression \"spills over\" to unrelated antigens and can suppress the immune response to vaccination against other pathogens. Indeed, several human studies have reported a negative correlation between helminth infections and responses to vaccinations. Using mice that are infected with the parasitic nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis as a model for chronic human filarial infections, we reported previously that concurrent helminth infection impaired the vaccination-induced protection against the human pathogenic 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus (2009 pH1N1). Vaccinated, helminth-infected mice produced less neutralizing, influenza-specific antibodies than vaccinated na\u00efve control mice. Consequently helminth-infected and vaccinated mice were not protected against a challenge infection with influenza virus but displayed high virus burden in the lung and a transient weight loss. In the current study we tried to improve the vaccination efficacy using vaccines that are licensed for humans. We either introduced a prime-boost vaccination regimen using the non-adjuvanted anti-influenza vaccine Begripal or employed the adjuvanted influenza vaccine Fluad. Although both strategies elevated the production of influenza-specific antibodies and protected mice from the transient weight loss that is caused by an influenza challenge infection, sterile immunity was not achieved. Helminth-infected vaccinated mice still had high virus burden in the lung while non-helminth-infected vaccinated mice rapidly cleared the virus. In summary we demonstrate that basic improvements of influenza vaccination regimen are not sufficient to confer sterile immunity on the background of helminth-induced immunosuppression, despite amelioration of pathology i.e. weight loss. Our findings highlight the risk of failed vaccinations in helminth-endemic areas, especially in light of the ongoing vaccination campaign to control the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Several studies report a negative correlation between pre-existing helminth infections and the response to vaccinations against cholera [6] , tuberculosis [7] , tetanus [8] , influenza [9] , or malaria [10] , in the human population; a fact that is seldom taken into account during testing of novel vaccines in the tropics [11, 12] .

            "text": "To investigate possible interference with vaccination efficacy by underlying helminth infections in a controlled setting, we use Litomosoides sigmodontis-infected mice as a model for chronic human filarial infections [15] . L. sigmodontis infective third stage larvae (L3) are transmitted by mites, the intermediate host, during the blood meal. Although the natural definitive hosts are cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), exposure of inbred laboratory mice to infected mites results in successful infection. The mites are separated from the mice after the blood meal and transmitted L3 migrate within 4 days via the lymphatics to the thoracic cavity of the mice. They moult via fourth stage larvae (L4) to parasitic adults by day 30 post infection (p.i.). Semisusceptible C57BL/6 mice allow establishment of infection but start to kill the parasites by day 35 via granuloma formation while fully susceptible BALB/c mice stay infected for more than 90 days [16, 17] . Using this model, we reported previously that acute and chronic L. sigmodontis infection reduced antigen-specific T cell proliferation and antibody (Ab) responses of all isotypes to model antigen immunization in both, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice [18] [19] [20] [21] . These findings were clinically relevant: First, the expansion of sporozoite-specific CD8 + T cells, their cytokine production, cytotoxic activity and protection against a Plasmodium berghei challenge infection was impaired in vaccinated helminth-infected mice compared to non-infected mice [22] . Second, vaccination responses to the trivalent split subunit vaccine Begripal, that was licensed for human influenza vaccination in the seasons 2014 to 2017, were impaired by concurrent helminth infection [23] . We recorded reduced quantity of all isotypes and impaired quality of Influenza Haemagglutinin (HA)-specific Ab response in helminth-infected mice compared to na\u00efve control mice. Vaccinated control mice were protected against a challenge infection with the human pathogenic 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus (2009 pH1N1) while vaccinated, helminth-infected mice displayed transient weight loss and high virus burden in the lung. Moreover, reduced Ab responses were also observed if vaccinations were performed after immune-driven or drug-induced termination of the L. sigmodontis infection [23, 24] . This sustained suppression of vaccine response was correlated to a systemic and sustained expansion of type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1) and could be partially reverted by blocking the Tr1 key cytokine IL-10 [21, 23, 24] . In summary, our findings raise the concern that also humans living in helminth-endemic areas that either suffer from acute helminth infection or have a history of previous helminth infections may not benefit from vaccinations even the absence of acute and thus diagnosable helminthiasis.",

While the trivalent split subunit influenza vaccine Begripal is delivered without adjuvants, the influenza vaccine Fluad is enhanced with MF59, an oil-in-water squalene-based adjuvant that is licensed for humans [25] . We show that either prime-boost vaccination with the non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine Begripal or single vaccination with the adjuvanted influenza vaccine Fluad did not abrogate the helminthinduced reduction of the Ab response. Adjuvanted or prime-boost vaccination rather elevated the Ab response in general, in helminth-infected and na\u00efve control mice to the same extent. This elevated Ab response in vaccinated and helminth-infected mice was sufficient to protect against the transient weight loss induced by influenza virus challenge infection. However, the improved vaccination regimen was not sufficient to prevent viral replication, as influenza virus load in the lungs were still significantly higher in vaccinated, helminth-infected mice compared to mice that were vaccinated in the absence of an underlying helminth infection.",

All mice were kept in individually ventilated cages. C57BL/6 mice were either bred in the animal facility of the BNITM or were obtained from Janvier Labs. Female 8-10 week old mice were used for experiments. To alleviate suffering, all mice are kept in small groups of 2-5 with toys and crawl spaces to allow hiding places. Experimental mice were monitored daily and scored for signs of suffering (ruffled fur, impaired activity, signs of paralysis) and body weight. Mice losing more than 25% of their body weight or reaching other endpoint criteria according to the score were sacrificed. For anaesthesia, mice received ketamine/xylazine (100 mg and 5 mg/kg body weight) i.p. in 200 \u03bcl PBS and were closely monitored and kept on a heated mat (37\u02daC) until they regained consciousness. Mice were sacrificed by an overdosed CO 2 Narcosis. When the inter-toe reflex was no longer apparent a cervical dislocation was performed in addition.",

Subsequently, mice were either vaccinated once day 14 or twice days 14 and 28 post L. sigmodontis infection using the influenza vaccine Begripal season 2017/18. Begripal is a non-adjuvanted trivalent split subunit vaccine that is composed of HA derived from three different influenza strains including 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus. Vaccine-induced protection is predominantly mediated by neutralizing Ab [27] . Vaccination of na\u00efve control mice induced HA-specific IgG1 ( Fig 1B) and neutralizing Ab response recorded as HI titre (Fig 1C) in all groups that received either one (black and dark blue symbols) or two (grey and light blue symbols) injections of the vaccine while non-vaccinated mice did not contain HA-specific Ab ( Fig  1B and 1C open symbols) . Thereby, the prime-boost vaccination regimen yielded significantly higher Ab and HI titres than just one dose of vaccination (Fig 1B and 1C black asterisks). Concurrent infection with L. sigmodontis at the moment of vaccination significantly reduced Ab and HI titres (blue asterisk) compared to na\u00efve control mice, as described before [23] . This helminth infection-induced reduction of Ab and HI titres was still observed in mice that received a boost immunization, merely at an elevated level. Thereby, the Ab and HI titres in helminthinfected mice that received prime-boost vaccinations were more than 10-fold higher than in helminth-infected mice that were just vaccinated once (Fig 1B and 1C red asterisks) .",

As sublethal infection results in a transient weight loss reflecting pathology, body weight was recorded over 14 days (Fig 1D) . While non-vaccinated mice lost up to 20% of their body weight before recovering, non-helminth-infected control mice that were vaccinated once or twice were almost completely protected from influenza infectioninduced weight loss. Helminth-infected mice that received a single vaccination displayed significantly increased weight loss compared to vaccinated control mice (Fig 1D, dark blue circles and blue asterisks), as we had shown before [23] . Still, vaccination had some protective effect also in helminth-infected mice as non-vaccinated helminth-infected mice lost significantly more weight than the vaccinated helminth-infected group (Fig 1D open blue circles to dark blue circles and black asterisks). By contrast, helminth-infected mice that received two vaccinations (Fig 1D, light blue circles) were protected from challenge infection-induced weight loss to the same extent as non-helminth-infected control mice that received one vaccination (Fig 1D, black squares) .",

We report that both, prime-boost vaccination with non-adjuvanted trivalent split subunit vaccine Begripal or single vaccination with the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine Fluad elevated IgG1 and neutralizing Ab responses to influenza vaccination in helminth-infected mice. However, neutralizing Ab responses were still significantly reduced in helminth-infected mice compared to naive control mice. The partially restored Ab response was sufficient to protect mice from influenza challenge infection-induced weight loss but not from viral replication in the lung. Thereby, performing a kinetic analysis, we showed that Fluad-vaccinated mice cleared 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus from the lung by day 5 p.i. whereas mice that were Fluad-vaccinated while carrying a chronic helminth infection displayed the same high viral burden as non-vaccinated mice.",

            "text": "The influenza vaccine Begripal is a subunit trivalent inactivated vaccine, composed out of HA derived from 3 different influenza strains including 2009 pH1N1. Vaccination-induced protection is thought to be mediated predominantly by HA-specific neutralizing Ab [27] . Begripal is recommended for humans over 6 months age, contains no further adjuvant and thus is not very immunogenic. Therefore, the use of adjuvanted vaccines such as Fluad is recommended for elderly persons above 65 years, suffering from immune senescence [32] . Likewise, improved influenza vaccination strategies are currently evaluated for individuals with a compromised immune system due to HIV infection or immunosuppressive treatment of autoimmune diseases or after solid organ transplantation [33] . However, no strategies are approved for helminth-infected individuals that display an impaired immune response to bystander antigens as well [3] [4] [5] . Fluad contains the adjuvant MF59 which is a squalene-based oil-inwater adjuvant. Although the exact molecular mechanisms are not fully understood [25] , MF59 was shown to induce upregulation of a broad array of immune-relevant genes [34] , to improve APC recruitment and function [35, 36] and to enhance Ab responses, especially in children [37] . While adults usually receive a single vaccination against seasonal influenza, young children benefited from a second vaccination dose that resulted in significantly improved protection from influenza disease [38] . In line with these findings, we observed increased Ab responses in mice receiving a prime-boost vaccination either twice with the nonadjuvanted Begripal or a single vaccination with the MF59-adjuvanted Fluad, thus demonstrating that helminth-infection did not interfere with boost or adjuvant functions per se. However, the pre-existing helminth infection still reduced the Ab response to vaccination, leading to only partial establishment of protection. From the translational point of view protection from morbidity indicated by prevention of the influenza-induced weight loss appears to be advantageous enough. Nevertheless, and in light of even more fatal viral diseases such as Ebola, sterile immunity i.e. prevention of viral replication would be the ultimate goal.",

This may also be extended to other vaccines since similar susceptibility to helminth-induced suppression was reported for a protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice [39] . Chronic Taenia crassiceps infection reduced S. pneumoniae-specific Ab response even if the overall Ab response was boosted by a second immunization. The reduced Ab response in T. crassiceps-infected mice resulted in impaired protection against pneumonia and increased lethality during a S. pneumoniae challenge infection. Likewise, chronic infection with the intestinal parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus reduced the Ab response to vaccination with a crude lysate of Plasmodium chabaudi parasitized erythrocytes, thereby abrogating the protection from parasitaemia that was achieved in vaccinated helminth-free mice [40] .",

            "text": "Moreover, helminth-induced suppression of vaccination efficacy is not restricted to protein-based vaccines. The efficacy of the DNA-based transmission-blocking anti-Plasmodium falciparum vaccine Pfs25 was compromised in mice with concurrent H. polygyrus infection despite repeated immunizations [41] . Interestingly, in the same study the immunization with irradiated Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites induced comparable circumsporozoite (CSP)-specific Ab responses and protection from a challenge infection in H. polygyrus-infected mice, suggesting that life attenuated vaccines may outcompete helminth-induced immunosuppression. In line with this reasoning, we have shown previously that experimental immunization with a fusion protein composed out of the Plasmodium berghei CSP 245-253 and detoxified Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) induced a CSP-specific CD8 + T cell response that conferred protection against P. berghei infection [42] . The numbers and the function of vaccination-induced CSP-specific T cells were reduced in mice that carried chronic L. sigmodontis infection during vaccination. Consequently, parasite burden in the liver was increased after a P. berghei sporozoite challenge infection. However, introduction of a prime immunization with a CSP-expressing attenuated live Salmonella strain before the ACT-CSP immunization rescued the CD8 + T cell response in L. sigmodontis-infected mice and conferred almost sterile immunity to a P. berghei challenge infection [22, 43] . The same advantage of life vaccine carrier was observed in anti-HIV immunization. Infection with the liver fluke Schistosoma mansoni reduced the cellular response to vaccination with a multi epitope T cell DNA vaccine against HIV-1 C [44] . By contrast, vaccinating with a HIV-1 gag protein expressing Lysteria monocytogenes as living carrier induced a gag-specific T cell response in S. mansoni-infected and non-infected mice to the same extent [45] .",

            "text": "In light of our failed attempts to rescue the influenza vaccination-induced protection by prime-boost vaccination or mild adjuvants, these combined findings raise the concern that not all vaccine regimens may induce a protective immune response in helminth-infected individuals. As also drug-induced deworming did not restore responsiveness to influenza vaccination in mice, a combination of deworming and improved vaccination regimen might be needed [24] . The accumulated data from the mouse system suggest that especially life carrier-based vaccines might be more functional in helminth-endemic areas. Still, introduction of more potent adjuvants appears to be an option, since a recent study reported that recombinant Pfs230 conjugated to a carrier protein and adjuvanted with Alhydrogel induced comparable Ab titres hat displayed equal transmission inhibiting capacities in the absence and presence of intestinal H. polygyrus infection [46] . In summary our study highlights the importance to test vaccination responses for their ability to protect on the background of pre-existing helminth infection. Here, it will be extremely interesting to analyse the performance of the newly developed mRNA-based SARS--CoV-2 vaccines in helminth-endemic areas as well as in the mouse system. ",

Mice either received a control injection (open symbols) or were i.p. vaccinated with non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine Begripal season 2017/18 (black squares, dark blue circles) or adjuvanted influenza vaccine Fluad season 2017/18 (grey squares, light blue circles) at day 28 post L. sigmodontis infection. All mice were i.n. infected with 1 x 10 3 PFU 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus 2 days later. Influenza virus burden in the lung was quantified day 3 post challenge infection (B) or at indicated time points (C). Shown are combined results out of 2 independent experiments with n \ufffd 4 per group and experiment. (B) Each symbol represents an individual mouse the lines show the mean. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences applying 1-way ANOVA (p > 0.001) with Tukey's multiple comparison test comparing all vaccinated groups with each other. Numbers indicate p-values, ns = not significant, \ufffd p \ufffd 0.05, \ufffd\ufffd p \ufffd 0.01, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd p \ufffd 0.001; black asterisks: na\u00efve control non-adjuvanted vaccine group to na\u00efve control adjuvanted vaccine group, blue asterisks: L. sigmodontis-infected nonadjuvanted and adjuvanted vaccine groups to na\u00efve control non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted vaccine groups, red asterisks: L. sigmodontis-infected non-adjuvanted to L. sigmodontis-infected adjuvanted vaccinated groups. (C) Symbols show the mean per group at the indicated time point, error bars show SD. Asterisk indicated differences between the na\u00efve control adjuvanted vaccine group and the L. sigmodontis-infected adjuvanted vaccine group applying 2-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison test. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266456.g003",
