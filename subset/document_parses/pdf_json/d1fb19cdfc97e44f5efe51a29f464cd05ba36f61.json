            "text": "Rapid screening and early treatment of lung infection are essential for effective control of many epidemics such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 . Recent studies have demonstrated the potential correlation between lung infection and the change of back skin temperature distribution. Based on these findings, we propose to use low-cost, portable and rapid thermal imaging in combination with image-processing algorithms and machine learning analysis for non-invasive and safe detection of pneumonia. The proposed method was tested in 69 subjects (30 normal adults, 11 cases of fever without pneumonia, 19 cases of general pneumonia and 9 cases of COVID-19) where both RGB and thermal images were acquired from the back of each subject. The acquired images were processed automatically in order to extract multiple location and shape features that distinguish normal subjects from pneumonia patients at a high accuracy of 93%. Furthermore, daily assessment of two pneumonia patients by the proposed method accurately predicted the clinical outcomes, coincident with those of laboratory tests. Our pilot study demonstrated the technical feasibility of portable and intelligent thermal imaging for screening and therapeutic assessment of pneumonia. The method can be potentially implemented in under-resourced regions for more effective control of respiratory epidemics.",

Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has imposed a significant burden on the healthcare systems worldwide [5] [6] [7] . Early and rapid detection of respiratory disorders is essential to prevent their further transmission. Commonly used non-invasive imaging techniques for the diagnosis of pneumonia include chest X-ray (CXR) [8] and computed tomography (CT) [9] . While CXR and CT with advanced image processing and artificial intelligent (AI) algorithms are able to detect pneumonia with accuracy and spatial resolution [10] [11] [12] [13] , they pose the potential radiation hazard, especially for babies and pregnant women [14] . Besides, the high cost and the poor portability of these equipment items have prevented their broad applications in under-resourced regions. Therefore, it is important to find a portable, low-cost, safe, non-invasive, and fast tool for pneumonia screening.",

            "text": "Infrared thermal imaging (TI) is a fast, non-invasive, cost-effective, and safe imaging technique that has been widely used in many clinical applications, such as early detection of breast cancer [15] and skin cancer [16] ; assessment of burn depth [17] ; and fever screening at public places during pandemics [18] such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [19] and influenza A pandemic (H1N1) [20] . TI can create a visible image from the invisible infrared radiation emitted from the surface of the human body [21] , which reveals the distribution of the skin temperature. It is known that skin temperature is a significant indicator of illness. Whether generalized or localized, the change in skin temperature is recognized as the presence of diseases [22] . This is because injury [23] , infection [24] , inflammation [25] , or malignancy [26] is associated with localized vasodilation leading to tissue hyperperfusion to the affected area and increased metabolic processes, all which lead to a higher emitted temperature. In a recent study [27] , Wang et al. investigated the diagnostic accuracy of thermal imaging for focal pneumonia with chest X-ray as the gold standard, they found that the skin temperature of the lung mapping area on the back of patients with pneumonia increased significantly, and this temperature difference can be used to assist the diagnosis of pneumonia. Similar results can be found in the other study [28] . Rafael Y. Brzezinski et al. developed a non-invasive and portable thermal imaging tool to detect COVID-19 and lung injury based on the analysis of thermal images of back. Since TI is very sensitive for detecting small changes in the temperature distribution of the skin, which helps to access valuable information regarding the underlying physiological process causing diseases, it is a potentially new screening method to aid detection and monitoring of pneumonia including COVID-19.",

All patients (fever patients and suspicious pneumonia patients) took thermal imaging at their first visit before receiving any specific medical treatment. The final used pneumonia thermal images were selected from the enrolled suspicious patients based on the CT scans and laboratory characteristics results with diagnosis of pneumonia. Eventually, 69 adult subjects, which consist of 12 females aged 19-64 years and 57 males aged 18-80 years, were recruited in the study, and divided into two groups: pneumonia negative group and pneumonia positive group. The pneumonia positive group comprised of 19 cases of general pneumonia aged 59 \u00b1 24 years and 9 cases of COVID-19 aged 59 \u00b1 14 years. The pneumonia negative group included 30 normal adults aged 44 \u00b1 17 years and 11 cases of fever without pneumonia aged 55 \u00b1 16 years. Except age, the height and weight of all subjects were recorded to calculate their body mass index (BMI). As shown in Table 1 , each subject has similar BMI.

The goal of LDA is to transform the pneumonia data onto the low dimensional space, such that the transformed data set is linearly separatable. LDA has the advantages of avoiding over-fitting and low computational cost. QDA (quadratic discriminant analysis) and Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes classifier are the variants of LDA. The difference between three models is the simplification of the covariance matrix. The brief introduction of discriminant analysis is shown below:",

The first setting is a two-classification including normal subjects (n = 30) and pneumonia positive patients (n = 28). All the six machine learning models performed well. For examples, SVM, KNN and Decision tree even achieved a high accuracy more than 90%. However, except pneumonia, fever may also alter the thermal patterns of back from normal by increasing the absolute temperature of the back. Thereby, introducing potential confounding factors to the analysis, the second setting is a two-classification including pneumonia negative patients (n = 41) and pneumonia positive patients (n = 28). Both SVM and Gaussian NB got an accuracy more than 80%. However, the rest models only got an accuracy between 70% and 80%. The last setting is a threeclassification including normal subjects (n = 30), fever patients without pneumonia (n = 11), and pneumonia negative patients (n = 28). Compared to the results from the first and second setting, all six models didn't show good performance in the third setting. Only SVM and Gaussian NB had an accuracy more than 70%. The other methods had an accuracy between 60% to 70%. This is probably because there is no clear boundary for back thermal images between normal person and fever patient. In fact, the temperature change of fever patient is not always reflected on the back thermal images. It may be difficult to differentiate the patients with low-grade fever and normal people. In addition, it is worthwhile to mention that the performance for four-class classification (normal/fever/general pneumonia/Covid-19) is poor. This is because the back thermal images for general pneumonia and Covid-19 have little difference. Overall, SVM had the best performance in the three settings among all six models. Therefore, we used SVM model to monitor the recovery of two pneumonia patients during treatment.",

However, these attempts have demonstrated limited effectiveness. Our innovative approach to extract advanced location and shape features from the thermal image other than absolute body temperature value, could help improve these screening tools and aid in the diagnosis of acute inflammatory changes in deep tissues, such as lung infection. We designed this study to determine if the thermal pattern of the back could be used as a diagnostic marker of pneumonia including The thermal pattern is outlined by the high temperature region whose temperature ranges from T max -1 to T max . As shown in Fig. 3 , significant differences were found between the normal, fever and pneumonia groups for the thermal patterns on the back, indicating its powerful discriminatory capacity to detect pneumonia. Though 1 degree Celsius difference in temperature is remarkable for human bodies, the temperature distribution outside of 1 degree Celsius may also have contribution to differentiating pneumonia. Hence, except the high temperature regions, we also defined a sub-high temperature region (T max -2 to T max -1) to expand the interested temperature region so that a significantly broader range of temperature distribution is considered.",

Therefore, future studies should take these into account and control as much as possible the effect of age and gender factors and the effect of medication on thermal patterns of the back.",

First, the sample size is not very large, and the cases of fever patients without pneumonia and the cases of COVID-19 patients are limited. As a preliminary study, the relatively high accuracy classification results and two typical monitoring results can reveal the feasibility of our method to distinguish pneumonia patients from other subjects and monitor the recovery of pneumonia treatment. However, a lager sample size with other will be needed for further validation of the clinical performance in the future. Secondly, due to the limitation of the cases of COVID-19, we didn't analyze the difference between general pneumonia and COVID-19. So, after increasing the number COVID-19 patients, further analysis will be conducted. Thirdly, the lung and spine areas were marked manually by an experienced respiratory doctor before feature extraction, which may introduce variations. Therefore, in the future, we may use deep learning methods to mark the lung and spine areas automatically.",

In our method, we first used novel image processing algorithms to extract multiple location and shape features of the thermal images automatically and then applied machine learning analysis to achieve good performance on detection of pneumonia. For examples, a high accuracy of 93% in a twoclassification setting including normal subjects (n = 30) and pneumonia positive patients (n = 28), a high accuracy of 86% a in a twoclassification setting including pneumonia negative patients (n = 41) and pneumonia positive patients (n = 28), and a relatively high accuracy of 81% in a three-classification setting including normal subjects (n = 30), fever patients without pneumonia (n = 11), and pneumonia negative patients (n = 28). In addition, the monitoring results of two pneumonia patients by our method during treatment were consistent with their clinical results based on laboratory characteristics. Hence, our proposed method may facilitate the screening of people to detect and monitor pneumonia in real time, especially in low-income regions with limited imaging resources, which can help limit the spread of COVID-19. However, despite the very promissory results of our pilot study, more extensive trials are required to confirm our findings and validate them. Future studies should focus on determining whether the thermal patterns we identified can be used to discriminate between general pneumonia patients and COVID-19 patients.",
