We did not identify any publications that focused on risk of reinfection in seropositive individuals; however, since our systematic search, one study has been published using data from two LTCFs in London, UK. This study reported a 96% reduction in the odds of reinfection in individuals who were seropositive compared with those who were seronegative based at 4-month follow-up in 161 participants. We found ten studies that included seroprevalence surveys of staff or of staff and residents in LTCFs in eight cohorts. Five of these surveys were done in response to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks within the care homes, as part of the subsequent investigation or as post-infection surveillance. The largest of these studies, which enrolled both staff and residents, was done in six LTCFs and included longitudinal antibody testing.",

Our findings suggest that previous infection reduced the risk of reinfection by approximately 85% in residents and 60% in staff members. We identified only 14 cases of possible reinfection, mainly affecting staff, and although almost all of these individuals reported symptoms, none required hospital treatment. These findings suggests that previous SARS-CoV-2 infection provides a high degree of protection against a second infection and is broadly consistent with findings from longitudinal studies 11 in hospital staff. Although staff and residents with antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein at baseline remain susceptible to symptomatic infection, our findings based on up to 10 months of follow-up from primary infection (assuming earliest infections occurred in March, 2020) suggest that their risk of reinfection is low (<1% risk per month). Similar findings were obtained in sensitivity analyses, in which the threshold for detection of IgG to nucleocapsid and time at risk were varied. The low number of reinfections reduced statistical power and restricted strong conclusions about symptom profiles, but the majority of reinfections in both staff and residents were symptomatic. This finding contrasts with studies of hospital staff, in which only a third of reinfected individuals reported symptoms. 11 In our findings, symptoms seemed to be milder in staff (eg, cough) than in residents (eg, fever); however, differential ascertainment of symptoms between staff and residents cannot be excluded. The risk of recall bias is minimised by the fact that LTCFs recorded symptoms in staff and residents prospectively.",

By comparison, more than 80% of samples obtained from PCR testing in LTCFs during the same time period, which will mainly represent primary infections considering the low incidence of reinfection, had Ct values of less than 30, based on a comparable assay. 22 Although it is difficult to compare tests done in different laboratories, these findings provide tentative evidence that reinfections might be associated with lower viral load and reduced risk of transmission compared with primary infections. Ideally, the presence of reinfection would have been confirmed by viral sequencing. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that we mis classified primary infections that remained PCR-positive as reinfections, because most participants had at least 90 days and all had two or more negative PCR tests between their baseline antibody test and PCR-positive test.",

            "text": "We found no difference in quantitative antibody titres against spike or nucleocapsid proteins in reinfected individuals compared with uninfected individuals with baseline antibodies. The low incidence of reinfection makes studies of correlates of protection challenging and highlights the need to standardise the assays that are used to evaluate humoral and cellular immunity to enable the pooling of sample collections and results across cohorts. 16 Since the date of primary infection was unknown for most reinfected cases in our study (due to low levels of PCR testing in LTCFs at the start of the pandemic), it is possible that these cases of reinfection followed from primary infections that occurred at the start of the pandemic or were asymptomatic, associated with low viral load. The reasons why the magnitude of protection against reinfection afforded by baseline antibodies was greater in residents than staff remain unclear. We hypothesise that that symptomatic staff might have accessed PCR testing outside of the LTCF, or that staff had comparatively higher levels of exposure to infection than residents during the analysis period. This higher level of exposure is because staff are likely to have more close contacts in the LTCF setting and also have more interaction with individuals in the community compared with residents. Additionally, residents who were antibody-positive at baseline might represent a particularly robust group, having survived the first wave of the pandemic. One strength of our study is that we estimated the incidence of infection during a period of high community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, associated with the rapid emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant. 21 The low number of reinfections suggest a good level of protective immunity against this variant following natural infection. The local prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be a key . SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody values at the first round of testing (C) and last round of testing, stratified by duration between the last antibody test and last relevant PCR test (D). The last relevant PCR test was defined as the first positive PCR test following antibody testing for reinfected cases and the last negative PCR test for controls. The median duration between the last antibody test and last relevant PCR result (first positive for cases, last negative for controls) was 62 days (28-88) among reinfected cases and 68 days (48-75) among control cases; on the basis of this testing gap, participants were categorised into three categories (0-50 days between tests, 50-75 days, and 75-180 days).

Control Reinfected driver of transmission in LTCFs because staff can import infection from the community. 23, 24 Restricting our analysis to Oct 1, 2020, onwards reduced the duration of person-time at risk to 4 months, although incidence was low in the preceding months. Since most participants already had baseline antibodies on Oct 1, 2020, it is likely that these individuals were mainly infected during the first wave of the pandemic, up to 6 months earlier.",

            "text": "We were able to recruit participants from more than 100 geographically dispersed LTCFs, and although all LTCFs were owned by one provider, LTCFs varied in size and by the type of care provided. Overall, 35% of beds were funded for dementia care, two LTCFs cared exclusively for residents with dementia, and 18 facilities did not provide any dementia care. By capturing variation in these characteristics, which have been shown to be important in SARS-CoV-2 transmission within LTCFs, 25, 26 our results might be generalisable to other LTCFs in England. Although we accounted for LTCF-level differences, such as infection control practices, in our analysis, our results might not be generalisable to providers that operate different funding models, staffing ratios, or infection control practices. Expansion of the VIVALDI study on Nov 9, 2020, to a wider range of care providers should help to address these limitations. Our study was limited by sample size and the quality of surveillance data. 26, 27 Although we were able to link 2895 (65%) of 4470 eligible participants who had antibody testing to their PCR results, the majority of unlinked individuals were staff members. This is largely explained by the fact that most LTCFs do not hold identifiers that are required for data linkage, such as date of birth or address for their staff. Although we were unable to compare the demographic characteristics of linked and unlinked staff, we have no reason to suspect that there were systematic differences between these groups that could introduce bias. We recruited a median of 6\u00b78 residents and 14\u00b73 staff per LTCF, reflecting the challenges of recruiting frail residents who might lack capacity to consent or might be receiving end-of-life care, despite our use of personal or nominated consultees. Although we were not able to account for comorbidity in our analysis, it is likely that almost all residents had at least one underlying health condition, 28 and more than a third of residents were receiving dementia care. During the analysis period, residents (who were tested monthly) had a mean of 1\u00b76 PCR tests per month and staff (who were tested weekly) had a mean of 3\u00b71 PCR tests per month, suggesting high levels of participation in the voluntary testing programme. Less frequent PCR testing in residents and missing test results for staff is likely to lead to underestimation of the incidence of asymptomatic infection in both groups. However, it is likely that the majority of infections from June, 2020, onwards were detected because most participants were tested at least every 4 weeks, and the median duration of PCR positivity is 12-18 days. 29, 30 We classified baseline antibody status against nucleocapsid because data on antibodies to spike protein were only available for a subset of participants, and this might have led to under estimation of the proportion of individuals with previous infection due to antibody waning. To overcome this limitation, we reduced the test index threshold for the immunoassay to 0\u00b78, which has been shown to increase sensitivity with minimal effect on test specificity. 17, 31 There is also a possibility of cross-reaction of antibody assay with antibodies to pre-existing seasonal coronaviruses although validation studies 31 have shown high test specificity.",

However, the high degree of vaccine coverage in residents will make it challenging to investigate protective effectiveness in this group. Additionally, further work is ongoing in this cohort to understand the extent of protection against reinfection offered by cellmediated immunity. 33 In summary, the risk of a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was substantially reduced in staff and residents of LTCFs who were SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive and the observed reinfections were not clinically severe.
