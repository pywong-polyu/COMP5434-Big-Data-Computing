(ii) The second epidemic wave showed a slower pace, but a widespread diffusion in the Country that eventually yielded far worse figures (in terms of fatalities, patients hosted in intensive care units, etc.) than the first wave.

The first and second epidemic waves are analysed and the results are compared at both the national (Section 2.1) and regional (Section 2.2) scales. Some critical indicators for the epidemic, that can be displayed by the dashboard, are analyzed in Section 3. In Section 4 we first recall the SUIHTER model and analyze its interplay with the epiMOX dashboard. In particular, through the dashboard, we validate the model in Section 4.1 against the data of the second wave at the national level. Then, we propose what-if-scenarios for the analysis of alternative NPIs in Section 4.2, we analyze the impact of the UK variant in Section 4.3, and we compare different short term future scenarios in Section 4.4. Conclusions follow in Section 5.",

Finally, we observe an exponential growth starting by the end of February 2021 and due to new virus variants featuring a higher transmission rate (see the discussion in Section 4.3). Although, in this case, the growth rate 4 appears to be lower than previous ones with a corresponding doubling time of approximately 36 days, the fact that this new outbreak is starting from a much larger number (more than half a million) of positive individuals makes the situation at present (early March 2021) extremely critical.",

As shown in Table 1 for most of the compartments (Positives, Daily positives Hospitalized and Hosted in ICUs) there is a 20-days delay between inflection point and the maximum, while this delay is slightly longer (24 days) for the Daily deceased time series. A consistent time lag between inflection point and maximum point (the one corresponding to the peak) can be used as a preliminary indicator in future epidemic waves to predict the day at which the peak will possibly occur. A similar correlation between the peak of the derivative and that of the corresponding time series is missing during the first wave. This is likely due to the severe under-estimation of data collected for some epidemiological compartments and then provided by the DPC.",

The same comparison is carried out in Figure 10 concerning three southern Italian regions (Campania, Sicilia and Sardegna, the latter two being insular) that were very mildly affected by the first wave last Spring 2020. We recall that, in all figures, the upper color bars indicate the non-uniform NPIs. If we focus on the number of Positives per 100,000 inhabitants (Figures 9(a) and 10(a)) that were diagnosed as positive to the virus, we notice that the red regime yields a pronounced decrease of the curves. Both the orange and yellow regimes serve to mitigate the outbreak, without however significantly damp it. This behavior is less evident on the hosted in ICUs compartment (Figures 9(b) and 10(b) ). A possible explanation is that this latter compartment is slightly more \"indifferent\" to the stringency of the NPIs that are being implemented. The hosted in ICUs individuals are at a very large extent elder people who were less directly exposed to outdoor contacts as either they were residents of healthcare facilities or they spent a substantial part of their time at home.

On the one hand, data related to the different compartments may not be available (or they may not even be collected); on the other hand, the resulting data assimilation problem may suffer from limited identifiability of the parameters, as discussed, e.g., in the paper [17] for SIR-like models of COVID-19. A new compartmental model named SUIHTER has been recently introduced in [16] with the goal of facing the first of these two issues, i.e. defining a model best suited for the data actually available. In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, the time series that are daily collected and made available (which have already been described discussing the dashboard for the data analysis) led us to consider for the new model the following compartments: ",

This strategy, even if maintained for a short period, is indeed far more effective than adopting more permissive measures (or even the very same measures) for a much longer duration at a later stage.

Without a prompt intervention the risk of a third epidemic wave that will end up to be worse than the previous two is extremely high. A detailed summary of the evolution of the NPIs introduced at the regional level has been collected on this webpage https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestione_della_pandemia_ di_COVID-19_in_Italia As mentioned in Section 4 and discussed in details in [16] , the SUIHTER model can be calibrated using a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach for a robust estimate of the parameters. For each parameter considered in the calibration, the MCMC calibration starts from a prior, in our case a uniform distribution around an initial guess computed by minimizing with a least-square minimization procedure the difference between data and model results, and provides its posterior probability density function.",

Several analyses were carried out by means of the dashboard. A careful comparison between the first two epidemic waves (the one of Spring 2020, and the one that took off in Fall 2020) is made. Finally, we have reported results, mainly concerning predictions, obtained by using the novel epidemiological differential mathematical model SUIHTER.
