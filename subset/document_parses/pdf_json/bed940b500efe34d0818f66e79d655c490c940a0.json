Whereas most of the infected persons recover, even young and unpredictably, healthy subjects may be succumbed to the illness (4). These observations have raised the question of how the variation in COVID-19 disease severity could be explained by genetic susceptibility. The genetic factors might be related to highest extreme transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the observed progression of the disease in a considerable proportional of the diseased population; so far, these factors are mostly undetermined. Extensive genetic studies in various populations from different geographic origins have exhibited considerable genetic disparity in protein-coding areas, with broadly variable allelic' frequencies (5) .",

Since there is considerable variation in disease behavior among COVID-19 infected patients; a multifactorial analysis may identify the possible risk factors that is involved in development and progression of COVID-19 infection.

(35) that these SNPs are directly pathogenic. The latter also suggest that sex may have a role in the pathogenicity of the TMPRSS2 SNPs, citing differences in gene responses to androgens, so being linked to sex polymorphism-specific effects, as TMPRSS2 is expressed in androgen-sensitive tissues, and to some extent, the weakly significant effect of sex on disease severity in our study may reflect this proposition. The current results showed a significant association of the TMPRSS2 rs12329760 (CT + TT) SNP with increased inflammatory marker CRP, and ferritin, LDH and D-Dimer. Iwata-Yoshikawa et al. (36) used a murine TMPRSS2 knock-out to speculate that the molecule (and by implication, its genotype variants) has a role in inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV.
