Additionally, most available research on empathy is on medical trainee cohorts. We set out to study the impact of empathy and communication training on practicing clinicians' self-reported empathy and whether it can be sustained over six months. An immersive curriculum was designed to teach empathy and communication skills, which entailed experiential learning with simulated encounters and didactics on the foundational elements of communication. Self-reported Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) was scored before and at two points (1-4 weeks and 6 months) after the training. Overall, clinicians' mean self-empathy scores increased following the workshop and were sustained at six months. Specifically, the perspective taking domain of the empathy scale, which relates to cognitive empathy, showed the most responsiveness to educational interventions. Our analysis shows that a structured and immersive training curriculum centered on building communication and empathy skills has the potential to positively impact clinician empathy and sustain self-reported empathy scores among practicing clinicians.",

Empathetic communication has been shown to correlate with greater diagnostic accuracy. 5 An empathetic clinician is able to more readily elicit pertinent information and relevant psychosocial concerns from patients. 6, 7 Additionally, empathy enables a clinician to relate with patients and better understand their needs. 8 Tailored communication that meets patients' where they are at, empowers them to participate in decision-making. 9 ,10 These positive effects of clinical empathy translate into improvements in patient satisfaction, patient empowerment, and adherence with proposed treatment plans. 11, 12 Evidence suggests that having empathy is a positive predictor of clinical competence in medical trainees. 13, 14 Empathy in clinicians is also perceived as a mark of competence by their patients. 15 Not surprisingly, empathy is considered to be a major element of professionalism in medicine 16 and an important attribute of the humanistic physician. 17 In addition to the myriad of direct patient benefits that clinician empathy provides, the ability to form meaningful connections, being attuned to a patient's emotions, and empathize with them are some of the core elements that contribute to professional satisfaction as well. A growing body of the literature supports the idea that empathetic clinicians experience fewer burnout symptoms. 18 Recent studies suggest that over half of physicians in the United States show evidence of burnout, 19 bringing it to a crisis level even prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, promoting and sustaining empathy among healthcare providers is more important than ever.",

It includes a combination of simulated patient actor encounters based on the VitalTalk TM framework, as well as didactic lectures. VitalTalk TM is a nonprofit company which grew from NIH-funded research on the development of courses to improve communications skills among clinicians. 33 The didactics in our workshop included short, interactive lectures on listening, delivering information, impact of verbal and nonverbal communication, neurobiology of emotion, and the concept of empathy as a learned skill. This curriculum was designed by two hospital medicine physicians in a large Midwestern healthcare system and offered to the system clinicians two to three times per year. Course availability was advertised via email and department meetings. Participation in the course was free of charge and voluntary; however, no protected time was offered for attendance. The interactive sessions were designed for a maximum of six participants with professional actors playing the role of patients or family members in one of four case scenarios. The actors embodied fully developed characters with an in-depth back story and strong emotions but were not given a script. These simulations created challenging and emotionally charged clinical situations that required the application of empathetic communication skills to navigate them. Every learner in the group participated in a faculty-moderated encounter with the patient or family member. Since these encounters required clinicians to \"perform\" in front of their peers, deliberate care was taken to create psychological safety, where participants could be vulnerable while navigating these challenging scenarios and trying out new skills. In each group of six, one engaged in the encounter, the other five observed, ensuring active engagement and learning for all. Each encounter included a debrief consisting of positive feedback from the peers as well as the participants' selfreflection. A repeat attempt was offered after the debrief to practice and consolidate the skills. Each learner engaged in two scenarios during the two (morning and afternoon) sessions.",

Developed by Hojat et al., 34 it has been translated into 56 languages and used in more than 80 countries. It is considered to be a standard empathy scale in a medical context. 35 The JSE is a 20-item instrument answered on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree). Half of the items are positively worded and directly scored, and the other half are negatively worded and scored in reverse. Each question on the JSE gauges one of three domains: perspective taking, compassionate care, and standing/walking in the patient's shoes. Three versions of the JSE are available; we used the version targeted to practicing health professionals.",

Institutional review board approval was received prior to the study. Upon enrollment in the course, research staff screened the participants for inclusion/exclusion criteria. To be included, clinicians had to be an MD, NP, PA-C, MBBS, or DO; have scheduled rotation at the hospital where data collection was conducted; and consent to be in the study. A research intern contacted participants and collected the survey. Due to budget constraints, this intern was only able to contact clinicians at one of the hospitals in the health system. Participants received baseline surveys, including a demographic questionnaire and the initial JSE, 1-4 weeks prior to the CRAVE course. They repeated the JSE at 1-4 weeks and again 6 months after the course. All clinicians who met inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Twenty clinicians who enrolled in the course consented to participate in the study, completed the preworkshop survey, and attended the course. Sixteen clinicians completed the presurveys and at least one postcourse survey (either 4 weeks or at 6 months). Fourteen providers completed all three, the preand postcourse survey plus an additional postcourse survey at 6 months.

A clinician's empathy within patient care context is predominantly cognitive rather than affective. Cognitive empathy involves understanding rather than feeling with patients (their suffering, pain or other emotions) and most importantly, combines it with the capacity to communicate this understanding with the intention to help. 34, 35 Our exploratory analysis showed that the perspective taking domain, i.e., cognitive empathy, arguably the most important for clinicians, is most susceptible to training and can be improved in clinicians. Research consistently supports the concept that individuals with a greater cognitive role-taking capacity or higher dispositional empathic concern can communicate better than those with lower capacity. 36 There are few studies with focused curricula that have explored the perspective taking domain of clinician empathy. 37, 38 Emotion and cognition are integral to relational skills and making connections. While the components of empathy (affective, cognitive, and behavioral) are deemed independent, they are also deeply interwoven. Too much affective empathy (feeling others' pain) can lead to compassion fatigue and burnout. It is often advised to regulate this component of empathy. Our curriculum, through experiential learning, showed promise to improve participants' capacity of perspective taking and gain understanding of others subjective experiences.",

Practicing clinicians can become \"set in their ways.\" Once out of training, work stressors and time demands can further erode a sense of service, humility and lifelong learning. This can lead to clinician-patient relations becoming more transactional in nature, with less interpersonal connection that may increase burnout. These same time demands, whether personal or professional, can also make it difficult to create time space for learning. A single day training is more feasible and time-efficient than trainings which involve multiple day commitments and touch-points. A thoughtful, immersive and experiential training like ours, tailored to the clinical practice and delivered in a single day may enhance and sustain empathy over time. This study also supports the idea of continuous learning of empathy skills for clinicians throughout their careers. These trainings might act as empathy skill building \"gyms\", often invigorating a sense of purpose and renewed sense of connection. These connections with patients are often a source of joy in our work lives.",

Data collection was limited to providers who practice at a single hospital within one care system, although providers from other sites within this care system did attend the training. We were forced to halt data collection in March 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which further winnowed the participants. Data was self-reported and does not take into account the patient's perception of provider's empathy and communication. The designed empathy curriculum, although based on widely available concepts of teaching empathy was specific and tailored, so it is possible generalizability may be limited.
