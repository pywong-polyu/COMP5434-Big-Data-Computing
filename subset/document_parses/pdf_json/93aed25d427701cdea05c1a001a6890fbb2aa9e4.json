Universal healthcare worker (HCW) testing is potentially useful in ameliorating workforce depletion and reducing asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can diagnose only current or recent infection; testing for antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 could enhance the ability to expedite reinstatement of services, while ensuring patient and staff safety. Tests are now available for immunoglobulin (Ig) G against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein; the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA is reported to have high specificity We previously reported that 32% of HCW testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab were asymptomatic at the time. 2 Symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive adults have similar viral loads and infectious virus isolation. 3 Our finding that both of these groups developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is reassuring.",

Between May 15-28, 2020, 190 HCW who had previously had a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Informed consent included acknowledgement that a positive result should not be considered an 'immunity certificate'. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in 41 (22%) HCWs, including all 25 [19 (76%) symptomatic, 6 (24%) asymptomatic] previously testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR. At the same time, 16/165 (10%) HCWs who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab, of whom 2 (12.5%) had reported COVID-19-like symptoms, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG.
