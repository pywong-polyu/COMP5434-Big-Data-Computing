While bedside manner remains a key competency incorporated into medical school curricula, \"webside manner,\" or professional standards for virtual care, remains less defined. Recent Findings Best practices exist including guidance prior to the visit, methods to maintain a professional background environment, and translation of core communication competencies for a video interaction. Through application of these practices, a provider can ensure the core interpersonal and communication competencies are fulfilled. These practices have direct application to allergy, asthma, and immunology care.

This article provides best practices to assure the same standards of privacy, empathy, and cultural competency are met. adoption still exist. There is still a perception on the part of both patients and clinicians that a physical examination cannot be completed virtually. However, general appearance, skin, extremity, musculoskeletal, neurologic, psychiatric, and portions of HEENT, respiratory, abdominal, and cardiovascular examination can be completed effectively [5] . The use of commercially available peripheral devices (stethoscope, otoscope, blood pressure cuff) allows for an even more complete evaluation. The examination, however, requires active patient participation, more so than is required in an office setting. It is important to instruct patients, professionally and respectfully, to participate in the patient-assisted exam. This requires comfort with technology on the part of the clinician, as well a modest ability to troubleshoot challenges, such as frame of the video image, adjustment of lighting, and angle of the camera. A show-and-tell approach, demonstrating what the patient will need to do, is helpful for patients and can support relationship and rapport building. A physical exam may or may not be required for an allergy visit. For example, a history of accidental ingestions and other allergy history are the key pieces of information required for a patient coming in for a food allergy follow-up and renewal of an epinephrine autoinjector. For a patient with chronic urticaria, a skin exam can be completed either by video or through photo uploads.",

            "text": "Another barrier to long-term implementation of virtual care relates to workflow. Much of a clinician's practice is set up to be delivered in a brick and mortar setting. Therefore, attention needs to be paid to the workflow changes that are needed in order to support visits when the patient and/or the clinician are not physically in the office. This also requires expectation setting for staff members, so that, when a virtual visit is offered, it is done so confidently to reassure patients that the quality of care will not be compromised. Clear expectations also assist staff in understanding which visits require in-person care (e.g., skin testing, PFTs) and which can be conducted virtually (anything that is not procedure based). It may be helpful to adopt the approach that virtual care is part of the standard of care -there is not a \"wrong time\" for a clinician and patient to look one another in the eye, share information about a health condition, provide advice, and make recommendations on next steps. While it is true that sometimes patients show up to the wrong site of care, such as the office when they need an emergency room or vice versa, there is still value in interacting with the patient, triaging them, and educating them on symptom monitoring and about their overall condition. Adopting a virtual-forward approach can help avoid confusion when staff is booking appointments for patients.

Setting expectations regarding cost sharing/copays and how these will be collected should be addressed with patients in advance of the visit. It is also important to keep up to date with telemedicine reimbursement policies for commercial payors, Medicare, and Medicaid. State licensure requirements are another barrier to virtual care adoption. During the public health emergencies, many states waived state licensure requirements. However, as a sense of normalcy returns, clinicians should consider applying for neighboring state licenses to assure that out-of-state patients can still benefit from virtual visits.",

            "text": "Lastly, there may be concerns regarding health equity. Clinicians should acknowledge that there may be assumptions, based in fact or not, that can influence which patients are offered virtual visits. While there was a perception that virtual care is an offering mainly for younger, tech-savvy patients, we now know that even geriatric patients are satisfied with virtual visits [6, 7] . Based on an August 2020 survey, 72% of older adults said that they would be interested in scheduling a telemedicine appointment with their provider. Out of the older adult population that did have a telemedicine visit during the pandemic, 91% reported high satisfaction and ease in connecting with their doctor [7] . That said, attention needs to be paid to individuals not as comfortable using a smartphone or computer and those requiring special accommodations due to hearing or visual impairment. It can be helpful in these scenarios to also engage a family member or caregiver in advance of and during the visit. Ultimately, by empowering providers to offer video visits through defined workflows and accessible technology offerings, clinicians can recommend the best method of care delivery and remove the onus from the patient to choose which service is more appropriate.",

Their limited access -relative to their less poor, non-ethnic minority counterparts -could perpetuate if not exacerbate racial and ethnic health disparities. These locations also tend to be rural with limited access to clinicians. For these populations, partnering with communities and schools to offer virtual visits may be a useful option.

Avoid areas where people may be walking in the background, as this would convey to the patient that the area is not private. Some clinicians place a meaningful item in the background, such as a picture, sculpture, or book, that can sometimes spark conversation with the patient.

This highlights the perceived importance of the clinician-patient relationship in virtual care.

This involves making eye contact with the patient by looking directly into the camera and having appropriate facial expressions. It is important to note that a camera and lighting can exaggerate facial expressions, so this should be considered.

Patients may require coaching throughout the visit to assist with the physical exam. For example, the provider may wish to explain the physical exam in piecemeal format allowing the patient to follow the directions step by step. In doing this, the provider can ensure a higher quality exam and place the patient -especially one who is experiencing virtual care for the first time -at ease. Much like an in-person visit, helping a patient understand their condition and symptoms leads to better outcomes and improved quality of care. This includes stating a review of what was done, the findings of the examination, treatment plan, and next steps. Allocating a portion of the visit for the patient to ask questions can be a valuable way to ensure understanding of the agreed-upon treatment plan while also providing an opportunity for the patient to voice any lingering concerns. It can be off putting to patients to \"hang up\" or \"end\" the visit, so the shared decision-making, follow-up, treatment plans, and next steps need to be actively communicated, as well as anything the patient can expect to receive at the conclusion of the visit, such as a care plan through a patient portal or notice of a follow-up appointment, for example.",

Additionally, video visits allow for an easy connection to caregivers, friends, and family members who may want to participate in the conversation. Most video visit platforms allow for at least 4 participants in a call. This is particularly useful in older patients who may not have loved ones nearby. Additionally, video conferencing can be utilized to bring in other care team members, such as PCPs, case managers, pharmacists, therapists, or other specialists who may be involved in the patient's care.

            "text": "Telehealth provides unique opportunities for delivery of allergyimmunology care. For example, a video tour of the pantry allows for individually tailored food avoidance education. Allergistsimmunologists can \"co-read\" ingredient labels with their patients, using the food items that they commonly eat. This approach also provides an opportunity to engage family members who might otherwise not be able to attend an in-person clinic visit in a discussion about interpreting food ingredient labels. The telehealth format also allows for a joint trip to the grocery store, which would provide another opportunity to co-read ingredient labels and discuss assessing risks of foods in bulk containers or in buffets, tailored to the patient's specific food allergies. For parents of children with food allergies, allergists-immunologists can more concretely discuss strategies for storing and tagging foods in their kitchen to minimize the risk of accidental ingestion. Allergists-immunologists can help parents identify areas of the pantry or kitchen that are not reachable by smaller children for storage of unsafe foods and develop approaches to tagging foods -for example, with colored stickers -to indicate safe and unsafe foods that work best in the patient's own home. Such offerings could be billed used existing procedure codes. However, opportunities exist to advocate for broader counseling codes that relate more directly to offerings available through telehealth. For patients with allergic rhinitis or asthma, a view into the home can reveal sources of allergen and pollutant exposure that are not easily obtained with an environmental history. For example, a direct view of a child's bed can reveal many stuffed animals or many bedding components (blankets, comforters, etc.) that would all need washing to reduce dust mite allergen exposure. A home telehealth visit also facilitates medication reconciliation. Patients with asthma often have multiple inhalers that they have saved as they have transitioned from one controller medication to another. Directly visualizing those medications with the patient and walking through how the patient is using each inhaler can be very informative. Because patients do not commonly bring their medications to an in-person clinic visit, a home telehealth visit provides an opportunity to get a more accurate medication history and to provide patient education with their medications on hand. A home medication reconciliation may also reveal that the spacer is lost or is cracked and needs to be replaced.",

A thoughtful discussion with the patient prior to the telehealth home visit can give the patient an opportunity to consider the potential benefits and prepare for the visit. The above telehealth strategies for allergic disorders have not been well studied. For example, there have been no studies that have systematically assessed patient preference and satisfaction with telehealth home visits, whether for food allergy or asthma or allergies. Whether some of the above approaches are more effective at improving patient knowledge or allergic disease outcomes than in-person visits is unclear. However, there are decades of experience conducting in-person home visits for asthma, illustrating that many patients find them valuable. These home visits have been conducted mostly among children living in poverty, so this experience may not apply to other populations. Understanding the patient preferences along with the effectiveness of these approaches is particularly important given the recent explosion of telehealth. Moreover, even though the digital divide has been shrinking, it persists and clinicians risk perpetuating, if not exacerbating, disparities in allergic disorders if deliberate steps are not taken to measure and address inequities in telehealth access.",
