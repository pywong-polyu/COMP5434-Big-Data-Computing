In the Pisa Teaching Hospital, the organizational structure, including the establishment of COVID designated wards, and patient management protocols were modified to address the clinical needs of the patients, as well as the concern for the protection of healthcare workers from infection by SARS-CoV-2 [3] . However, Tuscany hospital services were already facing a challenge represented by the diffusion of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO), especially New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (NDM-CRE) [4, 5] . This issue was addressed by linking the already existing HCAI surveillance system with the epidemic surveillance protocols for COVID-19.
