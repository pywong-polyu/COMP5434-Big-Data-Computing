Methods: Patients who were .17 years and scheduled for reconstructive surgery for limb lengthening or angular deformity with internal and/or external fixation and healthy control subjects were prospectively enrolled. Patients completed the LD-SRS preoperatively. Mechanical axis deviation (MAD) and leg length discrepancy (LLD) were recorded preoperatively. Participants were stratified into five groups based on their diagnosis. ANOVA was used to test for associations between LD-SRS scores and diagnosis as well as mechanical axis deviation. Results: Patients with LLD, angular deformity, or combined LLD and angular deformity reported significantly worse scores than control subjects in LD-SRS Function/Activity, Pain, Self-Image/Appearance, and total score (P , 0.001 for all). Patients with short stature reported significantly worse LD-SRS Self-Image/Appearance (P , 0.001) and total score compared with control subjects (P = 0.015). There was a significant correlation between LLD and LD-SRS Self-Image/Appearance in the LLD and angular deformity group (r = 20.359, P = 0.043). Discussion: Although LD-SRS scores were worse in patients with limb deformity compared to controls, LD-SRS scores were not related to the degree of deformity in most patients, indicating that patient selfperception may be a construct unrelated to objective radiographic or clinical findings.",

However, with recent advances in angular deformity correction and limb lengthening, surgical intervention can result in improved patient-reported and clinical outcomes. 6, 9 One important indication for surgical intervention in lower limb deformity is its effect on the patient's quality of life. To assess this effect, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are often used. To be useful and valid in the clinical setting, PROMs need to be multidimensional, addressing physical health and subjective perceptions of the patients. 10 A modified version of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) outcome measure, the Limb Deformity Modified SRS (LD-SRS), is currently the only limb deformity-specific patient-reported outcome measure, which was designed to capture patient perceptions of their physical function, pain, mental health, and self-image. 11 However, differences between patients with different types and degrees of lower limb deformities using the LD-SRS have not yet been established.",

Although these patients did not display the functional limitations or pain that other patients with lower limb deformity reported, patients with short stature reported low self-image related to their lower limbs, similar to that of patients with LLD or angular deformity. Previous studies have shown that short stature can have a notable effect on psychosocial health. 5 Limb lengthening complications are not uncommon, 12 but many patients report higher self-esteem and overall satisfaction after the procedure. 13, 14 It is important to determine a patient's perspective when considering surgical intervention for short stature. In addition, the LD-SRS was able to detect this difference in self-image between patients with short stature and control subjects, whereas the other PROMIS domains were not.

In addition, some patient groups had few participants, so some analyses may have been underpowered. Although this does not weaken the positive findings of this study, drawing conclusions using non-significant associations should be made with caution. In addition, several PROMIS forms were incomplete for the included participants, reducing the sample size for PROMIS analyses and therefore weakening conclusions related to PROMIS scores. Another limitation was the lack of an additional self-image or appearance-related scale with which to compare the LD-SRS scores. However, no applicable self-image domain currently exists for PROMIS. 18, 19 In addition, patients were not categorized by underlying diagnosis or number of deformities. These factors might have an effect on self-perception as well. Future prospective studies with more participants should study how these diagnoses affect self-perception. Finally, the investigators selected a small convenience sample of healthy control subjects because of hospital COVID-19 restrictions on research. These control subjects may have had different demographic characteristics than the study population, which may have introduced bias of unclear clinical relevance.

This study further validates the LD-SRS as an objective and quantitative measure of patient perception and quality of life in patients with lower limb deformity. Radiographic measurements of degree/severity of deformity were not related to LD-SRS scores on average, indicating that patient self-perception may be unrelated to objective radiographic or clinical findings.",
