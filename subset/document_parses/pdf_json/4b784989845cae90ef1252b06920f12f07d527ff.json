Simple mathematical modelling is used in the context of a single, relatively closed workplace such as a factory or back-office where, in normal operation, each worker has lengthy interactions with a fixed set of colleagues. A discrete-time SEIR model on a fixed interaction graph is simulated with parameters that are motivated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK during a postpeak phase, including a small risk of viral infection from outside the working environment. Two kinds of worker are assumed, transparents who regularly test, share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as a contact tests positive for the disease, and opaques who do none of these. Moreover, the simulations are constructed as a 'playable model' in which the transparency level, disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be varied by the user. The model is also analysed in the continuum limit. All simulations point to the double benefit of transparency in both maximizing productivity and minimizing overall infection rates. Based on these findings, public policy implications are discussed for how to incentivise this mutually beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace, and simple recommendations are made.",

            "text": "The most important features of any public health campaign built around testing, contact tracing and isolation is the degree of compliance in the general population, which can vary with the method used [6] . Evidence presented to Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour (SPI-B) as part of the advice offered to the UK Government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) indicated a shortlist of factors that might help to promote compliance with and, adherence to, all behaviours that minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These apply equally to compliance with testing and contact tracing. Factors included messaging that increased perceptions of risk, clear communications from Government identifying what behaviours the public should adopt, encouraging support from the community so creating social norms for infection-limiting behaviours and importantly, actions making it as easy as possible for people testing positive to isolate [7] [8] [9] . Recent studies have indicated, however, that other factors may undermine compliance with contact tracing. Perceived lack of data security and privacy, together with lack of trust in government, were found to be the main barriers to adoption [10] . Even in relatively compliant populations, contact tracing may not be sufficient to control the spread of the virus. For example, the study [11] considered the effectiveness of two different methods of contact tracing within a closed, and generally compliant population, namely the participants at a scientific conference on epidemic modelling. One approach was based on reported contacts, as recorded in a log book, the other based on the use of unobtrusive wearable proximity sensors. While both methods were highly tolerated, it was found that neither on its own was able to give a full picture of meaningful contacts that might have caused an infection to spread. It is clear that other methods are needed to control the spread of the virus in addition to contact tracing.",

We imagine a risk assessment is to be made within a specific workplace on whether and how the workplace can be made 'safe' to reopen following lockdown. Here we use the term safe to refer to the public health of the whole of society, to avoid the workplace contributing to a resurgence of the virus in the general population. Nevertheless, the employees, who are the agents in our model, also benefit from safety, but it is assumed that the individual mortality and morbidity rates are sufficiently low that the pay-off to the individual is small. In addition, stakeholders who benefit from the output of workplace will want the workplace to be productive as possible. Such stakeholders include general actors who benefit from the upturn in economy, the owners or shareholders of the business in question, and the workers themselves in terms of security of employment.",

Such actions would clearly compromise safety, and are thus negative to society as a whole. This might be couched in terms of the classical Prisoner's Dilemma problem within game theory. That is, if every workplace took this attitude, then clearly resurgence within the general population would be probable, whereas one or two isolated 'bad apple' employers might be able to benefit by maximizing their personal productivity, provided that others do not.",

The specific motivation for their study was disease among farm animals where the disincentive to the farmer of complying with safety might be particularly harsh, such as the slaughter of their entire herd. They found that a sharp phase transition occurs from sub-critical R values to super-critical, for a relatively small amount of compliance. Their findings are echoed by those of Eksin et al [13] in a stochastic network simulation of epidemics. The latter also conclude that 'a little empathy goes a long way', meaning that a focus on treating and isolating those infected can be more advantageous than an approach that seeks to protect the healthy.

The participants were split into four teams to discuss different natures of the person-to-person interactions that happen in different working environments; brief versus lengthy, and with a closed set of colleagues versus with an open set of clients.

An example of such a working environment might be a back office, which is split into teams that are physically co-located with a number of middle managers and service personnel who naturally migrate between several teams. Another example might be a factory where individual job functions are well demarcated and a typical worker would only need to interact with a relatively small subset of other workers as part of their normal duties.

Moreover, we assume a routine contact tracing system is in place which requires contacts of those testing positive to self-isolate. We suppose that there is nonetheless a risk of infection outside of the workplace. We wish to explore the question of the effect within our chosen workplace of measures designed to stop any incoming infection spreading to the entire workforce. In particular, we shall look at the effect of the presence of a proportion of opaque workers, who are not transparent about their infection-risk status, and do not go home when made aware that one of their colleagues has the virus. Such opacity may be interpreted as a form of presenteeism, where workers continue to go to work despite possible infection or symptoms. Is there an incentive for the employers and employees alike to engage fully in transparency? That is, is it valuable to engage with test, trace and isolate procedures in order to halt virus spread while also maximizing productivity?",

In line with what is known about COVID-19, in fact, we choose a modified variant in which there are two infectious states; A for (A)symptomatic infectious individuals and U for infectious symptomatic, or (U)nwell. We suppose that susceptible individuals can become exposed in one of two ways, either through a (small) probability of exposure to the virus present in the general population, or with a much larger probability if one or more of their connected co-workers is infectious. For simplicity, we shall suppose that the rate of exposure outside of the workspace is constant, irrespective of each worker's personal circumstances. For the purposes of the simulation, it will also be useful to consider a sixth disease state, (Q)uarantined, to represent those who are obliged to be in quarantine post infection. Note that the Q state is only a small subset of those who are isolating at home (figure 1), which also includes other disease states. Figure 1 .

We tested this in preliminary simulations with synthetic small-world-type networks comprised of local bubbles with one or two long-range connections to other bubbles and found that the transmission rate to be remarkably similar to a random network with the same average degree.

The difference now is that, with N = 100 and \u03b1 = 0.001, approximately every 10 days a new infected individual is likely to enter the workplace. Data that are exactly analogous to those in the cold case are presented in figures 7-10. It is worth commenting on the different time-course dynamics in figure 7 than figure 3 . In the case of a completely transparent workforce (left-hand panels) note how the infection does not die out for the case of running hot. This is because approximately every 10 days a new infection enters the workplace. Thus the number of sick individuals (about three for d = 4 and about seven for d = 10) remains constant as does the number of workers at home (about eight and 20, respectively) throughout the simulation. Note that the number who are sick at any one time is roughly d times the number who would be expected to be sick if there was no contact within the workplace. For either 50% or 100% opacity, in the case of low degree (upper middle and right panels), the running hot case causes the infection to last much longer in the workplace, with a much wider peak than the running cold case.

In reality, if contact tracing is being conducted throughout the general population, such a scenario is likely to lead to the workplace being identified as a hotbed of infection, leading to the 'factory' being forced to shut down, negative publicity for the employer and possible prosecution. Also, recall that the 'factory' scenario unrealistically ignores the loss of productivity due to sick workers. Recalling the 'n'-shaped nature of the productivity deficit versus opacity curve, especially in the case of running cold (figure 6), it would seem that an optimal strategy to maximize productivity, even in the 'factory' case, would be again to maximize transparency within the workforce.",

They suggest that to be effective, a workplace campaign would need to: create a collective viewpoint emphasizing how people can look after each other; ensure messages concerning changes to behaviour come from trustworthy and credible sources; and ensure that whatever employers and employees have the capability, opportunity and motivation for what they are being required to do.",

Recent evidence review suggests that key to adherence to quarantine are clear understanding of the disease and quarantine procedures, social norms and perceived benefits of quarantine, perceived risk of the disease and practical problems such as maintaining supplies and financial consequences of being out of work [31] . In light of this, government advisory bodies have issued guidance to encourage quarantining that includes emphasizing civic duty, advertising the changing social norms and allowing others in the community to express disapproval and stressing the value of the organization, in this case, the employing organization.",

Other studies have suggested work should take place in fixed 'bubbles' that do not interact with each other. For most operations, strict bubbles are not feasible. Instead, our results show that the necessary degree of transparency (the rigour to which test, trace and isolate is required) is directly proportional to the size of the average workplace interaction network. The no detriment principle. We recommend workplaces engender a culture where there is no perceived detriment to a worker being transparent. One issue can be a workplace where there are a lot of self-employed or 'gig economy' workers who only get paid when they are present. Mechanisms need to be established so that all workers are fully remunerated if they are required to self-isolated and penalized if they are found to be at work while infectious. One such policy intervention could be the introduction of governmental statutory sick pay for all workers irrespective of their contractual status, from day 1 of self-isolation. The benefit of mutualism. As described above, we need to ensure that workplace campaigns to encourage transparency are effective. A sense of shared ownership in maintaining an infection-free workplace would need to be inculcated through a sense of collective efficacy. This might involve an employee/employer partnership that runs its own workplace test, trace and isolate system. This may be more effective than a scheme administered by an outside authority where there is the potential for lack of trust, for example over data privacy. Financial and other disincentives for non-compliant workplaces. For some businesses, there may be a temptation for the employer to seek short-term profit over long-term benefit. If infection rates are low in the general population, there may be unscrupulous or ignorant employers who try to keep everyone in work. We saw this in our models for the 'factory' scenario, in which theoretical maximal productivity could be achieved with no transparency whatsoever. It should be the function of a health and safety inspectorate to provide large penalties to deter such behaviour which would clearly not be in the public good.",

We recommend that individual employers should be encouraged to run a playable version of the mathematical model we have introduced in order to test the safety and feasibility of their operation.
