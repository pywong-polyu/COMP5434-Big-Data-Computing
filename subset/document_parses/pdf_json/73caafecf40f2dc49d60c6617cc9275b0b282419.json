As of early February 2022, close to 400 million confirmed cases and almost 6 million deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported globally [2] . It is now clear that COVID-19 may become an endemic disease [3] . One key reason is the rate of natural viral evolution that is probably too high to permit the extinction of existing viral variants by antiviral treatments before new variants arise [4] . Consequently, existing treatments may have to be regularly redesigned to ensure their ability to optimally interact with and suppress new variants with mutations that reduce efficacy. This issue has recently been highlighted by the Omicron variant which is more infectious than the prior Delta variant and therefore more difficult to eradicate [5] . In addition, this variant contains a new constellation of mutations that reduces efficacy of at least some current treatments [6, 7] .",

This issue is now of more importance than ever because the omicron variant appears to be particularly infectious in younger populations [9] . While adolescents generally experience milder symptoms, the lingering sequelae of long COVID can be devastating to their health and development [10] . To this date, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are the only widely used vaccines for adolescents and children and these approvals have come only recently [11] . As a result, there remains a lag between vaccination rates in younger people versus adults and this can be a critical gap in COVID-19 transmission control. For example, as of February 2022 in the US, only 56.9% of adolescents aged 12-17 are fully vaccinated compared to 74.6% of adults [12] . Similarly in Europe, 80% of adults are fully vaccinated compared to 70.9% of adolescents aged 15-17 and 35.5% of 10-14 years olds [13] . Therefore, the need to address adolescent vaccination is especially crucial in developing and less-developed countries to address vaccine inequality and disrupt virus transmission.",

The participants were intramuscularly administered in the deltoid region with two doses of either MVC-COV1901 or placebo (saline) on Day 1 For safety analysis, vital signs were assessed before and after each injection. Participants were observed for at least 30 minutes after each injection to identify any immediate adverse events. All participants who received at least one of the two doses of MVC-COV19 scheduled for Day 1 and Day 29 were evaluated for safety up to Day 119 (Visit 8) by assessing the following endpoints: solicited local adverse events (AEs) (up to 7 days after each dose of study intervention), solicited systemic AEs (up to 7 days after each dose of study intervention), unsolicited AEs (up to 28 days after each dose of study intervention), AEs of special interest (AESI), vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Solicited AEs were defined as AEs which occurred within 7 days after each dose of study intervention, including local events: pain/tenderness, erythema/redness, and induration/swelling; systemic events: fever, malaise/fatigue, myalgia, headache, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Unsolicited AEs are defined as any untoward medical events other than solicited AEs which occurred within 28 days after each dose of study intervention. The intensities of solicited and unsolicited AEs were graded using grading scales modified from the US FDA Guidance for Industry [16] .",

            "text": "A consistent picture emerged where immunogenicity was as robust in the adolescent age group as in the larger phase 2 trial. Essentially, the primary study endpoints of live virus neutralizing titers and seroconversion rates were non-inferior when compared with data from the phase 2 trial for young adults (Table S4) . Similarly, the secondary endpoints of live virus neutralizing antibody titers and anti-spike IgG titers increased at least two orders of magnitude compared to placebo at 28 days after second dose (Table S5) . As antibody titers diminish over time, the availability of full results up to Day 209 will be useful in gauging the degree of waning immunity in adolescents, as compared to our phase 1 extension results with three doses of MVC-COV1901 in adults, which tracked antibody decay up to Day 209 prior to administration of third dose as booster [19] . We have previously performed a post-hoc analysis of the phase 2 clinical trial and found a negative association between increasing antibody titers and decreasing age [20] . Thus, unsurprisingly, the adolescent group developed greater neutralizing antibody and IgG titers than that of the young adult group (Tables 2). Several studies of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in the adolescents and children were completed and contributed to their approval for use in younger population in the US and Europe. Moderna mRNA-1273 was non-inferior in terms of GMT ratio and seroconversion in the adolescents aged 12 to 17 years versus young adults aged 18 to 25 years, and had an efficacy of 93.3% according to the US CDC definition of COVID-19 with an onset of 14 days after the second dose [21] . In another study with mRNA-1273, two doses of mRNA-1273 invoked neutralization responses against Omicron variant pseudovirus that resulted in numerically superior GMT values in adolescents and children compared to adults [22] . BNT162b2 also demonstrated a higher immune response in the 12 to 15 year old adolescents than in adults and had an observed efficacy of 100% according to the definition of COVID-19 cases with an onset of 7 or more days after the second dose [23] . In all, these external results and our results not only clearly showed that COVID-19 vaccines are suitable for adolescents and children, but that they also generate higher immune responses than in the adults. Thus, the use of vaccines in the young population should help to stop this critical chain of transmission.",
