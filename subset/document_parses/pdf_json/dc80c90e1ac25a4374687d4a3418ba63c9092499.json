The leadership needed to professionalize to manage the growth. Business executives were called into the upper leadership to help with financial oversight and to correlate doctrine, teachings, and the leadership structure-streamlining the religion to help it function like a highly efficient corporation 2 (see the chapters by Garcia and Prince for additional discussion of the corporatization of the LDS Church over time). The LDS Church organization has certainly proven nimble, flexible, collaborative, and socially responsible in dealing with various natural crises in modern times, exemplified by its response to the current global coronavirus pandemic as detailed in Evan's chapter.",

While the finances of the LDS Church remain opaque and it requires whistle blowers and leaks to discern the wealth and investments of the religion, 5 it is clear that the LDS Church is on sound financial footing and has sufficient wealth to sustain it for decades to come, as Evans and Moffat and Woods argue in their respective chapters in this volume.",

            "text": "As the luster of American greatness has waned in the early twenty-first century, economic development has leveled off, and secularization has accelerated in all of the developed world and much of the still developing world, 6 the LDS Church is arguably in the middle of a pivot in its focus. Managing rapid growth seems to be less of a priority; preventing the hemorrhaging of members is increasingly a serious concern. Academics, minorities, and Indigenous communities around the world have called into question the ethics of globalization, colonial practices, and cultural destruction by hegemonic superpowers, science, corporations, and religions. Additionally, of the 195 countries in existence in 2020, 30 have legalized same-sex marriage 7 and attitudes have shifted in a more accepting direction toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals in most of those 30 countries. 8 Awareness and a growing acceptance of transgender individuals is spreading in the developed world, though there is still a long road ahead for the normalization of transgender individuals. 9 Countries are now ranked on gender inequality by the United Nations, 10 raising numerous concerns about the patriarchal structures and doctrines of the LDS Church in the twenty-first century. 11 Millions of people are also leaving religions, growing increasingly disillusioned with antiquated and discriminatory values and practices, with doctrines and beliefs that are no longer credible in the light of modern science and scholarship, and with ecclesiastical dishonesty and abuse. 12 In the twenty-first century, the leadership of the LDS Church has demonstrated interest in addressing criticisms for its lack of multiculturalism, its continued exclusion of sexual and gender minorities, and its inability to retain members and declining growth rates in the face of secularization. Throughout this volume, the various chapters have touched on each of these challenges facing Mormonism generally and the LDS Church specifically. In this concluding chapter, I summarize these challenges and problems the now globalized LDS Church faces in the twenty-first century.",

For any religion that expands beyond its initial cultural group, questions about how to accommodate different cultures will arise. A clear illustration of this question comes from Acts in the New Testament (see Chaps. 10 and 15) , when the early apostles of Jesus, who were all Jews, wrestled with the question of whether Gentiles could become Christians. They had to decide questions like: do Gentiles have to follow kosher laws? And do Gentiles have to get circumcised? The social structure of the LDS Church has made it difficult for the leadership to understand and embrace multiculturalism.

The First Presidency is made up of individuals selected from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which means the highest level of leadership in the LDS Church is made up exclusively of Apostles. The selection process used by apostles to select new apostles isn't perfectly clear, but, by examining those who are selected, it seems highly likely that selection is based on some or all of the following criteria: demonstrated past dedication to the religion (e.g., having served in local and regional leadership positions), demonstrated leadership ability, and some degree of expertise in one's profession. 13 Structurally, what these requirements necessarily result in is the selection of older male individuals as they have to have experience both within the LDS Church and within the world at large. Because of the implicit selection criteria, the odds of a 20-yearold (or even anyone under about 50 years of age) being selected as an apostle are very low. And because the highest leadership positions at every level in the LDS Church are all reserved for men, women are excluded. As a result of the hierarchy's relatively rigid albeit informal practice for deciding who will become an apostle, the highest levels of leadership of the LDS Church-The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles-are virtually guaranteed to be made up of older males (a problematic outcome also addressed by Stewart in his chapter on LDS growth dynamics). That, of course, is the case as of early 2020. The average age of the apostles (counting both the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve) is 76. The two most recently selected apostles, Ulisses Soares and Gerrit Gong, who were sustained in 2018, were 59 and 64 at the time of their ordination, respectively.",

If selection of apostles was intended to represent the cultural makeup of the religion, with more than half of the membership outside the US, there should be substantial diversity among the apostles-some from Europe, some from Asia, some from Latin America, and some from states other than Utah. But, structurally, apostle selection is a top-down process and not a bottom-up process; it is not a democratic election and there is no way for a lay member of the religion to nominate worthy candidates to become apostles. Selection is based on formal and informal social network ties. 14 Basically, this comes down to who the existing apostles know. A somewhat simplified illustration of this is to examine where the current apostles were born. Of the 15 apostles in early 2020, 13 of the 15 were born in the US; ten were born in Utah. Given the current characteristics of apostles, it is clear that the method for selection draws upon social ties rather than proportionate representation. Given what we know about human social ordering, 15 it is not surprising that existing apostles tend to select apostles who are a lot like themselves.",

Two thirds of them were born in Utah and just two apostles (13 percent) were born outside the US (Soares in Brazil; Uchtdorf in Czech Republic). The selection process for apostles-which is a manifestation of the social structure of the religionleads to a shared culture, a monoculture, within the highest echelons of the Church. LDS general authorities generally share the same beliefs, values, norms, and behaviors. Perhaps the selection of two apostles who are not from the US and one apostle who is a racial minority (Gong is Asian American) will start to open up the possibility of broadening the monoculture among ecclesiastical leaders. But, at present, top LDS Church leadership appears to struggle with the idea that there might be more than one way to be a righteous Mormon in good standing with the Church.",

            "text": "The various chapters in this volume illustrate the lack of multiculturalism in the leadership of the LDS Church. McDannell's chapter shows these challenges quite well, noting that Mormons around the world have generally not been allowed to write their own hymns (a point also addressed by Stewart in his growth dynamics chapter) but, instead, have been forced to sing translated versions of hymns that were written almost exclusively by Mormons of European descent (Allen and \u00d6stman note in their chapters there is an initiative to change this that began in 2019). In other words, there is no Ghanaian Mormon hymn book filled with songs that reflect Ghanaian melodies or perspectives on Mormon doctrines or values. There is, as of early 2020, only a Ghanaian translation of the universal Mormon hymn book; Ghanaian Mormons sing songs that reflect the values of white Mormons from the US. McDannell argues quite compellingly that the leadership of the LDS Church has pursued a path of \"universalism\" over multiculturalism, suggesting that the vision of what it means to be a good Mormon held by the apostles is true for all people of every culture around the world. McDannell illustrates that the leadership of the religion in the nineteenth century held similar views, attributing the declining rates of growth of the religion in Europe not to encouraging converts to migrate to Utah but rather to the idea that they had \"harvested\" all of the worthy people in Europe, which retrospectively reads as an implicit condemnation and thoughtless insult to all those who remained in Europe.",

With the rapid influx of mostly European migrants to the body of the Saints (in both Nauvoo and then in Utah), there was widespread intermingling of cultures, languages, and ideas. At the time, Mormonism was widely rejected in the US and was considered un-American, often being grouped with Islam and not considered Christian, in part because of the hierarchical structure of the religion and its embrace of polygamy (see Bennion's chapter on Mormon fundamentalism). 16 However, with the discontinuation of polygamist practice at the end of the nineteenth century and the eventual adoption and enforcement of specific behavioral practices during the twentieth century (e.g., no drinking alcohol, no swearing, encouraging conservative family values, etc.), the LDS Church came to be seen as quintessentially American. 17 In many respects, it reflected the values and mores of twentieth century America. And, in many respects, it continues to do so in the religion's efforts to spread internationally. Just as the US government has and continues to push American values throughout the world both explicitly through military and economic means and more subtly through the export of US media, 18 the LDS Church is similarly exporting conservative, white, middle-class American values by encouraging Mormons around the world to worship and behave in essentially the same way Mormons in Utah do (Cooper and Hernandez de Olarte and Stewart discuss this at length in their chapters in this volume). Men and women are encouraged to groom and dress themselves the same way in Fiji as they are in New Guinea, South Africa, South Korea, Russia, and Ecuador, and that blueprint was drawn and packaged in Salt Lake City, Utah.",

That housing was then replaced by upscale housing sold on the open market. Similar projects have been completed near the Salt Lake City and Ogden temples, as church leaders wanted the immediate areas surrounding the temples to reflect the middle-class values they espouse. 19 In the process, intentionally or not, the message LDS Church leadership is sending is that gospel culture embodies white American middle-class values.",

Van Beek et al. illustrate how the failure of LDS Church leaders in the US to understand that \"religious freedom\" is understood very differently in Europe than it is among conservative Christian groups in the US led to serious problems in obtaining visas for missionaries, a problem that could easily have been avoided by consulting with local members. Halford and O'Brien similarly illustrate that LDS Church leaders' dismissal of the long and serious conflict between England and the Republic of Ireland has resulted in a single administrative unit overseeing both locations and similar missionary policies being employed, policies that are more attuned to England than they are to Ireland.",

Members were discouraged from wearing traditional dress to religious services and instead had to wear the Mormon \"uniform\" that, again, reflects white middle-class American and corporate values-conservative dresses for women and a white shirt and tie for men. LDS leaders frowned on Scandinavian members celebrating cultural traditions that were linked with Lutheran Christianity, which worked to further marginalize Scandinavian members. As Allen and \u00d6stman argue, many of these cultural conflicts could be addressed by Utah Church authorities simply listening to the members and local leaders around the world rather than dictating to them what must happen. Rainock and Takagi frame these cultural conflicts as an issue of \"religious capital,\" arguing that the substantial amount of religious capital required to adopt Mormonism comes at considerable cost in Japan, a country with a very different set of cultural norms, values, and beliefs when compared to white, middle-class, tee-totaling Mormons in Utah.",

Thomas Murphy's chapter on Indigenous Mormons in the US provides keen insights into how this happens and how it is manifest. Some Indigenous American Mormons have syncretized the doctrines and values of the LDS Church. As Murphy summarizes, some Indigenous Mormons tell completely different religious origin stories that counter the colonial narrative offered by Joseph Smith Jr., which remains the standard narrative today-that Native Americans are the \"fallen\" descendants of righteous believers who must be saved by white Europeans and brought back into Christ's fold. For these Indigenous groups, Joseph Smith Jr. inverted the \"true\" narrative-it is not the Europeans who have come to save Indigenous populations but rather Europeans who have corrupted Indigenous teachings and have then tried to force those corrupted ideas onto Indigenous populations. Native American ancestors always had \"true\" religion and they perceive similarities between the pure and authentic religion of their ancestors and Mormonism, but also see Mormonism as having been corrupted, rejecting the narrative of LDS Church leadership. Barber describes similar instances of syncretism among the Ma\u014dri who, rather than discontinue their traditional religious practices, have adapted them to accommodate Mormonism. It is unlikely the current leadership of the LDS Church will embrace alternative cosmologies and rituals that differ as radically as those of the Indigenous Americans and the Ma\u014dri do from LDS colonial narratives, which is why multiculturalism will continue to be a challenge for the LDS Church.",

            "text": "In addition to wrestling with how to adjust Mormonism to cultures around the world, the LDS Church continues to struggle with its racist past and present. The monoculturalism of the Church makes it extremely difficult for both leaders and members to see how a policy change and a denial that the LDS Church taught racist doctrine for close to a century are not enough to help Black members feel like they are part of the religion. As noted in the chapters by Barber, Garcia, Kline, Martins, Williams, and Stevenson, the LDS Church changed its policy on Black members in 1978, allowing them to fully participate in the religion at that time. Martins and Stevenson both argue that this change was heavily motivated by international expansion and growth-primarily in Brazil and Africa-and not motivated by a desire to accommodate Black individuals in the US. Barber's discussion of Australian aboriginals and some Polynesians illustrates the complexity of the 1978 policy change. Until 1964, Australian aboriginals were considered \"black\" by LDS Church leaders, and, as a result, were discouraged from joining the LDS Church. But LDS Church leaders changed their mind in 1964 and Australian aboriginals were suddenly no longer considered \"black.\" As is widely understood today, this arbitrary declassification of a people of color-Australian aborigines-as not being Black demonstrates that race is a social construction, not a meaningful biological distinction, that is used to discriminate. 20 That LDS leaders could arbitrarily classify and declassify groups as being \"black\" illustrates how race is an instrument of prejudice. 21 While some may argue that the 1978 policy change ended racial discrimination in the LDS Church, multiple chapters in this volume indicate that that is not the case. Garcia reports repeated instances of discrimination in wards throughout the US, as does Williams. This has also been shown in other research on the LDS Church. 22 Kline makes it clear that, even though the women who were interviewed in South Africa didn't focus on racial discrimination, many noticed that none of the apostles or First Presidency were people of color (when the interviews took place, that was the case). The clearest illustration of the consequences of monoculturalism among the LDS Church's leadership is Williams' chapter. Much of her chapter focuses on the Black Legacy Conference that takes place annually in Washington, D.C. While the conference provides an opportunity for Black Mormons to gather and support each other, the origins of that conference are informative. It was not organized by the LDS Church. It was organized by frustrated Black members and was allowed to proceed by leaders of the LDS Church, similar to the Genesis Group in Utah. In other words, on issues of race, LDS leaders don't seem to know how to move forward. They certainly want to distance themselves from the explicitly racist past, but the lack of racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity among the general authorities of the religion means that they are following discussions of race, not leading them. As Williams argues, this is a clear example of structural racism.",

For many Ghanaian and Nigerian members, part of the appeal of the LDS Church is that it reflects middle-class American values (an argument similar to that made by van Beek et al. for Europeans in the twentieth century). Converts to Mormonism in Africa may adopt-wholly or in part-\"gospel culture\" and assimilate to white, American, middle-class values, but that may be what they want.

As he details, the original foray of what was then the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (RLDS) into the Philippines took place under leaders who jettisoned most of the beliefs and practices that made the RLDS distinct. These leaders had embraced indigenization to such an extent that the early converts in the Philippines were told that they didn't have to change any of their beliefs or practices in order to be members of the religion. More recent leaders in the Philippines have realized that this approach has its own problems and have moved the members and congregations of the Community of Christ in the Philippines toward closer alignment with the Community of Christ in the US while still retaining some of the cultural adaptations that have made the religion work. Howlett's chapter suggests that unfettered indigenization and multiculturalism is probably not the answer to the LDS Church's problem with multiculturalism (Rainock and Takagi make a similar argument in their chapter).

In order for the LDS Church to be fully egalitarian, women (and all other gender identities as well as non-heterosexual individuals) would need to have the ability to serve in and hold all of the same positions in the religion as do heterosexual men. 23 That would include every position from prophet and apostle to Aaronic Priesthood holder. As of spring 2020, women cannot hold all of the same positions as do men in the LDS Church; it's priesthood organization is explicitly patriarchal, and not egalitarian. As several of the chapters in this volume make clear (see the chapters by Kline and Ross and Finnegan, in particular), arguments that men and women (ignoring other genders and sexes for a moment) are \"separate but equal,\" or \"different but equal,\" or \"complementary in their equality\" in the LDS Church are disingenuous. A simple test of this would be to replace \"women\" in these comparisons with other groups. Would the LDS Church be egalitarian if Argentinians could not hold all the same positions as Americans? Or if redhaired Saints couldn't hold all the same positions as members of the religion with blonde hair? And what if Black men could not hold all the same positions as white men? In all of these scenarios, no one would, as of 2020, claim that the religion is \"separate but equal.\" These would be clear illustrations of discrimination and inequality. Yet, ecclesiastical leaders euphemistically continue to claim that there is no inequality between men and women in the LDS Church because men and women have \"complementary\" roles. 24 Patriarchy in the LDS Church clearly exists, but it should also not be overstated. It is the case that the teachings and policies of the LDS Church strongly discourage spousal abuse and, in practice, many Mormons hold views toward gender equality that align with those of their surrounding culture. As noted above, because the leadership of the LDS Church is largely monocultural and that culture is a reflection of middle-class, white American (albeit conservative) values, explicit suggestions that men and women are not equal and that women should be subservient to men have diminished substantially over time. As a result, in some cultures where spousal abuse and more severe inequality between men and women exist, the LDS Church can seem relatively progressive when it comes to gender equality (see the chapters by Kline, Garcia, Cooper and Hernandez de Olarte, and Moffatt and Woods).",

This may seem surprising, but recent research on gender and religion suggests that women who are members of conservative religions are strongly supportive of sexist policies. 27 Some women find validation of their desire to stay home and raise children inside conservative religions. 28 Some women are empowered within conservative religions as they are still given a fair amount of control and responsibility. 29 An alternative perspective on why women in conservative religions defend their subordination derives from system justification theory. From this perspective, Mormon women internalize their inferiority and then defend their subordination more vocally than do men in order to align their selfperception with the system of inequality in which they find themselves. 30 Regardless of the explanation, research suggests that many Mormon women justify and defend the patriarchal structure of the religion and even go so far as to claim that the LDS Church is egalitarian, in spite of their institutionally subordinate positions.",

            "text": "Equality between men and women is a major issue within the LDS Church, but it is just one component of the gender, sex, and sexuality complex. At a very foundational level, the leaders of the LDS Church continue to confuse and conflate gender, sex, and sexual identity. Scientists distinguish between all of these. Sex is primarily biological and refers to the physical makeup of one's body. Does an individual have exclusively male organs and genitalia, exclusively female organs and genitalia, or a combination of the two? In the first case, they would be categorized as male, in the second, female, and in the third, intersex. There have been times and places historically where intersex individuals were accepted and not forced into a sex binary. 32 In much of the Western world, accepting the possibility that intersex individuals do not have to be forced to undergo surgeries as early as possible to force them into a specific sex is a relatively recent change in medical policy and practice. Thus, there are at least three sexes-male, female, and intersex 33 and which sex someone is assigned to is, at least to some degree, a decision made by medical authorities. 34 Gender is different and is related to social behavior: how does someone present themselves? To a large extent, gender is an act or something we dowe portray ourselves in a very specific way to tell other people who we are. 35 Of course, how one does their gender is tied to cultural norms, which means wearing skirts in one culture may be masculine or feminine (e.g., Scottish kilts) while it may be exclusively feminine in other cultures. In many cultures, gender is still primarily limited to masculine and feminine acts, creating a gender binary that has often been forced onto a sex binary. In other words, those with male genitalia and sex organs are expected to act in masculine ways; those with female genitalia and organs are expected to act in feminine ways. However, as of the late twentieth century in most of the developed world, it became clear that \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" were social constructs-humans invented these categories and forced actions and behaviors onto them. Once humans become aware of the fact that we created something, it gives us the power to change it. As a result, understandings of gender have changed. There is no reason that gender has to be limited to just two broad categories-masculine and feminine. There are now hundreds of gender identities, including genderqueer, agender, queen, bigender, gender variant, and so on. Some scholars have suggested that a new way to classify gender is to divide individuals into two groups (which, ironically, runs counter to queer theory, but is still a useful intellectual exercise): cisgender and transgender individuals. 36 Cisgender individuals are those whose biological sex and (chosen) gender identity align in traditional masculine/feminine ways. Transgender individuals are those whose biological sex and chosen gender identity do not align in traditional masculine/feminine ways; for example, FtM (female to male), MtF (male to female), agender, or gender fluid individuals, among many others. 37 Finally, sexual identity refers to whom someone is sexually attracted. People can be attracted primarily to those who are unlike them as regards biological sex (i.e., heterosexual), those like them (i.e., homosexual), both (i.e., bisexual), neither (i.e., asexual), or it may shift over time (e.g., sexually fluid). Thus, to understand gender, sex, and sexual identity, it's necessary to understand that gender is not sex, sex is not sexual identity, and sexual identity is not gender. These may all be related, but they are also different concepts.",

            "text": "There are a number of issues with this language in light of modern understandings of gender, sex, and sexuality. To begin with, the passage continues to conflate sex and gender. In some sense, it is beginning to distinguish between these by recognizing that people can \"socially\" transition to a different gender, but the passage also claims that surgery is used to change someone to the \"opposite gender\" from their \"birth sex.\" This language choice is intriguing. Implicit in this passage is the assertion that people simply have a sex at birth, not that sex at birth is assigned, which it is. 38 That sex is assigned means it is more complex than a simple binary classification. The language also includes \"opposite,\" which implies a binary. Additionally, the passage assumes that a \"sex reassignment\" surgery transitions someone's gender but not their sex. In other words, \"sex\" is innate, while gender can be transitioned. This understanding does not align with modern understandings of sex and gender. Transgender individuals-whether they transition or simply reject gender norms-do not \"feel\" as though their sex has stayed the same. The very idea behind a sex or gender reassignment or confirmation surgery is to help transgender individuals to align their sex with their gender identity. The LDS Church Handbook is drawing this distinction because the Handbook later uses \"sex at birth\" as the exclusive means of classifying individuals, as this passage from the Handbook suggests, Gender is an essential characteristic of Heavenly Father's plan of happiness. The intended meaning of gender in the family proclamation is biological sex at birth. Some people experience feelings of incongruence between their biological sex and their gender identity. As a result, they may identify as transgender. The Church does not take a position on the causes of people identifying themselves as transgender. Most Church participation and some priesthood ordinances are gender neutral. Transgender persons may be baptized and confirmed as outlined in 38.2.3.14. They may also partake of the sacrament and receive priesthood blessings. However, priesthood ordination and temple ordinances are received according to birth sex.",

Thus, an intersex individual who was classified by a doctor as female at birth who later transitions to a masculine gender identity and then gets surgery to align their genitalia more closely with their identity must, per the 2020 LDS Church Handbook, always be treated as a female because a doctor classified them as such when they were first born.",

Current LDS doctrine on gender, sex, and sexuality is a doctrine of erasure for all those who do not fall neatly into a heterosexual cisgender binary.",

As norms, values, and laws toward LGBTQ+ individuals change in the US and around the world, as more and more children raised in the LDS Church identify as LGBTQ+, and more and more members of the religion come into contact with and become more accepting of LGBTQ+ individuals, the LDS Church will continue to be pressured to change.",

Both multiculturalism and gender and sexual equality are important manifestations of and contributors to secularization.

            "text": "While the US is often described as quite religious when compared to other highly developed countries, that characterization is increasingly inaccurate. Scholars knew in the early 1990s that people in the US over-stated their religious attendance; only around 20 percent of Americans attend religious services on a roughly weekly basis. 46 With the end of the Cold War, during which the US was pushed toward developing a religious identity to counter godless communism, 47 the percentage of Americans who identify as having no religious affiliation has increased rapidly. 48 As of 2020, nonreligious Americans make up somewhere between 24 and 28 percent of the US population, a larger share than any single religious denomination. Belief in God remains relatively high, with just over 50 percent saying they know God exists, but just under 50 percent either reject the existence of God/gods, don't believe God's existence can be determined, believe in a higher power, or are unsure. Collectively, there has been a decline in religious behavior, religious belonging, and religious belief in the US, which has resulted in a more vocal albeit declining conservative religious minority. 49 The US is somewhat behind other developed countries in its path toward secularization. More than 50 percent of the British now report no religious affiliation. 50 More than 30 percent of the French are atheists. 51 And religious attendance throughout Scandinavia and Northern Europe is in the single digits. 52 Similar declines have been observed in other highly developed countries outside of Europe (e.g., Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, etc.). The evidence supporting a decline in interest in or \"demand\" for religion as societies develop economically is now quite robust. 53 The LDS Church did experience a period of rapid expansion and growth following the end of WWII and running through the late 1990s. Much of that growth took place in countries that were experiencing rapid economic development. As prior research has established, the LDS Church grows most rapidly in countries that are developing, but that growth slows dramatically in countries that are highly developed. 54 Both Martinich and Stewart, in their chapters in this volume, illustrate this same pattern and show that the LDS Church is basically stagnant in highly developed countries. Rainock and Takagi compellingly illustrate that the only reason why the LDS Church is not actually experiencing a decline in overall members in Japan is because of its active missionary efforts that are recruiting enough people to offset the losses to secularization. van Beek et al. also conclude that the LDS Church is stagnant in The Netherlands and Belgium with virtually no growth and no prospects for growth. Likewise, Allen and \u00d6stman assert that the prospects for future growth of the LDS Church in the Nordic countries are very poor. Stewart argues that the prospects for LDS growth in Eastern Europe and Russia are also limited. All of these chapters indicate that the LDS Church has no answer for secularization; once countries have secularized, the LDS Church is forced to fight a rear-guard action, fending off decline and collapse.",

            "text": "What challenges, then, do the LDS Church and other Mormon groups face as a result of secularization? More and more people will likely question why they \"need\" religion. Most of the growth of the nonreligious (i.e., those with no religious affiliation) in the US, Canada, and many other highly developed countries is still due to people leaving religions, 55 though the percentage being raised nonreligious is increasing as well. 56 There are clear differences in religiosity between generations, suggesting that it is in the transmission of religion from parents to children that a lot of secularization takes place. 57 The LDS Church is facing this challenge as well. Already in the 1980s it was clear that those who left the LDS Church were particularly likely to become nonreligious, 58 a finding confirmed more recently as well. 59 Recent changes in LDS practices suggest that the leaders of the religion are trying to slow the losses of young people, who are the most likely to leave religion altogether. Reducing the age at which young men and women can serve missions removes or reduces the amount of time between high school graduation and entering the mission field when many of these young people would have attended college and had greater autonomy. Many people take advantage of their greater autonomy during emerging adulthood to leave their parents' religion. 60 Organizing wards for young adults is also a tactic the LDS Church has employed to attempt to minimize losses. By encouraging young people to marry quickly, they minimize the risk that young Mormons will have pre-marital sex or choose to cohabit, both of which are associated with a higher likelihood of leaving religion, not because these individuals have \"sinned\" but because these individuals reject the moral condemnation of traditional and increasingly anachronistic teachings regarding chastity and moral purity. 61 Encouraging marriage at a young age also increases in-group social network ties, which make it more difficult to leave. 62 Since the LDS Church does not report the number of people who have resigned their membership or have been excommunicated on an annual basis and also does not report activity levels (though numerous chapters in this volume have provided this information; see, e.g., Cooper and Hernandez de Olarte's chapter on Mexico), it is difficult to know just how big of a challenge this is for the LDS Church and other Mormon religions (e.g., Community of Christ or the FLDS Church). Even so, given prevailing trends in highly developed countries around the world, losses of young people is a major challenge facing Mormon religions and the LDS Church in the early twenty-first century around the world.",

The concordance between claimed membership and census numbers varies substantially, from a low of about 20 percent to a high of around 60 percent.

This approach reflects the top-down, hierarchical nature of the religion; the LDS Church continues to insist that it has the authority to determine who is and is not a member. Yet, the low levels of self-identified affiliation reflected in censuses illustrate just the opposite-individual people control their religious identity, not religious organizations.

Despite efforts to stem the losses of young people, there is direct and indirect evidence that this is occurring. Young people are finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile prejudicial teachings and discriminatory practices-like those of the LDS Church toward LGBTQ individuals and women-and fail to see the relevance of Mormonism for their lives in the modern world. As Knoll and Reiss illustrate in their chapter in this volume, younger generations of members of the LDS Church are less likely to accept and follow the teachings of their faith tradition.

While missionaries may recruit the occasional new member, the backbone of the religion in these locations are multi-generational families who have been members of the religion for decades and provide the core leadership (see especially chapters by van Beek et al., Rainock and Takagi, Allen and \u00d6stman, and Howlett) . In describing these families, many of the authors note that, while there are participation costs to these families like there are for all those involved with Mormonism where it is peculiar, some of those participation costs are offset by the social status these families receive within the smaller community of the LDS Church. In other words, in the \"big pond\" of broader society, these families are unlikely to be unique; they are \"little fish.\" But in the \"little pond\" that is the LDS Church community in that specific location, these families are the \"big fish.\" Future qualitative research should examine to what extent status within Mormon wards, stakes, branches, or districts functions as an incentive to remain an active Mormon in the face of secularization.",

But an equally plausible explanation is that members no longer wanted to dedicate three hours of their weekend to religion and it made it challenging to invite non-members to attend services when the invitation required a three hour commitment. Changes to temple practices have also occurred in recent years, reducing some of the explicit patriarchy in the ceremony. 68 These changes were likely the result of agitation among members for greater gender equality.

If we ignore human psychology and use strict logic, the cheaper generic brand should have greater appeal because it is largely the same scent as the others but much cheaper. But humans are not always rational. Most of us would rather purchase the more expensive items, such as the more costly perfume (or clothes or car or house) because we believe that items that are more costly come with greater benefits. 76 But we are also restricted by how much money we have. As a result, people may want the most expensive perfume/ cologne, but they will settle for the medium-priced, name brand perfume/ cologne and not buy the generic one. We convince ourselves that there is greater value in products that cost more, whether that is true or not. 77 Of course, there is another option as well-many people may simply conclude that perfume/cologne isn't necessary at all.",

            "text": "There is reason to believe that the same psychology applies to religions. Religions with close ties to governments, like those in England and Northern Europe should, based strictly on reason and logic, be wildly popular. Their values align with those of most of the population and, for many of them, they receive indirect and direct financial benefits from their respective governments. They are, to continue the example above, generic religions. Yet, attendance and involvement with the established or state-sponsored (or formerly statesponsored) religions in those countries has declined to almost negligible numbers-fewer than ten percent of people in most of those countries attend religious services on a regular basis 78 and the fastest growing types of ceremonies and rituals for celebrating life events (e.g., weddings and funerals) are secular or Humanist. 79 While a simplistic comparison, these established and (formerly) state-sponsored religions are like generic perfume-there is minimal cost to membership and, therefore, very limited appeal. For those who are attracted to religion, they would rather adhere to a more costly religion because they believe it is more likely to be worth the cost (i.e., time, money, loss of social status and friendships, etc.). 80 However, the highest cost religions-those that require complete exclusion, self-flagellation, unusual sexual practices, donations of all of one's wealth to the religion, and so on-are simply too costly for most people. 81 Thus, for many who want religion, the option on which they settle is the medium cost religion. Such religions come with some cost; often the members of such religions feel marginalized by mainstream society, leading to stronger in-group identity. 82 Of course, large percentages of people are opting out of religion altogether, which, in the face of secularization, is an increasingly attractive option. 83 Thus, if we consider religion to be a simplified marketplace, we could argue there are four options: low cost generic religion, medium cost branded religion, extremely high cost exclusive religions, and no religion at all. Assuming people have the freedom to choose their religion (an assumption that does not hold around the world), those who are interested in religion are most likely to choose the medium cost religions as they believe they offer greater rewards than low cost religions and they can afford the costs.",

Progressive critics of the religion want the religion to give ciswomen and transgender individuals the priesthood and open up all offices in the religion to ciswomen and transgender individuals. Likewise, they want the religion to fully accept and embrace LGBTQ+ individuals with no restrictions on membership. They also want the religion to adjust the policies, practices, and doctrines to accommodate varied cultural practices around the world and to embrace cultural relativity. Finally, they also want laxer requirements for full membership, including allowing people who reject specific practices and doctrines or emphasize others (e.g., worshiping a Heavenly Mother) to be allowed full membership in the religion, from being able to say prayers in sacrament meetings to participating in temple ceremonies. In other words, progressive Mormons and critics of the religion want the LDS Church to move toward prevailing social norms, perhaps not realizing in the process that the religion will become a non-controversial, generic religion with limited appeal to religionists.",

For others, suggesting that homosexuality may have a biological component and therefore warrants sympathy was too controversial to accept. Many are aware of the thousands of polygamist Mormons in the Intermountain West who view the LDS Church's discontinuation of polygamy and embrace of monogamy as a capitulation to prevailing social norms, as detailed by Bennion in this volume. For many of these individuals, the decline in prophecy, the perceived milquetoast doctrinal innovation, and the growing corporatism of the LDS Church suggest that the religion is accommodating modern society too much.

If they fail to assimilate at all, the religion becomes too costly for those who live in the world and have to be part of it as well, which is likely the majority of the active membership. As I have argued elsewhere, 84 the LDS Church will continue to move in a progressive direction, albeit slowly and in a punctuated fashion. Every time the LDS Church accommodates a prevailing social norm-allowing women to say prayers at general conference, granting that homosexuality likely has a biological component, allowing Blacks to hold the priesthood-these are accommodations that cannot be undone. A counterfactual here will illustrate the point: imagine how members and non-members alike would respond if the LDS Church leadership announced they were rescinding the policy change allowing Blacks to hold the priesthood. The result would be apocalyptic for the religion. Only white supremacists would continue to embrace such a high cost, radical religion.

Women will eventually be ordained to the priesthood and positions in the religion will be opened up to all sexes and genders.
