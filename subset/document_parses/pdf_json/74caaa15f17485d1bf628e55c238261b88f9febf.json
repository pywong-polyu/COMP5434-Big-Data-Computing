            "text": "Rupture of an aneurysm is the leading cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) which results in accumulation of blood between the arachnoid and pia mater, consequently increasing intracranial pressure. This often results in life threatening conditions like herniation or clinical presentations including focal neurological deficits. In children, these events, although rare, have significant implications. Pediatric SAH is associated with better outcomes in the hospital setting and may even be prevented proactively by the recognition of potential risk factors. Specifically, better recognition of genetic predispositions, metastatic lesions, and infectious causes of aneurysms is important to understand their growth and prevent hemorrhagic events. This review highlights the causes of pediatric SAH, reviews the models of current understanding of this etiology, and discusses the current treatment schema to provide a succinct summary and highlight gaps in current knowledge. This may lead to future investigations aimed at further improving prevention strategies, patient care, and patient outcomes.",

In an event of SAH, blood vessels in the brain can become irritated and damaged by the breakdown of blood products (including oxyhemoglobin) leading them to constrict which limits intracerebral blood flow [15, 58, 62] . This could lead to stroke and further exacerbation of the existing injury. Potential consequences of the bleeding include lifelong brain damage, paralysis, or coma in severe circumstances. Given these implications of pSAH, the need for understanding the causation and to plan the management of these events is vital for improved patient outcomes.",

When they occur, high pressure arterial blood does not flow into capillaries and tissue but instead, directly into the thin-walled venous structures. These venous structures become damaged due to the high flow and pressure, leading to aneurysm and rupture. Intracranial hemorrhage is the presenting clinical manifestation in 75-80% of pediatric patients with AVMs and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality [53] . In a study by Zheng et al., 70 .9% of their cohort of 127 children with AVMs presented with hemorrhage, and size and deep venous drainage were found to be independently associated with hemorrhage risk [74] .",

The bacterial source for IIAs is most commonly Staphylococcus aureus, but they can also be caused by fungal or viral infection [17, 37] . Blood and CSF cultures show the causative organism in about 2/3 of patients. The typical locations include the distal small arteries, the skull base, and cavernous sinus. The clinical presentation is varied but generally presents after severe intracranial hemorrhage and carries a 60-90% mortality when bacterial, while fungal infections are even more lethal [ [17, 37, 46] ]. IIAs are typically friable and thin walled, with a resultant high rupture tendency, however, even without rupture, IIAs are associated with a mortality of up to 30% [17] . Unlike other sources of aneurysm, in which size is a predictive factor in likelihood for rupture, size is not predictive of rupture for IIAs. Small IIAs rupture at high rates while larger ones tend to produce symptoms through mass effect [17] .",

            "text": "Although, AVM or neoplasm development present a risk for SAH, most pediatric SAHs mostly occur when a cerebral aneurysm develops due to these etiologies or independently of them [30] . Trauma induced aneurysmal development, whether it be accidental or nonaccidental, is the most common cause of SAH in the pediatric population [66] . Traumatic SAHs result from the tearing and weaking of intracerebral blood vessels, resulting in intracranial aneurysms, due to the force of the trauma. Non-traumatic SAHs are seen in patients with pre-disposing factors associated to an impairment to the arterial wall. A possible explanation for pediatric non-traumatic SAHs may be due to a deficiency of a necessary protein essential for arterial wall functionality [64] . Studies have highly suggested the prevalence of SAH among the pediatric population may be a due to a degradation of the internal elastic lamina and arterial medial layer. A possible explanation for this could be a lack of \u03b11-antitrypsin [70] . \u03b11-antitrypsin is a glycoprotein whose function is to inhibit proteases, like elastase and collagenase, from degrading connective tissue, specifically, connective tissue that surrounds the tunica media in the arterial wall [55] . This protein deficiency may increase aneurysm rupture incidence among the pediatric population, and it should be considered that this may also explain the larger appearance of pediatric intracranial aneurysms, which is not typical with adult intracranial aneurysm cases [66] . There is also a hemodynamic stress factor that might add to the propensity of developing cerebral aneurysms, and rupture, in children because of their susceptibility to develop aneurysms at the ICA bifurcation [59] .",

A study found that the absence of SirT1 in VSM-specific SirT1-ablated mice does not result in any obvious vascular functional impairment, but when exposed to pro-inflammatory and prooxidant stressors, such as angiotensin II (angII) infusion, arterial ligation, hyperlipidemic apoE\u2212/\u2212 genetic background, aging, and a diet high in fat and sucrose, this defect in SirT1 causes vascular disease, including atherosclerosis, aortic stiffness and dissection [20, 21, 25] . Sirtuin 1 may be repressed with changes in brain function and vasculature in some vulnerable populations which has been connected to the role of nutrition and xenobiotics; and may be relevant to pediatric subarachnoid hemorrhage treatment [9, 16, 20, 22, 32, 41] .",

Early intervention following SAH diagnosis is important for the prevention of this complication [34] . Regarding vasospasm, oral nimodipine may be employed as prophylaxis [2] . In one study involving 12 children with SAH, the mean oral dose of nimodipine was approximately 1 mg/kg every 4 hours [27] .

            "text": "SAH is associated with trauma, infection, and vascular abnormalities in the pediatric population, and it requires high levels of care during management and after discharge. However, when identified in a timely manner, the outcomes for patients with pSAH are more favorable in this population. Specifically, preventing rebleeding and vasospasms, using pharmacotherapy to improve blood flow, and closely monitoring symptoms and vitals help prevent neurologic and hemodynamic complications. Patients who may develop such complications may require extended hospital stay, additional surgeries, and therapies like Triple-H. Many SAH survivors may develop chronically disabling medical disorders, including issues with mood, neurophysiological function, and memory. For populations with predisposing genetic conditions that affect vasculature (e.g. AVM formations), early monitoring may be an effective preventative measure for these acute events. Moreover, closing the knowledge gap on epidemiological and biochemical predisposition to aneurysmal growth and rupture will inspire better preventive, management, and treatment protocols for pSAH. Intracerebral aneurysms caused by ADPKD are uncommon in children, but they are highly influenced by family history. Documented prevalence rates range from 0% to 41%.",

Venous congestion is thought to be a key cause of SAH and ICH in this population.

Multiple intracranial aneurysms and kidney cysts are associated with it.vascular anomalies The inability to repair or maintain vascular integrity, as well as the presence of less stable versions of normal anatomy that are prone to aneurysm formation.Marfan syndrome Aneurysms and hemorrhagic strokes are among the neurovascular consequences of this autosomal dominant musculoskeletal disorder.Autosomal dominant inheritance disease with thickened intima of major branches of the circle of Willis and Moya Moya arteries as a general finding. In individuals with MMD, intracerebral hemorrhage is a common cause of mortality.An autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance condition that generates cerebral and cardiovascular aneurysms.Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is characterized by hyperplastic skin and hyperextensible joints due to an autosomal dominant collagen synthesis deficiency. Furthermore, Ehlers-Danlos vascular type IV is associated with spontaneous rupture of arteries, including intracranial arteries.Through the activities of transcription factors, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases, the VHL tumor suppressor gene may be causally linked to aneurysm formation, resulting to SAH in some cases.Although hemangioblastomas in VHL are noninvasive, their increasing size can compress tissue and disrupt blood flow or they may hemorrhage, resulting in the observed clinical symptoms.Telangiectasias of the skin and mucosal membranes, as well as arteriovenous abnormalities in internal organs, contribute to hemorrhagic strokes.",
