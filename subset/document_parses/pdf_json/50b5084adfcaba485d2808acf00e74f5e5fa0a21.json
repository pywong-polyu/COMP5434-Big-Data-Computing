However, long hours of facemask usage have come with their own adverse effects like headache, rashes and light headedness [1] .",

As per the history given by the patient, his ear-looped mask got stuck somewhere and the shearing force caused the avulsion injury at the point of contact. There were minor abrasions on limbs, and no other systemic injury was noted.",

All dust and particulate matter was meticulously removed to prevent development of chondritis at a later date. As the injury was fresh, there was no devitalized tissue and debridement was not needed. Skin suturing was started from one end using 4.0 Ethilon. Meticulous attention was paid towards maintaining proper anatomy and alignment of the pinna to achieve the best possible cosmesis. Stay sutures were applied on the cartilage as and when necessary. Satisfactory results were obtained. Bolster was kept in the cymbae concha to prevent hematoma formation. Pressure dressing was given and patient was put on prophylactic IV antibiotics to prevent infection.",
