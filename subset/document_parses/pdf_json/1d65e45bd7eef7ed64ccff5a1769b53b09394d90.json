A quasi-experimental, pre-post study was carried out in the Arab American University. A convenience sample consists of 90 first-year nursing students were chosen. A progressive muscle relaxation exercise for five days per week was conducted on one group of nursing students. Students' anxiety was measured by S-anxiety scale (STAI Form Y-1) at pre and post the intervention. The severity of anxiety reduction was greater post the exercise (t (89) = 30.783, P = .001).",

            "text": "Nursing education is accomplished by utilizing knowledge and skills in clinical settings. 1 Clinical practice, an central aspect of nursing education, permits nursing students to acquire and develop their psychomotor abilities. 2 One of the main features shaping clinical education quality is students' exposure to and preparation for enrolling in the clinical training setting. 3 According to several research, the clinical aspect of nursing education is the most demanding. 4, 5 Students in clinical training have significant levels of anxiety. [6] [7] [8] [9] Previous study described that nursing students in Indonesia faced stress and anxiety through clinical care. 5 A Malaysian study revealed that clinical assignments were the leading source of anxiety among nursing students. 10 Also, a study conducted in Saudi Arabia found that 50% of the pharmacy students experienced anxiety and stress during their undergraduate education. 11 According to study, extreme levels of anxiety can have adverse effect on learning and clinical accomplishment of medical students. 8 This stress and anxiety might be ascribed to challenges in clinical practice as well as a scarcity of professional work experience. 12 It is generally acknowledged that exposing nursing students to long-term and unmanageable stress has a negative impact on the development of their professional identity as well as their health, and it can also be considered to have an impact on patient outcomes. 13, 14 Faculty and students must work together to create practical techniques to help nursing students avoid, minimize, or resolve psychological harm. 8 Relaxation techniques can help students cope with academic stress. 15 According to some studies, the PMR exercise should be used across all of nursing courses to encourage greater satisfaction and positive outlooks. 16 According to the researchers' experiences in nursing clinical training, nursing students experience anxiety in their initial clinical training and their behaviors and performances alter. 17 This alteration may have a detrimental impact on their training, advancement in patient care, and quality performance. The performance of a progressive muscle relaxation program, with which students are confronted in their first clinical learning setting, assists in the resolution of these issues and contributes to their professional development. 18, 19 Given the significance of reducing nursing students' anxiety throughout their initial clinical training, strategies such as progressive muscle relaxation exercise (PMR) may be beneficial in resolving this issue. However, according to the literature, no investigations have been done in Palestine upon this benefits of relaxation exercise on stress reduction in student nurses in their initial clinical training. As a result, the current study is to examine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercise on anxiety of nursing students during their initial clinical experience.",

Also, in collaboration with administrator of the nursing department, an announcement about the study was posted on the electronic contact links and students' board. Then, the coordinator called the researcher to present information about the study to students who agree to participate in it. The researcher explained the purpose, duration, and content of the study, as well as what participants were expected to do. The researcher assigned the students who agreed to participate to ten groups randomly. Date and time of the intervention were communicated to each group.

He also encouraged the participants not to miss any meetings and to complete all of them. The researchers used PMR exercises in other sessions. The muscle groups addressed in this exercise: hand and forearm, forehead, upper arm, mouth and jaw, eyes and cheeks, shoulder blades, shoulders, neck, chest and stomach, hips and buttocks, upper leg, lower leg, and foot. These muscles must be engaged and relaxed in the order specified (Table 1) . 22 The participants felt relaxed on the floor while the researcher was using this exercise and they had been warned to dress appropriately in order to reduce tension. Additionally, the students were tasked to perform each session at home approximately 10-15 minutes every day.

The study stated that Muscle Relaxation technique can help nurses to reduce their stress levels. 31 The current study is supported by Maharjan and Baby's findings of the effect of muscular relaxation therapy for academic and clinical stress. For ten consecutive days, progressive muscle relaxation was demonstrated. The study found that muscle relaxation technique was beneficial in lowering stress in nursing students. 32 Also, Dehghan-Nayery et al. indicated that PMR reduces stress and improves quality of life (QOL) among schoolgirls. 33 As a result, practicing PMR appears to be essential for students, particularly nursing students, because, according to one study, test anxiety reduces information processing speed. 26 The key idea behind PMR is to educate people how to deliberately suppress their tension and, as a result, decrease their level of anxiety. This strategy's key benefits in anxiety reduction and management include independence of practice, cost-effectiveness, and convenience. Nursing is stressful for nursing students, and the quantity of academic information they must study, and intense clinical setting, contribute to their anxiety. Individuals' perceptions of their capacity to adapt with daily stressors may change, and PMR exercise technique can be used to lower students' anxiety.",
