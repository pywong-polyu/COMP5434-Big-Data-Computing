            "text": "A general consequence of such intervention strategy is relevant if someone considers the mobility of human population between the patches/communities connected with non-local heterogeneous networks. In this backdrop, the key question we raise here, what will be the ideal and optimal way of distribution procedure of test-kits in meta communities? In the last century, a major development in the aviation as well as transportation networks expedites the epidemics of infectious disease. For instance, SARS and H1N1 Influenza originating from a local community spread across different countries within a few months [1] [2] [3] . Another example, COVID-19 originating from Wuhan, China on December, 2019 severely affected different countries within very short periods (3-4 months). Therefore, a suitable and optimal control of infected network is essential and important for faster eradication of epidemic spread. Motivated by the relative importance of human mobility in spatial spread of disease, here we find the suitable way of distributing test-kits in complex connectivity of the communities in which the mobility of human will be determined by the diffusive migration [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Note that, this meta-population network with migration is analogous to the reaction-diffusion dynamics [25, [30] [31] [32] i.e., particles (here fraction of population) diffuse and interact. It is well known that the suitable intervention strategy by partially controlling the network can reduce the prevalence of the entire system [9, [12] [13] [14] . For instance, the infection spreads rapidly through the hubs [27] . Therefore, vaccination in targeted nodes can dramatically resist the infection spreading [33] [34] [35] [36] compared to the random immunization. In this background, we propose an optimal strategy (in higher diffusive strength) by means of the distribution of testkits. Exploiting the microscopic information of a network, we are able to show that incorporating test-kits in high degree patches (or patches having high betweenness centralities) from the onset of epidemics can effectively reduce the peak of the infection, i.e., implication of test-kits in a certain fraction of high degree patches (patches with high betweenness) will have almost the same impact (the percentage of reduction in the peak of infection) compared to the implication of test-kits in each patch/community of the entire network. The proposed strategy acts like an effective immunization technique neglecting the information of the nodes which may have high prevalence in absence of test-kit implementations. To validate our optimal strategy, we consider two real networks: the global connectivity pattern of flights and the transportation networks of the city Kolkata.",

A rigorous simulation (with analytical argument) is provided to reveal the effective reduction of final outbreak size and peak of infection as a function of basic reproduction number in a single patch. Further, to study the impact of long and short-distance human migration among the patches, we have considered heterogeneous networks where the linear diffusive connectivity is determined by the network link structure. We numerically confirm that implementation of test-kits in the fraction of nodes (patches) having larger degrees or betweenness centralities can reduce the peak of infection (as well as final outbreak size) significantly. A next-generation matrix based analytical treatment is provided to find out the critical transmission probability in the entire network for the onset of epidemics. Finally, the optimal intervention strategy is validated in two real networks: global airport networks and transportation networks of Kolkata, India.",

Under a systematic implementation of test-kits, we unveil, that it may significantly reduce the peak of infection as well as the final outbreak size. The basic idea of our study lies within the usage of test-kits in which the number of production is assumed to be dependent on the current infection level and by using the test-kit, the procedure of admitting the infected individual in the hospital is accelerated. A detailed investigation of the model enables us to accurately predict the relative reduction of the peak of the infection as well as final outbreak size in the presence of test-kit based strategy.",

The human population is categorized into five compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), hospitalized (H) and recovered (R) depending on the current health status of the individuals. The individuals who are susceptible to a disease become exposed if they experience close contacts with the infected individuals. The force of infection is given by \u03b2 I N , where \u03b2 is the rate of disease transmission from infected to susceptible and N is number of the total human population. The individuals in the exposed compartment do not have the ability to transmit the disease among other susceptible individuals as the pathogen abundance in their body is not sufficient for active transmission. Sometimes this compartment is therefore called latent. At the end of the latent period (i.e. 1 \u03c3 ), the exposed individuals move to the infected compartment. In this stage, individuals show the symptoms of the disease and are capable of spreading the infection. The infected individuals then move to the hospitalized compartment at a rate \u03b1(K) and then get recovered from the disease at a rate \u03b3. We consider the disease to be non-fatal and therefore neglect the disease induced mortality. It is assumed that the process of hospitalization depends on the availability of the test-kit. With the help of the test-kit, the undetected infected individuals are tested and among them who are tested positive, admitted to the hospital. The implementation of testing procedure wit the help of test-kit basically speeds up the hospitalization process. As a result, the infected individuals get lesser time to transmit the disease to the susceptible population. For the sake of simplicity, we consider the rate of hospitalization as a linear function of the available test-kit, i.e., \u03b1(K) = \u03b1 0 + \u03b1 1 K, where \u03b1 0 denotes the rate of hospitalization in the absence of any test-kit, \u03b1 1 is the effectiveness of the test-kit. We assume that the test-kit is produced as proportion (\u03be) of the number of current infected individuals and looses its efficacy at a rate \u03c7. Note that, since we consider a disease outbreak situation and the duration of outbreak is generally shorter in compared to the human demographic process, therefore we neglect the demographics in our study. At any instant of time t, the rate of change of the number of individuals in the above-mentioned human compartments and that of the number of test-kit can be expressed mathematically as a set of ordinary differential equations as follows:",

In this parameter set-up the infection (I, red line) gets a maximum value around 0.4 which occurs at \u223c 210 days from the onset of infection. In presence of test-kits, exposed individuals as well as infected individuals are significantly dropped at (I max \u223c 0.15) shown in Fig. 1 (d) and 20% susceptible population (blue) remain unperturbed. As a result the recovered individuals (R) saturates around the 0.8 (green). We have also checked the maximum of the infection (I max ) as a function of basic reproduction number R 0 in absence of test-kits ( Fig. 1(b) ). Here analytically calculated I max (Eqn.

We have produced the number of kits as a proportional to the total infected individuals ( M n=1 I n ) in which a fraction of kits will be used in an infected compartment by the function g(K) = \u03b1 1 \u00d7 p n K. If the test-kits are equally distributed in each patch, the term p n will be equal to the inverse of the size of the network, i.e., p n = 1 M . If the test-kits are distributed in l patches according to their connectivity pattern i.e. the degree, one can write g(K) = \u03b1 1 \u00d7 p n K = \u03b1 1 \u00d7 dn l n=1 dn K. Hiring, these features into the compartment(s), we seek an efficient distribution of kits within the communities for the optimal reduction of prevalence and peak of infection of the entire connected patches. Exploiting the micro structures of the network we identify the key and influential patches in the network where the test-kits will be provided to decrease the peak of infection largely. In the next sections, we will show, such fractional but potential intervention strategy may indeed reduce the peak of infection significantly and it can also decrease the final outbreak size. We expect (under certain conditions), the test-kits distributed in fraction of specific patches will have same impact if we equally distribute the To illustrate our strategy, we choose a small but heterogeneous network ( Fig. 3(a) ) of 40 nodes (patches). To identify the influential patches in the network, we have chosen four nodes with different degrees marked by A, B, C and D. The patches A (d A = 19) and B (d B = 9) (green) have large number of neighbours where as C (d C = 5) and D (d D = 4) (blue) have less number of connections. Rest of the nodes (grey) have small number of connections. At first we apply the test-kits in A and B following the degree based strategy (SD) e.g. the test-kits will be distributed and divided according to the degree of those patches. Therefore, the test-kit will appear in two equations only with the term p A = d A d A +d B \u223c 0.678 and p B = d B d A +d B \u223c 0.321, respectively. Next, we have randomly chosen two low degree patches C and D (blue circles in Fig. 3(a) ) and distribute the test-kit equally, i.e., p C = 1 2 and p D = 1 2 . We call it as randomly selected and identically distributed test-kit strategy (SI). These two strategies have different impact in the evaluation of total infection (I). Compared to SI (blue line in Fig. 3(b) ), the peak of the infection is significantly decreased for SD (green line in Fig. 3(b) ). In absence of test-kits, the total infection (I SW ) is shown with black line (strategy without kit: SW) in the same figure. To quantify the efficiency of each strategy, we define relative reduction (RR) of the peak of infection as follows:",

We have now guessed that for a suitable migration strength, applying test-kits in the high degree patches will be highly beneficial for connected communities. A natural question appears, what will happen if we choose other microscopic topological properties of a given graph? Apart from the degree sequence, here we introduce two more network characteristics: (i) Betweenness centrality [41] [42] [43] , and (ii) local clustering coefficient [41, 43, 44] .

At first we apply test-kits in a fraction of nodes (N d = 10%) which have (i) larger degrees, (ii) larger clustering coefficients, or (iii) larger node betweenness centralities compared to the rest of the nodes. The results are shown in the extreme left of Fig. 4 (a) for relative reduction (RR) of infection peak and (b) for final outbreak size. It is clear that, the infection peak is significantly reduced (\u223c 65% \u2212 70%) for degree based (SD, green bar) as well as for betweenness centrality based strategy (SB, red bar). On the other hand, SI and SC (blue and orange bar respectively) based strategy can only reduce 25% \u2212 30% of the peak of infection. We have observed the similar pattern for the final outbreak size (extreme left Fig. 4(b) ) where Z FOS is remarkably decreased for SB and SD strategy. If we increase the fraction of nodes to N d = 20%, the situation is slightly improved for SI and SC based strategy, however they cannot outperform SB and SD.When we apply test-kits in every nodes (100%, extreme right in each panel), all the strategies provide almost similar results.To check whether our partial control based strategies are robust, we increase the average degree ( d ) of the network (M = 500) continuously from 4 to 14. The impact of increased average degree is shown in Fig. 4(c-d) . The peak of the total infection I max is reported for four different strategies: degree based (SD, green), betweenness centrality based (SB, red), clustering and randomly chosen identically distributed (SC, SI in orange, blue respectively). For comparison, we have also shown the infection peak in absence of test-kit (black line (SW)). Clearly, the results are not affected by the increased average degree of the network, i.e., SD and SB become the suitable choice for test-kit distributions. Same thing occurs for final outbreak size, the prevalence is reduced and remain almost constant (around 0.6) for SD and SB. For Fig. 4(c-d) , the 10% nodes/patches are impacted by the test-kits, and coupling strength is fixed at 0.05. Changes in RR with respect to N d and have been explored in the next section.",

In this case, we also observe a similar trend as in RR(I max ), i.e., relative reductions in Z FOS increase with the increment of as well as of N d (see Fig. 5 (e)-(h)). In the same way, it is to be noted that in terms of RR(Z FOS ), the strategies SD and SB appear to be quite efficient than SI and SC. The strategies SI and SC can achieve maximum 20% reduction (see Fig. 5 (e) and (h), yellow and light yellow regime) in Z FOS , whereas 30% reduction can be achieved through the strategies SD and SB (see Fig. 5 (f)-(g), red or deep red regime). In our cases, it is clear, degree based and betweenness based strategy (SD and SB) outperform the others. The reason is as follows: In heterogeneous network, removal of most connected nodes can break the giant component into isolated fragments [45] . Also, it was shown that isolating small subset of nodes (with high connectivity) for vaccination may resist the epidemic outbreak [33-36, 46, 47] . As high degree nodes have large number of connections, it helps to spread information more rapidly in the entire graph. Therefore, targeting few nodes (high degrees) at the onset of epidemics and apply test-kits in the targetted patches the prevalence become less severe, therefore a large number of neighbours got less infected. The same thing occurs for the case of betweenness centrality. However, the clustering based strategy (SC) which signifies how the neighbours of a node are connected to each other, cannot encode the information of the coupling structure, therefore fails to improve the result. Same thing occurs for randomly chosen but identically distributed strategy (SI), since the chosen nodes and their neighbor cannot capture the underline heterogeneous structure at all. In the same way, we can identify the nodes with high page rank or closeness characteristics which will may have positive impact in the intervention strategy.

To delve deeper, we have further cross validated our proposed for a wide range of infection rate (\u03b2). Now we will show, in absence of test-kit increased \u03b2 enhances the peak infection significantly. On the other hand, partial implication of test-kits slows down the infection peak (I max ) as well as final outbreak size (Z FOS ) for a wide range of \u03b2. Particularly, when a small fraction of patches (with high betweenness or degree) are monitored by the test-kits (N d = 10%), the I max is significantly decreased shown in Fig. 6(a) for SD (green) and SB (red). In higher transmission rate (\u03b2 \u223c 0.06) the peak of infection are enhanced for SW (black), SI (blue) and for SC (magenta). However, SB and SD based strategy largely restrict (\u223c 0.15) the peak of infection (red and green) around. A slight increase in the number of controlled patches (N d = 20%) improves the decrement of I max for strategy SC and SI shown in Fig. 6(b) . In this situation, the impact of SD and SC are still superior than SI and SC. If we apply test-kits in all patches(N d = 100%), the output of all strategies are almost same irrespective of the value of the transmission parameter \u03b2 (Fig. 6(c) ). Similar type of patterns appear for the case of Z FOS shown in Fig. 6(d-f) where N d = 10, 20, and 100% respectively. For all N d , the SD and SB based strategy outperform the other two strategies. Note that, for all cases described above (Fig. 6(a-f) ), the onset of infection (I > 0) starts around \u03b2 \u2248 0.012. In the appendix we have analytically calculated the critical transmission rate (\u03b2 c ) in the network and identified that \u03b2 c = 0.01 for R network 0 > 1 and \u03b1 0 = 0.01. Interestingly, the critical \u03b2 is same as single model and it does not depend on the network structure as well as diffusive coupling strength .",

A rigorous analytical derivation associated with numerical simulation confirms our claims. We have confirmed that such strategy can reduce (i) the peak of the infection as well as the (ii) the final outbreak size. To validate our model, we have randomly chosen three states of USA and confirmed that our model can efficiently capture the time dependent hospital data of each state. Next, we have considered the interlinked meta-communities and tested the impact of the migration (between communities/patches) and nodal characteristics on the underlying networks. To perform the numerical simulation, the proposed model is used over the top of a heterogeneous graph and connect each patch with diffusive coupling. The migration of people from one patch to other patch is considered through diffusive coupling reflecting intrinsic functional activities of meta-communities. In this backdrop, we have partially intervened the networks with test-kits, e.g the test-kits are applied in the nodes which have higher degrees or betweenness centralities. The results reveal that suitable choices of the nodes for the test-kit implication can have same effect compared to the intervention of test-kits in the entire graph. To validate our networks results further, we have considered two real networks (i) airport to airport connectivity pattern through existing flights and (ii) transportation network within wards in Kolkata municipality. We have numerically confirmed that, in an environment of a degree based strategy, compared to full control, a partial intervention (10% nodes are chosen for the test-kit implications) can drastically reduce the final outbreak size as well as infection peak. Here we derive the basic reproduction number for our network model (see the Eqn. (4.1)).

However for SI, the test-kits are always distributed identically. To study the impact of randomization in each strategy, we fix the N d (controlled nodes/patches) at 10% and quantify the relative reduction in I max i.e RR for a wide range of coupling strength, . For all the strategies, we plot RR obtained for targeted control (nodes having high network scores and test-kits are distributed according to their scores: degree, betweenness or clustering) and random control (randomly selected nodes and test-kits are distributed according to their network score) by varying the coupling strength . For random control we take 30 different realizations. Since in the strategy SI, all the nodes have same status (i.e p n = 1 M , for n = 1, 2, ..., M ), we observe no such significant difference between the targeted control and random control (see Fig. 8 (a), blue line and blue circle respectively). However, in the cases of SD and SB, a significant difference between targeted control and random control is observed. From Fig. 8 (b)-(c), we see that in terms of reduction in I max , random control (green and red circles) performs poorly in comparison to targeted control (green and red lines) for any given coupling strength.

In our case, we select: (i) Betweenness centrality (BC n ), (ii) Local clustering coefficient (CC n ), (iii) Closeness centrality (CLC n ), (iv) Page rank (P R n ) and (v) and Eigenvector centrality (EC n ).",

In the network, we have chosen 10% nodes having higher degrees. The network is reported in Fig. 9(a) , where high degree nodes are shown in brick red with bigger size. At first, we have plotted degree of each node with respect to its betweenness centrality ( Fig. 9(b) . Clearly, the 10% high degree nodes (deep red color) are positively related to the nodes having high betweenness centralities. The relationship between closeness centralities and degrees is shown in Fig. 9(d) , where 10% high degree nodes are depicted with brown color. The same features are also validated for page rank score and eigenvector centrality ( Fig. 9 (e-f), where 10% high degree nodes are marked with cyan and magenta color respectively). The positive correlation for the large values of BC n , EC n , CLC n and P R n with nodes having high degrees ensures that test-kit based intervention strategy can successfully mitigate the disease if we apply them on the nodes having higher degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centralities or higher page ranks. Note that, nodes with higher clustering coefficient cannot capture the degree heterogeneity, therefore unable to reduce infection height as well as final outbreak size. To check the impact of all nodal characteristics, we have plotted ( Fig. 9(g) ) the relative reduction of I max by applying test-kits in 10% nodes with higher degree (SD, green) or higher centrality measures such as page rank (SP, dark cyan), closeness (SCL, brown), betweenness (SB, red), eigenvector centrality (SE, magenta)).

The small three-wheeler cars (auto) and the pedestrians naturally move from one Ward to the adjacent Ward reflecting the almost regular connectivity pattern of the lattice. In this setup, the total number of connections in the lattice are 698. Apart from pedestrian mobility, we consider the bus connectivity and metro network within Kolkata city. Maparu et al showed that in Kolkata, the bus routes can be subdivided into ten important zones [52] . Based on homogeneity in land and population (see Table 1 in the same paper) we find out the most significant places of those zones and connect them to each other (formation of cliques) as there will be bus connections (major bus routes) between them. We have also added some random links among all other wards to map several small insignificant bus routes. Establishing the long distance connection between wards through bus we further add links in the original lattice to map the metro links between the Wards. As the typical timescale of the movement of people through metro is faster, we have created a complete graph (clique) between the Wards which have metro stations. Finally the network has 2524 links and 141 nodes. For numerical simulations, we consider the total population in each ward to be 10000. We randomly select two wards and set the initial infection in that wards as 10.",
