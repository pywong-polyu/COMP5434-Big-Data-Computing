An investigation regarding properties and behavior device has been investigated with the help of Silvaco TCAD. It is observed that Junction less TFET has advantageous over JLFET and TFETdue to the absence of junctions. The proposed device shows reduced short channel effects, lower subthreshold swing along with a higher voltage gain. The detection of the biomolecule is done by varying the gate dielectric constant inside the cavity and different electrical parameters such as electric field, sensing current, threshold voltage and transconductance are observed. The change in the threshold voltage, drain current, transconductance has been used as the sensing metric to detect the sensitivity of the presented device for biomolecule detection. Biomolecule position inside the cavity have been investigated to find out their effect on sensitivity parameter.",

A productive sensor is the one which has less error rate, consumes lower power and gives output faster. The detection of biomolecules using a biosensor can be done in two methods either by using Label Based technique or Label-Free detection technique. Label-free detection technique involves detection based on physical properties such as permittivity, sensitivity, selectivity. These physical properties play a good role in affecting the inputoutput characteristics of the device. Since label-free detection techniques do not involve chemical reaction with a biomolecule, it makes them reusable for detecting multiple times.",

This increase in the amount of leakage current consequentially increases the power consumption [3] . FET based biosensors have short channel effects in addition to very sharp doping profile [4] . Transistors named tunnel field-effect transistors(TFETs) were introduced to resolve the issue of short channel effects. TFET's could achieve subthreshold swing(SS) below 60 mV/ decade which could not be achieved using MOSFET's. Along with these advantages, the ability to decrease operating voltage has made them the best alternatives to MOSFETs in low power circuits [5, 6] . Even though TFET's reduced short channel effects and provided superior gate controllability, the issue of doping gradient remains to make it tougher to fabricate devices in nanoscale [7] . Colinge J et al. introduced the junctionless transistors by defining the physics behind them and their properties [8] . The device has superior properties and is easier to fabricate as it doesn't have any junctions. JLFETs have gained popularity because of their ability to recognize unlabelled molecules faster and lower production cost [9] . JLFETs are highly scalable and highly sensitive while operating over the target biomolecule to be detected.",

Double gate devices also reduce subthreshold leakage and increase ON-current because of formation of two conduction channels which makes it more suitable for circuits designed in sub-50 regime [15] [16] [17] [18] . We have isolated the gates because creating isolation in between gates reduces power consumption [19, 20] . The model contains a high-K gate dielectric which is TiO2.

After all, the doping concentrations and type of doping is the same for source and drain which is not possible in conventional FET biosensor. JLFET biosensors consume lower power than conventional FET biosensors. This biosensor has higher performance and less power loss because of having higher Ion/Ioff ratio. Furthermore, it is resistant to dopant fluctuations as it doesn't have dopant atoms. Figure 2 shows the energy band diagram of the device along the x-coordinate; when the gate bias is applied to the control gate and the polarity gate remains at zero bias. The diagram shows that the bandgap between the valence band and the conduction band is low. The lower bandgap shows that there is a higher probability of electrons to tunnel from valence band to conduction band, consequently increasing the current flow. The device exhibits a similar electric field for each case when the device is tested for different biomolecules. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the electric field along the length of the device. We observe that the electric field is smaller in the drain region, later increases to approximately 2.25 \u00d7 10 5 V/cm at the juncture of the channel and source; soon decreases in the drain region. A higher value at juncture is because electric field's strength increases as more space charge moves towards juncture, causing a maximum accumulation at that point. Figure 4 . illustrates the way the potential of the device varies along the length of the device. The potential of the device is approximately 1 V in drain region which instantaneously rises to 1.5 V in the channel region but later falls to 0 V in the source region. Figure 5 depicts the transfer characteristics of the proposed model for various biomolecules with values of permittivity as above. It can be observed that as the permittivity of the biomolecule increases; the device's subthreshold region decreases. Drain current is highest i.e.0.241 \u03bcA, \u22126.61798 (log Scale) for biomolecule with K = 9, least 13.5 nA, \u22127.96816(log Scale) for K = 1 which is air and for other K values it keeps increasing with K value. It helps us infer that the drain current in ON-state also increases as the permittivity of biomolecules increases. Figure 6 depicts the ratio of Ion/Ioff for different biomolecules of different K values. The device could attain exceptional Ion/Ioff ratio = 6 \u00d7 10 8 for biomolecule with permittivity = 7. Permittivity 7 is the average permittivity of the outer shell of human protein. A higher Ion/Ioff is required because it indicates better performance and lower power loss through leakages. Higher Ion/Ioff provides more gate controllability which helps in faster switching.",

As the permittivity of the biomolecule increases; the device shows a peculiar trend which is subthreshold slope can neither be considered as directly proportional to permittivity nor be considered as inversely proportional to permittivity.

The plot depicts that when we increase the gate voltage; as the value of permittivity of biomolecule increases the transconductance of the device also increases. Figure 10 illustrates the transfer characteristics of the device when different cavities are filled with biomolecules. It can be observed that the behaviour of the device when all cavities are filled with protein and only cavities under P-gate are filled with protein are almost similar, while the device behaviour when cavities under control gates filled with protein, all cavities filled with air, only cavity under P-gate or only cavity under control gate exhibit similar characteristics after the threshold region that is after 0.39 V. Control gates only help in controlling the ON and OFF states of the device with lower semiconductor losses, while on the contrary P gates help in the conduction of current. A positive P gate helps in current flow through electrons, while a negative P gate helps in current flow through holes [28] . This capability of P gate makes cavity below P gate a major affecter. Hence, similar properties are observed when the P gate is filled and all gates are filled. Table 1 depicts the variations in threshold voltage, subthreshold slope and transconductance after filling different types of cavities. Despite exhibiting similar characteristics when few types of cavities are filled; threshold voltage, subthreshold slope and transconductance values vary for each condition. ",

From the results, we conclude that the proposed JL-TFET model can act as a superior biosensor for biomolecule detection in comparison to existing FET based biosensors for low power application. The position of biomolecules inside the nanogap cavity have been varied to find out their effects on sensitivity. It has been concluded that maximum sensitivity could be obtained when all of the cavity regions are filled with a biomolecule. ",
