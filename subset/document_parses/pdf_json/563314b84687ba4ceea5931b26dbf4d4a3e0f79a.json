Methods Comprehensive literature searches were executed in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane library. The grey literature was searched via international clinical trial registries for relevant studies published in English in the last 20 years. We included studies in healthy humans of any age that used any dose-sparing strategy to administer intramuscular seasonal influenza vaccines. Title/abstract and full-text screening were carried out by pairs of reviewers independently. Data extraction was conducted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Our outcomes were influenza infections, intensive care unit admission, pneumonia, hospitalisations, adverse events and mortality. Results were summarised descriptively. Results A total of 13 studies with 10 351 participants were included in the review and all studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between 2006 and 2019. The most common interventions were the trivalent influenza vaccine (n=10), followed by the quadrivalent influenza vaccine (n=4). Nine studies included infants/toddlers 6-36 months old and one of these studies also included children and adolescents. In these nine studies, no clinical effectiveness outcomes were reported. Of the four adult studies (\u226518 years), two studies reported on effectiveness outcomes, however, only one RCT reported on laboratory-confirmed influenza. Conclusions Due to the low number of studies in healthy adults and the lack of studies assessing confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness, there remains a need for further evaluation.",

Immunocompromised populations and animal studies were excluded. Examples of persons with weakened immune systems include those with HIV/AIDS; cancer and transplant patients who are taking certain immunosuppressive drugs; and those with inherited diseases that affect the immune system (eg, congenital agammaglobulinaemia, congenital IgA deficiency). 7 \u25ba Intervention: Any dose-sparing strategy used to administer IM seasonal influenza vaccines (eligible vaccines listed in online supplemental appendix 4). Eligible strategies included, but were not limited to, administrating less than the standard 15 ug HA antigen using multidose vials (MDV), half dosing or preformulated products with reduced antigen quantity, or with revised vaccine dose schedules. Any studies examining monovalent pandemic vaccines, specialty/experimental vaccines (eg, high dose), whole virus vaccines or other routes of administration (eg, intranasal, intradermal (ID)) were not eligible. Only vaccine products approved for use in Canada or equivalent formulations approved for use in other countries were eligible for inclusion. Concomitant administration with other vaccine products were included only if administered to both the intervention and the comparator groups. \u25ba Comparator: Any of the interventions listed above, no intervention or placebo. \u25ba Outcomes: Lboratory-confirmed influenza infection (primary outcome), influenza-like illness or clinical/ symptomatic diagnosis of influenza, hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, pneumonia, mortality and adverse events (local/systemic reactogenicity, vascular-related, serious). Reactogenicity represents the physical manifestation of the inflammatory response to vaccination, and can include injection-site pain, redness, swelling or induration at the injection site, as well as systemic symptoms, such as fever, myalgia or headache. 8 Immunogenicity outcomes were not abstracted, but these studies were flagged for NACI. \u25ba Study designs: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised studies (eg, quasi-RCTs, nonrandomised trials, interrupted time series, controlled before after) and observational studies (eg, cohort, case control) were included. Studies must have had a control or comparator group in order to be eligible for inclusion and as such, cross-sectional, case series, case reports and qualitative studies were excluded. \u25ba Publication status: We included full text and abstracts if they included data on safety or effectiveness. Inclusion was also limited to studies written in the English language due to the short timelines for the conduct of this review.",

[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Two RCTs compared the administration of full (0.5 mL) and half (0.25 mL) doses of the same standard 15 \u03bcg/strain vaccine. 11 15 The first RCT compared two full vs two half doses of TIV in previously unimmunised infants (6-11 months) and toddlers (12-23 months) using Vaxigrip (15 \u03bcg/strain). 11 The study found that in the infants group, two full 0.5 mL doses of vaccine did not increase reactogenicity. Local reactions were less common in infants than toddlers and more common with full doses versus half doses, but the differences were not statistically significant. An identified clinical trial registry compared a single IM injection of 0.5-0.25 mL of FLUAD or Agrippal and showed comparable numbers of children with reactogenicity outcomes and other adverse events across the groups, but no significance levels or conclusions were provided by the investigators on contact. 15 The objective of three of the included RCTs was to examine the impact of administering the full adult dose of 15 \u03bcg/strain vaccines compared with the usual children's dose of 7.5 \u03bcg/strain in infants and toddlers. [12] [13] [14] A multicentre RCT was conducted in Canada assessing the safety of full-dose Fluviral TIV (15 \u03bcg/strain) compared with the half-dose (7.5 \u03bcg/ strain) and an active comparator Vaxigrip (7.5 \u03bcg/ strain). 12 Compared with the half-dose, the full-dose vaccine resulted in clinically similar reactogenicity Open access and safety. A similar three-arm RCT to assess the use of Fluarix at two different dose levels (7.5 \u03bcg/strain and 15 \u03bcg/strain) compared with an established control vaccine Fluzone (7.5 \u03bcg/strain) also found the reactogenicity and safety profile of Fluarix did not appear to be affected by doubling the dose, but one participant in the 15 \u03bcg group had two serious adverse events (apnea and cyanosis) that were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to vaccination. 13 A third multicentre RCT compared the 15 \u03bcg/ strain formulation to the 7.5 \u03bcg/strain formulation of Fluzone (Sanofi Pasteur) administered to young children across multiple influenza seasons. 14 This study also found no statistically significant differences between the full-dose or half-dose groups for systemic reactions, local reactions or adverse events when both seasons were combined; however, in the 2011-2012 season, 8 of 48 (16.7%) participants in the half-dose group compared with 32 of 96 (33.3%) in the full-dose group had increased redness at the injection site (p<0.05).",

AEs Solicited systemic reactions were reported in more infants aged 6-35 months in the MDV group than in the PFS group, however, this was not clinically significant. AE not considered related to a study vaccine. There were no differences in reactogenicity or safety between the two vaccine formats. These results showed that the MDV format of QIV was as safe and immunogenic as the PFS format in infants, children, and adolescents. These findings support the use of MDV QIV as a resource-saving alternative for seasonal influenza vaccination. Open access higher in the full dose group, when adjusted to include only clinically significant pain levels (>3 out of 5 on a Visual Analogue Scale) the difference was no longer statistically significant. 20 The RCT found no differences in occurrence or severity of any other adverse effects. Similarly, one RCT comparing four different doses of Fluzone (3 \u03bcg, 6 \u03bcg, 9 \u03bcg, and 15 \u03bcg per strain) did not report any differences between the IM vaccination groups. 21 Finally, the RCT in older adults also found no difference in the occurrence or severity of adverse events in the low-dose (9 \u03bcg) vs high-dose (15 \u03bcg) group and found no serious adverse events that were considered related to the vaccine. 22 DISCUSSION PHAC commissioned this rapid scoping review to identify the evidence for efficacy and safety of fractional influenza vaccine dosing for IM administration of seasonal influenza vaccines in healthy individuals of all ages that have been evaluated in human trials. Thirteen RCTs published between 2006 and 2019 comparing standard/full-dose and half/low-dose vaccines were included in this scoping review after a comprehensive search of three electronic databases, trial registries and references of relevant systematic reviews. The majority of the included RCTs were conducted in children and evaluated TIV. In young, healthy children, there were no effectiveness outcomes of interest reported. However, local reactogenicity, systemic reactogenicity and adverse events were comparable across the full-dose and half-dose TIV and QIV vaccine arms. In addition, the authors of one RCT in children and adolescents that compared full-dose QIV using PFS vs MDV also found no statistically significant differences in safety outcomes between administration formats. In healthy adults (including older adults), halfdose QIV was considered equally effective as high-dose in the two RCTs that assessed clinical effectiveness. Safety profiles were similar across groups in all four RCTs.",

NACI concludes that since many of those at high risk of influenza (eg, adults 65 years of age and older, individuals with specific underlying chronic health conditions) may have a lower immune response to influenza vaccination already (due to immunosenescence in older adults or a condition that alters immune function), it is important to ensure that those at high risk continue to receive the full dose of influenza vaccine. With regard to the safety of IM seasonal fractional doses of influenza vaccines, there is fair evidence that fractional doses do not result in significant differences compared with full dose with regard to severe adverse effects post-influenza vaccination. Readers are encouraged to reference the full NACI report on the Health Canada website. 3",

Only one RCT by Kramer et al reported the objective outcome 'laboratory-confirmed influenza', and the other RCT by Engler only reported the outcome 'influenza like illness'. 19 20 Since a 2014 narrative review found that less than 25% of cases diagnosed by physicians as influenza like illness were later laboratory proven influenza cases, 23 we are lacking RCTs examining fractional dosing of IM influenza immunisation. Further, twelve dose-sparing RCTs were not included because they did not provide sufficient data, and did not include vaccines that were deemed of interest to the stakeholders. Another limitation was that only studies published in the English language were included, and data extraction was conducted by one abstractor and one verifier. Since this was a scoping review, we did not appraise the methodological quality of the included studies. 24 Future research Dose-sparing approaches such as ID immunisation vaccination exhibits similar, or even enhanced, immunogenicity, when using a fractional dose only, as compared with IM or subcutaneous immunisation, and should be explored in future scoping reviews. 25 ",
