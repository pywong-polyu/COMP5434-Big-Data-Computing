Objectives The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of oral sildenafil and intravenous milrinone infusion and compare the effects of these drugs in combination versus as monotherapy in neonates with PPHN. Methods A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in which neonates with PPHN were divided into three groups of 20 patients each: group 1 received oral sildenafil starting at 0.5 mg/kg every 6 h to a target maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg every 6 h; group 2 received intravenous milrinone 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/min as a continuous infusion; and group 3 received both oral sildenafil and intravenous milrinone. Results Post-treatment pulmonary artery systolic pressure was significantly lower in group 3 than in groups 1 and 2, which both received monotherapy (p = 0.031). The oxygenation index also decreased significantly in the dual-therapy group (p = 0.002) compared with the monotherapy groups. Combined use of both drugs demonstrated a beneficial synergistic effect with better outcomes and reduced mortality. Conclusion Dual therapy using sildenafil and milrinone was superior to monotherapy with either drug in neonates with severe PPHN and is recommended for use in resource-constrained settings.

In group 1 (sildenafil only), there was no significant change in PASP from day 1 to day 2, with the difference only appearing at the end of management. This may be because sildenafil needs a longer treatment duration to induce a therapeutic effect. For group 2 (milrinone only), there was a significant decrease in PASP from day 1 to day 2 but no significant change in PASP from day 2 to the end of management. This may reflect that milrinone induced its therapeutic effect rapidly, but some sort of tolerance arose with continuing management as no further beneficial effect was seen. Group 3 (combined therapy) had a significant decrease in PASP from day 1 to day 2 and from day 2 to the end of management, suggesting that the dual therapy had a rapid therapeutic effect, and PASP continued to improve until normalization with no apparent tolerance arising. The use of milrinone in combination with sildenafil in a resource-limited setting has demonstrated a beneficial synergistic effect with better outcomes, especially in severe PPHN.",

In such situations, dual therapy using oral sildenafil and intravenous milrinone infusion might be a suitable option.

This has also been observed in other studies [12, 16, 17] . Therefore, all available data indicate that dual This study was not without limitations. First, the study was conducted in one center, and results were dependent on the type of supportive care provided in this center so results are not generalizable. A second limitation is the relatively small sample size even though we calculated it to give 80% power for the statistical analysis. For more robust results, the study should be repeated in a larger population and in multiple settings. Third, the clinical trial was designed to compare the effects of the drugs without the gold standard therapy for severe PPHN (iNO and ECMO) being used as a comparator. However, these results remain crucial for developing countries without access to the gold standard therapy. Lastly, the relatively short duration of follow-up for patients in this study did not allow a comparison of the neurodevelopmental outcomes of the three treatment groups.",
