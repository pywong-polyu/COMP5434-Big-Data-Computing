This study aims to describe and assess the perception of barriers and facilitators and the associated factors for the participation of underrepresented and non-underrepresented fibromyalgia patients. Methods: We performed an online survey through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) targeting fibromyalgia patients from April 7 to July 3, 2020 during the COVID-19 stay home mandate and it was restricted to the United States of America. We described and compared the survey characteristics between underrepresented and non-underrepresented participants, and we performed logistic regression models to assess the associated factors with clinical trial participation. Results: In total, 481 completed the survey including 168 underrepresented fibromyalgia patients. Only (1) 11.09 % reported previous participation in clinical trials and the significant perceived barriers were investigator-related (lack of friendliness of research staff and the opportunity to receive the results) and center-related (privacy and confidentiality policies, and the institution's reputation); (2) the participation rate and perceived barriers and facilitators were similar between underrepresented and non-underrepresented patients; and was positively associated with low income, higher age, and clinical trial awareness from their physician; and negatively associated with the perception of investigator-related barriers; and (4) for the underrepresented population, the presence of emotional support.",

Additionally, studies showed that 40% out of 253 trials were terminated prematurely, and around half of the trials had to prolong recruitment time due to ineffective recruitment strategies [2] . Evidence has also shown potential participation barriers such as certain social, economic, cultural traits, lack of clinical trial awareness, mistrust and lack of disease education, particularly in the underrepresented population [3, 4] .",

It contributes thus to inequitable distribution of benefits and risks of trial participation [9] . The influence of the underrepresented population in RCT recruitment varies across diseases based on their clinical and epidemiological characteristics; thus disease-specific studies to understand barriers and facilitators for their participation are needed [10, 11] .",

Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities report significantly greater levels of symptoms [14] . Fibromyalgia is a debilitating, poorly understood, and complex chronic pain condition [15] , where most patients are highly impacted by the disease, lacking access to healthcare delivery and suffering significant comorbidities, such as functional and psychiatry disorders [16, 17] . Besides, given the perception and intensity of pain vary among subjects and across time, it may represent a barrier to accomplish the schedule and visits of a clinical trial [18] . Also, the definite diagnosis could extend from months to years; thus, patients do not know about it early enough to participate in a trial [15] . Currently, the response to available treatments is variable and the risk of adverse events is high [19, 20] . Other conditions as breast cancer has reported that despite the high prevalence in women, and even higher risk of breast cancer-specific mortality in race/ethnicity minorities, they have a lower representation in clinical trials [21] . Therefore, given there is a need to improve the recruitment of women and minorities in clinical trials, fibromyalgia patients represent an example of the challenges on recruitment and adherence of an underrepresented population.",

Moreover, engender participation opportunities to underrepresented populations into fibromyalgia clinical trials may also clarify clinical outcomes as well as provide a deep understanding of different treatment response profiles. However, there is a lack of exploring and understanding of potential factors influencing the recruitment and participation for underrepresented and non-underrepresented fibromyalgia patients. Therefore, given the high prevalence of fibromyalgia in women and minorities, it is critical to determine the clinical trial participation barriers and facilitators for fibromyalgia patients to improve the recruitment strategies of current and future clinical trials. This study aims to describe the clinical trial participation of underrepresented and nonunderrepresented fibromyalgia patients and to assess their perception of barriers and facilitators for recruitment and the associated factors to their participation to propose further strategies enhancing recruitment.",

The survey was approved by the Institutional Review Board of MassGeneral Brigham's ethics committee under the protocol number 2017P002524. It was performed and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) electronic data capture tools hosted at Partners HealthCare Research Computing, Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services (ERIS) group [23] . Prior to starting the survey, participants were asked for their preferred language (English or Spanish) and their consent to participate after a description of the survey, including the aim to understand the participation of fibromyalgia patients in clinical trials and their anonymity participation (Supplementary Material 1). Before the Google Ads release, the survey was tested in a small sample (n \u00bc 21) of participants during March 2020. We then made minor changes about the wording of the questions and answers and eligibility criteria according to the initial experience. Based on our pre-established settings on Google ads, potential participants who fit our search criteria received an advertisement and an encrypted link from our survey [23] .",

Google Trends gives live information about what is being searched on a determined area or at a certain time or under a specific subtopic [30, 31] . Therefore, you can delineate the profile of the users and infer the characteristics of a determined group of individuals [31, 32, 33] . This have been used in the literature to discuss a few main health topics and how they are affecting the population. Studies has shown that an adequate use of keywords and the understanding of Google analytics metrics, Google Ads can be an useful recruitment tool [34, 35, 36, 37] ; also it has shown to be effective to target specific populations [36] . Moreover, it has shown a good performance recruiting underrepresented populations [38] . See the ad preview in supplementary table 1. Since our target population was subjects with fibromyalgia with iterative fibromyalgia-related information searches through Google, we focalized the scope of the Google ads by subject using five keywords (fibromyalgia, fibromyalgia syndrome, fibromyalgia pain, fibromyalgia symptoms, and fibromyalgia pain relief) and restricted its distribution geographically only to the United States (achieving impressions and clicks from all states).

Fibromyalgia variables included confirmation of diagnosis, pain score average over the last six months (0-10 numeric scale), time since diagnosis in years. Sociodemographic variables included, age, sex, ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino or Spanish Origin, not Hispanic), race (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, white, Two or more races, other), education (Home-school, No school, Some school, GED or equal, High school graduated, Associate or Bachelor's, Master's or higher), household income (<15 000 USD, 15 000-20 000 USD, 21 000-30 000 USD, 31 000-45 000 USD, 46 000-60 000 USD, 61 000-120 000 USD, >120 000 USD), number of people per household. Other variables included: religion, civil status, income, government support, employment, housework hours, emotional support and feeling down, depressed, or hopeless in the last two weeks. Clinical awareness was measured by previous knowledge of clinical trials by their physicians and whether they were asked previously to participate in a clinical study and the likelihood to participated in clinical trials measured by a 5-point Likert scale. Previous participation was measured by a dichotomic question asking, \"In your lifetime, in how many trials have you taken part? -I have never participated in a clinical trial, or I have participated in ____,\" and the number of previous clinical trial participation. Perceived factors that might influence participation were measured by a four point-Likert scale. A copy of the survey as fielded to participants is supplied in supplementary table S1.",

The variable that was not considered a confounder was kept in the model if the p-value <0.05 and if it does not inflate the standard error of the clinical trial participation variable substantially, in order to avoid collinear terms. The selection of independent variables was based on the \"purposeful selection method\" [41] . We reported the logistic regression results using odds ratios (ORs), a relative measure of association between exposure and outcome. The OR represents the odds that an outcome (clinical trial participation) will occur given a particular exposure (participant characteristics, trial awareness, and perception of barriers and facilitators to participating). OR higher than 1 indicates increased occurrence of the outcome, and OR lower than 1 indicate the opposite [42] .",

Moreover, minorities including race, ethnicity and low income populations are not well represented in chronic pain studies [47] . The low rate of self-reported clinical trial participation is aligned with a previous online survey [40] , which reported 11% of participation of fibromyalgia patients and significantly lower than other included diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (36%), Parkinson's disease (36%), and multiple sclerosis (20%). To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of clinical trial participation of underrepresented fibromyalgia patients. However, contrary to studies on cancer clinical trials [10] , which reported a lower participation rate among underrepresented individuals, we found no differential participation rate in this subgroup. This suggests that the barriers to participating are homogeneously distributed in the overall fibromyalgia population and could be associated with individual characteristics (education, income, race, ethnicity, etc.) rather than the full definition of underrepresented population. Our survey aimed to help identify barriers or facilitators in clinical trial participation among patients with fibromyalgia. Our findings are consistent with recruitment surveys done in the general population [48] .",

The fact that the association of these variables with clinical trial participation remained significant when the results were stratified for being underrepresented helps us refine recruiting strategies for this population. The low-income variable remained significantly related to clinical trial participation, even when controlled for employment status. Thus, we can speculate that low-income patients were not attracted to participate in the studies because they were unemployed and with more free time, but because of other factors, such as pursuing alternative treatments for their conditions or financial compensation. Age also affected the trial participation in the overall and underrepresented fibromyalgia population. We found that older patients were significantly more likely to participate. The literature suggests that the elderly population is vastly underrepresented in clinical trials restricting the generalizability of the efficacy and safety of interventions [53] . Our study indicates that particularly older patients with fibromyalgia are prone to a higher participation rate. Therefore, they should be targeted in the recruitment strategies. Possible explanations for this finding include time-commitment availability and seeking alternative experimental treatment options after multiple unsuccessful treatments in the past. Targeting this population can thus help to improve underrepresented population participation.",

Therefore, promoting a trustable and safe environment by the investigators at the research center might play an important role for this population, increasing recruitment and adherence to their participation.",

From our sample, we found specific characteristics associated with previous involvement in research. We believe that the participation of underrepresented and nonunderrepresented populations can be enhanced considering these critical characteristics. First, we suggest an in-depth training of the recruitment and consent team improving their communication skills, standardizing the way they explain procedures and answer concerns, and adding a post-study procedure that includes a summary report of the trial results or publications. Second, we found two potential factors that could improve the strategies to target potential participants: lowincome population and older age. Collaboration with non-profit or governmental organizations that provide assistance to patients and the use of digital databases to identify specific profiles using IRB-approved methods (such as online marketing services -Google ads or social media or electronic medical records) are options to consider in the recruitment plan. Third, we found the importance of increasing RCTs awareness and the role of health care providers as liaisons for recruitment. Thus, we recommend creating an early partnership with primary care physicians, rheumatologists, and pain medicine specialists to develop targeted strategies at clinics with information to be forwarded to their patients instead of broad-based alternatives. Finally, we found that emotional support is also important, especially in the underrepresented population. Therefore, identifying and targeting support groups of fibromyalgia patients or implementing institutional support groups that could help as a long-term partnership for referral of fibromyalgia patients, especially for large and long RCTs.",

            "text": "There are some limitations to our survey. The first one is the unknown number of non-response. Thus, the generalization of these findings is limited by our convenience sample. However, our participants' characteristics (Table 1 ) are similar to previous epidemiological studies on fibromyalgia [61, 62] , suggesting that our sample could be representative of these patients. Furthermore, the identification of underrepresented populations by an internet-based survey could be argued as a potential biased method. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown the high availability of internet in the USA [63] , and the access is similar for underrepresented and non-underrepresented populations [64] . Also, our survey was relatively short, thus did not inhibit participation once started. Finally, we surveyed subjects during the COVID-19 stay-at-home mandate in most of the US states. It is possible that participation and generalization increased during this time due to more internet use and home stay. The second factor is that self-reported data increases the risk of recall bias or the probability of having incomplete information in the survey regarding participation in past clinical studies. The final limitation is that we cannot request confirmation of diagnosis as the data collected is based on non-identifiable information; therefore, we rely on the individual confirmation of the diagnosis of fibromyalgia that could be uncertain. However, it needs to be underscored that subjects had no secondary gain to participate in the trial (they did not receive any monetary compensation). Thus, it is less likely subjects who do not have fibromyalgia would be imprecise with this information. Also, as online tools for targeting this population, Google ads were shown in previous survey studies as a reliable method to reach patients based on their internet search patterns [65, 66, 67, 68] . In summary, our findings suggest low rates of clinical trial participation of fibromyalgia patients, regardless of their status as underrepresented. However, the low-income category is the component of the underrepresented population definition that most influences their participation. Strategies to enhance recruitment should consider targeting support groups and low-income populations, involving their physician as liaison to increase the awareness of clinical trials and improve patient-researcher communication.",
