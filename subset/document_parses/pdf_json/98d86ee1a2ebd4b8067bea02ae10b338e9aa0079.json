            "text": "Background: An unexpected high prevalence of enterococcal bloodstream infection (BSI) has been observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU). Materials and methods: The primary objective was to describe the characteristics of ICUacquired enterococcal BSI in critically ill patients with COVID-19. A secondary objective was to exploratorily assess the predictors of 30-day mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ICUacquired enterococcal BSI. Results: During the study period, 223 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to COVID-19-dedicated ICUs in our centre. Overall, 51 episodes of enterococcal BSI, occurring in 43 patients, were registered. 29 (56.9%) and 22 (43.1%) BSI were caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. The cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI was of 229 episodes per 1000 ICU admissions (95% mid-p confidence interval [CI] 172-298). Most patients received an empirical therapy with at least one agent showing in vitro activity against the blood isolate (38/43, 88%). The crude 30-day mortality was 42% (18/43) and 57% (4/7) in the entire series and in patients with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSI, respectively. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score showed an independent association with increased mortality (odds ratio 1.32 per one-point increase, with 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.66, p \u00bc .021). Conclusions: The cumulative incidence of enterococcal BSI is high in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Our results suggest a crucial role of the severity of the acute clinical conditions, to which both the underlying viral pneumonia and the enterococcal BSI may contribute, in majorly influencing the outcome.",

Although the exact causal pathways of this increased risk are still not completely clear, different non-mutually exclusive mechanisms have been proposed: (i) the use of immunomodulatory agents; (ii) the impairment of antigen presentation and the presence of acquired immunosuppression due to SARS-CoV-2; (iii) the impairment of microcirculation due to the endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy occurring during COVID-19 [1, 4, 5] .",

For the primary descriptive analysis, the cumulative incidence of ICUacquired enterococcal BSI was calculated as the number of events per 1000 ICU admissions of COVID-19 patients, with exact mid-p 95% confidence interval (CI) [22] . In the case of multiple episodes of enterococcal BSI from the same species occurring in the same patient, a novel event was considered as independent from the previous one if developed at least 30 days after the last positive culture related to the previous episode. With regard to the demographic and clinical characteristics of single patients, categorical variables were summarized with numbers and percentages, and continuous variables with medians and interquartile ranges. The 95% CI was calculated for all estimates [23, 24] . For the secondary exploratory analysis of predictors of 30-day mortality, the first ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI per patient was considered. The possible association between clinical variables and 30-day mortality was first tested in univariable logistic regression models. Then, variables potentially associated with the outcome in univariable comparisons (p < .20) were included in an initial logistic regression multivariable model, and then further selected for the final multivariable model through a stepwise backward procedure based on the Akaike information criterion. The survival of patients with ICU-acquired BSI was also summarized graphically through the Kaplan-Meier method, with the time of origin set at the day when the first positive culture of the first enterococcal BSI episode was drawn. Statistical analyses were performed using the R Statistical Software (version 3.6.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",

            "text": "increased predisposition of critically ill COVID-19 patients to develop enterococcal BSI have been proposed. For example, the use of ceftriaxone or ceftaroline (which is inactive against E. faecium, although some in vitro activity against E. faecalis has been reported) as empirical agents in the suspicion of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia superimposed to the viral disease, since this could have exerted a selective pressure increasing the risk of enterococcal BSI [3] . However, large use of cephalosporins may have not been the rule in all series reporting a high cumulative incidence of enterococcal BSI in critically ill COVID-19 patients [1, 6] . An alternative, non-mutually exclusive possible explanation is an increased risk of cross-transmission of Enterococcus spp. due to possibly relaxed infection-control measures (i.e. during the peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic the protection of healthcare personnel from the virus was prioritized with respect to the allocation of personal protective equipment, with a possible consequent risk of crosstransmission of bacteria across patients [25] [26] [27] ), although this explanation is not fully in line with the fact that a similar increase in the transmission of several other bacteria (e.g. Enterobacterales, staphylococci) was apparently not observed [3, 6] . Finally, an intriguing hypothesis is that of an increased bacterial translocation from the gut due to the presence/worsening of intestinal wall damage/inflammation related to the viral infection and/or the host response to the virus [1] , which nonetheless deserves further investigation in the light of, again, the apparent absence of a parallel increase in the risk of BSI due to Enterobacterales and the lack of a clear elucidation of the underlying causal pathway and mechanisms. Despite the above-discussed uncertainty in deciphering the true reasons for the high cumulative incidence of enterococcal BSI we and others observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the high number of such infections remains, and with the present series, we tried to better depict the characteristics and outcomes of enterococcal BSI in this peculiar population. Notably, despite the high median age of patients in our cohort (63 years), we ultimately registered only a moderate burden of baseline comorbidities (frequency <10% for most of the registered comorbidities, as shown in Table 1 ), likely reflecting the fact that severe respiratory insufficiency by SARS-CoV-2 may present not only in patients with already existing severe conditions but also in old patients with none or few comorbidities [28] . Another interesting aspect worth discussing is that mortality was high despite most patients (88%) received an in vitro active empirical therapy since the onset of BSI, suggesting a possible role of the severity of the underlying viral disease in unfavourably influencing the outcome. Of note, two patients did not receive prompt empirical therapy, possibly due to initially unclear or unrecognized infections in presence of mitigated clinical signs and inflammatory markers at the onset of BSI after previous treatment with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents [29, 30] .",

For example, the potential unfavourable impact of vancomycin resistance in E. faecium, since, in crude numbers, 30-day mortality was higher in the small subgroup of patients with VRE BSI (57% vs. 42% in the entire series), possibly connected to the fact that 3 of the 5 in vitro inactive empirical therapies in the entire series were administered to patients with VRE BSI. Finally, it should be noted that we detected a high number of CRBSI (72%). However, we are unsure whether the CVC was the primary site of infection since we cannot exclude that colonization and infection of the device may have occurred after an initial translocation into the bloodstream from another site (e.g. the gut). Another factor showing a non-statistically significant direction of effect towards increased mortality and deserving further investigation in larger cohorts is the Pitt bacteraemia score (reflecting the severity of BSI presentation), whereas in our cohort there was no apparent association between baseline comorbidities (summarized by means of the Charlson score) and an unfavorable prognosis. The absence of endocarditis diagnoses and the low values of the DENOVA score (reflecting the risk of endocarditis) did not allow us to explore their possible prognostic effect in our cohort.",

First, this was a case series of COVID-19 patients with enterococcal BSI, thus no comparison was made with critically ill COVID-19 patients with no BSI or with BSI caused by other microorganisms. However, such a possible comparison was not the aim of our study, which was instead conceived to depict the characteristics and outcome of ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI, once recognized their high cumulative incidence in the target population. Second, owing to the observational nature of the study, which implies the existence of unmeasured confounding, and the small sample size, which precludes more sophisticated adjustment for measurable confounding, the present study was not structured to assess the impact of antibacterial therapy (and the type of employed drug/s) on mortality in a completely reliable way. Other not included data that we were eventually unable to reliably collect retrospectively from all patients were: (i) presence and type of recent chemotherapy; (ii) the time elapsed from the last CVC substitution and development of enterococcal BSI. In addition, we cannot exclude the incompleteness of the information on previous glycopeptide use and previous VRE isolation (e.g. in case of the previous hospitalization in other centers).

An additional, penalised, multivariable logistic regression model with Firth's correction, which included source control performed/unnecessary plus all the variables included in the final standard multivariable model, confirmed the results observed in the standard model (age: OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.18, p \u00bc .112; previous hospitalisation: OR 2.82, 95% CI 0.40-31.13, p \u00bc .302; SOFA score: OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.61, p \u00bc .025) and no independent association with treatment failure was observed for source control performed/unnecessary (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.00-3.27, p \u00bc .296).
