Recent Findings We found a steadily increasing rate of late-life suicide in the USA in the past decade. Evidence supporting the integration of depression care managers into primary care for risk reduction is among the strongest to date. Pharmacologic and neuromodulation studies should be considered in geriatric depression complicated by suicidality. Broad societal campaigns about suicide education, as well as active outreach to psychiatric patients after discharge or a suicidal crisis, prevent suicidal behavior. Growing research supports an integrative multidisciplinary approach. Summary Suicide is a complex and multifaceted behavior with numerous casual points for intervention. Access to deadly means, presence of depression, disease, disability, and social disconnection are factors that increase vulnerability. Quality geriatric care, regular screening in primary and emergency care settings, and a multidisciplinary approach are necessary to mitigate risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic amplifies need for a more aggressive approach.",

            "text": "Although crude death rates have declined over the last five decades, having peaked in the 1950s, a slow and steady rise in suicides occurred in the last 10 years (CDC fatal injury reports). The actual number of deaths by suicide in late life is expected to rise with increasing percentage of older Americans (expected to reach 22% of the population by 2050). Despite its prevalence, late-life suicide receives little attention from media to healthcare initiatives to funding agencies [1\u2022\u2022] . Ageist views tend to consider depression and thoughts of death as a normal feature of the aging process. Accumulation of physical illnesses, disabilities, life events, and losses is seen as the explanation for so-called rational suicide to opt out of this end-stage of life [2] . A systemic review of \"rational suicide\" identified depression, self-determination, mental competence, and ageism in both physicians' and population's perspectives [3\u2022] . Geriatricians are increasingly encountering older adults expressing suicidal wishes in the absence of overt mental illness, which is expected to grow [4] more so in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic [5] . In this review, we provide an update on suicide rates and related vulnerabilities. We summarize notable prior literature and highlight more specific findings from the past 3 years. Finally, we end with a review of population-based approaches for reducing its risk. Table 1 shows suicide rates among adults ages 65 and older from 2009 to 2019. In the most recent decade, the highest rate was 16.67 per 100,000 seniors in 2019, reflecting a nearly stepwise annual increase, and a 60% increase as compared with 10.4 per 100,000 seniors 20 years prior. The nation's 65-and-older population has grown rapidly since 2010, by over a third (34.2% or 13,787 ,044) during the past decade and by 3.2% (1,688,924) from 2018 to 2019. In 2019, older adults made up 16.5% of the American population but they This article is part of the Topical Collection on Geriatric Disorders accounted for more than 19.4% of suicides. Approximately 71% of late-life suicides in the USA are the result of firearm use. Suicide attempts in this age group are usually fatal in the first attempt due to the lethality of means, existing fragility and lack of desire or opportunity for rescue [6] . While the crude suicidal death rate was 16.67 per 100,000 seniors in 2019 including all races, ethnicities and genders, the highest death rate was observed in white males ages 85 and above, at 54.41 per 100,000. Suicide rates among white males grow from late adolescence and see an abrupt increase from age 65, in contrast to elderly women, whose rates remain constant from 65. The prevalence of late-life suicide among white males, a group least likely to seek treatment for depression, has been the case since the early 2000s [7] (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "Systemic reviews suggest that older adults who died by suicide are different from younger suicide victims. Older victims had less evidence of maladaptive personalities and the majority did not meet the threshold for psychiatric diagnosis. The only significant association was with a relatively small number of older suicide victims who had obsessivecompulsive and avoidant personality disorders, which researchers suggest may account for more difficult transitions into later-life changes. They also noted that older suicide victims were more diverse in both risk factors and experiences compared with early-life suicide victims [8] . A cross-sectional case-control study comparing the personalities of 200 lateand early-onset elderly suicide attempters using the Five Factor Model echoed similar findings where older attempters scored higher on orderliness and conscientiousness. In contrast, younger attempters displayed higher neuroticism, borderline traits, lower extraversion, and higher antisocial traits [6] . Gujral's 2020 [9] study examined whether late-onset (versus early-onset) suicidal behavior is associated with worse cognition. They found that both attempter groups displayed worse executive functioning than non-suicidal depressed older adults. Late-onset attempters additionally displayed poorer global cognition and processing speed than non-suicidal depressed older adults and poorer memory than early-onset attempters.",

In study 2, experiences of defeat (powerlessness, poor coping to threats to autonomy/status) were more frequently endorsed by men and associated with disagreeableness. Study 1 revealed that attempters high in dysfunctional psychopathology were more likely to report self-oriented escape motives for suicide, while study 2 identified a putative pathway to suicide in men involving antagonism and the experience of defeat [15] . Another study examining motivation for suicide by Bickford 2019 emphasized \"perceived stress\" as a significant risk factor.

Studies suggest that white matter changes on MRI and executive dysfunction may underlie geriatric depression and predict poor antidepressant response [18] . Depression may then predispose and precipitate vascular events [20] . In Mikami's 2014 study, low-dose escitalopram provided to persons free of depression symptoms and anxiety within 90 days of an embolic stroke halved the incidence of depression, reduced the emergence of anxiety and was well-tolerated [21] . That geriatric depression is mediated by inflammation is a provocative theory. Plasma studies suggest that peripheral inflammatory markers are elevated in late life depression and associated with severity of both mood and cognitive symptoms. A recent prospective study found that inflammation predicted new onset depression in men more so than women. Participants (n = 10,357) with no evidence of depression at baseline (based on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), lifetime diagnoses, and current antidepressant medication) were evaluated for depression 5 years later. Multivariate logistic regression predicted the onset of depression based on C-reactive protein and white blood cell count. Based on both markers, inflammation was predictive of new cases of depression 5 years later, even after adjusting for sociodemographic, physical health, health behavior, and baseline depression symptoms. Inflammatory markers were predictive of depression in men, but not in women. Additional predictors for the onset of depression were younger age, loneliness, smoking (in men), cancer, and less alcohol consumption (in women). These gender differences in the etiology of depressive disorders within the community suggest a greater role of physical factors in men [22] .",

Many had one standard deviation fluctuations several hours apart within the same day\" [8] . This highlights the need to monitor fluctuations and not dismiss the possibility of sudden increases in suicidal urges, even when the current risk appears low.

The study was completed in 2019 using the National Violent Death Reporting System, 2003-2016 (n = 26,884) for suicide deaths for adults aged \u2265 65 years. ORs compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, cause of death, and precipitating circumstances based on coroner/medical examiner and law enforcement reports. Older male (69.1%) and female (50.2%) suicide decedents did not have a known mental illness. A physical health problem was the most prevalent precipitating circumstance but was more common among older adults without known mental illness. Past suicide attempt, disclosure of suicidal intent, depressed mood, and substance use were more common among those with a known mental illness. More than three fourths of suicide decedents did not disclose their suicidal intent. Most suicide deaths involved firearms, which were disproportionately used by decedents without known mental illness (81.6% of male and 44.6% of female decedents) compared with those with known mental illness (70.5% of male and 30.0% of female decedents) [26] .

Several crosssectional studies indicate an association between clinical frailty and gut microbiota composition (lower levels of butyrateproducing bacteria). Findings suggest that the causal link between microbiota and physical fitness is still uncertain due to a lack of targeted studies and the influence of covariates, including diet, exercise, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy, on both microbiota and physical function in older age.

A study comparing pre-and post-programming attitudes toward aging indicated a successful increase in positive age stereotypes and decrease in negative age stereotypes after a performance art program [37] . The scale utilized in this study, \"Expectations Regarding Aging\" met minimum requirements for psychometric validation (i.e., internal consistency, adequate content and structural validity) for assessing the \"stereotypes\" dimension of ageism, but not for the other two ageism dimensions \"prejudice and discrimination,\" highlighting the need to develop and validate a scale that more broadly captures the multidimensional nature of ageism [38] . Similar community-level campaigns were tested in Nuremberg compared with W\u00fcrzburg Germany, which resulted in a decline in suicide attempts after year one and even more in year two in Nuremberg. However, reductions were most noticeable in the use of lethal means and among persons less than 70 years of age [39] .",

Data suggest that those who died by suicide were less likely to be married, have children, or be involved in religious practice. Association between low social integration and suicide remained significant after controlling for psychiatric disorders and employment status. In addition to poor social integration and sense of belonging, the death of close relatives is a highly disruptive loss that constitutes a major risk factor for suicide. Mogensen reported the highest suicide risk during the 6 months following the loss of a close relative (40). The highest odds ratios for suicide were found in persons aged 45 and older who had lost a partner within the last month. Interestingly, loss of a spouse was associated with lower levels of belongingness in men, but not in women. The differential link between bereavement and sense of belongingness between men and women may be due to the different psychosocial function of marriage or lower ability for men to maintain social ties compared with women. Detecting high-risk patient populations with recent suicide attempts and those likely to be socially disconnected is a start. Connecting them with community activities, support groups and individual and group skills training may be effective. Provide training to maximize elderly use of technology to connect with health care providers, internet communities and existing social supports, like family and friends. Van Orden suggests creating \"a Connections Plan,\" for the depressed elderly, similar in concept a Safety Plan in Emergency Settings. They propose its widespread use in outpatient clinics and long-term care settings, as well as in early sessions of psychotherapy [1\u2022\u2022] .",
