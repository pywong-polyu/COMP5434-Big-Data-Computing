An ever-increasing amount of electronic data in health care are becoming available, much of which are coded. These data can be a rich source for secondary data analysis, accelerating scientific discoveries 10 . Thus, many researchers have been exploring data-driven scientific hypothesis generation guided by secondary data analysis 2, 11 , including genomics 5 . However, exactly how a scientific hypothesis is generated, even as shown by secondary data analysis in clinical research, is unknown. Understanding the detailed process of scientific hypothesis generation could improve the efficiency of delineating clinical research questions and, consequently, clinical research. Therefore, we are investigating the process of formulating scientific hypotheses guided by secondary data analysis. Using these results as a baseline, we plan to explore ways of supporting and improving the scientific hypothesis-generation process and study the process of formulating research questions as long-term goals.",

Thus, many electronic data are continuously captured and available for analysis to guide future decisions, uncover new patterns, or identify new paradigms in medicine. Much of the data is coded by hierarchical terminologies, such as the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM 14 ) and Tenth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD10-CM 15 ), Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT 16 ), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC 17 ), RxNorm 18 , Gene Ontology (GO 19 ), and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH 20 ). We use the coded data sets by hierarchical terminologies as examples of existing data sets to facilitate and articulate the scientific hypothesis-generation process in clinical research, especially when guided by secondary data analysis. We developed algorithms 21, 22 and a web-based secondary data analytic tool [23] [24] [25] [26] to use the coded electronic data (ICD9 or MeSH) to conduct population and other clinically relevant studies.",

More experienced clinicians used underlying situational knowledge about the clinical condition, while the novices used the surface structure of the patient information during the diagnostic generation process. Patel's 29,30 and Kushniruk's 31 studies used inexperienced and experienced clinicians with different roles, levels of medical expertise, and corresponding strategies to diagnose an endocrine disorder. In these studies, expert physicians used more efficient strategies (integrating patient history and experts' prior knowledge early) to make diagnostic decisions 29, 31, 32 . All these studies focused on hypothesis generation in solving diagnostic problems. Their results set the groundwork for reasoning in medical diagnostic process. Their findings (i.e., inexperienced and experienced clinicians generate diagnostic hypotheses via different processes) helped us formulate and narrow our research questions. Their methodology involved performing pre-defined tasks, recording \"thinkaloud\" sessions, and transcribing and analyzing the study sessions. Making a diagnosis is a critical component of the medicine and a routine task for physicians. If generating the initial diagnostic hypothesis is correct, there is no need to search further for alternative hypotheses related to a particular patient.",

The difference between the two can be demonstrated by the two enterprises, where the goal of generating a diagnostic hypothesis is to make decisions about a patient, and it is time constraint. In scientific research, time is not constrained, and the task is to explore various scientific hypotheses to formulate and refine the final research question. In both making a medical diagnosis in clinical practice and scientific thinking, generating initial diagnostic hypotheses depends on prior knowledge and experience 33, 34 . However, in scientific thinking, analogy and associations play significant roles in addition to prior knowledge, experience, and reasoning capability. Analogies are widely recognized as playing a vital heuristic role as aids to discovery 33 . They have been employed in a wide variety of settings and had considerable success in generating insight and formulating possible solutions to existing problems. This makes it essential for us to understand the scientific hypotheses generation process in clinical research and compare this process to generating a clinical diagnosis, including the role of experience during the processes.",

VIADS is a visual interactive analytical tool for filtering and summarizing large health data sets coded with hierarchical terminologies 23, 24, 35 . It is a cost-free Web-based tool available for research and educational purposes. VIADS can be used as registered users or as guest users without registration. Our group developed VIADS as well as the underlying algorithms over the years 22, 25, 36 . VIADS is designed to use codes from terminologies with hierarchical structures (for example, ICD9-CM, MeSH) and their usage frequency to achieve the following objectives: (1) provide summary visualization (i.e., graphs) of a dataset; (2) filter data sets to ensure manageable sizes based on users' selection of algorithms and thresholds; (3) compare similar datasets and highlight the differences; (4) provide interactive, customizable, and downloadable features for the graphs generated from the datasets. VIADS is a useful secondary data analytic tool that can facilitate medical administrators, clinicians, and clinical researchers make their respective decisions. For example, VIADS can be used to track longitudinal data of a hospital over time and explore the trends and detect the differences in diagnoses over time; VIADS can also be used to compare two similar medications and compare the medical events associated with the medications to provide detailed evidence to guide more precise clinical use of the medications 36 . Our study provided evidence of the different information needs between physicians and nurses via the algorithms of VIADS 22 . Figure 1 shows example screenshots of VIADS.",

Scientific hypothesis generation will eventually help to formulate relevant research questions. Our study aims to decipher the process of scientific hypothesis generation and determine whether a secondary data analytic tool can facilitate the process in a clinical research context. When combined with clinical researchers' experience and observations, we anticipate that such tools will facilitate scientific hypothesis generation. This facilitation will improve the efficiency and accuracy of testing scientific hypotheses, formulating research questions, and conducting clinical research in general. We also anticipate that an explicit description of the scientific hypothesis-generation process with secondary data analysis may provide more feasible guidance for clinical research design newcomers (e.g., medical students and new clinical investigators).

However, what is the perfect balance between systematic structure and randomness during scientific hypothesis generation is unknown.

We only considered experience levels and whether use VIADS for such a complicated cognitive process. However, even for such a straightforward design, the experienced clinical researchers only have one volunteer during recruitment thus far. Thus, we first focused on inexperienced clinical researchers.

To design a complicated experiment that answers more complex questions, we must consider the balancing practical workload, recruitment reality, expected timeline, and researchers' desire to pursue a complex research question.",
