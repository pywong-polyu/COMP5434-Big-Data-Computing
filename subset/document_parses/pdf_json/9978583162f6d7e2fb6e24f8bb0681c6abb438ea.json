To achieve the UK Department of Health's ambition to reduce stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates by 50% by 2030 (with a preliminary target of 20% by 2020) [6] it is important that fetuses at high-risk of mortality or morbidity are promptly identified and obtain additional monitoring. Current antenatal care guidelines provided by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggest all uncomplicated pregnancies only undergo fetal growth monitoring using fortnightly symphysis-fundal height (SFH) measurements from 26-28 weeks' gestation [7]. The NHS Saving Babies' Lives Care Bundle Version 2 (SBLCBv2) [8] further suggests that pregnancies classified as high-risk for FGR have uterine artery Doppler measurement at 20-24 weeks' gestation and serial ultrasound (US) scans every 2-4 weeks in the third trimester of pregnancy to measure the estimated fetal weight and umbilical blood flow. Furthermore, if the uterine artery blood flow is normal, these serial US scans will commence from 32 weeks' gestation, and from 28 weeks' gestation if abnormal [8]. This additional monitoring ensures fetuses with an estimated fetal weight less than the tenth centile are identified in a timely manner and can receive appropriate specialist care [8].",

These findings suggest the current gold-standard antenatal methods have failed to reliably detect fetal compromise.

As current methods used in clinical practice do not significantly improve perinatal outcomes, hence it is hypothesised that longer-term monitoring will increase the chances that signs of fetal compromise are detected [1] . Unfortunately US-based technologies (US scans, Doppler and CTG) cannot be used for a sustained period of time due to concerns about the unknown thermal effects of high intensity ultrasonic waves [15] . Therefore, novel technologies to continuously monitor the fetus for prolonged periods of time have had to be developed. To date, non-invasive devices with limited safety concerns have primarily focused on monitoring the FHR or FM pattern for extended time periods. In order to implement such devices into clinical practice, the views of healthcare professionals and pregnant women must be considered, both of whom have indicate that the use of CFM devices would be acceptable [16, 17] .",

Nonetheless, various CFM devices exist within the literature; however a clinical review of these technologies has not yet been performed. Therefore, this scoping review aimed to describe the available evidence to provide an overview of CFM devices developed for use in antenatal care to date, and to determine areas for improvement. This review included devices developed which can monitor the fetal heart rate and/or the pattern of FM for long periods of time.

I 2 , a statistic derived from Cochran's chi-squared statistic Q, was calculated to describe the variability between the studies that is due to between-study variability, rather than chance [20] . An I 2 value of <30% was classified as low heterogeneity between studies, 30-59.9% as moderate, 60-89.9% as substantial and \ufffd90% as considerable [21] . A random effects meta-analysis was used in anticipation of heterogeneity due to differences in study design and populations. When studies presented non-parametric data, estimated values of the mean and standard deviation were calculated using established methods [22] , in order to enable comparison using meta-analysis; when data were converted it has been stated in the results. Where meta-analysis was not possible, descriptive statistics were used.",

In addition, the arrangement of the sensors varied; all electrodes were placed abdominally, generally around the umbilicus, with the exception of four devices [32, 35, 41, 43] which required additional thoracic electrodes. A variety of signal processing approaches were used; the most frequently described process involved the removal of the mECG trace from the device signals.",

All the devices used between one and four abdominal phonocardiographic sensors, and two studies stated a specific placement of the sensors-either directly over the fetal heart [37] or in a predetermined abdominal position [41] . Furthermore, two studies securely attached the sensors to the maternal abdomen using either belts [32] or a 3-D printed plastic harness [41] . All fPCG devices utilised different signal processing methods. ECG data was collected in parallel for three studies [32, 37, 40] for either validation or to aid signal recovery, with one study using a US-based Doppler instrument for reference purposes [45] .The single combined fECG/fPCG device used a combination of electrodes and acoustic sensors, secured to the abdomen using a wireless belt, to monitor the FHR [46] . The FHR was independently detected by both methods and the signals combined to produce a reliable FHR trace. Performance of fECG devices. There was no common means of assessment to determine the accuracy or success rates of the devices in the included studies. Therefore, the accuracy or success of different named devices is not directly comparable; however studies which used the same named device were compared.",

Studies reported data on a variety of factors which could affect the performance of fECG devices: gestational age (15 studies), BMI (8 studies), time of day (5 studies), maternal movement (4 studies), fetal position (5 studies), location of recording (3 studies), maternal-fetal complications (5 studies), uterine activity (1 study), amniotic fluid index (1 study), multiple fetuses (1 study) and smoking status (1 study). These factors will be addressed in turn.",

The gestational age was broken down into distinct but unstandardized categories (e.g. 16 +0 to 19 +6 weeks' gestation) in ten of these studies [25, 33, 34, 36, 38, 40, 44, 49, 52, 55] , as shown in Fig 4. Overall, there was a reduction in the device performance in the middle gestational age categories, roughly from the start of the third trimester (28 +0 weeks) until 35-36 weeks' gestation. Moreover, the device performance was greatest at term or in post-term fetuses. Of the five studies not represented in Fig 4, a further two studies reported a decrease in the success between 24-34 weeks' gestation [58] and difficulty detecting a fECG signal at gestational ages 31 and 34 weeks [32] . The remaining studies reported opposing findings: one found the majority of unsuccessful traces were between 37-39 weeks' gestation [30] ; a single study found a weak positive correlation between the SQ and gestational age (p = 0.05) [26] ; and one study determined that the relative gap duration between successful traces significantly decreased with increasing gestational age (p = 0.04) [56] .",

Following analysis of the SQ throughout 24 hours, a higher SQ was found in hospital group during the day (daytime: hospital 43.3% vs home 40.2%) but was lower in the night-time (night-time: hospital 71.1% vs home 86.8%), when compared to home SQ (p<0.001) [36] . An estimated fetal weight less than the 10 th percentile was not reported to have any effect on the performance of fECG devices [36, 39, 56] ; these three studies used different terminology for the small fetal size (fetal-growth restriction, small-for-gestational age and intrauterine growth restriction). Kapaya et al. [39] did report a large difference in the mean success rate of SGA (48.6%) fetuses compared to appropriate-gestational age fetuses (75.7%), however no statistical analysis was performed on this specific data to determine any significance. Graatsma et al. [34] stated that no maternal-fetal conditions affected the fECG device, however the authors did not fcne these conditions and this cohort of hospitalised women were compared to women who had home recordings, hence it is unclear whether this was a confounding variable. In addition, the success rate of fECG recordings was not affected by structural heart disease [58] . On the other hand, participants suffering from pre-eclampsia had a greater proportion of valid recording time (p = 0.01) and fewer gaps in the FHR trace per hour (p = 0.04) [56] .",

            "text": "CFM devices which monitored the FHR were comprised of numerous fECG devices, fPCG devices and a single combined fECG/fPCG device. Currently only the Monica AN24 device, a fECG device, is in widespread use and was utilised in numerous studies, however its SQ exhibited high levels of variability between the different studies (mean SQ 68%, 95% CI 49-87%). Furthermore, studies with the largest cohort size showed the highest SQ suggesting that there is a possible learning curve in obtaining fECG recordings of optimal quality, however there was no statistically significant relationship between study size and SQ (p = 0.53, r 2 = 0.06). Whilst other FHR devices appear to have a better device performance, many have only been tested for short periods of time (median of 30 minutes) and hence their results must be viewed with caution with respect to CFM which would require longer-term monitoring. Various variables which could alter device performance were only evaluated in fECG device studies. A widely documented reduction in the performance of fECG devices was noticed between roughly 28 to 36 weeks' gestation. This has been attributed to electrical impedance from the vernix caseosa, a protective insulating layer which surrounds the fetus from 28 to 32 weeks' gestation and completely dissolves by 37 weeks' gestation [67] . The vernix caseosa has an impedance factor of 500-1000 higher than amniotic fluid [68, 69] and hence significantly reduces the fECG amplitude, however the FHR can still be weakly detected due to signal transmission through the umbilical cord, oronasal cavity and gaps within the vernix caseosa [67, 69] . Therefore, as the impact of gestational age on fECG trace quality is widely understood, further studies are not required to test this specifically but gestational age should be taken into consideration when evaluating the impact of other factors. Regarding novel fECG devices, ideally these should be initially tested after 37 weeks' gestation to minimise signal disruption, as this will elucidate whether the devices can accurately and reliably extract FHR and/or FM data.",

Moreover, although the location (hospital vs. home) of fECG recordings does not affect the overall success rates, day-time recordings are more successful in the hospital setting as women will move less and are often confined to their bed, whereas in the night-time recordings are less successful in hospital than at home as women could have a lower quality of sleep due to the novel environment, ambient noise and interruptions by health care professionals and other patients [36, 72] .",

One explanation could be that that uterine activity may mimic the effect of maternal physical activity causing disruption of the FHR signals. However, uterine contractions can trigger FHR accelerations [73] , a reassuring sign of fetal wellbeing. It is important that CFM FHR devices have the ability to detect these significant changes in the FHR variability, as lack of accelerations indicate fetal compromise requiring possible clinical intervention. Whilst other factors may or may not affect the quality and success of fECG devices, further research is required to deduce those which have a significant impact.",

Future use of larger cohorts will provide a clear overview of the association (or lack of) between the performance of accelerometers and fetal gestational age.

Therefore the FMAM appears to be more technologically advanced to have the ability to record FM overnight, compared to the remainder of FM devices which have only been studied for a maximum of 30 minutes. Substantial changes in the FM pattern can be indicative of fetal distress and often act as a 'warning sign' prior to stillbirth [1, 2] . However, FM patterns vary significantly between individuals and can alter weekly as pregnancy progresses [60] .

One proposition would be to determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy against concurrent use current gold standard methods using short recording periods (e.g. 20-30 minutes), and to report the signal quality in longer (i.e. >90 minutes) recordings. This approach would be applicable to both FHR and FM devices and will determine the suitability of devices for CFM, ensuring the FHR or FM pattern can be reliably recorded for long periods of time. It is anticipated that a standardised method of reporting will highlight favourable approaches. For CFM devices to be implemented into clinical practise, additional issues must first be addressed. Whether the device is primarily analysing the FHR or FM pattern, analysis must be individualised to each fetus and account for changes which occur in these parameters as pregnancy progresses [60] , however theoretically 'normal' patterns must also be known. This includes the normal fetal sleep patterns, response to uterine contractions and the normal fetal movement pattern throughout the day. This awareness will ensure any deviation from the normal FHR or FM pattern is detected via the CFM device.",

The implementation of CFM devices into clinical practice could reduce or potentially replace the need for current methods. However, concerns have been raised by women about the sole use of CFM in antenatal care, and many currently perceive CFM as an 'add-on' form of monitoring to current methods [26] . Nonetheless, the experimental use of CFM devices has already prevented adverse outcomes in a number of cases, specifically using the Monica AN24 [50] and the FMAM [78] . In addition to this, as well as providing reassurance to women that their baby is being actively monitored [17] , the use of a CFM device increases maternal awareness of fetal wellbeing [60] . This demonstrates the multiple benefits which can be achieved through the use of CFM in clinical practice, enabling timely identification of compromised fetuses which in turn could assist in the reduction of the stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates. Nonetheless, whilst clinical studies are still undergoing to assess the reliability of CFM it is also important that intermittent monitoring continues to take place so there is no deviation from current 'gold-standard' forms of practice.",

To date, numerous different CFM devices have been developed to address this need; however there is a high level of inter-device and intra-device variability and currently no approach appears to be advantageous. In addition, there appear to be numerous factors which affect the quality of CFM recordings, although these have only been investigated in fECG monitors and accelerometers. It is clear that gestational age, maternal movement and the time of day clearly alter device performance, however the evidence base for other factors such as the impact of BMI, uterine activity and the amniotic fluid index is sparse. Consequently, additional studies are required to specifically highlight the impact of such factors as this will help to aid the development of better devices and highlight certain pregnancies where the device's quality and diagnostic ability is reduced.",

Four studies reported data only using a figure, hence data reported were extracted from the original figures either by drawing a line to the axis (Carter et al. and Graatsma et al. (2009)), or by dividing the number of successful recordings by the total number of recordings (Manella et al. and Taylor et al.).
