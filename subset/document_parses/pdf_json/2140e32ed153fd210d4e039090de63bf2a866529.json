            "text": "Facility location (FL) is a well-known optimization problem that asks to optimally place facilities so as to serve clients at various locations, requesting a facility service, with minimum possible costs. Many variants of FL have been known, appearing as sub-problems in many applications in computer science, management science, and operations research. Most FL models studied thus far assume that clients need to be served by connecting each to one facility. To overcome facility failures and provide a robust solution, we investigate in this paper FL problems that require each client to be connected to multiple facilities, represented by an additional input parameter. The aim of the algorithm is then to provide a robust service to all clients while minimizing the total connecting and facility purchasing costs. This is known as the Multi-Facility Location problem (MFL) and has been studied in the offline setting, in which the entire input sequence is given to the algorithm at once. In this paper, we study MFL in the online setting, in which client requests are not known in advance but are revealed to the algorithm over time. We refer to it as the online multi-facility location problem (OMFL) and study its metric and non-metric variants. We propose the first online algorithms for these variants and measure their performance using the standard notion of competitive analysis. The latter is a worst-case analysis that compares the cost of the online algorithm to that of the optimal offline algorithm that is assumed to know all demands in advance. We further study OMFL in the leasing setting, in which facilities are leased, rather than bought, for different durations and prices, and each arriving client needs to be connected to multiple facilities leased at the time of its arrival. The aim is to minimize the total connecting and facility leasing costs.",

In its simplest form, we are given a set of facilities and a set of clients. Each facility has an opening cost and each client i has a connecting cost to each facility j, which is the distance between i and j. The goal is to open a subset of the facilities and connect the clients to open facilities so as to minimize the sum of the facility costs and the connecting costs. FL is known to have two versions, metric and non-metric. In the metric version, the distances are assumed to be symmetric and satisfy the triangle inequality.",

To capture such scenarios, the theoretical leasing framework has been introduced in [34] . In this framework, there are a number of lease durations, respecting the economy of scale, such that longer leases cost more but are cheaper per unit time.
