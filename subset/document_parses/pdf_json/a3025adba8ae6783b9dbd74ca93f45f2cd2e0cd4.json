            "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional organelle in the cytoplasm that plays important roles in female mammalian reproduction. The endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria interact to maintain the normal function of cells by maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis. As proven by previous research, glycine (Gly) can regulate the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) and enhance mitochondrial function to improve oocyte maturation in vitro. The effect of Gly on ER function during oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) is not clear. In this study, we induced an ER stress model with thapsigargin (TG) to explore whether Gly can reverse the ER stress induced by TG treatment and whether it is associated with calcium regulation. The results showed that the addition of Gly could improve the decrease in the average cumulus diameter, the first polar body excretion rate caused by TG-induced ER stress, the cleavage rate and the blastocyst rate. Gly supplementation could reduce the ER stress induced by TG by significantly improving the ER levels and significantly downregulating the expression of genes related to ER stress (Xbp1, ATF4, and ATF6). Moreover, Gly also significantly alleviated the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8 m) to improve mitochondrial function in porcine oocytes exposed to TG. Furthermore, Gly reduced the [Ca 2+ ] i and mitochondrial Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] m ) levels and restored the ER Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] ER ) levels in TG-exposed porcine oocytes. Moreover, we found that the increase in [Ca 2+ ] i may be caused by changes in the distribution and expression of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP 3 R1) and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), while Gly can restore the distribution and expression of IP 3 R1 and VDAC1 to normal levels. Apoptosis-related indexes (Caspase 3 activity and Annexin-V) and gene expression Bax, Cyto C, and Caspase 3) were significantly increased in the TG group, but they could be restored by adding Gly. Our results suggest that Gly can ameliorate ER stress and apoptosis in TG-exposed porcine oocytes and can further enhance the developmental potential of porcine oocytes in vitro.",

The ER and mitochondria are connected by mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and interact to maintain the normal function of cells by maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis (Ando et al., 2018) . An imbalance in calcium homeostasis can activate ER stress, which can lead to the transfer of ER Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] ER ) to the cytoplasm and can cause an increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ). When there is an overload of Ca 2+ in oocyte mitochondria ([Ca 2+ ] m ), it is accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damage to metabolic homeostasis, which can then cause damage to mitochondrial function, block the meiotic process of oocytes and reduce the developmental ability of oocytes .",

            "text": "Normally, intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis is dependent mainly on ryanodine receptors (RyRs), inositol-1,4,5trisphosphate receptors (IP 3 Rs) and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase pumps (SERCA pumps) in the ER (Santulli et al., 2017) . RyRs and IP 3 Rs release Ca 2+ from the ER lumen into the cytoplasm or mitochondria, and SERCA takes up free cytosolic Ca 2+ into ER stores (Bootman et al., 2001) . In the IP 3 R channel, Ca 2+ stored in the ER is released through IP 3 R, diffuses through the MAMs, is taken up by voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), and is transported to the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (MCU). This process maintains the dynamic Ca 2+ equilibrium. An imbalance in intracellular calcium homeostasis can induce ER dysfunction and ER stress. The inhibition of SERCA activity by thapsigargin (TG) caused an imbalance in Ca 2+ homeostasis and induced the occurrence of ER stress (Wu et al., 2012) . Excessive Ca 2+ influx into mitochondria causes the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, resulting in the production of ROS, and leads to the release of proapoptotic proteins, such as cytochrome C (Cyto C), which can not only influence the developmental potential of oocytes but can also induce cell apoptosis (X. M. Zhao et al., 2016) .",

The major UPR-associated pathways include the PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 pathways, which involve downstream molecules such as CHOP and Caspase 3/9/12 (Siman et al., 2001; Hitomi et al., 2004) , Xbp1 and Bip/Grp78, and ATF4 (Mei et al., 2013; Fung and Liu, 2014; Jheng et al., 2014) . In pigs, negative effects on oocyte maturation and embryo development occur as a result of ER protein misfolding and apoptosis (Lin et al., 2016) . However, research shown that the oocyte maturation rate and embryonic development can be recovered or even improved when ER stress is reduced (Ridlo et al., 2021) . Inhibition of the ER stress-related PERK pathway could significantly improve the embryonic development of aged mouse oocytes (Takehara et al., 2020) . In addition, it was previously reported that suppression of ER stress could significantly increase the maturation rate and decrease ROS levels and apoptosis in bovine oocytes (Khatun et al., 2020) . Therefore, we may improve the maturation rate of porcine oocytes by inhibiting ER stress in the in vitro maturation (IVM).",

Gly is ubiquitously distributed in oviduct fluid, uterine fluid and follicular fluid in sows and plays an important role in cell protection mechanisms against oxidative damage from ROS. Several studies have shown that Gly plays a crucial role in the development of oocytes (Zander-Fox et al., 2013) . In fact, we conducted basic research on the effect of Gly on porcine oocyte IVM in the early stage (Li et al., 2018; Wang Y. et al., 2020) . Our previous studies showed that 6 mM Gly treatment has a beneficial effect on oocyte IVM and subsequent blastocyst development after parthenogenetic activation (PA) by decreasing ROS levels and increasing mitochondrial function (mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8 m, ATP concentration) to reduce apoptosis and regulate gene expression related to development (FGFR2 and Hsfl) and apoptosis (Bax and Bcl2). Furthermore, we also proved that Gly could improve oocyte IVM by regulating the [Ca 2+ ] i to enhance mitochondrial function (Yu et al., 2021) .",

In ER The number of oocytes examined (1209) is the total of four independent assays. a,b Different superscripts within the same column differ significantly (p < 0.05). MII, metaphase II. Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 733860 stress related genes, the results showed that CHOP, Xbp1, and ATF4 were significantly decreased in mature oocytes after Gly treatment (Supplementary Figure S3) . After determining the role of Gly, to detected the effects of Gly on ER function in oocytes in exposure to TG, we tested the level of ER in cells by ER-Tracker Red. Compared with the control group and Gly group, the ER levels showed an obvious downward trend in the TG group (p < 0.05). However, the addition of Gly successfully improved the TG-induced decrease in ER levels ( Figures  4A,B) . To further confirm the effect of Gly on ER function, we detected the mRNA expression of typical genes associated with ER stress by qPCR. As shown in the results, Bip/Grp78, ATF4, ATF6, Xbp1, and CHOP were significantly increased in oocytes that received TG relative to the control oocytes. We then examined those putative central genes in the Gly treatment group, and the mRNA expression levels of UPR signalling pathway genes were normal ( Figure 4C ) (p < 0.05). Real-time PCR analysis revealed the induction of ER stress by TG, which increased the expression of most UPR marker genes. We hypothesized that there was a protective role of Gly on TG-induced ER stress. Based ] i in the TG group was visibly higher than those of other groups (p < 0.05), reaching almost twice as high as the control group. In the TG + 6 mM Gly group, although the level of [Ca 2+ ] i was still higher than that in the control group, it was not significantly different from that in the control group ( Figure 5B) . Importantly, to detect the whole dynamic balance of calcium ions in cells, we also stained the calcium ions in the ER and mitochondria with specific probes. The results showed that the trend for the mitochondrial calcium changes in the three groups was the same as that of [Ca 2+ ] i levels, while the calcium in the ER was opposite to the first two. The [Ca 2+ ] ER in the TG group decreased significantly, while the calcium ions in the control group and Gly group were significantly higher than those in the TG group ( Figure 5C ). In addition, we found that the levels of [Ca 2+ ] i and [Ca 2+ ] m were opposite to the mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8 m levels. In the TG group, the levels of [Ca 2+ ] i and [Ca 2+ ] m were increased significantly ( Figure 5D ), while the mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8 m of mitochondria decreased significantly, indicating that a high level of [Ca 2+ ] i was not conducive to the normal function of mitochondria in oocytes. In addition, to further determine the changes in calcium ion levels, we detected calcium ion-related genes by qPCR. The mRNA expression of calreticulin (CALR) was also significantly increased in the TG group ( Figure 5E ). To maintain the calcium ion balance in cells, ] ER outflow. Adding Gly could improve mitochondrial dysfunction and promote oocyte maturation. Therefore, the addition of 6 mM Gly could effectively change oocyte Ca 2+ levels, which were increased by TG. In order to confirm the regulatory effect of Gly on calcium ion, Gly was added separately and compared with the blank control group. The results showed that added Gly could decrease the [Ca 2+ ] i and [Ca 2+ ] m but could increase the [Ca 2+ ] ER , so Gly could affect calcium levels (Supplementary Figure S4) .",

            "text": "The ER is the main storage organelle of Ca 2+ , and mitochondria are the main effectors that regulate Ca 2+ uptake and intrinsic apoptosis in cells. The dynamic balance of Ca 2+ plays an important role in maintaining organelle function and homeostasis. ER stress could lead to an increase in the [Ca 2+ ] i induced by Ca 2+ transfer from the ER cavity to the cytoplasm. The increasing [Ca 2+ ] i is an important reason for mitochondrial dysfunction. In fact, our results illustrated that [Ca 2+ ] i levels were significantly elevated in porcine oocytes after TG treatment. At the same time, when the [Ca 2+ ] i level increased, the mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8 m began to decrease the [Ca 2+ ] i (Bustos et al., 2017; Missiroli et al., 2017; Prudent and McBride, 2017; Marchi et al., 2018) . The level of calcium ions in the ER decreased Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 733860 significantly in the TG group. Based on the principle of intracellular calcium ion dynamic balance, we think that after ER stress, calcium ions in the ER continue to be released outward, resulting in a surge of calcium ions in the cytoplasm. Further evidence at the gene level also confirms this result. The mRNA expression of CALR, the gene of a key ER calcium binding protein, was significantly increased. In addition, we found that when the intracellular calcium ion levels increased, the calcium ion levels in mitochondria increased significantly, but the mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8 m decreased significantly in the TG group. This result indicates that the high concentration of calcium in mitochondria will lead to damage to mitochondrial function. However, after the addition of Gly, the [Ca 2+ ] i , [Ca 2+ ] m and [Ca 2+ ] ER levels were rescued, and the mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8 m was also improved, which is consistent with the previous conclusion that reducing mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels can improve mitochondrial function (Zhang et al., 2020) . Several studies have shown that the protective effect of Gly is achieved by reducing intracellular Ca 2+ overload (Qu et al., 2002) . These results support the hypothesis that Gly reverses the ER stress induced by TG and improves the developmental competence of oocytes by regulating intracellular Ca 2+ levels.",

However, ROS and Ca 2+ signals regulate each other. Ca 2+ overload of the mitochondrial matrix can lead to an increase in ROS, trigger permeability transition pores, release Cyto C, and lead to apoptosis (Brookes et al., 2004) . Therefore, we measured ROS levels, and our results showed that ROS levels were significantly increased in the TG group. In addition, the dynamic changes between ROS and GSH are related to oocyte competence (Barros et al., 2019) . We also measured GSH levels in all groups, and the results showed that the GSH levels were significantly decreased in the TG group. Gly is the main component of GSH. Our previous study also verified that Gly treatment had a beneficial effect on in vitro oocyte maturation and blastocyst development by decreasing ROS levels to reduce apoptosis (Qu et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2021) . In this study, Gly treatment reversed the decrease in GSH levels and the increase in ROS levels induced by TG. It has been reported that the mitochondrial respiratory chain in oocytes caused by high levels of ROS is mediated by mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels; this is consistent with our results (Zhang et al., 2020) .",

CHOP can trigger the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the inhibition of BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 and the upregulation of BIM, which regulates BAX-BAK-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to Cyto C release and the Caspase cascade (Hu et al., 2018; Kim and Kim, 2018) . Previous studies have identified that the expression of key regulators of oocyte apoptosis (Bax and Caspase 3) is increased in mouse oocyte apoptosis (Escobar et al., 2019; Wang F. et al., 2020; Wang L. et al., 2020) . Overexpression of Bax modulates the mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8 m and triggers Cyto C release and induces the activation of Caspase 3, leading to DNA fragmentation and thereby oocyte apoptosis (Chaube et al., 2014) . Furthermore, Gly addition during both vitrification/thawing and maturation enhanced the oocyte quality, as demonstrated by the antiapoptosis effects in mouse oocytes (Anchordoquy et al., 2019) . Therefore, we examined Caspase 3 activity, Annexin-V signals and the expression of apoptosis-related genes, such as Bax, Bcl2, Caspase 3, and Cyto C. The results indicated that Caspase 3 activity and Annexin-V signals were significantly increased in the TG group, and the mRNA expression of Bax, Caspase 3 and Cyto C was significantly increased after TG treatment. Thus, Gly ameliorates the overexpression of apoptotic proteins and genes.",

            "text": "IP 3 R and VDAC1 are the main channels involved in MAM Ca 2+ transport. IP 3 R1 is located in the ER membrane, VDAC1 is located in the mitochondrial membrane, and IP 3 R connects with VDAC1 to control Ca 2+ release from the ER to mitochondria and the cytoplasm (Moltedo et al., 2019) . The Ca 2+ stored in the ER is released through IP 3 R, diffuses through the MAMs, is absorbed by VDAC1, and is transported to the mitochondrial matrix by MCU. Some studies have shown that increasing the [Ca 2+ ] i through IP 3 R induces ER stress and inhibits the UPR signalling pathway. Excessive Ca 2+ influx into mitochondria causes the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, resulting in the production of ROS, and leads to the release of Cyto C, which can not only affect the developmental potential of oocytes but can also induce cell apoptosis. Knockdown of IP 3 R1 expression in mice could improve mitochondrial function and alleviate oocyte damage caused by obesity (L. Zhao et al., 2017) . At present, two main pathways by which Gly prevents calcium overload have been reported: the binding of Gly with its receptor GlyR activates PKC and increases IP 3 , which activates the IP 3 R to increase intracellular Ca 2+ release. Additionally, the binding of Gly with GlyR leads to membrane hyperpolarization and decreases the opening of voltagedependent Ca 2+ channels (such as VDAC). Gly could reduce the extracellular Ca 2+ influx and alleviate Ca 2+ overload, which ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction and reduces apoptosis (Qu et al., 2002; Van den Eynden et al., 2009; Wheeler et al., 2000; Wheeler et al., 1999; Yamashina et al., 2001) . Therefore, we examined the cellular distribution and localization pattern of IP 3 R1 and VDAC1 during porcine oocyte maturation. IP3R1 and VDAC1 have been reported to be distributed in the cortex of oocytes and to form cortical clusters. Our study produced similar results, and we observed that IP 3 R1 and VDAC1 in porcine oocytes were distributed in the cytoplasm and formed cortical clusters in the control group. However, the distribution and mRNA expression of IP 3 R1 or VDAC1 were changed after TG treatment. Both IP 3 R1 and VDAC1 were transferred to and distributed in the cytoplasm when porcine oocytes were exposed to TG. The mRNA expression of IP 3 R1 and VDAC1 was significantly increased in the TG group. Fortunately, the distribution and mRNA expression of IP 3 R1 and VDAC1 were recovered to the control level after Gly treatment. Our results demonstrate that VDAC1 selectively interacts with IP 3 Rs and plays a key role in the processes by which the ER transmits Ca 2+ to mitochondria, affecting the function of the ER and mitochondria. It has been reported that there is a connexin Grp75 between IP 3 R and the Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 733860 VDAC1 pathway (Mendes et al., 2005; Szabadkai et al., 2006) , and researchers have found that calcium transport in cells can be regulated through the IP 3 R-Grp75-VDAC1 pathway. IP 3 R1 is the most widely expressed subtype in mammals. Therefore, in this experiment, we detected the IP 3 R-Grp75-VDAC1 pathway. The results show that calcium ions are likely to be regulated by this pathway during porcine oocyte IVM, which is similar to previous results. Finally, we tested whether early embryo development was affected by TG or Gly treatment. Compared with those of the control group, the TG group had a low cleavage rate, blastocyst rate, and cell number. However, treatment with Gly altered the effects of TG. An increasing number of studies have indicated that mammalian oocyte maturation and early embryo development processes are Ca 2+ -dependent. There are specific distribution patterns and dynamic changes in Ca 2+ that take place during the processes of bovine oocyte maturation and PA embryo development in vitro (Liang et al., 2011) . Therefore, the addition of Gly at the IVM stage is beneficial to the development of an early embryo after PA.",
