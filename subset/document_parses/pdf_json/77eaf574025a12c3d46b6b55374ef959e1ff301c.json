The current focus of several therapeutic design efforts explores attempts at affecting the binding potential between the two proteins to limit the activity of the virus and disease progression. In this work, we analyze the stability of the spike protein under all possible single-point mutations in the RBD and computationally explore mutations that can affect the binding with the ACE2 enzyme. We unravel the mutation landscape of the receptor region and assess the toxicity potential of single and multi-point mutations, generating insights for future vaccine efforts on mutations that might further stabilize the spike protein and increase its infectivity. We developed a tool, called SpikeMutator, to construct full atomic protein structures of the mutant spike proteins and shared a database of 3800 single-point mutant structures. We analyzed the recent 65,000 reported spike sequences across the globe and observed the emergence of stable multi-point mutant structures. Using the landscape, we searched through 7.5 million possible 2-point mutation combinations and report that the (R355D K424E) mutation produces one of the strongest spike proteins that therapeutic efforts should investigate for the sake of developing effective vaccines.",

The virus causing COVID-19 was termed SARS-CoV-2 3 , and shares sequence and structural similarity with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 4 and with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 5-7 . As of March 30, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected 128,006,406 people and sadly killed over 2,799,201 worldwide (https:// www. world omete rs. info/ coron avirus/). The pandemic has caused economic shutdown in many countries, fears of a global recession, restricted travel, closure of educational institutions, and mental distress on a global level 8-10 . With the drastic widespread and impact of SARS-CoV-2, many countries are still fighting against the second and third waves of the virus and fear the devastation of future waves 11 . SARS-CoV-2 contains a lipid envelope bilayer, with attached spike and membrane proteins, surrounding a stranded RNA genome of the virus 12 . Similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, the spike proteins in SARS-CoV-2 mitigate the attachment and binding of the virus to cell receptors and facilitate the release and entry of the viral genome into host cells [13] [14] [15] . The binding to host cells occurs at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) 16 in the S1 subunit of the spike protein. The mechanical stability of the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 is 50pn greater than in SARS-CoV, which could explain the rapid spread of COVID-19 17 . The SARS-CoV-2 RBD recognizes the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located in the lungs, heart, kidney and intestines as its host receptor 2,18 . Impeding the function of spike proteins has been the target of several antibodies, vaccines, and inhibitors [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

Every trimer structure contained one mutation that was simultaneously applied to each of the three aggregated spike proteins. The free energies generated by the all-atom simulation runs are reported in Figs. 3 and 4. Figure 3 plots a 3D mutation energy landscape of the receptor-binding domain. One axis in the landscape represents the amino acids positioned at residues 331 through 524, the second axis plots the 20 canonical amino acids, and the third axis captures the free energy of the mutant structure defined by the two other axes. Lower energy values correlate with favorable mutations that stabilize the RBD and can potentially improve binding with the ACE2 enzyme. Higher energy values suggest mutations that increase instability in the domain and potentially alter the binding dynamics with the ACE2 enzyme. The 3D landscape maps the possible outcomes of single-point mutations and exposes conserved regions and unstable ones. For some amino acid positions, the appearance of a mutation does not impact stability. At other www.nature.com/scientificreports/ positions, most mutations will cause an increase in destabilizing forces, illustrated in the 3D plot by red curves that create a wall-like barrier. Interestingly, the introduction of some amino acid mutations such as a C or D throughout the spike generally improves structural stability. Figure 4 provides a 2D projection of the landscape and makes it easier to visualize the energies across different areas of the RBD. We observe that a mutation including a negatively charged, polar and hydrophilic amino acid such as aspartic acid (D) or glutamate (E) would increase the stability of the receptor-binding domain. A positively charged, polar, and hydrophilic amino acid such as arginine (R) introduces some of the most unfavorable mutations in the region 419-434, located relatively inside of the spike trimer and far from the solvent accessible surface. The spike trimer contains an arginine (R) at position 355. The landscape plot suggests that this is an unstable residue position and that any other amino acid mutation at this position would increase the stability of the domain region. Hence, it is highly likely to observe a mutation at this position, which has actually been reported in a sequence from the UK on GISAID 23 . In addition, we found that 15 out of 19 mutations at position 331 and another 15 out of 19 mutations at position 343 increase the instability of the spike complex. Experimentally, it has been shown that disrupting the glycosylation in both of these positions greatly reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 38 .",

Among these countries, Qatar was the only country to report a spike protein with an insertion resulting in the longest known spike mutant with 196 amino acids. It is not known whether or not this longer sequence contributed to the country's low COVID-19 mortality rate (0.15%). The remaining 894 sequences had equal length to the reference spike sequence but exhibited one or more point mutations. We report in Table 1 the top country origins of these sequences and the E values generated using our mutation landscape and Eq. (2) . E measures the change in free energy between the mutant and nonmutant spike structures. Positive values indicate increase in instability and negative values indicate increase in stability within the RBD. We observe that all the countries in Table 1 report mutations that both stabilize and destabilize the receptor-binding domain, which could explain the varying severity of disease symptoms and health conditions reported in those countries 39 . Table S6 of the supplementary material is an extension of Table 1 and contains the complete list of countries. We report in Table S10 the E values of the top 10 stabilizing and top 10 destabilizing single-point mutations calculated using three different molecular dynamics forcefields. The results show that the forcefields are in agreement regarding the reported stabilizing mutations. The predicted mutations in the RBD region are increasing the Spike stability. The last column of the table presents an error estimate of the AMBER forcefield we used in comparison with the other forcefields. The error bounds are low, suggesting that the stability outcome of the reported mutations are independent of force-field uncertainties Table 2 lists the spike mutations that appear worldwide ranked in order of the number of reporting countries. Mutation V367F was reported in 12 countries and appeared in 51 sequences. Our energy landscape suggests that this mutation is favorable and further stabilizes the receptor-binding domain ( \ufffdE < 0 ). Other mutations exhibit positive E values and could lead to different binding potentials with the ACE2 enzyme, affecting the rate of disease, incubation periods and patient symptoms. Table S5 of the supplementary material reports the data for all 894 sequences. Table S7 of the supplementary material presents the point mutations reported in each country as of July 2020.",

It is interesting to note that all recent 2, 3, and 4-point mutations have a \ufffdE < 0 , suggesting a mutation drive to further stabilize the receptor-binding domain and potentially increase infectivity. The 2-point mutation (V367F G413V) that was reported in Spain appears to have evolved from the widely spread mutated sequence (V367F) reported in 12 countries. No other sequence reported a G413V mutation. Although we do not know the order in which the other mutations have appeared, it is theoretically possible for a sequence to undergo a destabilizing mutation first and then after some time experience a strong stabilizing one that brings the structure to a more overall stable conformation. The sequence with the 3-point mutation (Q506H P507S Y508N) could have undergone its first destabilizing mutation (Q506H \ufffdE > 0 ) and then experienced two stabilizing single point mutations (P507S \ufffdE < 0 ) and (Y508N \ufffdE < 0 ). If this is the case, then other spike sequences that have become mild or less dangerous because of destabilizing mutations could potentially experience future mutations that cause a regain in toxicity potential, and cause a periodic increase and decrease in COVID-19 symptoms.",

However, if a vaccine can show good results on one of the most stable www.nature.com/scientificreports/ mutant structures, then it is possible that it will also show good results on many less stable ones.

            "text": "To further explore the effect of the (R355D K424E) mutation on the spike's structure and stability compared to the non-mutant native type, we ran molecular dynamics simulation of 50 nanoseconds on both the full www.nature.com/scientificreports/ non-mutant native type and mutant structures. We report in Fig. 5a the RMSD graph of the simulation run. The RMSD graph shows that the mutant structure exhibits a more stable and energetically favorable conformation compared to the non-mutant native type. When we superimposed the resulting structures at time = 50ns onto their initial conformations, we found that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the mutant structure was more conserved than the NTD in the non-mutant native type. Figure 5c ,d shows a schematic of the 2 structures superimposed on their initial starting conformations, plotted in gray. The increase in RMSD values in the mutant graph of Fig. 5a at around time = 20 ns was due to a slight translation shift of the entire RBD region. Figure 5b shows the RMSF plot of the simulation run and captures this change in RBD position. Although the mutation has induced an overall increase in stability, the RBD region's conformation has been altered. We plot in Figs. S1 and S2 the residue contact map of both the native and mutant structures at time t = 0 ns and t = 50 ns. The results show that the mutant structure is more stable than the native protein. Compared to the native structure, the mutant had lost 15 less contacts, made 4 extra new contacts, and preserved 10 additional contacts. This gain in stability can affect binding to the ACE2 enzyme, and might impose new identification challenges for antibodies. For these reasons, the (R355D K424E) should be tested against potential vaccine candidates. The 2-point and 3-point mutations that countries have reported are still far from the most stable conformations possible. It appears that the virus still has millions of possible candidate mutations to select from to increase the receptor-binding domain's stability and potentially become more toxic. www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

Prior to calculating the energy of this new structure, we perform a short energy minimization (EM) run using the GROMACS 2019.3 molecular dynamics package 44 to relax the structure and remove any severe steric clashes. The setup of the run is as follows: molecules were prepared in a cubic box (with a minimum distance of 35 \u00c5 from any edge of the box to any atom) and neutralized with chloride ions and modeled using the AMBER99SB-ILDN 45 force field along with the TIP-3P water model. We used a cutoff of 10 \u00c5 for van der Waals and short range electrostatic interactions, and calculated long range electrostatic interactions using a particle mesh Ewald sum 46, 47 . 2000 EM steps were performed for every structure using a steepest descent algorithm and the Verlet cut-off scheme. Simulations to generate the RMSD and RMSF plots in Fig. 5 were prepared for a full MD run in both isothermal-isobaric and canonical equilibration ensembles. Twenty five million time steps were used with an integration time step of 2 fs to simulate 50 ns. The residue contact maps of structures undergoing MD have been generated using the GoContactMap server 48 with the following GO parameters: Sequence distance = 4, Cutoff long = 1.1nm, and Cutoff short = 0.3nm. Supercomputer resources. To perform our simulations, we resorted to the cloud-computing system provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Constructing the energy landscape was possible with the utilization of 24 EC2 machines with 16 CPUs each running in parallel for several weeks. The full molecular dynamics simulation of the native and the (R355D K424E) mutant structures required 2 machines with 36 CPUs each. The SpikeMutator algorithm and a copy of the GROMACS 2019.3 molecular dynamics package 44 was installed on each machine. Generating the 7.5 million possible combinations of 2-point mutations and ranking their energies was also made possible with these machines on AWS.",

We observed that the sequences isolated from COVID-19 patients exhibited some mutations that both increased and decreased the spike's structural stability. Out of the 7.5 million possible 2-point mutation combinations, we found that the (R355D K424E) mutation produces one of the most stable spike proteins and should be included in the testing of possible vaccines and molecular inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.",
