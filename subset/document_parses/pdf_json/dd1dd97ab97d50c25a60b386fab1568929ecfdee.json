A major regulator of cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis, in normal and cancer cells, is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK influences cell growth via its modulation of the mechanistic target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, specifically, by inhibiting mTOR complex mTORC1, which facilitates cell proliferation, and by activating mTORC2 and cell survival. Given its conflicting roles, the effects of AMPK activation in cancer can be counter intuitive. Prior to the establishment of cancer, AMPK acts as a tumor suppressor. However, following the onset of cancer, AMPK has been shown to either suppress or promote cancer, depending on cell type or state.",

This has stimulated interest in targeting mTORC1 for cancer therapy. Notably, rapamycin and its analogs bind to a domain separate from the catalytic site to block a subset of mTOR functions, inhibiting cell growth [6] . A limitation of rapamycin is that it is only an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2, the latter after a prolonged administration, but rapamycin does not fully block mTOR activity [7, 8] . Second generation mTOR inhibitors that target the catalytic site of mTOR to block mTOR activity have been developed [9] . However, while the potency of these inhibitors in slowing cell growth and proliferation has been demonstrated, their toxicity has limited their usage [10] . Furthermore, the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells allows them to trigger mTOR-independent mechanisms to compensate for the inhibited mTOR activity, thereby allowing the cells to acquire sufficient nutrients for growth and proliferation. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve therapeutic strategies to maximize their benefits [11] .",

            "text": "Among the several proteins associated with mTOR and the formation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, one particularly intriguing modulator is the DEP domaincontaining mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR). Taken in isolation, DEPTOR inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 [12] . However, when feedback loops are taken into account, the overall impact of DEPTOR on mTOR signaling becomes more complex [13] . While DEPTOR depletion promotes mTORC1 activity, its loss has been reported to unexpectedly inhibit mTORC2 [12] . Conversely, overexpression of DEPTOR reduces mTORC1 signaling and promotes mTORC2 activity [12] . This apparent paradox can be attributed to the mTORC1/Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) feedback loop, whose opposing effect on mTORC2 dominates over DEPTOR. Because DEPTOR affects the signalling of mTOR and PI3K, which are key modulators of cell growth, survival, and proliferation, the relationship between DEPTOR and cancer is a promising research focus. But as is often the case in cancer research, the ideal target compounds may differ depending on cancer types. In most cancers, DEPTOR expression is low [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Thus, it may be beneficial to administer compounds that enhance the stability of DEPTOR or its connection to mTOR, in an attempt to suppress mTOR and the growth, survival, and proliferation of cancer cells. However, in some other cancers, e.g., multiple myeloma, DEPTOR expression is elevated [12] . Here, compounds that impair the DEPTOR-mTOR connections may be beneficial.",

Known as a master regulator of cellular energy, AMPK is a heterotrimeric kinase complex consisting of a catalytic \u03b1-subunit and two regulatory subunits, \u03b2 and \u03b3 [19] . Under conditions of low energy, AMPK phosphorylates specific enzymes and growth control nodes to increase ATP generation and decrease ATP consumption. The link between AMPK and cancer was first identified through the tumor-suppressive function of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which phosphorylates AMPK and leads to mTORC1 inhibition [20] . Studies in animal models and humans have suggested that compounds that activate AMPK have health-promoting effects, including improvements in diabetes, cardiovascular health, and mitochondrial disease, and even extension in life span [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, the role of AMPK in tumorigenesis is controversial: while studies have suggested that AMPK suppresses cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation [25] , recent evidence also suggests that AMPK can promote T-ALL tumor cell growth through cell energy maintenance in some model organisms [26, 27] . Further complicating the picture, a direct link between AMPK and mTORC2 was recently discovered [28] [29] [30] , which reveals the ability of AMPK to promote cell survival under energetic stress situations and emphasizes the strong interplay between anabolism and catabolism regulators: AMPK and the mTORC family [29] .",

How might a DEPTOR inhibitor differentially modify a cancer cell's propensity to proliferate and persist? And how are these effects impacted by the cell's microenvironment? The multitude of biochemical reactions and feedback loops involved in the metabolic pathway are difficult to untangle. As such, we developed a computational model to simulate the effects of pharmacological maneuvers that target key metabolic signalling nodes, with a specific focus on AMPK, DEPTOR, and mTORC. Model simulations clarify some of these conflicting effects and provide a better understanding of the role of key metabolic signalling pathways in tumorigenesis. These findings may yield insights on innovative therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy that targets relevant metabolic networks in cancer.",

Nonetheless, model parameters are constrained by biologically plausible values. To determine the baseline parameter set, we perform careful calibration using data from multiple experimental studies. Specifically, model parameters are calibrated to satisfy the following criteria simultaneously: (i) the model predicts oscillations in mTORC1, ULK1 and AMPK under energetic stress that approximate experimental data in Ref. [38] , (ii) the feedback response of mTORC1 to variations in AMPK approximate experimental data in Ref. [39] , and (iii) the model predicts changes in AMPK and AKT activation in response to treatment of AICAR, an AMPK activator, consistent with experimental data in Ref. [29, 40] . We seek to satisfy criteria (i)--(iii) simultaneously via an iterative process. Criterion (i) is satisfied by optimizing the predicted time-profiles using the interior point algorithm in the MATLAB built-in function fmincon. Criterion (ii) is satisfied by adjusting parameters K_AMPK and K_AMPK_by_SIRT1 to minimize the least-square difference between the predicted mTORC1 and mTORC2 response curves, as the fractional activation of AMPK varies from 0.1 to 1.0. Criterion (iii) is satisfied by adjusting parameters K_AMPK and K_AMPK_by_SIRT1 to minimize the difference between the measured and predicted AMPK and AKT activation levels. These procedures are repeated iteratively until all three criteria are satisfied simultaneously. Baseline model parameters are given in Table 2S (supplemental materials).",

However, given AMPK's impact on cellular energy and cycle, as well as the heterogeneity of cancer cell types, are there microenvironments under which AMPK activation may be harmful to the organism's overall survival? To investigate this possibility, we simulated cellular microenvironments with different metabolic stress levels by considering a range of V_IR values. V_IR determines the activation level of IR; consequently, higher V_IR values correspond to higher insulin and thus glucose levels in the microenvironment, and vice versa. For each V_IR value we varied AMPK abundance and analyzed changes in key variables mTORC1 and mTORC2 to assess the effects on the cell population. Results are shown as a surface plot in Fig. 4B . We are particularly interested in the implications in cancer. Because mTORC1 and mTORC2 promote cell proliferation and survival, respectively, the simultaneous inhibition of both proteins may help to limit the proliferation of cancer cells. For a given AMPK activation level, increasing nutrient availability (V_IR) generally promotes cell population growth. That is intuitive and not at all surprising. A more interesting consideration is how AMPK activation may impact tumor cell population at different nutrient levels. Activation of AMPK facilitates the phosphorylation of mTORC2 but inhibits mTORC1. What is then the combined effect of AMPK activation on cancer cell proliferation and survival? Interestingly, the answer depends on the cell microenvironment, specifically, on the nutrient level of the cancer environment. At low nutrient levels, which corresponds to low insulin receptor activation (V_IR = 0.00737 in Fig. 4) , increasing AMPK abundance from 20 to 480 increases phosphorylated mTORC2 by 3.87 folds, but has a relatively negligible effect on mTORC1 activation, despite AMPK's general inhibitory effect on mTORC1. This is because the inhibition of mTORC1 by AMPK is partially offset by the indirect activation of mTORC1 by mTORC2. Taken together, enhancing AMPK abundance results in a 13% increase in total phosphorylated mTORC1 and mTORC2, which suggests that AMPK activation may have a detrimental effect on promoting the cancer cell population. See the left set of bars in Fig. 4A and the red diamonds in Fig. 4B . In contrast, in a microenvironment with sufficiently high nutrient levels (V_IR = 0.02), increasing AMPK abundance from 20 to 480 reduces the total phosphorylated mTORC1 and mTORC2 by 22% (right set of bars in Fig. 4A and the blue squares in Fig. 4B ). Thus, for cancer cells with chronic nutrient deprivation, AMPK inactivation is expected to have the beneficial effect of limiting their population. ",

This result is consistent with the observation that AMPK activation promotes prostate cancer cell growth under glucose deprivation [45] . However, while AMPK activators such as metformin are widely available, the same cannot be said for AMPK inhibitors. The AMPK inhibitors such as Compound C, which has been shown to suppress the growth of some tumors and SBI-0206965 [46] , are limited to laboratory applications [47] . Hence, for potential clinical applications we consider an alternative, indirect inhibition of AMPK. SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin protein family, is known as one of the activators of AMPK through the deacetylation of LKB1 [48] . SIRT1 can be inhibited by EX-527, which results in mTOR activation and may be beneficial in certain inflammatory injuries [49] . Thus, we assessed the effect of SIRT1 inhibition on mTORC1 and mTORC2 dynamics under different cell microenvironments. We simulated the application of a SIRT1 inhibitor at a dosage that reduces SIRT1 bioavailability to 10% of its baseline. We then examined the resulting AMPK and mTORC dynamics under different nutrient levels.",

These profiles were obtained for three different nutrient levels, at V_IR = 0.1, 0.005, and 0.002687. Each profile was normalized by its peak value in that case. In all three cases, SIRT1 inhibition suppresses AMPK. By 62% under conditions with sufficient nutrients (V_IR = 0.1; Fig. 5A1 ), and to a lesser but still significant extent at lower nutritional levels (52 and 43% at V_IR = 0.005 and 0.002687, respectively; Figs. 5B1 and C1). At V_IR = 0.1 (i.e., sufficient nutrients), the decrease in activation of AMPK that follows SIRT1 inhibition enhances mTORC1 activation by 30% and reduces mTORC2 activation by 71% (Figs. 5A2 and A3). However, these effects are substantially attenuated at lower nutritional levels, with only 3 and 4% changes in mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation levels, respectively, at V_IR = 0.005 (Figs. 5B2 and B3), and with those effects becoming negligible at V_IR = 0.002687 (Figs. 5C2 and C3). These results suggest that SIRT1 inhibition may promote cell proliferation and limit survival, but that effect may be insignificant under severe nutrient deprivation. This result may seem inconsistent with the model prediction discussed earlier (Fig. 4A) , where under nutritional stress, inhibiting AMPK significantly reduces total phosphorylated mTORC1 and mTORC2. That discrepancy can be explained, in large part, by the magnitude of AMPK reduction: in Fig. 4A , AMPK activation decreases by 24 folds, which may be achievable by an inhibitor that directly targets AMPK; whereas in Fig. 5C , indirect inhibition of AMPK only reduces its activation by 43%.",

However, given the many protein-protein interactions, inhibition of mTORC2 inevitably affects mTORC1 activity, with potential unfavorable consequences. To understand the synergistic effect on cell proliferation and survival, we simulated the effect of a mTORC2 inhibitor, by varying the rate of deactivation of mTORC2 (V_pmTORC2). Given the somewhat unintuitive effect of AMPK activation on cell growth identified above under nutrient deprivation, model simulations were conducted for a range of AMPK abundance with V_IR = 0.002687. In this parameter regime, model solutions are oscillatory. The two surfaces shown in Fig. 7 correspond to the maxima and minima of the solutions. Additional response curves for mTORC1 and mTORC2 are shown in Figs. 3S and 4S. Inhibition of mTORC2, which corresponds to high V_ pmTORC2 values, inhibits mTORC1 via AKT deactivation. Under nutritional deprivation, the competing effects on the two mTOR complexes yield an overall reduction in total phosphorylation of mTORC1 and mTORC2; see Fig. 7A . This trend is observed for the range of AMPK abundance considered. However, that comes with the potentially detrimental effect of enhancing cell proliferation, as evinced by the increasing pmTORC1/ pmTORC2 ratio as V_pmTORC2 increases (Fig. 7B ) for a fixed AMPK. As such, to simultaneously suppress both cell proliferation (mTORC1) and survival (mTORC2), one may combine a mTORC2 inhibitor with an AMPK activator. At sufficiently high V_pmTORC2 and AMPK values, both the sum and ratio of phosphorylated mTORC1 and mTORC2 attain their minima (Fig. 7B) . ",

Thus, AMPK plays a key role in coordinating metabolic pathways and in balancing nutrient supply with energy demand. Because of the favorable physiological outcomes of AMPK activation on metabolism, AMPK is believed to have therapeutic importance for treating obesity, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease [51] . A number of roles have been hypothesized for AMPK in tumorigenesis, both as a promoter and a suppressor. A potential role for AMPK in limiting tumorigenesis is supported by its activation at low ATP by LKB1 [20] , which is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutationally inactivated in a number of cancers. Administration of AMPK activators has demonstrated anti-tumorigenesis effects in culture and mice, and in some genetic contexts [52] [53] [54] . Activated AMPK phosphorylates downstream targets that activate catabolic pathways, while switching off anabolic pathways and other ATP-consuming processes. As a result, AMPK not only promotes ATP synthesis but also restricts cell growth and proliferation in an attempt to restore energy homeostasis and maintain cell viability. However, a conflicting role for AMPK emerges as it is found to promote cell survival under nutrient-poor conditions. This effect is particularly relevant for cancer cells, which are often challenged with insufficient nutrients in the microenvironments to support their needs. Thus, AMPK is also hypothesized to play a pro-tumorigenic role and its presence may be essential to sustain the rapid growth of some cancer populations. Indeed, findings in cancer cell lines and orthotopic xenografts [27] suggest that AMPK is required for some tumor cells to survive under metabolic stress [45, 55] .",

This question is challenging to answer due to the complexity of the signalling pathways that regulate cell growth, which involve many positive and negative feedback loops. To attain insights into the synergy among these processes, and to unravel the effect of activating or inhibiting AMPK under different cellular microenvironments, we have developed the present computational model. To interrogate the effect of AMPK activation on cancer cell population, we applied the model to assess the effect on mTORC1, the activation of which promotes cell proliferation, and mTORC2, the activation of which favors cell survival [29] . Model simulations (Fig. 4) suggest that under nutrient-poor conditions, AMPK activation may have an overall pro-tumorigenic role by facilitating cellular survival and hence the growth of cancer. In contrast, with sufficient nutrient availability, the anti-proliferation effect of AMPK dominates, and AMPK acts as a tumor suppressor. Taken together, whether AMPK is pro-or anti-tumorigenic depends, in part, on the nutrient level of the microenvironments of the cancer cells.",

They observed that AMPK deletion caused a drastic loss in leukemia cells in the bone marrow, a nutrient-poor environment, but that effect is substantially attenuated in leukemia cells in the spleen, where nutrients are relatively plentiful [56] . These findings have potentially groundbreaking implications in cancer therapies. Before the onset of cancer, there was clearly no concern regarding the effect of AMPK on cancer cell survival. Hence, the health impacts of AMPK activators such as metformin are clearly positive. But in established cancers, AMPK can be a double-edged sword [57] . In most cancers, the affected organs (e.g., spleen) are well perfused and cancer cells have access to sufficient nutrients; under these conditions, AMPK opposes cancer growth and proliferation. But in some cancers, the microenvironments are nutrient-poor (e.g., bone marrow leukemia), and cancer cells are more dependent on AMPK activity. In that case, the activation of AMPK would increase the viability of the tumor cells and thereby potentially decrease survival of the patient. Thus, in cancers such as bone marrow leukemia, it would be an AMPK inhibitor rather than an activator that might be therapeutically useful.",

However, while SIRT1 inhibition influences mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation levels, those effects are insignificant when nutrients are scarce (Fig. 5) . Given that this is the cell microenvironment in which AMPK inhibition may limit cancer cell population growth (Fig. 4) , what are the alternative means of simultaneously suppressing mTORC1 and mTORC2, if not via SIRT1 inhibition? The predicted negligible effect of SIRT1 inhibition may be attributable to the significant but insufficiently large impact on AMPK activation. With a 90% reduction in SIRT1 abundance, the model predicts less than 50% reduction in AMPK activation under nutrient deprivation, due to the opposing effect from the mTORC1-ULK1-AMPK feedback loop (see Fig. 1 ). In contrast, when AMPK is much more strongly inhibited, the model predicts significant changes in mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Fig. 4A ). An implication of these results is that, if one seeks to combat a cancer whose growth is known to be promoted by AMPK activation, indirect inhibition of AMPK may not be sufficient due to the many compensatory feedback loops in the network. Direct AMPK inhibition may be required. Compound C is available as an AMPK inhibitor and has been demonstrated as a tumor suppressor for certain cancer types [58] . However, due to its toxicity Compound C is currently limited to laboratory applications. Similarly, the specificity of another AMPK inhibitor SBI-0206965 has been questioned [59] . Hence, cancer research may benefit from enhanced effort in the development of a clinically usable AMPK inhibitor.",

This fact points to the potential of mTORC2 inhibitors in cancer treatment. Indeed, selective mTORC2 inhibition has shown promise in blocking breast cancer cell growth and survival and in slowing the migration and metastasis of melanoma cells [60] . However, given the many proteinprotein interactions, inhibition of mTORC2 inevitably affects mTORC1 activity, possibly with detrimental outcomes. Furthermore, excessive inhibition of mTORC2 may overly suppress AKT, which is essential in the translocation of GLUT4, and lead to insulin insensitivity [61] . Our simulations indicate that if a mTORC2 inhibitor is used in an anti-cancer therapy, its effect in combating the progression of cancer will be enhanced by combining it with an AMPK activator (Fig. 7) .",

The role of DEP-TOR as a tumor suppressor is consistent with its low expression revealed in a number of human cancers, including pancreas [14] , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [15] , lungs [18] , and breast cancer [16] . The role of DEPTOR in inhibiting tumor progression may be attributed to its ability to repress cell migration, which is necessary in metastasis and cancer progression. Supportive evidence is provided by the significantly reduced DEPTOR expression reported on the invasive front of endometrial cancer tissues. Consistency with the multifaceted nature of most aspects of cancer, DEPTOR has been reported to be overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells [12] , which suggests a role of oncogene rather than tumor suppressor. Whether and how DEPTOR might promote metastasis in specific contexts awaits clarification in future studies. Our model simulations suggest that the relative effect of DEPTOR on cancer cell proliferation and survival depends on its expression level and other factors, including metabolic stress and AMPK activation level (Fig. 6) .",

The cascading effects and feedback response can be fully explored using the present model. For example, the DEPTOR simulations suggest that with adequate nutrients, administering either a DEPTOR activator or inhibitor can shift cell fate away from proliferation in favor of cell survival; but in nutrient deprivation, DEP-TOR inhibition may introduce oscillations in mTORC (Fig. 6) . Another potentially impactful application of the model lies in the exploration of drug-drug interactions. In the mTORC2 inhibitor and AMPK activator simulations, the model predicts that when co-administered, these drugs may effectively limit the cancer population and the effect of both drugs on the system is not additive and is difficult to predict without a mathematical model (Fig. 7) .",

Specific signalling pathways may differ among cell types; e.g., whether AKT directly or indirectly phosphorylates AMPK appears to depend on cell types [63, 64] . Also, molecular alterations involving the mTOR pathway have been reported in a number of cancer types [65] , which may limit the implications of the model's predictions to cancers. Despite its limitations, with appropriate extensions the model may yet prove useful in investigations of cell growth and metabolism in mammals, in both health and disease. Indeed, the model is applicable to many diseases other than cancer [31] . One example is diabetes. One novel anti-hyperglycemic medication is the sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which targets the kidney [66] . SGLT2 inhibition in diabetes is known to delay the progression toward or of diabetic kidney disease and offer cardiovascular protection [67] . An additional benefit demonstrated at least in the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin is its activation of AMPK [68] , which may have positive effects on kidney metabolism. To study how the administration of canagliflozin affects renal hemodynamics and bioenergetics in a patient with diabetes, one may incorporate the present model into a computational model of kidney function and metabolism [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . Furthermore, mTOR pathways in conjunction with AMPK may be therapeutic targets for controlling cell injury, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the onset of hyperinflammation [74] , a significant disability associated with COVID-19 [75, 76] .",

Major findings include the importance of cellular nutrient level in determining whether AMPK is a cancer suppressor or promoter. Model simulations also indicate that SIRT1 inhibition may produce markedly different cellular dynamics depending on cellular nutrient levels. Consequently, the simultaneous direct inhibition of mTORC2 and activation of AMPK may suppress both cell survival and proliferation. In sum, simulation results clarify the competing effects and the roles of key metabolic signalling pathways in tumorigenesis, which may yield insights on innovative therapeutic strategies. ",
