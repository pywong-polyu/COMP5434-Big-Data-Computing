The infection is typically found in AIDS patients and in other immunocompromised persons. Cryptosporidium species are also common and dangerous waterborne pathogens. 1 Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the most frequent causes of enteritis and diarrhoea in postnatal calves, lambs, goat kids and in other agriculturally important animals. The economical, hygienic and zoohygienic impact of cryptosporidiosis is significant. 1, 2 Control of the infection in human and veterinary practice is complicated by a lack of effective therapy. Although immunotherapy, mainly administration of hyperimmune colostrum, may improve the clinical status of patients, chemotherapy is the main therapeutic approach. 3 However, none of the known anticryptosporidial drugs, such as paromomycin, azithromycin and nitazoxanide used mostly in humans, or halofuginone-lactate approved for anticryptosporidial therapy of calves, is absolutely effective. 4, 5 Better anticryptosporidial drugs with minimal residuality and toxicity are still needed in human and veterinary clinical practice.",

Indeed, commercial ATA used in most biological studies, including the present, is a chemical compound whose chemical structure is still being discussed. ATA was originally thought to be a triphenylmethane dye, but the dye's structure is still incorrectly used in much of the ATA-related literature. Commercially available ATA is actually a heterogeneous mixture of polymers of the phenol formaldehyde type. 17 In addition, it is known that ATA readily polymerizes and that its biological activity varies with the molecular weight. 8 A study on the effect of ATA fractions on nuclear swelling and on in vitro RNA and DNA synthesis even found that significant biological activity can be attributed to formaurindicarboxylic acid, an impurity found in commercial preparations of ATA, whereas pure ATA was found to be almost inactive. 18 A complete understanding of the relationship between the chemical structure and the biological properties of ATA is essential before ATA is considered for clinical use, including as an antiprotozoal drug. Our data indicate that commercial ATA preparations have strong anticryptosporidial activity and that the treatment was well tolerated in mice. In light of the limited therapeutic options for treating cryptosporidiosis, further evaluation of ATA is clearly justified. .
