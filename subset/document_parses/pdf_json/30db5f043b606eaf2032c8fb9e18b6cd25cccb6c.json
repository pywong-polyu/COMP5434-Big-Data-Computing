On August 16, 2020, there were over 8.96 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 760,000 deaths [1] . As the first country fighting COVID-19, the Chinese government launched the first level of measures in Wuhan and in other cities in Hubei Province in response to the major public health emergency on January 23rd and 24th, 2020, respectively, followed by other provinces [2] . The government enacted measures including social distancing, stay-at-home orders, the closure of non-essential businesses, and regional lockdowns during the epidemic period [3] . The significant reduction in human activities caused the slowing or even stagnation of industrial production, which inevitably led to a reduction in energy consumption [4] , carbon emissions [5] , and industrial pollution [6] . By using environmental monitoring data, the impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on China's economy [7] , human mobility [8] , income inequality [9] , and secondary health risks [10] can be estimated. Moreover, stagnation provides a perfect sample of how industrial emissions will change if more effective policy intervention is taken to address future industrial emission reduction. However, an understanding of the environmental changes that have occurred during the COVID-19 epidemic is still needed.",

            "text": "Studies have investigated the correlation between epidemics and the atmospheric environment, including temperature [11] , humidity [12] , and others [13] . A few studies have focused on the impact of the epidemics on air quality. Zhang et al. [14] used the WRF-GC model, an online coupling of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale meteorological model and the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry model, and tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) column observations to estimate the top-down emission changes in nitrogen oxide (NOx) in eastern China from January 1, 2020, to March 12, 2020 . They found that the average NOx emissions in East China decreased by 50% during the epidemic compared with the values before the pandemic. Meanwhile, they also found that NOx emissions in most provinces in East China began to recover after February 10 but did not return to the levels observed in early January. Wang et al. [15] analysed changes in PM 2.5 under different emission reduction cases in the North China Plain from January 1 to February 12, 2020, by using the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ). Their research indicated that the reduced anthropogenic activities after the COVID-19 outbreak did not mean that severe air pollution events were avoided. Concentration data for air pollutants obtained by remote sensing [16] and numerical weather prediction models [17] can reflect the real-time change in air quality during the COVID-19 epidemic period. Air quality changes are dynamic and can be affected by many factors, including meteorological conditions [18] , human activity [8] , and industrial production [19, 20] . Therefore, using remote sensing data to analyse changes in air pollutant concentrations cannot help us understand changes in pollutants in different industrial sectors [21, 22] . In addition, although a few studies have analysed the contributions of industrial sectors to atmospheric environmental change during epidemics [23, 24] , they have mainly combined industrial operations data to speculate on possible influencing factors, lacking real-time observation data as evidence.",

Its spatial agglomeration is related to the development of the regional social economy [32] . NOx is an important component of atmospheric particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) [33] and the precursor of ozone (O 3 ), a toxic air pollutant [34] . Understanding how the epidemic would affect industrial NOx emissions can also help constrain future NOx budgets and quantify human health impacts [35] . Initial estimates of NOx emissions changes based on a limited sample of power plants and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) have suggested that the tropospheric NOx concentrations dropped sharply after the Wuhan lockdown [36] . Therefore, the monitored NOx emissions and the operating vent numbers during the epidemic could be effective indicators to assess the real-time impact of COVID-19 on industrial sectors.",

To accomplish this task, we first divided the NOx emissions data into three periods based on the dates for the Chinese New Year. Them, the number of operating vents and the emission concentrations of 20 industrial sectors compiled from 9169 key polluting enterprises in China were calculated for each period. On this basis, the natural breakpoint method was used to evaluate the spatial distribution of operating vent numbers and emission concentrations, and the relative change rate was used to estimate changes among the three periods in each sector. We also selected the typical sectors with the largest changes to show their change patterns. Finally, by comparing the changes in the NOx operating vent numbers and emission concentrations in the same period of 2020 and 2019, we estimated the changes in NOx emissions in all provinces and cities of China affected by the COVID-19 epidemic. Our study provides new insight into how the shutdown for COVID-19 affected industrial emissions and air quality, thus helping us propose more detailed suggestions to reduce the annual average NOx emissions of sectors or enterprises in China after the COVID-19 event. In addition, our study can provide a reference for assessing the social, economic, and environmental impacts (e.g., job and profit loss, carbon emission reduction, etc.) of COVID-19 and other natural and human-induced disturbances as the global epidemic situation continues to worsen.",

Therefore, we divided all emissions data into three groups based on the date of the lunar calendar, including the normal operations period (pre-COVID-19 outbreak) (P1), the Spring Festival period (P2), a seven-day national holiday, and the epidemic period after the Spring Festival (P3). Generally, many enterprises begin to stop working approximately one week before the Spring Festival (P2). Therefore, we eliminated data from the week before the Spring Festival and took data from two and three weeks before the festival as the baseline data indicating the normal emissions of key enterprises. The data for P3 were used to analyse how enterprises were affected by COVID-19 after the Spring Festival, and it was defined according to the timing of the level 1 cancellations in all provinces and cities of China in response to the serious public health emergency (SI Table S2 htt p://www.nhc.gov.cn/). The data from the same period in 2019 were taken as the control group, i.e., the NOx emissions of key enterprises in China without the impact of COVID-19.

Examining the daily trend in the number of NOx vents in the four sectors (Fig. 6) , it can be seen that the number of vents in each sector was higher in 2020 than in 2019. The daily change trends in the number of NOx vents in sectors B, C, and D were similar in 2019 and 2020. The number of NOx vents began to decline around January 12 in 2020, reached the lowest point in P2, and then began to gradually increase. However, the number of NOx vents was affected by COVID-19, and thus the number increased by less than 10%. Specifically, in 2020, the average number of NOx vents in sectors B, D, and F from P2 to P3 increased by 2.67%, 1.64%, and 8.19%, respectively, while the number in sector C decreased by 0.48%. The average number of NOx vents in sectors B and F in P2 of 2020 exceeded the number in P2 of 2019 ( Fig. 6a and d) . The operating vent numbers of sectors C and D reached the same level they reached in 2019 after February 4, 2020 (Fig. 6b and c) . It is worth noting that in 2019, the number of NOx operating vents in sectors C, D, and F returned to the pre-P2 level within 7 days, which is significantly different from the trend seen in the same period in 2020. Compared with the same period in 2019, in 2020, the recovery rate in the number of NOx vents in sectors B, C, D, and F decreased by 79.23%, 100.31%, 96.97%, and 104.24%, respectively. These results indicate that the operating vent numbers of these four typical sectors were seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the NOx operating vent numbers in all sectors gradually recovered after the Spring Festival, the recovery rate is far lower than that for the same period in 2019.",

The NOx (w) 5 38 \u00b1 2.80) decreased gradually, which is similar to the changing trend for NOx operating vent numbers.

In contrast, the NOx (w) 5-day in 16 provinces showed a positive change, with the largest increases in Inner Mongolia (3.99 \u00b1 1.37).

This result is mainly because these areas were less affected by COVID-19, and when the epidemic was basically under control, enterprises there were able to restore production quickly. In Hunan (0.13 \u00b1 0.10), Jilin (0.23 \u00b1 0.16), and Shanghai (0.08 \u00b1 0.34), the NOx (w) 5day had a positive change, but it declined gradually.

During P1, North, East, and Central China had higher values of NOx emission concentrations and operating vent numbers. In P2 and P3, the most rapid decline in operating vent numbers also occurred in these three regions. In China, more than 70% of enterprises are located in these regions, which means that most of China's production capacity is concentrated there. Moreover, the governments in these areas are more open than those in West China [38, 39] , so they were able to more quickly respond to the emergency measures put forward by the state and work out effective measures to limit population flows and unnecessary business activities in a short time. Therefore, enterprises in these regions were more affected by the epidemic, resulting in more significant changes in NOx emissions. In contrast, because Northwest China is far from the outbreak's epicentre, enterprises are scattered and numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases are low, neither NOx emission concentrations nor operating vent numbers have a downward trend in P2 and P3 but instead show a slowly increasing trend. From the provincial differences, the provinces with a rapid and continuous decrease in operating vent numbers were mainly Hubei and its surrounding provinces and the eastern provinces (SI Fig. 3 ). This result may be caused by the relatively serious epidemic situation in these areas. Hubei, as the epicentre of the outbreak in China, maintained a low level of NOx vent numbers and emission concentrations in the P3 period. However, in Zhejiang, Shandong, and Shanghai, after the number of confirmed cases became relatively stable, local governments quickly took effective measures to resume production. As a result, the number of NOx vents and emission concentrations began to recover early.",

The manufacturing industry (C) is one of the pillar industrial sectors in China, and is largely composed of labour-intensive enterprises. Affected by the Spring Festival holiday and COVID-19, the NOx emission concentrations and operating vent numbers in the manufacturing industry in P3 of 2020 slightly increased after a short-term decline. This trend occurs because after the epidemic outbreak, some manufacturing enterprises had to resume production to supply emergency materials. The NOx operating vent numbers in the power, heat, gas, and water production and supply industry (D) are basically the same as those in 2019, while the emission concentration is approximately half of that in the same period in 2019. This result shows that in P3, the basic energy supply of the country was guaranteed, but its consumption intensity was effectively controlled. This result is in accordance with the conclusion of Hu et al. [35] . Moreover, although NOx operating vent numbers and emission concentrations in the wholesale and retail industry (F) declined rapidly during the Spring Festival, they increased rapidly in P3 and even exceeded the corresponding level in 2019. This result is due to China's developed logistics system and convenient online shopping environment. The NOx operating vent numbers and emission concentrations in other sectors, such as the education, agriculture, financial, and real estate industries, experienced a slight decline after the epidemic outbreak. This decline occurred because, on the one hand, the NOx emissions generated by these sectors were limited and, on the other hand, the nature of enterprises in these sectors meant that they had a strong ability to resist the risk of this epidemic.",

In places where key polluting enterprises are concentrated (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and East China), the impact of the epidemic on the emission concentration of key polluting enterprises varies greatly. Therefore, when planning to reduce NOx emissions in such areas, enterprises with outdated clean technology should be eliminated, and the emissions of enterprises with an emission concentration exceeding the regional average level should be strictly controlled. However, regions with a small number of polluting enterprises and a significant increase in NOx concentration during the epidemic period, such as western and northeast China, should pay more attention to improving regional clean technology on the premise of meeting the local market demand. Among the four typical sectors in this study, there are fewer NOx vents in sectors B and F than in the other two sectors, this number slightly decreased in P2, and the recovery after the epidemic was faster. However, the (w) 5-day in sectors B and F decreased by approximately 60% and 80%, respectively, after the COVID-19 outbreak, and the (w) 5-day data were scattered. This means that NOx emission concentrations emitted from a few enterprises in these two sectors are much higher than the average level. Therefore, when formulating NOx emission reduction measures for polluting enterprises in sectors B and F, more attention can be paid to the control of a few enterprises with high emission concentrations. In contrast, there are many key polluting enterprises in sectors C and D. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of NOx vents recovered slowly, but the (w) 5-day recovered quickly. This shows that when controlling the NOx emissions of enterprises in these two sectors, more attention should be paid to reducing the number of enterprise emission outlets than to reducing the NOx emission concentration. Specifically, to reduce NOx emissions in sectors C and D, it may be more effective to focus on eliminating enterprises with outdated production capacity on the premise of ensuring the necessary regional supply than to improve the enterprise cleaning process on a large scale.",

This result shows that the comprehensive analysis of operating vent numbers and emission concentrations of NOx can be used to reflect the impact of COVID-19 on the NOx emissions of enterprises. In addition, our results may have some deviations due to the increase or decrease in the NOx emission monitoring ports of enterprises. However, the automatic monitoring data of key polluting enterprises have clear quality requirements and standardized data auditing processes.

There was a negative change in the number of NOx vents in 17 provinces caused by COVID-19, among which the number of vents in Shandong Province decreased the most (\u2212 1823 \u00b1 80.59). After the Spring Festival, the (w) 5-day also showed a trend similar to that of the vent numbers. In 13 provinces, the (w) 5-day showed a negative trend, and the (w) 5-day of Anhui Province changed the most (\u2212 129.92 \u00b1 4.20).",

Western and northeast China could focus on improving the clean technology of enterprises to work out effective NOx reduction measures. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and East China should strictly control enterprises with high NOx emission concentrations and force enterprises with outdated production capacity to shut down. When formulating NOx emission reduction measures for polluting enterprises in sectors B and F, more attention can be paid to controlling a few enterprises with high emission concentrations. For sectors C and D, it may be more effective to focus on the elimination of enterprises with outdated production capacity. ",

The NOx operating vent numbers of 17 provinces showed a negative change, of which the value decreased the most in Shandong Province (1823 \u00b1 80.59), followed by that in Jiangsu Province (\u2212 420 \u00b1 142.95). In contrast, the average number of NOx vents in Hunan (1 \u00b1 1.24), Inner Mongolia (27 \u00b1 55.83), Hainan (45 \u00b1 8.15), Yunnan (66 \u00b1 54.79), and Shaanxi (143 \u00b1 48.36) showed a positive change during this period. This result shows that the epidemic had little impact on the number of NOx vents of key enterprises in these regions, which might be because there were smaller numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 found in these provinces.
