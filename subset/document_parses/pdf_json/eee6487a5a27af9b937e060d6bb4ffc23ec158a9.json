            "text": "Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea among children worldwide. In 2017, Italy included rotavirus vaccination in its National Immunization Program. The use of social media monitoring, an efficient tool to understand vaccine hesitancy, has increased in recent years; however, only a few examples of such monitoring are available for Italy. Present study analyzed content on online sources, including social media, to identify factors contributing to Italian parents' decisions to vaccinate or not their children against rotavirus. Blogmeter Suite was used to search and analyze conversations related to rotavirus in Italian on online sources during 2020. These data were compared with data from 2019. There were 2250 mentions of \"rotavirus\" recorded; 1080 were related to the rotavirus vaccine. Terms and hashtags used were similar in both years. Facebook was the main source of influence, Instagram dominated the engagement (the sum of interactions related to a post), and Google Trends showed a 5-year upward trend in searches for rotavirus vaccine. Of 1270 sentiment opinions, 60.7% were negative. More parents were familiar with the disease and the vaccine in 2020 compared with 2019. Pediatricians were the most influential healthcare professionals (59.2% of mentions), followed by vaccination staff (33.4%). The most relevant factors for vaccine hesitancy were fear of adverse events, concerns about the vaccination schedule, and COVID-19. Present study represents the first web listening analysis of online discussions about rotavirus. The results can be used to inform targeted communication to counteract misinformation and raise awareness about rotavirus vaccination among parents.",

            "text": "Social listening includes the monitoring of social media conversations to identify the topics being discussed and gain an understanding of the mood of individuals posting on social media (i.e., qualitative analysis), while social monitoring focuses on data collection and metrics, such as engagement rates or numbers of mentions (i.e., quantitative analysis). 12 Web listening platforms incorporate softwares capable of performing in-depth semantic network analyses of words, concepts, or sentiments to understand and register the discussions as a person would do. The social media data obtained are organized into conceptual cognitive maps and are prepared for structural, lexical, and semantic analyses. The results of these analyses are organized and stored in databases and reports that are easy to read by users; they can be visualized using visual analytics platforms (such as Tableau Software). 11, 13 The number of studies reporting social media as a source of information about public perception of vaccines has increased in recent years. Various social media platforms were used for these research purposes. For instance, Google Trends was used to monitor interest in preventable infections (e.g., influenza, meningitis, and human papillomavirus) and related vaccines between 2004 and 2016; 14 the search engine Google.fr was used in 2013 to evaluate the strategies and arguments used by vaccine opponents on French-speaking websites; 15 in Poland, posts on the online forum \"Nie szczepimy\" (\"We Don't Vaccinate\") were examined to study attitudes toward vaccine hesitancy and vaccine refusal among the population; 16 Twitter was used to investigate the proportion of vaccine-related posts linked to webpages of low credibility; 17 Facebook posts were analyzed to investigate trends in perception around influenza vaccines from 2015 to 2018; 18 WhatsApp and Telegram were used to analyze content related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Iran; 19 and Sina Weibo, China's largest social media platform, was used to examine concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic that were raised and discussed. 20 While content related to vaccines is widely present across all social media platforms, only a few examples of web listening in relation to vaccines and vaccination have been carried out in Italy. A set of such studies explored vaccine hesitancy and the perception around maternal immunization among pregnant women. [21] [22] [23] To date, no social listening study relating to rotavirus vaccination has yet been published.",

These factors were all analyzed a posteriori (i.e., after the extraction of the subsets of data from the corpus obtained through web listening); a description of this framework can be found applied in Andreotta et al. 24 ",

Research in the past has unraveled a strong relationship between consumption of social media and vaccine hesitancy. It was specifically found that users on social media can \"selfselect content streams, contributing to ideological isolation\" and thereby form their opinion on vaccination, as recently demonstrated for the COVID-19 vaccination. 30 The approach of identifying in the qualitative analysis content related to vaccination to assess the overall opinions and feelings of people regarding specific vaccines has previously been tested by Basch et al. to assess the safety of pediatric vaccines through analyses of YouTube videos. 31 Rather than creating a direct link between specific metrics (such as positive or negative sentiment) and vaccine hesitancy, the quantitative data analysis helped us assessing the overall opinion of parents and extracting topic subsets (i.e., factors of influence) in the vaccination journey. Compared with 2019, more parents were aware of rotavirus and the need to have their children vaccinated against it. This increase was probably generated in part by rotavirus disease awareness campaigns specifically designed for parents 32 and by campaigns promoting pediatric vaccination in Italy. The latter were carried out by institutions such as the Italian Ministry of Health and National Institute of Health 33, 34 or scientific societies such as the Italian Federation of Primary Care Pediatricians (Federazione Italiana Medici Pediatri; FIMP). 35 The personal experiences of other families and the guidance of pediatricians were also important, especially for first-time mothers.",

Personal experience is also important, with second-and third-time mothers being more confident and less anxious about vaccinating their children, while first-time mothers need more information and reassurance before having their children vaccinated. Similar behavior was reported by Danchin et al. in a survey of 975 women in Australia published in 2018. The authors found that first-time mothers were more hesitant about vaccinations for their newborns than mothers who already had children. 36 The present study highlights a certain level of participation by fathers in online conversations about rotavirus vaccination. Although fathers participate less than mothers, no differences between fathers and mothers could be detected with regard to the nature of their opinions or concerns with regards to rotavirus vaccination. We noted that fathers rarely participate in online maternity communities, which are mostly populated by mothers. The absence of online communities dedicated to paternity means that apparently the voices of fathers remain unexpressed. However, these voices exist, and can be found in publications of non-gendered online communities. This should be kept in mind when framing communication campaigns or counseling programs about childhood vaccination, to ensure a more gender-balanced communication.",

The COVID-19 pandemic also exerted a negative impact on vaccination against rotavirus. Vaccination plans were delayed in areas affected by the pandemic due to logistical obstacles, but also because of parents' fear of COVID-19 infection if they visited a health center. As a result, rotavirus vaccination coverage decreased notably in 2020. 25 The findings of this research identified some rotavirus vaccine hesitancy topics.

For example, an institutional web listening service could be set up, to promptly provide scientifically-validated information to individuals engaged in discussions that could lead them to refuse rotavirus vaccination for their children. Such information could include data showing intussusception is a condition that occurs naturally in Italy, independently from rotavirus vaccine implementation, 41, 42 and also that risk factors, such as previous consumption of antibiotics, can independently contribute to the condition. 43 Alternatively, if a child experiences an adverse event following rotavirus vaccination, a deeper dialogue with the parents could be started by the family pediatrician and/or public health personnel, to manage expectations in terms of their medical understanding.",

A recent example that highlighted its potential was a systematic scoping review commissioned by ECDC in 2020, which was conducted by researchers from the Vaccine Confidence Project. 11 The review concluded that social media monitoring is a plausible way of capturing the nature and direction of online discourses about vaccination and could be helpful in understanding how social media can influence public perceptions and therefore decisions about vaccination. Such information could then be used to restore public confidence in vaccines. 11 The European Joint Action on Vaccination project, cofunded by the Health Programme of the European Union (Work Package 8), is conducting a comprehensive analysis of the factors that influence perceptions around vaccines among the general population in different countries. The data generated from the monitoring of social media and web resources will be used to identify the most efficient practices to help overcome vaccine hesitancy. 44 In Italy, there are various reports of the use of web listening to monitor the insights of web users about vaccinations and to measure trends in hot topics. For instance, in 2017, 560 YouTube videos related to the unfounded link between vaccines and autism or other serious side effects in children were subjected to a quantitative analysis that revealed a negative tone in most of the videos. The authors urged greater engagement on the web by public institutions, to provide reliable information about vaccination to the population. 26 The same platform was used in an observational study carried out from September 2015 to January 2016, in which the search keyword used was \"vaccinations.\" In contrast to previous results, most of the videos were positive in tone, although the most shared and liked videos disapproved of immunization. 27 Other platforms have been used for the analysis of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination coverage in Italy 28 and to study the impact of the \"FLUAD case.\" 29 The FLUAD case highlighted the crucial need for adequate information campaigns. Following a cluster of deaths related to the administration of an influenza vaccine (FLUAD, Seqirus), two contaminated batches were withdrawn, but no link between the influenza vaccine and the deaths was ever confirmed. Nevertheless, this incident fostered huge media coverage that negatively impacted influenza vaccination coverage. 29 These examples highlight the role of new media and the importance of disseminating high-quality information to raise vaccination awareness.",
