The purpose of the study was to present local treatment of hypodermic necrosis caused by docetaxel extravasation in course of systemic cancer therapy. A woman, 59 years of age, in course of systemic therapy due to advanced cancer of the left breast (T2N1M1 CS IV) with confirmed metastases within the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra and in the liver, receiving a combination treatment with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel. During the therapy, a conservative treatment was applied due to extravasation for over three months. Effects in the right forearm included swelling, redness, signs of 4x10cm inflammatory infiltrate, with 1x4cm necrotic crust visible in the central region. Hypodermic necrosis was debrided using L. sericata maggots, and subsequently specialist dressings were applied to promote granulation and healing. In the case discussed here, effectiveness of MDT was rather poor, however the treatment minimised the risk of infection associated with evacuation of necrosis. Attempts to use MDT should be continued to enable more comprehensive understanding of problems related to management of necrosis in wounds developing during cancer therapy.",

Although such approach gives a chance of recovery, it may also carry a risk of undesirable symptoms and complications. These include localized reactions following extravasation of cytostatic agents that is leakage from the veins. Extravasation occurs in 0.1-7% cases of intravenous administration of cytotoxic drugs, with the rate of serious consequences in the range of 0.01-1% (1), or from 0.26% to 4.7% following administration via the central vein (2) .",

The therapy is recommended for use in the case of various types of infected or necrotic wounds where the standard surgical intervention is not recommended or its effectiveness would be uncertain or relatively low for the patient. Clinical observations explicitly show that by using the maggot therapy it is possible to reduce the duration of the process and to remove necrotic tissue from the wound with great precision, compared to the conventional methods involving application of surgical interventions and specialist dressings (hydrogels, and hydrofibers) (5, 6) . Increased interest in MDT also results from the growing antibiotic resistance of infected chronic wounds and poor effectiveness of the conventional methods (4) .",

The treatment was continued without effect for over three months. In the meantime, the patient's chemotherapy was continued via a newly implanted venous access port. In February 2020 the patient was referred to a chronic wound care clinic for assessment of the lesion on her forearm. The examination (19 Feb.) showed the patient was capable of auto-and allopsychic orientation, as well as self-care (Barthel Index 85 points). Symptoms visible in the right forearm included swelling, redness, and signs of 4x10cm inflammatory infiltrate, with 1x4cm necrotic crust visible in the central region, as well as a high risk of infection, 3 points in WAR (Wound at Risk) scale. The assessment also showed symmetric and normal range of motion in the joints and muscle strength of the limb. A request was made for computed tomography of the forearm, to be performed during radiological assessment of the cancer therapy (22 Feb.) ( Fig.  1 ). The patient was informed about the possible treatment which would involve opening of the wound and its debridement with Lucilia sericata maggots, to be followed with application of specialist dressings promoting granulation and healing of the wound. The patient's attitude towards this method was assessed with MDT acceptance questionnaire which showed high level of motivation and the patient's consent for the therapy. Consequently, the damaged skin was opened by incision and gentle dissection of tissue layers. Necrotic subcutaneous tissue was revealed; the wound was drained using silver-impregnated mesh dressing (At-rauman Ag\u00ae, Hartmann). The maggots were ordered from Biolab Polska; one day before the application, the use of antiseptic was discontinued. Ultimately, 25-30 free-range maggots were used (28 Feb.). Zinc ointment was applied to the skin around the wound to secure it against chemical irritation produced by the maggots. At the time the dressings were applied, the skin was secured with lubricating and protective agents Ozonella\u00ae (Onkomed) and Arcalen\u00ae (Herbapol).",

Again, very poor therapeutic effect was observed, the larvae debrided only a small part of the wound, revealing its base (approximately 20-30% of the necrotic tissue). At the same time larvae from the same culture were applied in other patients, and in that case effectiveness of the debridement process exceeded 70%, which disproved the assumption about the \"poor quality colony\". After evacuation of the larvae, the liquefied necrotic tissue was removed with a curette, and antiseptic gel Prontosan\u00ae (B.Braun Melsungen) as well as hydrofiber dressing Durafiber\u00ae (Smith & Nephew) were applied to the wound.

Docetaxel reduces the growth and development of neoplasm. It was stipulated that the poor growth and death of the larvae may have been caused by the cytotoxicity of the necrotic tissue which the maggots were to eliminate by feeding on it. Of significance here is the type of dead tissues to be removed. Experience of these authors suggests that dead muscle and skin tissues provide excellent nourishment for maggots, while tendons and fasciae are assimilated less effectively -this seems to be reflected by the growth of maggots on the specific days of a therapy continued for up to 3-4 days. By comparison, these authors reported 70% effectiveness of wound debridement therapy applied in home setting. The 200 cm\u00b2 wound in the forearm, resulting from extravasation of calcium chloride, was debrided in 72 hours with the use of 100 larvae (10) . This suggests good potential of MDT. These authors' observations, however, suggest that MDT cannot be applied to each patient with a necrotic wound, and this is consistent with .",

Topical administration of antibiotic to skin affected by a disease is a frequent procedure in dermatology (14) , however this approach is not effective, and is controversial when it comes to treatment of chronic wounds particularly those of large size. Topical antibiotics present numerous benefits since they come in direct contact with pathogenic bacteria and reduce a risk of systemic side effects while presenting a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity owing to the high concentrations of the active ingredient at the location in which they are applied (15) . Topical administration initially leads to high concentrations at the relevant location, without causing toxic levels in the blood serum, yet it poses a risk of inducing resistance and produces bacteriostatic effect at concentrations which are difficult to control in the case of topical application. The agents used in the relevant case included ciprofloxacin (administered orally), as well as (off-label) gentamicin applied at a dose of 15 mg (3 mg/1cm\u00b2) on hydrofiber dressing, and in course of 10 days there was a decrease in fibrin and a rapid decrease in the size of subcutaneous compartment owing to growth of granulation tissue.",

            "text": "In the literature there are very few studies investigating effectiveness of gentamicin administered topically. Feasibility of dressing impregnated with gentamicin has not been extensively investigated, except in some cases of osteomyelitis (16) ; the method has also been recommended for use in treatment of chronic infections in patients with diabetic foot (17) . The consensus published by Kramer et al. recommends that combinations of antiseptics be used in local treatment of wounds highly at risk of infection (14) , however in specific difficult cases antiseptics prove to be ineffective and systemic administration of an antibiotic produces insufficient benefits for the patient. Given the above, in this case the authors decided that efficacy of topical administration should assessed in course of the controlled observation. The applied procedure proved to be effective, the wound was healed while the systemic cancer therapy was continued, and the patient's self-reported quality of life was greatly improved.",
