[3] [4] [5] In Ethiopia, non-adherence to TB treatment remained a major challenge due to several reasons. [6] [7] [8] [9] Studies reported that poor provider-patient relationship, poor knowledge towards TB and its treatment, distance to the health facility, competing employment, family commitments and adverse clinical experiences were common reasons for non-adherence to TB treatment. 10 11 One of Northwest Ethiopia's studies reported that forgetfulness accounted for 34% of patient's reasons for non-adherence to TB treatment. 6 12 Studies show that non-adherence to TB treatment worsens during the continuation phase, where patients took the responsibility of managing their TB treatment at home (patient-centred treatment). 12 13 Unlike the intensive phase, patients in the continuation phase are responsible for refilling their pills weekly at the nearby clinic and taking their Summary What is already known? \u25ba mHealth technologies overcome barriers against access and quality of health care. \u25ba Virtually-observed (video) therapy improves patient's adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment. \u25ba Interactive text messaging found effective but only for patients who can read and write. \u25ba Phone-reminder systems commonly applied for daily TB medication, but refilling paid less attention.",

However, community supporters may be busy with their own routine business and find it difficult to remind and follow patients for such a long period. Hence, implementing digital health technology could improve patient adherence to TB treatment. Digital health interventions, including mobile health (mHealth), have now brought attention to the strategy to end the global TB epidemic by 2035. 14 As an opportunity, mobile cellular penetration in Africa and other regions of the world has been estimated to grow more than ever. 15 In Ethiopia, mobile subscriptions have reached more than 46 million. 16 Evidence showed that mobile technologies had been found useful for resource-limited countries to overcome barriers against access to healthcare and the quality of care delivery. 17 The WHO has already established its global task force on digital health to support the development of digital health innovations in global efforts to improve TB care and prevention. 18 Evidence indicated that mHealth technology is a feasible, acceptable and promising solution to improve patient adherence to TB treatments in different settings. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Previous studies used video (virtually)observed therapy, 21 25-29 which could not be widely feasible for many resource-limited settings. Some studies used medication reminder systems but focused on daily medication reminders and paid less attention to pillrefilling reminders, though refilling is equally important for patient adherence to TB treatment. Most studies used only text messaging and excluded patients who cannot read and write text messages. 20 21 23 24 One study applied both text and graphic reminders but was limited only to daily medication reminders and the follow-up period was for 2 months. 30 Our study engaged both illiterate and literate patients using simple graphics and text messages for weekly pill refilling, and daily medication reminder runs for 4-month continuation phase. We hypothesised that in addition to routine care, applying a daily medication reminder with weekly pill-refilling reminders could improve patient-centred TB treatment adherence.",

Treatment completed is a patient with TB who completed treatment without evidence of failure but with no record to show that sputum smear or culture results in the last month of treatment and on at least one previous occasion were negative, either because tests were not done or because results are unavailable. Defaulted is a patient whose treatment was interrupted for 2 consecutive months or more. Treatment failure is a patient with TB whose sputum smear or culture is positive at month 5 or later during treatment. While death is a patient with TB who dies for any reason before starting or during the course of treatment. 38 It was also planned to measure patient attendance to TB clinics 39 ; however, it was not analysed because the weekly appointment scheme was not consistently practised by TB clinics. From our observation, some TB clinics appoint patients every 2 weeks, some every month, and some others allow family/treatment supporters to refill on the patient's behalf. One of the reasons for the inconsistency was during the rainy season, patients were not willing to come every week. Patients used to delegate their treatment supporter during social events (like funerals) and whenever feeling sick.",

Otherwise, every subsequent patient was assigned to the groups with an imbalance across the covariate groups using a minimisation algorithm. The covariates, including participants' educational status (able and unable to read and write), sex (male, female), residence (urban, rural) and type of facility (health centre and hospital), were considered during randomisation.

To reduce information contamination, we planned to include one, if more than one patient attending TB treatment from a household; however, the situation did not happen. The outcome assessors (care providers in TB clinic and endline data collectors) did not participate in patient enrolment, and endline data were collected using participant codes to mask each participant's randomisation status purposely to reduce detection bias.

The study has shown that patient adherence was significantly higher among patients who received phone reminders than patients under routine care group. Similarly, in a study in Malaysia, the mean adherence was significantly higher in the short message service (SMS) intervention group compared with the control group after 6 months of follow-up. 44 A similar study in China also revealed that a daily SMS reminder system has significantly improved adherence to TB medication. 45 A study in Tanzania also indicated that graphics-based reminders improved patient's adherence to TB treatment. 46 Besides, a pooled analysis of evidence indicated that SMS had significantly improved adherence to tuberculosis treatment as compared with participants without mobile phone-based interventions. 19 On the other hand, previous RCT studies in Cameroon, Argentina, China and Pakistan reported that patients who received SMS reminders showed improved adherence to TB treatment; however, the difference was not statistically significant. 20 47-49 The variation may arise because most of the previous studies used pill count as a measure of adherence to TB medications which leads to bias since pill count was known to distort adherence to TB treatment. 50 In this study, the measurement of adherence involved both refilling and medication questions that measure patients' intentional and unintentional practices towards TB treatment. 36 Unlike other studies, our intervention consists of a one-time welcoming message, a combined text and graphic reminder messages for weekly pill refilling, and daily medication with 5 min orientation for participants in the intervention group to understand messages; whereas most of the previous studies focused merely on daily medication reminders.",

The composite items of the tool could trigger memory and responses that could reduce both recall and social desirability biases. This study included only patients who own a mobile phone that could affect the study findings' generalisability to the study area's general population. Studies indicated that phone sharing was a common practice in the study area. 61 This study, however, did not apply this approach as phone sharing could not allow absolute access and use of the phone by the patients. The small sample size and considerably higher lost to follow-up of study participants could reduce the power of the test. This study did not evaluate the effect of the intervention on the sputum conversion rate on the 5th month, perceiving that needs the reminder system to involve care providers than patients.",
