One of the most realistic avenues for clinical translation of iBCI technology is to enable control of a computer cursor-i.e. movement-related neural activity is interpreted (decoded) and used to drive cursor function. Both nonhuman primate and human studies have demonstrated high-level cursor translation control using attempted upper limb reaching movements. However, cursor click control-based on identifying attempted grasp-has only been successful in providing discrete click functionality; the ability to maintain click during translation does not yet exist. Here we present a novel decoding approach for cursor click based on identifying transient neural responses that emerge at the onset and offset of intended hand grasp. We demonstrate in a human participant, who used the BCI system independently in his home, that this transient-based approach provides high-functioning, generalized click control that can be used for both point-and-click and click-and-drag applications.",

Intracortical braincomputer interface (iBCI) systems, which interpret motor intent signals from movement-related brain areas, may eventually be paired with dexterous robotic limbs (Carmena et al., 2003; Collinger et al., 2013; Hochberg et al., 2012; Velliste et al., 2008) or electrical stimulation of paralyzed limbs (Ajiboye et al., 2017; Ethier et al., 2012; Friedenberg et al., 2017) to return \"natural\" upper limb motor control. While these goals are not yet fully realizable in a clinical implementation, it is possible with current iBCI technology to provide high performance cursor control for use with computer-based applications (Nuyujukian et al., 2018; Pandarinath et al., 2017; Simeral et al., 2011; Weiss et al., 2019) . Computer use provides a means of connecting to the world, and can greatly improve quality of life for those living with severe motor impairment by allowing access to web browsing, social media, electronic games, or text-based communication (Gilja et al., 2011; Huggins et al., 2011; Ryu & Shenoy, 2009; Wolpaw et al., 2002) .",

Commonly, cursor translation is controlled using neural activity related to attempted arm movements; for example, an attempted reach to the left is converted into leftward cursor movement (typically velocity). Similarly, cursor click is derived from neural activity during attempted hand grasp, where grasp is converted to a clicked state and the absence of grasp (neutral/relaxed posture) to an unclicked state (Bacher et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2011; Nuyujukian et al., 2018; Simeral et al., 2011) . This approach provides the user with intuitive control, and can achieve performance levels suitable for real-world use in some applications (Nuyujukian et al., 2018) . However, existing click decoding approaches have demonstrated only discrete click functionality, and not the ability to maintain click during translation. Such generalizable control is essential to achieve clinically-viable application of iBCI for full computer access.",

To do this, we trained two independent classifiers, which then ran concurrently during online control to update changes in click state. To train each transient classifier, we first identified the optimal time window for a given session. From the results in Fig 2, we found that the transient responses (observed in the smoothed estimate of neural firing rates, see Data acquisition) were only about half a second long. These short time windows meant that idiosyncrasies in the user's approach during calibration-which might vary across days or across subjects-could significantly impact the classification. For example, a user might attempt to grasp immediately upon hearing the audio cue to \"click\", or might wait until visual feedback of the cursor changing from the unclicked to clicked state. For this reason, on each session we trained the transient classifiers using a limited grid-search approach similar to the one outlined in the section Neural components of click (grasp). However, rather than search the entire parameter space, we restricted the search to smaller time periods. For both grasp and release, we swept through a range of window centers (-1.0s to +1.0s relative to onset/offset, 0.1s increment) and window widths (0.2s to 2s, 0.1s increments). For each window, we computed the output probabilities from the resulting LDA classifier (10-fold cross-validation) and calculated the MCC for probability thresholds between 0.1 and 0.9 (increments of 0.1). We then selected the time window with the greatest cumulative MCC (summing across all thresholds).",

The relatively low success rate in comparison to previous studies is likely because we only examined the first click on each trial when determining success or failure rather than allowing multiple attempts following an errant first click. When trained on the sustained click calibration task, the sustained decoder failed to provide adequate control, with a high occurrence of early clicks.

The decoder trained from sustained click calibration also had a lower incidence of drops (17% vs 8%, Fig 5d) , suggesting slightly better release control. Together, these results indicate that while the performance of a transient-based decoding approach is largely invariant to the calibration task, a calibration routine involving sustained click (i.e. translation in both clicked and unclicked states) may lower the incidence of both unintentional clicks (Figs 4d, 5d) and unintentional releases (Figs 5d) .",

            "text": "The improvement in performance achieved by the transient click decoder can be attributed to two main findings. First, the transient responses at the onset and offset appear consistently more salient (higher magnitude) than the response corresponding to sustained grasp. The larger magnitude of the responses leads to improved classification and reduces the incidence of both false positives (unintended click or release) and false negatives (poor responsiveness). Importantly, these transient responses appear to be: (1) inherent to grasp onset and offset, and (2) unique from each other. The participant reported that his attempted actions during click and unclick were squeeze (hand already in clenched posture) and relax, respectively. Thus, the observed transients do not appear to be part of a control modality separate from the sustained component (e.g. kinematics of hand closing/opening). Rather, the three response types (onset transient, offset transient, sustained grasp) seem to reflect three components of a singular, dynamic neural process underlying grasp. The lack of confusion between the two transients during classification also indicates that they reflect two unique components, rather than a single, broad response such as a global increase in firing rates.",

Responses in motor cortex appear to modulate with a very broad range of actions, regardless of the specific recording location. During attempted click-and-drag, the neural activity thus contains components related to both cursor translation and sustained click, which complicates classification of only grasp-related activity. However, the cursor is generally at rest at the moment of click (and release), which means that classification of click state change is generally equivalent across tasks, regardless of the complexity or multimodality of control before or after. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the transient decoder can also allow for click and release in the middle of active cursor translation.",

            "text": "The control of click state transitions also allows for greater flexibility in modifying the control during use. Since click and release arise from separate classification processes, the thresholds can be modulated independently. For sustained click classification approaches, decreasing the threshold to make clicking easier necessarily makes releasing more difficult (and vice versa). However, for the transient click decoder, the thresholds for onset and offset can be adjusted independently as necessary to improve responsiveness (lower threshold), or prevent unintentional click state changes (higher thresholds) for both click and release. Additionally, onset and offset detection can be integrated into translation control to improve usability. For instance, leaving the target before release (drag out) was one of the most common failure modes for the point-and-click task. To prevent this type of error, translation control can be disabled when either transient click-related response (onset or offset) is detected. This immobilizes the cursor during click transitions and reduces the effect poor cursor stabilization, a common problem in iBCI (Sachs et al., 2015) . Thus, a transient-based click decoding approach not only provides more generalizable control of click, but also allows for more customization to meet the needs and wants of the end user.",
