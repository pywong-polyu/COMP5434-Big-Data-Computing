Maternal and child health care is affected due to various factors that influence MCH care administration, service provision, and uptake of the services by the beneficiaries (pregnant women, mothers, and children) [4] . Previous health emergencies like Ebola and Zika have reported a significant increase in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) due to decreased approach to health facilities and increased risky home deliveries [5] . The administrator's focus will likely to shift from MCH care to the pandemic. According to research, health workers in other Sub-Saharan African countries are not well-prepared to treat COVID patients and meet the demands of women during the pandemic [6] . Research has revealed a knowledge gap regarding the effect of pandemics on maternal well-being, especially in resource-constrained settings where marginalized women often receive poor health care [7] . A study conducted in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) has found a declining trend in the utilization of maternal and child health (MCH) services such as institutional delivery, antenatal care (ANC), and child immunization [8] . These limitations may have severe consequences for women's health in LMICs during the pandemic [9] .",

The utilization of prenatal services decreased by about 58% during the Ebola pandemic [26] [27] [28] [29] . Conversely, 55.5% of expectant mothers said they missed or delayed their antenatal check-ups during COVID-19 [30] . Three studies revealed that women had attended fewer ANC check-ups than the recommended number during the COVID-19 pandemic [30] [31] [32] . Women in the second trimester of pregnancy attended more ANC visits (48%) compared to those in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy (39.5% and 35.2%, respectively) during the COVID-19 pandemic in China [33] . Inappropriateness in the quality of ANC services was reported by 27.8% of Indonesian women as ANC examination was not performed under the scope of ANC service provision by midwives [34] . During Ebola, studies indicated a 22% loss in achieving four or more ANC visits in Liberia, while a COVID-19 related study in Ethiopia revealed a 1.8% loss for the same [23, 27, 30] . In India, hampered transportation (50.9% respondents) and fear of infection (33.4% respondents) were primary reasons for missing ANC check-ups [32] . Similarly, an Ethiopian study found that missed ANC visits were associated with a lack of travel means during lockdown (28%), fear of infection (56.8%), stay-at-home instructions (17%), and redirection of maternal health services/personnel (33%) [30] . Higher demand for virtual patient consultation during the pandemics was noticed. Another study from China reported that 59.6% of beneficiaries used remote consultation, and 42.2% requested fewer in-person ANC visits [33] . However, 50% of women used telemedicine in the US, and 10.7% of face-to-face appointments were reduced during COVID-19 [35] . There were just two studies that looked at how tetanus immunization rates changed among pregnant women during pandemics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a study in Ethiopia [30] reported a 38.3% drop in TT 1 st dosage and a 59.6% drop in TT 2 nd dosage; however, during Ebola in Sierra Leone, a 15% dip in TT 2 nd dosage was observed. Similarly, a 28.8% dip was observed in overall TT vaccination during the lockdown in Pakistan [36] .",

Beneficiaries in Zika-related studies claimed that they were aware of the potentially harmful effects of the infection on the fetus and preventive measures [25] . On the other hand, during Ebola and COVID-19, beneficiaries were apprehensive about the transmission of disease and pointed out that the media was disseminating misinformation or excessive information about the pandemic [39, 46] . Various misconceptions such as \"the deliberate creation of virus by medical workers for financial benefit\" or \"to create the need for more drugs\" [37] further contributed to people's mistrust of health workers [41] . Most of pregnant women were hesitant to visit health facilities for fear of acquiring the infection, thus missing their ANC visits or accessing facilities only in extreme situations [41] [42] [43] 46] .",

However, there was no variation in the percentages of home births. Conversely, a study found a 62% reduction in institutional delivery during peaks of Ebola in one district of Liberia [26] . During Ebola, it was reported that under the most conservative scenario, a decrease in utilization of life-saving health services resulted in 3600 extra stillbirths, maternal and neonatal deaths in 2014-15 [23] . In Guinea, a 14% increase in MMR and a 24% rise in the stillbirth rate are reported during the Ebola epidemic [49] . A study in Monrovia found no significant differences in the proportions between home and facility deliveries; however, there was a considerable shift from the public (31% decline) to private health facilities (increased to 47%) for deliveries [40] .",

The majority of women believed that going to the facility would put them at more risk of contracting the infection, which could harm their baby. Moreover, if they are detected to be COVID-19 positive, they may not deliver their child normally or will be separated from their child [41, 43, 44, 46] . Another noteworthy finding was a restriction for birth companions to accompany the women during labor [42] [43] [44] 46] . Even for women who visited hospitals, it was studied that due to the \"No-touch policy\", the healthcare workers did not use partographs or fetoscopes during labor, jeopardizing the quality of care [49, 54] . Other reported attributing factors to the quality of intrapartum care included shortage of qualified staff and basic supplies such as thermometers and gloves [39] and insufficient or inappropriate size PPE [20, 42] .",

Although beneficial, challenges have been reported concerning its mode of functioning, ensuring accessibility to patients, scheduling, and resource requirements [73] . Telephonic consultation/Telecommunication was reported to be another mode for ensuring MCH care during crises [42, 74] . It imparted more comprehensive coverage with less travel, so it was adopted for consultation with lesser hesitancy [68] . Concern over poor connectivity and injustice among those not acquainted with the technologies were reported for causing disparity in service uptake or delivery [68] . The unavailability of technology for virtual (video) consultation led to the uptake of telecommunication as an alternative to serving the purpose [75] .

The unmet need for family planning services was further exacerbated due to reduced access to family planning methods due to the pandemic. According to the UNFPA report, COVID-19 containment measures were supposed to prevent approximately 47 million women from using birth control methods in 114 LMICs, resulting in 7 million unintended pregnancies [79] . Hence, to avoid unwanted pregnancies and prevent related maternal mortality and morbidity, each country needs to have a comprehensive health https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268106.g005",

Disease outbreaks often negatively affect women's healthcare to a broader extent. According to a systematic review, the increased adverse maternal consequences result from of health system incompetence and their inability to cope with the pandemic [81] . Thus, it is strongly advised that adequate staffing for MCH care needs to be prioritized. Training and capacity building of frontline workers should be emphasized to provide safe maternity care during emergencies. Moreover, a separate task force should be formulated to keep frontline workers free to provide maternal health services [82] . Promoting safe and accessible maternity care is essential even during pandemics by having an efficient and sustainable MCH care model to prevent preterm births, stillbirths, and maternal mortality [81] .",

Factors such as limited information about the availability of health services at facilities, prevailing rumors about the pandemic, and fear of contracting the infection reduced the uptake and utilization of routine MCH care [5] . A study conducted in Pakistan found that around 25,000 polio workers were reallocated to assist with the COVID-19 response [84] . Similarly, measles immunization campaigns in 23 countries were halted, affecting nearly 80 million eligible children during COVID-19 [85] . The cessation of immunization may result in the global spread of vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccinations are time-sensitive, and if children are not vaccinated within the due time, they will miss out on the benefits of lifelong immunity, exposing the whole cohort to vaccine-preventable diseases [84] .",
