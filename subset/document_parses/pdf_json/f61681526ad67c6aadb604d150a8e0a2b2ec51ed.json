            "text": "Objective: Dysnatremia is common in hospitalized patients, often worsening the prognosis in pneumopathies and critical illnesses. Information on coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related hyponatremia is partially conflicting, whereas data on hypernatremia in this context are scarce. We assessed, in a cohort of COVID-19 inpatients: the prevalence of sodium alterations at admission and throughout their hospitalization; their association with inflammation/organ damage indexes; their short-term prognostic impact. Study design and methods: 117 patients (81 males, 64 \u00b1 13 years) hospitalized for COVID-19 between 1 March and 30 April 2020 were retrospectively followed-up for their first 21 days of stay by collecting all serum sodium measurements, basal CRP and serum lactate levels, maximum IL-6 and information on care setting, required ventilation, length of hospitalization, in-hospital death. Results: At admission, 26.5% patients had hyponatremia, and 6.8% had hypernatremia. During their hospitalization, 13.7% patients experienced both disorders ('mixed dysnatremia'). Lower sodium levels at admission were correlated with higher C reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.039) and serum lactate levels (P = 0.019), but not interleukin-6 (IL-6). Hypernatremia and a wider sodium variability were associated with maximum required ventilation, need for ICU assistance and duration of the hospitalization. Mean estimated time to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission was 20 days shorter in patients exposed to sodium alterations at any time of their hospital course (log-rank test P = 0.032). Conclusions: Sodium alterations frequently affect hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hyponatremia could indicate pulmonary involvement, whereas hypernatremia is associated to prolonged hospitalization and the need for intensive care/mechanical ventilation, particularly when resulting from prior hyponatremia. Optimizing in-hospital sodium balance is crucial to improve patients' prognosis.",

In predisposed individuals infected by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, IL-6 is also the main actor implied in the 'cytokine storm', which causes the evolution of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID- 19) pneumonia toward aggressive, life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care management (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) . In turn, intensive care management of critically ill patients is frequently associated with hypernatremia (serum sodium concentration > 145 mmol/L), with a 6% prevalence at ICU admission and a 4-26% incidence throughout ICU stay (18, 19) . Hypernatremia is mainly iatrogenic, due to a positive sodium balance induced by free water loss. Recently, also this disorder has been associated with longer hospitalizations, readmissions after discharge and higher mortality rates, regardless of its underlying medical condition and degree (20, 21, 22, 23) .",

Despite its prognostic value in critical illnesses, data concerning COVID-19-related hypernatremia are scarce (24, 33, 34, 35) ; specifically, only one study looked for the development of hypernatremia in COVID-19 inpatients, showing this was associated with in-hospital mortality (35) .",

            "text": "Interestingly, we confirmed that excessive in-hospital sodium fluctuations, rather than basal sodium levels are the main danger: almost all outcome measures were influenced by \u0394Na + min-max or Na + max in the whole cohort, and a longer hospitalization was correlated with a lower Na + min , a higher Na + max and a wider \u0394Na + min-max in survived patients. Patients experiencing dysnatremia were estimated to require ICU assistance in mean 20 days earlier than normonatremic ones (Fig. 1) . In-hospital death was more likely in elder patients (\u03c1 = 0.260, P = 0.005), where elevated sodium levels have been extensively observed (24, 32, 35) . Of note, the day-by-day sodium fluctuations experienced by dead patients were absent among those who were discharged, whose sodium trend perfectly traced the whole cohort findings. A similar discrepancy was found when comparing the saw-tooth 21-day sodium pattern of hypernatremic (group C) patients to the harmonious curves of hyponatremic (group A) and normonatremic (group B) ones (Fig. 2) . Moreover, the subgroup analysis reflected the results obtained for the whole cohort: dysnatremic patients (group A+C) who had been directly admitted in ICU (notably, 44% of the study cohort, Supplementary Table 2) had higher sodium levels and a wider sodium variability; moreover, Na + max , \u0394Na + min-max and exposure to hypernatremia during the hospital course were associated to worse assistance outcomes.",

Anyway, we believe that our original, exclusive focus on all possible sodium patterns throughout a 21-day observation period in a relatively large cohort is the main strength of this study: as very recently suggested elsewhere (36) , the day-by-day assessment of sodium levels enabled us to highlight excessive longitudinal sodium trajectories, rather than natremia itself, as the best indicator of COVID-19 evolution toward respiratory complications, longer hospitalization and death. Prospective confirmation of these findings is needed, but prompt and careful management of sodium imbalances would certainly bring positive repercussions in reverting the natural history of severe COVID-19 in clinical practice.",

Besides hyponatremia, which could primarily represent a diagnostic rather than a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 pneumonia, hypernatremia plays a crucial role, particularly when resulting from the correction of the opposite alteration. Patients experiencing mixed dysnatremia have a worse prognosis, mainly in terms of length of their hospitalization and need for ICU assistance/ mechanical ventilation. Further exploration of the interplay between sodium and inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6 above all) is needed in order to help clinicians in stratifying COVID-19 patients at different risk for disease progression since hospital admission; moreover, the subtle optimization of sodium balance by effectively preventing, through serial measurements, and properly correcting sodium alterations is of paramount importance to improve hospitalized COVID-19 patients' prognosis.",
