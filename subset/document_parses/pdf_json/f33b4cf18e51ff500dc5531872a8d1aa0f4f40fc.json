Hilton's analysis of the findings of these studies indicated two major findings: (1) when students use OER, they obtain the same learning outcomes as with traditional textbooks while saving money; and (2) both students and teachers find OER comparable to traditional learning resources in terms of quality. Several advantages of OER were also revealed. These included low or no cost of OER, perceived ease of reading and access, their ability to provide the same learning outcomes as traditional materials, and students' and instructors' positive perceptions. By indicating the role of OER in obtaining the same or similar learning, the study has also suggested that OER be considered useful sources for classes and also a valid replacement for commercial textbooks. However, we also need to consider the context where OER will be used and how OER are designed and used in this context since these two determine whether OER will work and suffice. This article considers the contextual factors and design of OER, and the limitations of Hilton's work in addition to several ideas and suggestions for further research regarding OER in online and face-to-face instruction.",

Quite a few instructors benefit from OER in their courses due to their perceived low-cost, ease of access, and flexibility (Hilton 2016) . OER has great potential in ESP (English for Specific Purposes). On the one hand, the specialization of many fields diversified needs of ESP learners makes it difficult to develop efficient and \"tailor-made\" traditional coursebooks. Therefore, using OER in educational settings has also gained the attention of researchers, leading to studies on the effectiveness of OER, teacher and learner perceptions of these materials, and their related benefits. To date, studies have promulgated that OER are positively perceived by teachers and instructors, and that they are as effective as traditional or commercial textbooks and materials (Hilton 2016; Hilton 2020; Delgado et al. 2019; Shams et al. 2020 ; Orton Grissett and Huffman 2019).",

Additionally, the OER materials can be easily updated, modified and shared which leads to inclusive, open and participatory education, saving time teachers significant time and effort on resource development (de Oliveira Neto et al. 2017 ).

When one probes into OER, it can be observed that some OER are well-designed in terms of being accessible, flexible, remixable, and aesthetically pleasing. However, it is also noticeable that some others are poorly designed and thereby poorly used.

Another point to be made on Hilton's article is that it treats all OER equally. It is important to explain how OER are used or presented to learners. In other words, the article does not probe the qualities necessary to make OER good or what they should include (e.g. visual and auditory materials). OER often include a digital textbook or the digitized version of print materials. In some cases, OER appear as electronic learning modules supported with multimedia such as images, animations, and videos. One can state that different OER might work better or worse in different contexts, for different subjects and at different levels. However, we also need to consider the context where OER will be used and how OER are designed and used in this context since these two determine whether OER will work and suffice. OER are not standardized pertaining to design. In other words, when teachers and learners search for OER covering a certain topic, they may find materials ranging from static, one-or multiple-page PDF file(s) to developed websites that can be accessed from mobile devices without losing their interactive features. We cannot find discussions or reviews of the design of OER in the studies reviewed in Hilton's article, and readers are not provided with information about the design of the activities and materials in commercial textbooks, either. We need to consider the design of these materials and resources, as it may heavily influence how they can be used for the 5Rs and how they are integrated into classroom practices (e.g. it can be almost impossible for instructors to remix multimedia files or PDF files even if they are allowed to do so).",

The contextual factors must be considered thoroughly in addition to the available technological devices and tools that both students and teachers have and/or access in their learning and teaching environments. For example, the Internet speed, quota, and the access of frequency might limit the usability of videos in online or face-to-face instruction since learners might be restricted in terms of download quota. In such cases, the quality of videos might be decreased, or audio-only versions might be used if the focus is the content rather than nonverbal signals such as body language. Texts might be shared through PDF files, and their size could be reduced to allow faster viewing and easier access. Moreover, learner agency can also be promoted by involving them in the decision process, and suggestions and/or other OER resources might be elicited rather than the inputs transmitted from the teacher to the learner. This can be done through a quick survey in large classes.",

Adopting OER may require significant effort from teachers who work alone and teach multiple classes. During the process of adoption, it is necessary to consider the local context, content, selection and design OER accordingly. Creating a multimedia learning environment with remixed images and videos might be necessary to present the content to learners in a variety of ways. Therefore, in further research, in online, blended, or face-to-face classrooms, it is imperative to consider contextual factors and the design of these resources while deciding on the adoption of OER and how they should be presented (e.g. decisions about using images to help learners understand the concepts; understanding which demonstrations can be used and combined).
