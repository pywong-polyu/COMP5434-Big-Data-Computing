PG modifications increased nuclease resistance in serum-containing medium for more than 21 days. Replacing two internucleotidic phosphates by PG groups in phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides did not decrease their cellular uptake in the absence of lipid carriers. Increasing the number of PG groups from two to seven per oligonucleotide reduced their ability to enter the cells in the carrier-free mode. Cationic liposomes provided similar delivery efficiency of both partially PG-modified and unmodified oligonucleotides. PG-gapmers were designed containing three to four PG groups at both wings and a central \"window\" of seven deoxynucleotides with either phosphodiester or phosphorothioate linkages targeted to MDR1 mRNA providing multiple drug resistance of tumor cells. Gapmers efficiently silenced MDR1 mRNA and restored the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutics. Thus, PGgapmers can be considered as novel, promising types of antisense oligonucleotides for targeting biologically relevant RNAs.",

            "text": "In the 40 years that have elapsed since the pioneering studies of Zamecnik and Stephenson, 1 concerted efforts have been focused on the development of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as therapeutic medicines to combat human diseases. 2, 3 ASOs can function by sterically blocking mRNA translation, by mediating mRNA cleavage by the recruitment of cellular nucleases, such as RNase H, 4,5 by altering pre-mRNA splicing, 6 or by preventing ribosome recruitment. 7 How-ever, two main problems still limit the widespread clinical application of ASOs: the difficulty of oligonucleotide delivery to the target cells 8 and rapid degradation of oligonucleotides by extra-and intracellular nucleases. While the former is a more formidable obstacle, the latter can be alleviated by chemical modification of the sugar residue 9 or, more straightforwardly, the internucleotidic phosphate of synthetic oligonucleotides. 10 Moreover, alteration of the internucleotidic phosphate may also help to improve cellular uptake of ASOs. 11, 12 Thus, efficient mRNA downregulation can be achieved by using an ASO with modified phosphate groups such as phosphorothioate (PS), 13 2 0 -modified RNAs, such as oligo-2 0 -O-(2-methoxyethyl)ribonucleotides (2 0 -MOE) 14 and bridged/locked nucleic acids (2 0 ,4 0 -BNA/ LNA), 15, 16 and by oligonucleotide analogs with a more or less radically altered sugar-phosphate backbones, such as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) 17 and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). 18 ASO development in the previous decade has firmly established the ASO concept as a straightforward approach for site-selective RNA targeting. This endeavor has culminated in the FDA approval of several ASO therapeutics with modified backbones that confer improved pharmacological properties: a 2 0 -MOE ASO Mipomersen (Kynamro) to treat familial hypercholesterolemia, 19 and 2 0 -MOE ASO Nusinersen (Spinraza) and PMO Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, respectively; PMOs Golodirsen (Vyondys 53) and, recently, Casimersen (Amondys 45) for DMD [19] [20] [21] and 2 0 -MOE ASO, Inotersen (Tegsedi), for familial amyloid polyneuropathy. 22 Of particular interest are the oligodeoxynucleotide analogs, which can mediate irreversible RNA inactivation in a catalytic mode by recruiting RNase H. These analogs include DNA oligonucleotides containing modification at phosphodiester bonds such PS, 23 2 0deoxy-2 0 -fluoro-b-D-arabinonucleic acids, 24 and the recently developed mesyl phosphoramidate oligodeoxynucleotides (m-ASOs). 25 These DNA analogs could be used to build gapmers: mixed backbone ASOs containing short (6-10 nucleotide [nt]) central \"windows\" of RNase H-competent deoxynucleotides and 3 0 ,5 0 -flanking \"wings\" (3-5 nt) of RNase H-incompetent residues, such as 2 0 -OMe, 2 0 -MOE, or LNA, which primarily increase RNA binding but also nuclease resistance. [26] [27] [28] Gapmer ASOs can efficiently silence RNAs by using the best of both mechanisms: steric blocking and RNase H-mediated RNA cleavage within the central RNase H-competent window of the heteroduplex.",

One of the findings of this study is that the Staudinger reaction could be successfully carried out in the presence of PS groups in the oligonucleotide. Thus, the two phosphate modifications, PS and PG, can be introduced independently during the oxidation step of the automated solid-phase synthesis cycle without interference from each other. By using commercially available deoxy-and 2 0 -OMe ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and three different P(III) to P(V) conversion procedures, namely, oxidation to PO, thionation (sulfurization) to PS, and guanylation (Staudinger reaction) to PG, it was possible to obtain a variety of gapmers having both sugar (deoxy-and 2 0 -OMe ribonucleotide) and phosphate (PO/PS/PG) modifications on a commercial automated DNA/RNA synthesizer ( Table 1 ). The standard sulfurizing reagent DDTT was used to introduce the PS modification. 44 Standard postsynthetic processing, such as cleavage from support, protecting group removal, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification based on the \"DMTr ON\" mode was analogous to that of native oligonucleotides irrespective of the pattern of modification. Molecular masses of the oligonucleotides were confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) and their integrity by electrophoretic analysis (Table 1 ; Figures S1-S23). MS analysis of reaction mixtures of gapmer oligonucleotides G1-G4 (see Figures S18-S21) showed that in all cases the main products correspond to desired composition and sequence. This confirms a good compatibility of both oxidation protocols with each other.",

Deoxy/PG (R3) and 2 0 -OMe/PG (R6) PGOs both were characterized by high stability and remained intact for over 21 days (Table S1 ). Thus, stability of PG oligonucleotides exceeded many times the stability of 2 0 -OMe/PS oligonucleotide R5 (24 h). Thus, nuclease resistance of modified oligonucleotides increased in the order R2 (deoxy/PS) < R5 (2 0 -OMe/PS) << R3 (deoxy/PG) z R6 (2 0 -OMe/PG).

Oligonucleotides M1-M3 and G1-G4 were hybridized with MDR1 mRNA followed by incubation with RNase H. RNA cleavage products were analyzed by 12% PAGE under denaturing conditions ( Figure 4A ). Oligo-2 0 -O-methylribonucleotide M2, which is unable to recruit RNase H, was used as a negative control (no hydrolysis in lane 1, Figure 4A ). Both unmodified (PO) M1 and its PS counterpart M3, which formed heteroduplexes with MDR1 mRNA that recruited RNase H, were used as positive controls. A typical pattern of MDR1 mRNA cleavage in a heteroduplex with M1 and M3 by RNase H is shown in Figure 4A , lanes 2 and 3, respectively. The gapmer G1 (2 0 -OMe/PS[deoxy/7PS]2 0 -OMe/PS, Table 1 ) formed a heteroduplex recognized by RNase H. The cleavage pattern observed with G1 was similar to those observed for M1 and M3 (lane 4, Figure 4A) . Correspondingly, the bands in lanes 5, 6, and 7 ( Figure 4A ) provide evidence for RNase H-mediated RNA cleavage of heteroduplexes formed by PG-gapmers G2, G3, and G4. Notably, the cleavage pattern depends not only on the nucleotide modifications within the central window, but on the number of PG modifications in the wings: the same cleavage patterns were observed for PG-gapmers G2 and G4, which both contain three PG groups at either the 5 0 or 3 0 ends (lanes 5 and 7, Figure 4A ), but in the case of PG-gapmer G3, which contains four PG modifications in both wings, the cleavage pattern is slightly altered, possibly because additional PG linkages narrow the window recognized by RNase H (lane 6, Figure 4A ).",

KB-8-5 cells were transfected with ASOs pre-complexed with Lipofectamine 2000. 24 h post-transfection, vinblastine was added and the cells were incubated for 3 days. The ability of ASOs to increase the sensitivity of KB-8-5 cells to vinblastine was evaluated by real-time cell survival monitoring. PO oligonucleotides R1 and M1, PG-gapmer G2 with a PO window, and PS oligonucleotides R2, M3, and PG-gapmer G4 with a PS window were compared in two parallel experiments. The concentrations were 1 mM for PO-modified (R1, M1, and G2) and 0.1 mM for PS-modified (R2, M3, and G4) oligonucleotides. The concentration of the PS-modified oligonucleotides was lowered due to their relatively high non-specific toxicity to KB-8-5 cells observed in the presence of vinblastine. It should be mentioned that no toxic effects of gapmer oligonucleotides were observed when the cells were incubated with G2 and G4 in the absence of vinblastine ( Figure S28 ). The full-PS-gapmer G1 was excluded from the experiments due to its especially high cytotoxicity under these conditions. The fully 2 0 -O-methylated oligoribonucleotide M2 was also excluded because its heteroduplex with RNA was not recognized by RNase H rendering M2 ineffective in this case. The PG-gapmer G3 containing four PG linkages in both wings did not affect the sensitivity of KB-8-3 cells to vinblastine at either 0.1 or 1 mM concentration (primary data not shown).",

Thus, at the concentration of oligonucleotides used in this study, no decrease in cell viability due to PS-mediated toxicity was expected. However, similar values of cell survival observed in the presence of the PS ASOs R2 and M3 and the PG/ PS-gapmer G4 may indicate the non-specific contribution of PS modification to the overall toxic effect on the cells.

There was no statistically significant difference in the level of Pgp in tumor cells incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 and random oligonucleotide R1 at a concentration of 0.1 mM. The PO ASO M1 at 0.5 mM caused a 2-fold reduction in the Pgp level in comparison with Lipofectamine and R1 groups (Figure 5F ). These data are in agreement with data on the decrease of cell viability in the presence of M1 ( Figure 5A ), although we did not observe a decrease in MDR1 mRNA levels. It can be assumed that the time points chosen for the analysis of both mRNA and Pgp levels are not optimal for the analysis of mRNA. It is known that the half-life of MDR1 mRNA is 4-9 h, while the half-life of Pgp is 48-72 h. [47] [48] [49] Since full-PS M3 at a concentration of 0.5 mM exhibited high toxicity to KB-8-5 cells, the Pgp level for M3 at this concentration was not measured. At an M3 concentration of 0.1 mM, a reduction of the Pgp level by 1.7-fold was observed ( Figure 5F ). PG/PS-gapmer G4 was the most potent inhibitor of Pgp synthesis, causing a 2-fold reduction in the Pgp level at 0.1 mM and a 10-fold reduction at 0.5 mM ( Figure 5F ). These data are in a good agreement with the data on the decrease of MDR1 mRNA level and restoration of cell sensitivity to vinblastine observed for this gapmer (Figures 5B and  5D ).",

Despite the restoration of cell sensitivity to vinblastine we did not detect statistically significant effect of G2 on the Pgp levels ( Figure 5F ), while G2 decreased the level of MDR1 RNA by 30% at the 24 h time point ( Figure 5C ). The reasons for this could be a 2-fold lower concentration of G2 used in these experiments, and the somewhat lower half-life of G2 in comparison with G4. Two reasons can explain the efficient Pgp silencing by G4. First, G4 is a PG/PS-gapmer, and the decrease in the number of PS linkages may reduce non-specific cytotoxicity as G4 worked efficiently at both 0.1 and 0.5 mM. Second, the experiments on downregulation of Pgp were carried out in the absence of vinblastine, which may have decreased the overall toxicity burden on the cells (compare Figures 5B and 5F ).",

Similar compatibility of the mesyl phosphoramidate chemistry with the PS protocol was shown recently by others. 56 We describe herein the novel antisense PG-gapmers, which efficiently downregulate a target mRNA in cell culture. In this study, we demonstrate that optimal combinations of the PG modifications can be achieved when some of the PS linkages responsible for both antisense activity and some off-target toxicity were replaced by PG groups, resulting in the exceedingly stable and less-toxic PG-gapmers that retain high biological activity.",

The thermal stability of the duplex formed by PGO with RNA was only slightly lower than of the native DNA:RNA duplex, while the thermal stability of PG-gapmer:RNA duplexes was similar to that of the DNA:RNA duplex, 36 unlike PMOs, which exhibit higher binding affinity to RNA targets. 18 The unaffected thermal stability of PG-gapmer:RNA duplexes may be considered an advantage of these oligonucleotides because it provides faster dissociation of a PG-gapmer from the complex with target RNA after RNase H-mediated RNA cleavage in comparison with other RNase H-triggering ASOs.",

Of note, these PGOs could still participate in a steric block antisense mechanism. 33 Our data show that PG-gapmers containing three to four PG groups at both the 3 0 and 5 0 ends of the oligonucleotide and the central window of seven deoxy/PS-nucleotides were able to recruit RNase H upon binding to MDR1 mRNA. It should be noted that RNase H displays different cleavage patterns depending on the number of PG groups flanking the central window of the gapmers. The cleavage pattern of RNase H in the complex of the RNA with the G4 gapmer containing three PG groups at either end and a 7 nt PS window, as well as in the complex with the G2 gapmer, which had a 7 nt PO window, was shifted downward compared with the cleavage pattern in the complex with the G3 gapmer containing four PG groups at both ends and the same 7 nt PO window. Despite the need for RNase H to bind to the heteroduplex at a site that is no more than four nucleotides, 60 the bulky PG modifications can shift the cleavage frame. However, the slight difference in the cleavage pattern of RNase H with different gapmers did not affect their antisense activity within cells as we observed a decrease of the level of Pgp under the action of the PG-gapmers followed by a decrease of tumor cell viability in the presence of vinblastine.",

Furthermore, the number and position of PG groups had an impact on the nuclease resistance of partially PG-modified oligonucleotides. Our data indicate that introduction of PG groups at the ends of a gapmer oligonucleotide is more beneficial for nuclease resistance and prolonged action within cells as compared with PS groups. Earlier it was demonstrated that the introduction of a single PG group into a trinucleotide increased its resistance to SVPDE. 36 One may expect that neutralization of the negative charge of an oligonucleotide may positively influence the cellular uptake in the case of PGOs. Our data showed that a fully charge-neutral deoxy-PGO penetrated eukaryotic cells no better than the unmodified counterpart. A similarly poor cellular uptake was observed for the naked PMOs and PNAs, which can be considered conceptually similar to PGO due to inherent lack of negative charge. 61 However, unlike PNAs or PMOs, the PG groups could be introduced into an oligonucleotide in a gradual way, replacing the phosphates one by one to produce partially charged oligomers. For example, the introduction of just two PG linkages into an oligo-2 0 -OMe PS ribonucleotide did not interfere with carrier-free intracellular accumulation. The results indicate that that optimal balance between the efficiency of cellular uptake and nuclease resistance of ASOs could be achieved by introducing a limited number of charge-neutral linkages such as PG modifications. Despite the hydrophobic nature of the Dmi group, it does not significantly interfere with the packaging of partially (but not fully) PG-modified oligonucleotides into lipoplexes with cationic liposomes. Thus, even though lipoplex formulations were shown to be unsuitable for the delivery of charge-neutral oligonucleotide analogs, such as PMOs, PG-gapmers packed in liposomes efficiently penetrate into the cells.",

At the same time, PS oligonucleotides displayed noticeable cytotoxicity at 1 mM. The toxicity became even more pronounced when cytotoxic compounds, such as vinblastine, were also present in cell culture medium with PS oligonucleotides. It is worth mentioning that the overall toxicity of PS modifications was significantly reduced when PG/PS-gapmer G4 was used instead of a completely PS oligonucleotide; however, the contribution of the PS modifications to the overall non-specific toxic effect on the cells and the presence of vinblastine masked specific antisense downregulation of MDR1 gene by these oligonucleotides (Figure 5 ). On the contrary, when vinblastine was not present in culture medium, the advantages of PG/PS-gapmers over PS oligonucleotides became apparent ( Figure 5C ). Specifically, the fully PS M3, which was somewhat effective at 0.1 mM, exhibited high toxicity at 0.5 mM, while PG/PS-gapmer G4 caused a 2-fold reduction of Pgp level at 0.1 mM and a 10-fold reduction at 0.5 mM. Thus, our data reveal that PG/PS-gapmer G4 is an efficient inhibitor of Pgp synthesis: it combines low toxicity and efficient gene silencing. Of note, in tumors with a MDR phenotype, the level of Pgp is increased 2-5 times compared with drug-sensitive tumors. 62 As we demonstrate in this study, 2-to 5-fold downregulation of Pgp is achievable by the action of, e.g., a PG/PS-gapmer G4.

These oligonucleotides have a number of similarities and differences. Fully or partially PG-modified ASOs are either charge neutral, similarly to PMOs, or carry a decreased negative charge, respectively, while m-ASOs completely retain a negative charge similarly to natural oligonucleotides. PGOs, PMOs, and m-ASOs are all able to form stable duplexes with RNA targets. Importantly, all the phosphate modifications significantly increase the nuclease resistance of ASOs, with t 1/2 > 21 days for PGOs and >7 days for m-ASOs. m-ASOs, as well as PG-gapmers, efficiently recruited RNase H and caused up to 4-versus 2-fold downregulation of their RNA targets in vitro, respectively (Table 2) , while PMOs and fully charge-neutral PGOs are steric blocking ASOs that work through an RNase H-independent pathway. None of the modifications facilitated cellular uptake of the ASO in a carrier-free mode (Table 2) . Nonetheless, when delivered by cationic liposomes, both anti-MDR1 PG-gapmers and anti-miR-21 m-ASOs efficiently downregulated their targets by an RNase H-dependent mechanism, which led to a decrease of tumor cell proliferation by specific miR-21 inhibition, 25 significant reduction of tumor xenografts in nude mice, 63 or the reversal of the MDR phenotype of MDR1-expressing cells, as shown in this work ( Table 2) . Because traditional cationic liposomes did not help PMO uptake, the main strategies for PMO delivery are chemical methods, 65 conjugation with cell-penetrating peptides, 66 or encapsulation in the so-called bubble liposomes. 67 The same may be applicable to fully charge-neutral PGOs, including nanoparticle-mediated delivery. 67 The application of gapmeric ASOs for mRNA downregulation has produced notable successes in many experimental studies and clinical trials. 22, 70, 71 These successes have opened new avenues for the therapy of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung fibrosis, and neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders. There have been significant advances in the use of ASOs, deoxyribozymes, and siRNA for the treatment of viral infections caused by RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV-1, and SARS-CoV; the latter could be very relevant to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. [72] [73] [74] A combination of the advantages of such internucleotide modifications as PG and mesyl phosphoramidate (m) could make it possible to design novel oligonucleotide drugs that target therapeutically important messenger or non-coding RNAs as well as viral RNAs.",
