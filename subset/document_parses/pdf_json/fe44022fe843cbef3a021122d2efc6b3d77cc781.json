In this review, we critically summarise evidence on trends and changes in burnout over the past decade, contributors to surgical trainee burnout, the personal and professional consequences of burnout and consider the evidence for interventions. There is no evidence for a linear increase in burnout levels in surgeons over the past decade but the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has yet to be established and is likely to be significant. Working long hours and experiencing stressful interpersonal interactions at work are associated with higher burnout in trainees but feeling more supported by training programmes and receiving workplace supervision are associated with reduced burnout. Burnout is associated with poorer overall mental and physical well-being in surgical trainees and has also been linked with the delivery of less safe patient care in this group. Useful interventions could include mentorship and improving work conditions, but there is a need for more and higher quality studies.",

However, specialising in surgery is also associated with high levels of burnout, the psychological syndrome characterised by feelings of emotional exhaustion and disengagement or 'depersonalisation' [7] . Evidence from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 89 independent studies indicates that surgical trainees report higher levels of burnout than their non-surgical peers [8] . This has also been found in a study in India, where surgical residents scored significantly higher than anaesthesia residents on several burnout indicators relating to neglect of personal needs [9] .",

Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was evidence of high levels of work-related stress and burnout in physicians overall. In the UK, a 2018 survey of 51,956 trainee doctors found that 1 in 4 felt burnt out to a high degree or very high degree [12] , and in the USA, a 2019 study of 4893 physicians indicated that approximately 44% were experiencing at least one symptom of burnout [13] . There are several questionnaires used to measure burnout, such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory [14] , Oldenburg Burnout Inventory [15] and Copenhagen Burnout Inventory [16] which conceptualise and measure burnout in varying ways. Furthermore, these questionnaires are often adapted in individual studies to make them shorter [e.g. 17, 18] . Due to this variation in measurement tools, direct comparison of results between studies can be challenging and it is hard to identify whether there are real differences in burnout rates between countries [19] . However, it is clear that burnout is a common occupational health problem in physicians internationally, which is a concern to all medical disciplines, including surgery.",

These have included both work factors such as the physical discomfort of wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and the psychological stress of managing a frequently changing work pattern alongside personal factors such childcare problems due to school closures and an inability to see family and friends [11] . Surgical trainees have been particularly vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic, which has reduced educational and career development opportunities, leaving some anxious about passing their annual reviews [11, 20] . The long-term impact of the pandemic on the mental health of surgeons and surgical trainees is currently unclear but evidence from previous pandemics indicates that this will likely be long-lasting [21] . Enduring effects could include elevated symptoms of post-traumatic stress and increases in smoking and drinking alcohol [21] . As such, there is an urgent need to better understand the causes and consequences of burnout in surgeons to inform the development of supportive interventions. There is also a particular need to understand these issues in surgical trainees, who have been significantly affected by the pandemic and whose retention is of crucial importance in supporting the delivery of healthcare services moving forward.",

This growing literature has allowed for the identification of broad trends and patterns which can help provide context to understanding studies into burnout in surgeons and surgical trainees. First, it seems that levels of burnout have been largely stable in physicians over time. The 2013 Medscape survey found that overall, 40% of physicians reported experiencing burnout; in 2021, the rate had only increased to 42%, despite the added stress of the COVID-19 pandemic [23, 24] . In general surgeons and orthopaedic surgeons, the same survey indicated a small drop in burnout over the same time window (Fig. 1 ) but a comparable increase in urologists where the rate increased from 41 to 49% [23, 24] . The absence of a widespread upwards trend in burnout in physicians more generally and surgeons in particular has also been corroborated by other surveys [13] . It should be noted though that this data has all been drawn from US physicians and may not reflect patterns of burnout in other countries. Furthermore, while no evidence indicates a steady increase in burnout over the past decade, data on overlapping constructs (e.g. healthcare professional stress levels) suggests that there is likely to have been a real-terms reduction in staff well-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic [25] .",

            "text": "We are not aware of longitudinal studies which focus on surgical trainees and so must extrapolate from wider evidence suggesting that it is unlikely that burnout has increased in a linear trend in this group over recent years. The apparent stability of levels of burnout seems counterintuitive given a growing awareness of burnout as a problem. These null findings could potentially be attributed to weaknesses in the measurement of burnout, but similar trends have also been found in studies of other mental health indicators such as depression [26] . For example, a 2015 metaanalysis in resident physicians estimated a year-on-year increase of 0.5% in depression prevalence, but the authors suggested that this might be explained by wider community cohort changes or growing awareness of depression, rather than real increases over time [27] . Instead, it has been suggested that rather than burnout increasing over time, the greater awareness of burnout has been driven by changing attitudes, with younger cohorts of medical students prioritising personal well-being and worklife balance more highly [28, 29] . Moreover, while awareness of burnout was growing prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has subsequently been further prioritised following the pressures on healthcare services and focus on healthcare professional well-being elicited by the crisis [25] . Given the increased levels of burnout present in surgical trainees relative to trainees in other medical specialities [8] , it is possible that this trend could reduce the desirability of specialising in surgery and so threaten the sustainability of the surgical workforce moving forwards. Indeed, a recent survey of general surgery residents in the USA found that 40% would not choose surgery again [30] and a survey of orthopaedic and trauma surgery (OTS) residents in France reported that 61% would not recommend OTS to their children [27] .",

In a systematic review of 41 studies across surgical specialties, high levels of depersonalisation were found in 46-53% of residents compared with 7-26% of attending surgeons and high levels of emotional exhaustion were found in 17-42% of residents compared with 9-31% of attendings [33] .

Conversely, factors which could generate a sense of being unsupported have been associated with higher risk of burnout. In a study of digestive surgery trainees in France, it was found that perceiving a lack of gratitude from senior staff, an insufficient amount of practical training and an overly high level of responsibility were all associated with a greater risk of reporting burnout [47] .",

Instead, it may be more useful and accurate to view burnout as a warning sign which could indicate that a wider pattern of poor mental health and unhelpful behaviours could be present.

In a study of US general surgery residents, it was found that overall burnout and each of the emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation facets were significantly associated with a higher self-reported risk of having made a medical error that resulted in harm, and making a near-miss that did not result in harm [71] .",

For example, two studies observed significant associations between burnout and cognitive decline only in complex cognitive tasks whereas performance on less complex tasks was within the normal range [73, 74] . Interestingly, burnout is associated with poorer performance on cognitive tasks tapping attention and visuo-spatial constructional ability [75] . Additionally, a study revealed that healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, psychologists) with stress-related exhaustion take longer to switch their attention between tasks [76] . Moreover, research with internal medicine residents and faculty members show that high depersonalisation scores were associated with a decreased blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and middle frontal gyrus, while high exhaustion scores were associated with more right posterior cingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus BOLD, three brain regions that are associated with executive functions, memory and attention, respectively [77] . Error monitoring impairments, as indicated by event-related potential (ERP) patterns, have also been observed among burnout populations [78] . Disrupted ERP patterns indicative of a high cognitive workload have also been observed among surgical residents [79] . Overall, the impact of burnout on cognitive functioning most relevant to surgical practice (i.e. attention, executive functions and visuo-spatial abilities) is likely to have negative impacts on patient safety.",

Despite this, several promising avenues for future research can be identified. Findings from studies of risk factors related to surgical trainee burnout suggest that changes made to training programmes could be useful targets for reducing burnout and could be manageable to implement, such as the introduction of formal mentorship [30] .

However, most of the studies into interventions for surgical trainee burnout suffer from significant methodological limitations and there is an urgent need for further, higher-quality research in this area.
