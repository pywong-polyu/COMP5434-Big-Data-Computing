Mental health management using mobile apps can be a useful intervention method. The development and application of verified and highly efficient apps for mental health and stress management are needed. We developed healing programs and verified their effectiveness based on apps designed to promote adult mental health. Methods: We conducted a one-group pretest-posttest study in which 85 participants used the app for 12 weeks. We assessed its effects on participants' stress (perceived stress scale, effort-reward imbalance, and photoplethysmogram (PPG)), anxiety, depression, emotional labor, and well-being. Results: The stress survey results post-intervention increased or stayed the same; however, the PPG results decreased (p = 0.002) after using the app. Depression (p = 0.043) and anxiety (p = 0.003) also decreased; however, emotional labor and well-being remained unchanged. The awareness of, knowledge of, and attitude toward mental health management all increased post-intervention. Discussion: The developed mobile app was an efficient and highly accessible way to promote mental health. However, the app requires modification and supplementation for continual use. Additionally, ongoing research concerning the study, evaluation, and integration of mobile apps is required.",

In particular, 73.3% of adult workers were found to be under severe stress [2] . Stress causes several physical and psychological problems, such as cardiovascular disease, stomach ulcers, decreased immunity, and depression [3] . According to a mental health awareness survey conducted with Seoul citizens, 48.3% of the respondents experienced mental problems such as stress, depression, and suicidal thoughts in the past year; their way of coping with such problems was to talk to family and friends (47.9%) or try to take care of it themselves (27.3%). Most respondents (91.3%) recognized that mental illness needed medical treatment, just like other diseases; but they experienced difficulties in using medical and counseling institutions [1, 4] .",

The database was created by building a Java-based development environment. The tools used were VSCODE (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA), GIT (GIT, New York, NY, USA), MySQL Workbench (Oracle Corporation, Austin, TX, USA), Cyberduck FTP (Cyberduck, Boston, MA, USA), and Safari and Chrome browsers. Development languages were PHP v7.3, HTML, Javascript, and CSS. The database development environment was MariaDB v10 (MariaDB Corporation, Redwood City, CA, USA), and it was developed on a MAC OS. The Linux server (Red Hat, Raleigh, NC, USA) was used, and the goal was to store all data on the server and accumulate big data. The server receives and stores data from smart devices, which is the basis for analyzing data to identify mental health and other conditions and provide customized services (Figure 1 ). Figure 2 shows the main screen of Mind Healer, which consists of a psychological test, a sensor test, and a healing program that identify users' condition. It was designed so that information can be entered to identify users' health-related information and general characteristics.

When each test item was clicked and the questions were answered, a score was provided and stored on the app and on the Internet. \uf0b7 Two tools were used for stress. The first was the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), developed by Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein [16] . It is a Korean version of the PSS (PS-10)-a tool developed to assess the awareness of subjective stress. It comprises six items that measure negative awareness and four items that measure positive awareness. It evaluates the past month and provides a score from 0 to 4 per item (range = 0-40), and higher scores indicate greater stress awareness. Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.89. Second, we used the effort-reward imbalance (ERI), a tool translated by Hwang, Hong, and Kang [17] based on a tool developed by Siegrist [18] . The ERI measures work-related stress, and Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.80.

Although PSS scores increased (t = 3.43, p = 0.001), participants remained in the \"early stages of stress\" range. The ERI results showed no major changes before and after the intervention. However, for PPG, which shows immediate results after using the app, there was a significant decrease (t = 3.42, p = 0.002). Notably, it is difficult to measure stress from a single aspect considering the varied physical changes [35] ; therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between perceived chronic stress and acute stress that appears immediately during work or in daily life. However, many studies do not clearly distinguish between acute and chronic stress, and it is difficult to fully assess the individual or common parts between the two [36] . Harkness and Monroe [37] stated that stress measurement is likely to be affected by many causes of bias. They also argued that the measured values should not be considered the same as individuals' exposure to stress and stress reactions. Given this point, two important characteristics of chronic stress assessments are stability (they represent truly chronic, ongoing conditions) and convergent validity (they are not subjective and correspond to independent measures of similar constructs) [36] . Therefore, app-based interventions are difficult. However, mobile apps appear to be effective for acute or short-lived stress.",

Attention is paid to emotional labor because, when workers' original feelings are managed by the rules of emotion which are artificially constructed to generate profits for the company, the distortion or exaggeration of the nature of workers cause job stress [38] . Emotional labor management can be done at organizational and personal levels; but, in many cases, it must be managed at the organizational level. In 2019, Korea implemented the Special Act on the Protection of Emotional Labor, and the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA) prepared guidelines on emotional labor management. It provided that policies on emotional labor management should be prepared, and appropriate service standards and customer response manuals should be developed and distributed, so that regulations on unconditional kindness and response to malicious customers would be applied. It also recommended handling grievances, improving working conditions, and operating health promotion programs. On a personal level, it recommended learning how to control emotions, counseling, communication, positive lifestyles, and various club activities [39] . According to Shim [40] , better relationships with others, and higher trust or autonomy, lead to higher levels of well-being. Looking at emotional labor and well-being in this respect, it seems that our results were non-significant, because mobile-based MHapps focus on personal dimensions and cannot affect organizational aspects. However, if the application is used in an organizational manner to expand the operation of health promotion programs and handle grievances, positive results may be expected.",

In addition, most said they would ask for help from experts, which was much higher than the 75.2% of Seoul citizens who said they would take care of it alone or ask for help from acquaintances. The app thus raised awareness of mental health. Further, knowledge and attitude increased, and users were satisfied and would recommend the app. Subjective assessments noted that the app was easy to use and brief. By experiencing the effect of the MHapp, the users affect the continual use of the utility and ease of use of the healthcare app [41, 42] . Continued use of mobile apps is fostered by ease of habit, low effort expectancy, and high hedonic motivation MHapps [11, 43, 44] . Lee and Han [45] showed better results when positive assessments were made about MHapps and when healthcare programs using apps were preferred. Consequently, it is necessary to emphasize the positive aspects of MHapps before using them to users' willingness to use and to modify and supplement them by providing various content to make it more interesting.",

Because of this advantage, many MHapps are being released, and consumers are looking for and using apps for mental health [47] to improve their well-being. To efficiently manage the mental health of Korean people, the development and application of effective MHapps is essential. In particular, mental health professionals should serve as leaders in the research, evaluation, and integration of mobile apps [11] .
