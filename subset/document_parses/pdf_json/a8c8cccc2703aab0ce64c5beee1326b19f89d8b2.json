Primary healthcare providers closed their doors on business as usual, and rapidly embraced new ways of working to protect both staff and vulnerable patients. 4 5 'In-person' consultations were reserved for limited numbers of patients and conditions as determined by telephone triage, and consultations were conducted by telephone, video and messaging applications (telehealth or telemedicine). 4 6 7 Researchers have already explored patient experiences of primary healthcare delivered by telehealth during lockdown in New Zealand, 8 but the extent to which telehealth is appropriate for, and was used for, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is unclear. SRH consultations often involve discussion of confidential, sensitive issues. People without access to a quiet, private place will be at a significant disadvantage if only offered telehealth. Furthermore, many aspects of SRH care necessitate in-person consultations, and some aspects of SRH care were temporarily unavailable. For example, access to asymptomatic testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was limited as laboratories prioritised resources for processing COVID-19 swabs. 9 Intramuscular antibiotic treatment for gonorrhoea was not available in many services, 10 and cervical screening and human papillomavirus immunisations were deferred. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods could not be inserted or removed 11 and access to oral contraceptives was limited to repeat prescriptions or new starts only for the minipill. 10 Supply chains were disrupted, resulting in short supply or unavailability of some subsidised oral contraceptives and condoms. 12 13 Young people are likely to have been most impacted by these restrictions. This study explored young people's need for sexual healthcare during lockdown, their experience of care received, and preferences for future receipt of sexual healthcare. This was an opportunistic addition to a broader survey of young people's access to sexual healthcare planned prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Pre-COVID-19, telehealth consultations have been suggested as a way to reduce access barriers related to travel, geographic location, wait times and childcare. 14 15 However, telehealth consultations can disadvantage people without a reliable internet connection, without permanent accommodation, or who live in shared or crowded places with no access to a private space for a confidential conversation with a health provider. 16 These kinds of constraints on connectivity and privacy more often impact young people, ethnic minority groups, and members of the LGBTQI+community. 17 Our survey sample was too small to identify clear differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of those unable to access services, but there was some evidence that individuals in the NEET group were less likely to have received sexual healthcare during lockdown. This group is known to face more challenges accessing sexual healthcare in New Zealand. 18 There are particular confidentiality and privacy issues when using telehealth methods, 19 and we observed that trying to talk to nurses or doctors about sexual health during lockdown was difficult for some young people participating in this study. Participants preferences for receipt of sexual healthcare in the future predominantly centred around in-person, clinic visits. While favoured by some, telephone or video consultations were generally less preferred than messaging options. We did not seek information about reasons for choice of consultation method in this study, but personal circumstances, familiarity/existing relationships with service providers, and perceived convenience are likely factors driving choice of method. 8 Hesitancy to use video consultations for sexual healthcare (and healthcare in general) has been associated with fears about confidentiality and security in previous research. 20 21 It has been suggested that despite being avid mobile phone users, many young people are not comfortable making or taking calls, 22 which could partly explain the lack of support for telephone consultations. Young people can find it hard to seek sexual healthcare at the best of times, 23 and so the conditions under which telehealth options might help or hinder access to sexual health care need to be more clearly understood so that these options can be offered if, and when, appropriate.",

Therefore, we could not draw conclusions about potential differences in need or access for important demographic subgroups (eg, M\u0101ori). A larger study sample and/or qualitative research would be useful to provide more robust data on the acceptability of telehealth methods for sexual health needs. This study only involved young people in one region, (although selected for its high deprivation population) so findings may not be generalisable to the experience of young people in other areas of New Zealand, or other countries. Our recruitment method was both a strength and a weakness of the study. As has been reported elsewhere, 24 we were able to reach a diverse group of young people but would have missed anyone not engaged in the social media platforms used to advertise the study, as well as those unable to access a device, data or WiFi -a group known to have faced significant challenges during lockdown. The survey was administered some 5 months after the nationwide lockdown which may have resulted in recall bias. Some of the challenges identified by participants as impacting on their ability to access healthcare will not have been specific to lockdown. To keep survey completion time to a minimum, questions were kept brief. To avoid privacy and confidentiality concerns, participants were not asked about the nature of their sexual health care/ issues, so we cannot comment on specific aspects of care that were able/unable to be accessed during lockdown. Presumably some of the in-person consultations will have been for care that could not be provided virtually by telehealth.",

Sexual health service providers surveyed during lockdown in Australia noted that telehealth does not allow for the same level of engagement as in-person consultations, and reduces the likelihood of opportunistic conversations about sexual health. 25 Furthermore, a range of SRH issues necessitate in-person care, so if or when access is limited only to telehealth, some important aspects of care will be delayed or missed. The range of ways in which New Zealand providers Original research limited or adapted their provision of SRH services during the nationwide lockdown have not yet been fully documented. Research to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the SRH provider landscape and documentation of lessons learnt by SRH providers in New Zealand would be valuable. Limitations in telehealth and young people's concerns about these methods for SRH care need to be more clearly understood to inform future service provision, particularly for groups known to experience inequity in their SRH such as young M\u0101ori. This will allow mitigating strategies to be identified and implemented during future periods of lockdown to avoid exacerbation of current inequities in access to SRH care.",
