SCARFs include cellular factors both facilitating and restricting viral entry. Among adult organs, enterocytes and goblet cells of the small intestine and colon, kidney proximal tubule cells, and gallbladder basal cells appear most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with clinical data. Our analysis also suggests alternate entry paths for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung, central nervous system, and heart. We predict spermatogonial cells and prostate endocrine cells, but not ovarian cells, to be highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting male-specific vulnerabilities. Early stages of embryonic and placental development show a moderate risk of infection. The nasal epithelium looks like another battleground, characterized by high expression of both promoting and restricting factors and a potential age-dependent shift in SCARF expression. Lastly, SCARF expression appears broadly conserved across human, chimpanzee and macaque organs examined. Our study establishes an important resource for investigations of coronavirus biology and pathology.",

The canonical entry mechanism of these coronaviruses is a two-step process mediated by the viral Spike (S) protein decorating the virion. First, the S protein must bind directly to a cell surface receptor and second, it must be cleaved ('primed') by a cellular protease to enable membrane fusion. Thus, the cellular tropism of a coronavirus is conditioned not only by the expression of an adequate receptor on the cell surface, but also by the presence of a host-encoded protease capable of cleaving the S protein, preferably at or close to the site of receptor binding (de Haan and Rottier, 2005; . For both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) have been identified as a prime receptor and a critical protease, respectively, for entry into a target cell Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Wrapp et al., 2020) . These findings have prompted numerous efforts to profile the basal expression levels of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 across healthy human tissues in order to predict the tropism of these two closely related viruses. While studies monitoring protein abundance in situ (e.g. immunocytochemistry) offer a more direct assessment, and have been conducted previously to study ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 expression (Hamming et al., 2004; Hikmet et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020) , most recent investigations have taken advantage of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to profile the expression of these two factors at cellular resolution in a wide array of tissues (see references in Table S1 ).",

However, they suffer from several limitations. First, most studies (15/27) profiled a single organ or organ system, and the majority focused on the respiratory tract. Second, most studies (19/27) restricted their analysis to ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2, ignoring other factors potentially limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry or replication. Yet, there is evidence that these two proteins alone cannot solely explain all the current clinical and research observations. For instance, certain cell lines (e.g. A549 alveolar lung carcinoma) can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of appreciable level of ACE2 RNA or protein (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Wyler et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Similarly, clinical data point to SARS-CoV-2 infection of several organs, such as lung, bronchus, nasopharynx, esophagus, liver and stomach, where ACE2 expression could not be detected in healthy individuals (Hikmet et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020b) . Moreover, there are discordant reports as to where and how much ACE2 may be expressed in certain cells, including alveolar type II cells of the lung, which are widely regarded as a primary site of infection and tissue damage. Together, these observations suggest that either ACE2 expression levels vary greatly between individuals or during the course of an infection (Ziegler et al., 2020) or that SARS-CoV-2 can use alternate receptor(s) to enter certain cell types. For instance, cell surface protein Basignin (BSG, also known as CD147) has been shown to interact with the S protein in vitro and facilitate entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in Vero and 293T cells (Vankadari and Wilce, 2020; Wang et al., 2020b) . In fact, SARS-CoV and other hCoVs can utilize multiple cell surface molecules to promote their entry into cells, including ANPEP (Yeager et al., 1992) , CD209 (DC-SIGN) (Yang et al., 2004) , CLEC4G (LSECtin) (Marzi et al., 2004) , and CLEC4M (LSIGN/CD299) (Gramberg et al., 2005) . Likewise, hCoVs can use a variety of cellular proteases to prime their S protein, in substitution for TMPRSS2 in a cell type-specific manner. These include other members of the TMPRSS family (e.g. TMPRSS4) Zang et al., 2020) , but also Cathepsins (CTSL/M) (Simmons et al., 2013a) and FURIN (Mille and Whittaker, 2014; Walls et al., 2020) . To our knowledge, no single study has examined systematically the expression of these alternate hCoV entry factors. Just as importantly, none of the previous studies have taken into account the expression of host factors known to oppose or restrict cellular entry of hCoVs, including .

Specifically, we mined publicly available scRNA-seq datasets using consistent normalization procedures to integrate and compare the dynamics of SCARF expression in human pre-implantation embryos (Yan et al., 2013) , at the maternal-fetal interface (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018) , in male and female gonads (Sohni et al., 2019; Wagner et al., 2020) and 14 other adult tissues (Han et al., 2020) , as well as nasal brushing from young and old healthy donors (Deprez et al., 2019; Garc\u0131\u00e1 et al., 2019; Vieira Braga et al., 2019) . Additionally, we use bulk transcriptomics for four organs of interest (lung, kidney, liver, heart) from human, chimpanzee, and macaque (Blake et al., 2020) to examine the conservation of SCARF expression across primates. This study represents the most systematic survey of SCARF expression to date and provides a valuable resource, including a user-friendly web browser, for interpreting and prioritizing clinical, pathological, and biological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.",

Two factors have been established most rigorously to promote cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 (and previously SARS-CoV) in human cells ( Figure 1 and Table S2 ): the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 protease (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . BSG is a putative alternate receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which has received experimental support (Chen et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2020b) . We also included receptors which have been confirmed . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Next, we considered a number of cellular proteases, in addition to TMPRSS2, as alternative priming factors. TMPRSS4 was recently shown to be capable of performing this function for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells Zang et al., 2020) . TMPRSS11A/B has been shown to activate the S peptide of other coronaviruses (Kam et al., 2009; Zmora et al., 2018) . Additionally, FURIN is known to activate MERS-CoV and possibly SARS-CoV-2 (Mille and Whittaker, 2014; Walls et al., 2020) and Cathepsins (CTSL/B) can also substitute for TMPRSS2 to prime SARS-CoV (Simmons et al., 2013b) . Importantly, we also enlisted several restriction factors that are known to protect cells against entry of SARS-CoV-2 (LY6E) (Pfaender et al., 2020) or a broad range of enveloped RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV (IFITM1-3) (Huang et al., 2011) . We also considered a few additional factors that act postentry, but relatively early in viral replication such as TOP3B and MADP1 (ZCRB1), which may expressed in a tissue/cell type-specific fashion and are known to be essential for genome replication of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, respectively (Prasanth et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2012) . Lastly, we included a set of proteins known to be involved in assembly and trafficking of a range of RNA viruses and have been shown recently to interact physically with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Gordon et al., 2020) , including members of the Rho-GTPase complex (RHOA, RAB10, RAB14, and RAB1A), AP2 complex (AP2A2 and AP2M1), and CHMP2A. In total, our list includes 28 SCARFs we deem solid candidates for modulating SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human cells ( Figure 1 ).",

In fact, none of the TMPRSS family members showed significant transcript levels (log2 FPKM >1) prior to ZGA (Figure 2A and Figure S1A -B). Pluripotent stem cells show high expression of IFITM1-3 but no evidence of ACE2 expression ( Figure   2A and Figure S1A ). Furthermore, analysis of another scRNA-seq dataset profiling ~60,000 cells representing 10 cell types differentiated in vitro from pluripotent stem cells (Han et al., 2020) show no significant ACE2 expression in any cells up to 20 days postdifferentiation ( Figure S1C ).

To investigate this, we turned to the transcriptomes of ~70,000 single cells derived from tissues collected at the maternalfetal interface during the first semester of pregnancy (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018) , which include both embryo-derived cells (fetal placenta) as well as maternal blood and decidual cells. Our analysis of this dataset based on unsupervised clustering and examination of known markers recapitulated the major types of trophoblasts, decidua and immune cells ( Figure 2B and S2A). Expression of ACE2 and DPP4 receptors was evident in cytotrophoblasts (CTB) and syncytiotrophoblasts (STB). ANPEP was abundantly expressed in all fetal lineages, while BSG was broadly expressed in maternal and fetal cells, but at much higher density in fetal cells ( Figure 2C-D) . CLEC4M was the only potential receptor highly expressed in maternal-derived cells; our analysis identified this gene as a strong marker of decidual perivascular cells ( Figure 2B -D). Interestingly, extravillous trophoblasts (EVT), which directly invade maternal tissue, showed low level of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, but moderate to high levels of restriction factors IFITM1-3 and LY6E, which were also expressed by immune and decidual cells ( Figure S2B ).",

Perivascular tissues also exhibited BSG + TMPRSS2 + and DPP4 + TMPRSS2 + cells, albeit in fewer proportion compared to CTB (0.5 %) ( Figure 2E and S2B). Interestingly, a substantial fraction of DPP4 + cells (~20-80%) were co-expressing IFITM1-3 and LY6E consistently across the whole dataset, whereas ACE2 + and BSG + cells rarely co-expressed these restriction factors ( Figure 2E , S2D and Table S4 ). Rather, ACE2 + cells tend to co-express TMPRSS2 and FURIN, but again this was mostly confined to a small subset of CTB cells (see also Figure 1D -E).

To monitor more finely the expression profile of SCARFs in male and female reproductive tissues, we analyzed scRNA-seq datasets from testis samples collected from two healthy donors (Sohni et al., 2019) and adult ovary from five healthy donors (Wagner et al., 2020) . In adult testis, we were able to recapitulate the expression clusters identified in the original report (Sohni et al., 2019) , which consisted of early and late stages of spermatogonia (SPG), spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), spermatids (ST), macrophages, endothelial and immune cells, each defined by a unique set of marker genes ( Figure S3A -B). Turning to SCARFs, we observed that TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed in both early and late SSCs, whereas CoV receptors are abundantly expressed in the early stage of SSCs .

Early SSCs expressing one of the receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4, ANPEP) were found to be consistently enriched for co-expression with TMPRSS2 across the testis dataset (hypergeometric distribution, p-value <1e-7) ( Figure 3B ). Moreover, other SCARFs interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and predicted to facilitate virus trafficking or assembly (Table S2 ) also show highest transcript levels in SSC and SPG ( Figure   3C ). In contrast, restriction factors were lowly expressed in all four clusters of spermatogonial cells ( Figure 3A ). Taken together these observations indicate spermatogonial cells may be highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

ACE2 + cells were generally rare across this dataset, and most evident in granulosa, where they show a relatively high level of expression per cell ( Figure 3D ). Alternate receptors were expressed at significant level in specific ovarian cell populations. For instance, DPP4 was expressed in 4% of endothelial cells, while CLEC4M and BSG were highly expressed in granulosa ( Figure 3D ). T cells and endothelial layers were markedly enriched for ANPEP and DPP4 transcripts, respectively ( Figure 3D ). Strikingly, however, we could not identify any single cell across the entire ovarian dataset with evidence of TMPRSS2 expression, nor any of the alternate proteases TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11A and TMPRSS11B. This pattern was corroborated by examining the expression profile of all TMPRSS protease family members using bulk RNA-seq data from GTEx. None of these proteases appear to be expressed in ovarian tissue, whereas the testis expresses 7 out of 19 members including TMPRSS2 ( Figure   S4 and S5). We note that the oocyte also lacks transcripts from any TMPRSS family members (see Figure 2A , S1A). Collectively, these data reveal a stark contrast between male and female reproductive organs: while early stages of spermatogenesis may be highly permissive for SARS-CoV-2 entry, the ovary and oocytes are unlikely to get infected.",

We detected little to no expression of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 in the remaining tissues and cell types ( Figure 4B ), including type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) alveolar cells of the lung. This latter observation is at odds with earlier reports (Table S1 ), but in line with a recent study using a wide array of techniques to monitor ACE2 expression within the lung, including transcriptomics, proteomics and immunostaining (Hikmet et al., 2020) . Cardiomyocytes (from the heart) show relatively high levels of ACE2, but lacked TMPRSS2 expression ( Figure 4B and S6B-E). It is also important to emphasize that even when ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 were detected at appreciable RNA levels in a given organ or cell type, only a very small fraction of cells was found to express both genes simultaneously. For instance, the kidney shows relatively high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but only 0.01% cells were double-positive for these factors. Only three cell types stood out in our analysis for relatively elevated levels of co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (0.5-5% of cells double-positives): enterocytes, proximal tubule cells, and goblet cells ( Figure 4B -C), which we will return to below.",

Since this tissue was not included in the HCL dataset, we analyzed another scRNA-seq dataset derived from six nasal brushing samples from healthy donors collected by three independent studies (Deprez et al., 2019; Garc\u0131\u00e1 et al., 2019; Vieira Braga et al., 2019) (Table S3 ). Our analysis of this merged dataset reveals four major cell clusters consistent across all 6 samples, corresponding to ciliated, secretory, suprabasal epithelial cells and natural killer cells ( Figure 5A , Figure   S8 ). Natural killer cells express mostly DPP4, while the three epithelial cell types showed low to moderate RNA amounts of ACE2, ANPEP, BSG and TMPRSS2 ( Figure 5A , Table   S6 ). ACE2 RNA was most abundant in ciliated cells, while ANPEP was most highly expressed in secretory cells. Conversely, BSG was abundant throughout all the nasal epithelial cell types, albeit at higher level in suprabasal cells ( Figure 5A , S9A and Table   S6 ). TMPRSS2 was also expressed in all three nasal epithelial cell types, with highest density in ciliated cells (41%). Overall, the percentage of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells was relatively low within each cell type (2.3% in ciliated, 1.6% in secretory and 1% in suprabasal cells) (Table S6 ). In contrast with the digestive system (characterized above, Figure 4B -C), nasal epithelial cells rarely show co-expression of ANPEP, DPP4 and ACE2, but rather exclusive expression of one of these three receptors ( Figure 5A and S9A).

Lastly, we calculated the percentage of double/triple positive cells for various combinations of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and restriction factors (Table S6) . We found that 85% and 65% of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + ciliated cells are also positive for LY6E and IFITM3, respectively (Table S6 ). Together these data suggest that the nasal epithelium expresses various combinations of factors that in principle could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it also expresses robust basal level of restriction factors, which may act as a strong protective barrier in this tissue.",

While this is a small sample, this enabled us to split the data into a 'young' and 'old' group and compare the percentage of secretory and ciliated cells positive for entry factors between the two groups ( Table   S3 ). The percentage of cells positive for either ACE2, TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4 was comparable between the two groups and these factors were most highly expressed in ciliated cells of both groups. However, the percentage of double-positive cells (ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + or ACE2 + TMPRSS4 + ) were significantly higher in the old group, both within ciliated and secretory cell populations (Figure 5B, S9B and Table S6 ). Interestingly, the percentage of ANPEP + TMPRSS2 + or ANPEP + TMPRSS2 + double positives cells showed the opposite trend: they were significantly more frequent in the young group, both within ciliated and secretory cells ( Figure 5B ). To examine whether these differences were driven by an age-dependent shift in the relative expression of receptors and/or proteases during cell differentiation within the nasal epithelium, we conducted a global differential gene expression analysis between ciliated and secretory cells within each age group and each independent study. We found that ANPEP, TMPRSS4 and CTSB were significantly up-regulated in secretory cells relative to ciliated cells in all three studies, regardless of age ( Figure 5C ). Conversely, TMPRSS2 levels were up-regulated in ciliated cells of the young group, but remains unaltered in old individuals regardless of the study of origin .

Specifically, liver and lung samples from chimpanzee showed relatively high DPP4 expression but very low ACE2 expression relative to human and macaque ( Figure 6C -D). Liver and lung samples from human and chimpanzee did not express ACE2, however the macaque liver showed high expression level for ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and TMPRSS2 genes ( Figure 6D ). These results suggest that macaques may be more prone to liver coronavirus infection than humans or chimpanzees. In agreement with our scRNA-seq analysis of the HCL dataset, we found that ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP and TMPRSS2 genes are all expressed at higher level in the kidney of all three primates, relative to the other three organs. Thus, out of the four organs examined in this analysis, the kidney appears to be the most readily permissive to coronavirus infection in all three species ( Figure 6C-D) .",

A prerequisite to the success of these endeavors is to gain a better understanding of the biology and pathology of SARS-CoV-2, a newly emerged coronavirus responsible for millions of infections and over 300,000 deaths as of mid-May 2020. While it is clear that COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease which causes death via pneumonia, many unknowns remain as to the extent of tissues and cell types vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. How host genetic factors interact with the virus and modulate the course of an infection also remain poorly understood. Our study, along with several others (published or preprinted over the past few weeks, Table   S1 ) have tapped into vast amount of publicly available scRNA-seq data to profile the expression of host factors thought to be important for entry of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy tissues. Because the basal expression level of these factors determines, at least in part, the tropism of the virus, this information is foundational to predict which tissues are more vulnerable to infection. These data are also important to guide and prioritize clinical interventions and pathological studies, including biopsies. Finally, this type of analysis has the potential to reveal possible routes of infection within and between individuals.",

Most other studies have focused exclusively on ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 (see Table   S1 ). A handful of studies considered one or a few additional receptors (e.g. DPP4, ANPEP) in a subset of their analyses (Sungnak et al., 2020) . To our knowledge, no other study has included all the human coronavirus receptors considered here, even though these alternate receptors have been experimentally confirmed to interact with and facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (BSG) or the closely related SARS-CoV (CD209, CLEC4G/M) (see Table S2 for references). Furthermore, our study is the first to consider factors known or predicted to restrict SARS-CoV-2 at the level of entry, such as LY6E and IFITMs. While these restriction factors are known to be interferon-inducible (Jia et al., 2012; Mar et al., 2018) , their basal level of expression is likely to be a key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 tropism. Indeed, it is well established that coronaviruses are equipped with multiple mechanisms to suppress interferon and other immune signaling pathway (Frieman and Baric, 2008; Gralinski and Baric, 2015) and there is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection also illicit a 'muted' interferon response (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Wyler et al., 2020) . As such, the basal level at which restriction factors are expressed in a given target cell may be the major obstacle the virus encounters at the onset of an infection.",

While we detect high amount of ACE2 mRNA in the zygote and up to the 4-cell stage, it precipitously drops at ZGA and remained at very low or undetectable levels in the pluripotent cells of the early embryo. ACE2 remains silent in pluripotent stem cells in culture, even after 20 days of in-vitro differentiation to various cell types. These observations suggest that ACE2 RNA is heavily deposited in the zygote (presumably from the oocyte), but the gene is subsequently silenced in stem cells and poorly differentiated cells. The idea that ACE2 expression positively correlates with the level of cellular differentiation has been observed in the context of the airway epithelium (Jia et al., 2005) .",

During embryonic development, the trophectoderm gives rise to all the different types of trophoblasts (placental fetal cells). Accordingly, we observe that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression persists in a subset of trophoblasts at least up to the first trimester of pregnancy. Our results extend recent observations based on an independent analysis of the same placenta dataset, which remarked ACE2 expression in certain cell types of placenta/decidua (Sungnak et al., 2020) . We further these observations by identifying a small population of cytotrophoblasts co-expressing TMPRSS2 with ACE2, BSG and/or DPP4, but exhibiting very low levels of IFITM and LY6E restriction factors. We conclude that a subset of trophoblast cells may be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 entry. Overall, our findings for the placenta are consistent with current clinical data suggesting that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected mother to fetus is plausible, but probably rare (Baud et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020a; Cui et al., 2020; Hosier et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020) .

To our knowledge, these observations have not been reported elsewhere. One study reported high level of ACE2 expression in spermatogonial, Sertoli and Leydig cells , but did not investigate other SCARFs.

However, these observations have been challenged by more recent studies. For instance, Hikmet et al. could not confirm ACE2 expression in AT2 cells, neither through re-analysis of 3 different lung scRNA-seq datasets, nor by immunohistochemistry (Hikmet et al., 2020) . Ziegler et al. analyzed a different lung scRNA-seq dataset and found only a very small fraction (>1%) of AT2 cells expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts (Ziegler et al., 2020) . Likewise, Aguiar et al. detected only very low amount ACE2 RNA or protein in alveoli and airway epithelium, but showed that the alternative receptor BSG was consistently expressed in respiratory mucosa from 98 human samples (non-COVID-19) (Aguiar et al., 2020) . Our results, which stem from an independent analysis of yet another scRNA-seq dataset (Han et al., 2020) are consistent with the notion that basal ACE2 RNA levels in lung cells, including AT2 cells, are very low. Importantly, we observed that AT2 cells do co-express the putative alternate receptors BSG, ANPEP and/or DPP4 along with TMPRSS2 at appreciable frequency (0.2-0.7%). Taken together, these data question whether ACE2 is the primary receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 initiates lung infection. A non-mutually exclusive explanation is that ACE2 expression is widely variable in the lung due to genetic or environmental factors. Consistent with the latter, evidence is mounting that ACE2 can be induced by interferon and other innate immune signaling (Ziegler et al., 2020) .",

Conversely, we found that the percentage of ANPEP + cells was higher among secretory or suprabasal cells than in ciliated cells, while BSG was broadly expressed throughout the nasal epithelium. We also note that 19% of suprabasal cells expressed TMPRSS2. Yet, the percentage of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells remained rather low across the nasal epithelium while IFITM3 and LY6E restriction factors showed high RNA levels throughout this tissue. This latter finding is consistent with the observation of Sungnak et al.

We found that neither ACE2 nor TMPRSS2/4 on their own were differentially expressed between young and old nasal epithelia, but we observed that the percentage of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + /4 + double-positive cells was significantly greater in older donors, both within ciliated and secretory cells. Conversely, the percentage of ANPEP + TMPRSS2 + /4 + cells was significantly higher in younger donors. Considering ANPEP association with SARS-CoV infection (Kong et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2003) , these trends fit with the observations that the median age for COVID-19 patients in China has been reported at 51 years old (Aylward, Bruce (WHO); Liang, 2020), whereas the median age for SARS patients in China was 33 years old (Cao et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2009) . It is tempting to speculate that the opposite susceptibility of old and young people to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may relate to the differential usage of ANPEP and ACE2 receptors by these two closely-related coronaviruses. However, our analysis is limited by a small sample size and many possible confounders such as gender, smoking status, and other genetic and environmental factors, which could not be controlled for.",

Within the small intestine, we found that the jejunum is where highest expression of these factors is achieved. This is in slight deviation from Ziegler et al. who suggested that the ileum had the maximum expression of ACE2 (Ziegler et al., 2020) . Regardless of which section of the small intestine, both studies converge on the finding that expression of these factors is largely driven by enterocytes and their progenitors, which line the inner surface of the intestine and are therefore directly exposed to food and pathogens.",

We also established an open-access, web-based interface, dubbed SCARFace, allowing any user to explore the expression of any SCARF (and any other human RefSeq gene) at single-cell resolution within any of the scRNA-seq dataset analyzed here. Our finding that SCARF expression is generally well conserved across primate species, along with high level of sequence conservation of the ACE2 interface with the Spike protein (Damas et al., 2020; Melin et al., 2020) , suggests that non-human primates are adequate models for the study of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of therapeutic interventions, including vaccines. It would be desirable to obtain single-cell resolution of SCARF expression in a broader range of tissues and species, including nonprimate models such as hamsters and ferrets. While our survey of SCARF expression across human embryonic and adult tissues is the broadest of its kind, it remains limited by the constraints and shortcomings of scRNA-seq. These include the lack or underrepresentation of certain cell types that are rare or undetected due to low sequencing depth, isolation biases, or statistical cutoffs. Likewise, the expression level of any given gene may be underestimated due to dropout effects. Hence, we strongly recommend .

Furthermore, RNA expression levels are imprecisely reflective of protein abundance and our observations need to be corroborated by approaches quantifying protein expression in situ. Lastly, and perhaps most critically, SCARF expression within and between individuals is bound to be heavily modulated by genetic and environmental factors, including infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. Such variables may drastically shift the expression patterns we observe in healthy tissues from a limited number of donors. In fact, several SCARFs surveyed here such as IFITM and LY6E restriction factors (Jia et al., 2012; Mar et al., 2018) , and apparently ACE2 itself (Ziegler et al., 2020) , are known to be modulated by infection and the innate immune response. Our data still provide a valuable baseline to evaluate how SCARF expression may be altered during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because we survey host factors associated with a range of zoonotic coronaviruses, this study may also prove a useful resource in the context of other eventual outbreaks. ",
