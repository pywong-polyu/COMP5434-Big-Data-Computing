In fact, there is an urgent need of more efficient and less toxic chemotherapy for these diseases. Medicinal inorganic chemistry currently offers an attractive option for the rational design of new drugs and, in particular, antiparasitic ones. In this sense, one of the main strategies for the design of metal-based antiparasitic compounds has been the coordination of an organic ligand with known or potential biological activity, to a metal centre or an organometallic core. Classical metal coordination complexes or organometallic compounds could be designed as multifunctional agents joining, in a single molecule, different chemical species that could affect different parasitic targets. This review is focused on the rational design of palladium(II) and platinum(II) compounds with bioactive ligands as prospective drugs against trypanosomatid parasites that has been conducted by our group during the last 20 years.",

In the last decades, the number of cases in non-endemic regions, like United States, Australia, Europe and Japan, has increased due to migration flows. The disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) that is mainly transmitted to mammalian hosts by infected blood-sucking bugs. In addition, other modes of transmission, responsible of the spreading of the disease to non-endemic regions, involve blood transfusion, organ transplant and congenital transmission. The parasite shows a complex life cycle that involves stages in the host and in the biological vector. Stages in the host show different susceptibility to drugs, which hampers the development of an effective chemotherapy (Santos et al., 2020; World Health Organization, nd) .",

The protozoan parasite causing this disease is Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) and in particular, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense subspecies. Most cases of chronic-like infections are caused by T. b. gambiense while T. b. rhodesiense causes the most serious form of the disease. In the late stage of this illness the parasites enter the central nervous system leading to profound sleep effects that give rise to the common name of HAT, sleeping sickness.

            "text": "During the preclinical development of new prospective drugs, it is important to know that these parasites exhibit complicated lifecycles alternating between stages in the insect vectors gut and in the mammalian host. This knowledge is relevant since it is well known that these different stages show different biological properties and, most importantly, different susceptibility to drugs. Shortly, T. cruzi is transmitted to the vertebrate host by the release of metacyclic trypomastigote form of the parasite in the feces of an infected triatome insect vector during its bite. Once inside the host, the parasite converts into the infective blood circulating trypomastigote stage that invades the tissues. Intracellularly, the amastigote form emerges that divides by binary fission and produces cell\u00b4s lysis. The released amastigotes convert into blood circulating trypomastigotes. After an insect meal they infect new insects and close the life cycle by converting into the non-infective epimastigote stage that only exists inside the gut of the insect. A similar scenario is observed in the lifecycle of T. brucei that shows four main developmental stages that occur in the infected insect and in the mammalian host, epimastigotes and procyclic forms, slender metacyclic trypomastigotes, and stumpy bloodstream proliferative metacyclic trypomastigotes, being the last one the most relevant form in the development of therapeutic agents. In contrast to other trypanosomatids, the part of the life cycle of T. brucei in the mammalian host occurs completely in the extracellular space. During the lifecycle of Leishmania sp the parasite alternates between the infective promastigote stage generated in the intestine of the insect vector and the replicative amastigote form inside the host macrophages (Brindha et al., 2021; Kourbeli et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "Although these trypanosomatid protozoan parasites show important differences, they are transmitted by different insect vectors and are responsible for clinically different human diseases, it has been demonstrated that they show relevant similarities related to their biology. Their genomes have been sequenced in 2005 and they are available in a database for parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae (TriTrypDB, http:// tritrypdb.org) (El-Sayed et al., 2005; Aslett et al., 2010) . These studies showed that Leishmania spp, T. cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei have many common features, like gene conservation, genome architecture, high synteny, identical amino acid sequences in proteins and common subcellular structures like kinetoplasts. In particular, they show more than 6,100 closely related genes codifying proteins of a total of 8,000-12,000 genes. This paves the way for planning the development of broadspectrum compounds that could be trypanosomatid-specific, affecting the three main parasites instead of affecting only one of them. This could lead to drugs that affect common targets in the different parasites showing activity against Leishmania spp, T. cruzi and T. brucei (Stuart et al., 2008; Ilari et al., 2018) .",

However, the discovery of the potent anti-tumor activity of cisplatin, [PtCl 2 (NH 3 ) 2 ] determined the beginning of the modern era of Medicinal inorganic chemistry, accompanied by a huge impact of metal compounds in modern medicine. By exploiting the unique properties of metal ions, Medicinal inorganic chemistry currently offers an attractive option for the rational design of new drugs, looking for defined targets and activities, and new diagnostic and theranostic tools (Zhang and Sadler, 2017; Hanif and Hartinger, 2018; Englinger et al., 2019; Kostelnik and Orvig, 2019; Soldevila-Barreda and Metzler-Nolte, 2019; WahsnerGale et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Anthony et al., 2020; Chamberlain et al., 2020; Chellan and Sadler, 2020; Imberti et al., 2020; Murray and Dyson, 2020; Cirri et al., 2021; Karges and Cohen, 2021; Lin et al., 2021; Silva et al., 2021; Yousuf et al., 2021) . In the last decades, the development of metal-based drugs has proven to be a promising approach in the search for new therapeutic tools against parasitic diseases. As a result of the research performed by several academic groups, a great number of classical coordination compounds and organometallics bearing antiparasitic activity were developed (S\u00e1nchez-Delgado et al., 2004; Navarro, 2009; Navarro et al., 2010; Gambino, 2011; Gambino and Otero, 2012; Salas et al., 2013; Tahghighi, 2014; Brown and Hyland, 2015; Pessoa et al., 2015; Camarada et al., 2016; Gambino and Otero, 2018; Marcelino et al., 2018; Ravera et al., 2018; Gambino and Otero, 2019; Markwalter et al., 2019; Ong et al., 2019; Mbaba et al., 2020; P\u0103unescu et al., 2021) .",

In the search for new improved treatment options based on organic compounds, both phenotypic and target-based approaches have been used. In a phenotypic approach, many compounds are evaluated in vitro against the parasites searching for a hit or lead compound and, in the target-based drug design, a specific parasite target is selected, and drugs are drawn up to affect this target specifically (Haanstra and Bakker, 2015; Field et al., 2017; Gambino and Otero, 2019) .",

The activity of the selected ligand could be enhanced because of metal complexation and its pharmacological properties could be improved as the stabilization of the organic drug may allow it to have a better performance in reaching and affecting the biological targets. In addition, the potential toxicity of the metal may be reduced because the organic ligand may limit the ability of the metal to interact with biomolecules that leads to toxicity. This approach could also be useful to circumvent drug resistance, as the metal complex would mask the organic drug. Finally, as stated, these metallodrugs would be capable of affecting multiple parasitic targets simultaneously (S\u00e1nchez-Delgado et al., 2004; Gambino and Otero, 2012; Ong et al., 2019; Navarro and Visbal, 2021) .",

The selection of these metal ions is based on the resemblance between tumour cells and parasites as stated above. In this sense, the current treatment of cancer is based on platinum complexes, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, most efforts related to the development of more effective and less toxic anticancer agents have been devoted to platinum compounds. On the other hand, complexes containing palladium are closely related to their platinum analogues. Therefore, Pd(II) has been selected as an alternative to Pt(II) in the search of new compounds for cancer therapy. The most significant resemblances are related to their coordination chemistry and, in particular, to the coordination number (four) and geometry (square planar) of their compounds. However, the ligand exchange kinetics of Pd(II) compounds is 10 4 -10 5 times faster than that of the Pt(II) analogues. This means that Pd(II) compounds are much more reactive in solution which could lead to a higher toxicity and a different biological behaviour. However, the adequate selection of ligands could be able to stabilize Pd(II) complexes affecting their reactivity and imparting substitution inertness (Jahromi et al., 2016; Lazarevi\u0107 et al., 2017; Cirri et al., 2021; Czarnomysy et al., 2021; Yousuf et al., 2021) .",

Therefore, different studies were performed in order to sustain the proposed targets and to look into the potential mode of action of the metal compounds. Related to the bioactive ligands, the reduction of the nitro moiety had been demonstrated to be the first step of their mechanism of anti T. cruzi action. The nitro anion formed would be responsible of generating other toxic radical species through a redox cycling process. Therefore, the effect of metal complexation on the redox potential of the nitro moiety was studied using cyclic voltammetry. This potential slightly changed because of both palladium or platinum complexes formation (\u0394E 0.05-0.1 V) and no significant differences were observed between both metal ions. However, it should be stated that the nitro moiety of all compounds resulted more easily reducible than that of Nifurtimox, and, therefore, the capacity of generating toxic free radicals would be better for the complexes. The production of free radicals inside the parasite cells was assessed by ESR spectroscopy using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pirroline-N-oxide (DMPO) for spin trapping of radical species having short half-lives. A 10-13 lines spectral pattern was observed for all the studied complexes which is consistent with the intracellular generation of the hydroxyl radical and the nitroheterocyclic radical of the complexes. So, the mechanism of anti T. cruzi action of the HTS compounds seems to remain in the obtained complexes. However, only for [PdCl 2 (HTS)] and [Pd(TS) 2 ] series, a good correlation between the concentration of the detected radicals (measured through the EPR signal intensities) and the IC 50 values for the anti T. cruzi activity was observed. On the other hand, the described redox cycling processes should increase the parasite oxygen consumption. Thus, the parasite oxygen uptake in the presence of the compounds was determined. In general, complexes increased oxygen consumption which confirms that redox cycling processes are occurring inside the parasites treated with the complexes (Otero et al., 2006; Vieites et al., 2008a; Cipriani et al., 2014) .",

Both complexes bind to the enzyme into the cleft between domains 2 and 3, near to the nicotinamide ring of the NADH cofactor.

In this sense, [Pd(quino) 2 ] complexes were obtained in order to improve on one hand, the volume at the 3-amino level ( Figure 7) and on the other hand, the bioavailability of the organic ligands. Results showed that the antitrypanosomal activity (epimastigote form, Tulahuen 2 strain) of the quinoxalines was improved upon complexation.

Biphosphonates are examples of this approach. These compounds are the most prescribed drugs for osteoporosis and other bone diseases. Among bisphosphonates, those containing nitrogen (NBPs) have proved to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) enzyme of the osteoclastic cells as their main mode of action. This enzyme is also present in trypanosomatid parasites. In addition, the specificity of the anti T. cruzi action of NBPs could be facilitated by the presence in parasites of specific organelles called acidocalcisomes. Acidocalcisomes are acidic structures involved in the storage and metabolism of phosphorous and calcium in parasites. Their composition is equivalent to the bone mineral so accumulation of bisphosphonates in these organelles would facilitate their antiparasitic action (Gambino and Otero, 2019) . Therefore, bisphosphonates were selected as bioactive ligands for our multi-target based approach. In this sense, complexes of the formula [Pd(NBP) 2 (NN)] with NBP commercial bisphosphonates (alendronate (ale) or pamidronate (pam)) and NN 1,10 phenanthroline (phen) or 2,2\u2032-bipyridine (bpy) were obtained (Figure 8) . The selection of palladium as metal ion and the NN compounds as co-ligands points at DNA as target. In fact, besides the potential covalent interaction of Pd ion with DNA, metal complexes with these planar aromatic ligands could interact with DNA through intercalation between nucleobases. Additionally, parasitic enzymes of the mevalonate pathway (like FPPS) would also be a potential target for these compounds as they are for the NBP ligands.",

However, all the complexes were able to similarly inhibit T. cruzi farnesyl diphosphate synthase and solanesyl diphosphate synthase enzymes suggesting that enzymatic inhibition would not be responsible for the observed differences in the biological activity.

In fact, both Pd-NBP-phen complexes showed a much higher affinity for DNA in the fluorescent ethidium bromide displacement experiments than Pd-NBP-bpy analogues.

The selected coligand, 1,1'bis(dipheny1phosphino) ferrocene, dppf (Figure 9) , acts as bidentate ligand binding to the metal center through the two phosphorus donor atoms and leaving the two extra coordination positions of the metal centre able to coordinate to the selected bioactive bidentate ligand ( Figure 10) .

Interestingly, the Pt compound had both the highest inhibition values and the highest activity against T. cruzi suggesting that TcFR could be involved in the mode of action of the compounds. Additionally, theoretical calculations confirmed that both compounds could be able to undergo oxidation at the ferrocene moiety which could aid to the biological activity.

The identification of molecular targets and the understanding of the mode of action of drug candidates are essential data for their clinical development. This knowledge is commonly elusive for metal-based drugs due to complicated Frontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org January 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 816266 mechanisms of action involving the interaction of metal compounds with multiple targets and biomolecules. Inorganic medicinal chemists have traditionally tried to identify and characterize, using in vitro approaches, molecular targets of a metal-based drug that mainly depend on the nature of the organic ligands and the metal center. Omic studies are relevant tools for uncovering the whole mechanism of action of metal-based drugs. Up and down regulated cellular proteins due to effects of drug and molecular targets interactions, identified and quantified by proteomics, together with cell uptake and subcellular distribution, quantified by metallomics, and changes in gene expression, determined by transcriptomics, allow to get a deeper insight into what occurs in the cells after administering a metallodrug. The knowledge achieved is a useful income for the rational design of novel metallodrugs (Wang et al., 2020) . High-throughput omic studies have proved to be powerful tools for going further into the basic biology of parasites like T. cruzi and also for the validation of drug targets (Atwood et al., 2005; Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2017; Garc\u00eda-Huertas et al., 2017; Van den Kerkhof et al., 2020) . Although these studies have been also used to explore organic drugs action in kinetoplastid parasites, similar studies for metal-based drugs were not reported until part of our group recently performed a high throughput omic study on T. cruzi for the two analogous Pt and Pd organometallic hit compounds [M II (dppf)(mpo)](PF 6 ) (Mosquillo et al., 2018a; Mosquillo et al., 2018b; Mosquillo et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Metallomic studies showed a high Pt and Pd uptake by parasite epimastigotes. For the same dose a higher nanomolar uptake per 10 6 parasites was determined for Pt-dppf-mpo than for Pd-dppfmpo. A similar pattern of metal distribution among the four analyzed macromolecules fractions (DNA, RNA, soluble proteins and insoluble proteins including membrane lipids) was found, with a preferential association to DNA. It is well known that metal complexes often could suffer reactions in biological media. Therefore, to evaluate if the M-dppf-mpo compounds are taken up intact by the parasites, the M (Pd or Pt) and Fe (present in the dppf moiety) levels were quantified in the selected parasite fractions at the same time. A 1:1 stoichiometric relationship between Fe and M in each fraction was obtained which would be consistent with the presence of the intact M-dppf-mpo species bound to the selected macromolecules (Mosquillo et al., 2018a; Mosquillo et al., 2018b) . Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses allowed to identify differentially expressed transcripts and proteins in the treated parasites. The number of differentially expressed proteins was 342 for Pd-dppf-mpo and 411 for Pt-dppf-mpo. In addition, the number of soluble and insoluble proteins modified after treatment with both compounds was similar. The effect of Pddppf-mpo treatment showed more modulated transcripts (2,327 Frontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org January 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 816266 of 10,785 identified transcripts) than Pt-dppf-mpo treatment (201 of 10,773 identified transcripts). These results suggest that the mechanism of action for Pd-dppf-mpo is at the transcriptome level. Differentially expressed transcripts were functionally categorized which allowed to identify the cellular processes and pathways that were affected by the treatment with the compounds. Transcripts involved in DNA binding, protein metabolism, transmembrane transport (ABC transporters related with T. cruzi response and resistance to drugs, among others), oxidative defense, and the biosynthesis of ergosterol pathways were found to be modulated by the presence of the compounds. The whole set of data obtained allowed to suppose that the antitrypanosomal mechanism of action of Pd-dppf-mpo and Pt-dppf-mpo is multimodal. Interestingly, significant biological differences were assessed for both structurally analogous compounds showing the significance of the nature of the metal center on the biological behavior. In particular, metallomic studies allowed to assess that the Pt(II) compound showed higher cellular uptake than the Pd one. In addition, proteomic and transcriptomic studies showed different biological effects of both chemically analogous compounds. Both metals belong to the same group of the periodic table allowing to expect many chemical and physicochemical similarities between their compounds. Nevertheless, differences are expected based on the differential lability of the metal centers. The omic work performed gives details about the biological implications emerging of these chemical differences (Mosquillo et al., 2020) . As previously discussed, NADH-fumarate reductase, a specific parasite enzyme absent in the host, had been previously identified as a potential target for both M-dppf-mpo compounds (Mosquillo et al., 2018a) . Although proteomic analysis agrees with this previous finding showing that, the amount of enzyme is modified in the treated parasites respect to untreated control parasites, omic studies unveiled, in addition, several down and up regulated proteins and a wide range of pathways affected by the compounds. Another remarkable point is that in vitro target identification should be in agreement with observed cellular uptake and subcellular localization. In the case of the M-dppfmpo compounds, DNA was not considered for the in vitro target identification as an important biological target to be tested but metallomics showed a high accumulation of the complexes in the parasite DNA fraction. Globally, this study constitutes the first omic contribution to unravel the whole scenario of effects involved in the mechanism of action of potential metal-based drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease.",

IC 50 values for most compounds were in the low micromolar or submicromolar range against both parasites, having the platinum compounds higher activities than the corresponding palladium ones ( Table 1) . Their activities were significantly higher than those of the free thiosemicarbazone ligands, showing a 3-to 24-fold increase for T. cruzi and up to 99-fold increase for T. brucei. The presence of the organometallic dppf co-ligand also seems to be responsible for a lower toxicity on mammalian cells and higher selectivity towards both parasites when compared to the free thiosemicarbazone compounds.

However, no correlation between oxygen uptake and the generation of free oxygen radical species in the parasite, and the anti-T. cruzi activity was observed. Additionally, these compounds demonstrated to interact with DNA. Fluorescence results showed that ethidium bromide (EB) was displaced from the {DNA-EB} adduct as a result of the interaction of the Pd and Pt complexes with the biomolecule. This effect could be related to an intercalative-like mode of interaction or to the generation of DNA conformational changes causing the disruption of EB binding (Log K SV 4.3-5.0, with K SV Stern Volmer quenching constant).

Tropolone, hinokitiol and their derivatives as well as the metal complexes with these compounds as ligands have shown various biological activities, for example antimicrobial one (Ononye et al., 2013; Saniewski et al., 2014; El Hachlafi et al., 2021) .",

In addition, obtained heterobimetallic compounds showed higher selectivity indexes towards the parasite than the free ligands. Platinum complexes were more selective than palladium ones. Moreover, coordination of the bioactive ligands to the {M-dppf} moiety also led to a slight increase of the anti-leishmanial potency. Studies performed to unravel the mechanism of action of the compounds indicated that no effect on the thiol-redox homeostasis of the parasites is produced by the complexes' action. On the other hand, fluorescence measurements of displacement of ethidium bromide from the adduct {DNA-EB} showed that DNA could be a probable, but not main, target of these compounds.",

These compounds showed IC 50 values against bloodstream T. brucei form, in the submicromolar or micromolar range (IC 50 / 24 h: Pt compounds 0.14-0.93 \u03bcM; Pd compounds 0.33-1.2 \u03bcM). In addition, they displayed good to very good selectivity towards the parasite (SI: Pt compounds 11-48; Pd compounds 4-102) with respect to murine macrophages (cell line J774) ( Table 1) . In most cases, an increase of the activity (11-to 41-fold) was observed as a consequence of coordination of the bioactive 8HQs to the {Pt-dppf} moiety. Only part of the Pd compounds were more active than the corresponding 8HQ ligands and most of the Pd compounds were less active than their Pt analogues. It should be stated that, the palladium compounds were 2-to 45-fold more potent than the drug Nifurtimox while platinum complexes resulted 16-to 107-fold more potent than the same reference drug. All the complexes interacted with DNA (Pt compounds Log K SV 3.3-3.9; Pd compounds Log K SV 3.8-4.6) but the Pd compounds show higher Log K SV values than the Pt analogues. In addition, the most active Pt ones induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in tumor cells. Results suggest that the mechanism of action for these complexes against T. brucei may be mediated by interaction with DNA and additionally oxidative stress for the Pt compounds.",

For this study, the dependent variable was the log 10 of the IC 50 values on T. brucei. As independent variables, different physicochemical characteristics including lipophilic, electronic, and steric/topological properties were considered (Hansch et al., 1963) . Lipophilicity was indirectly determined by a reverse phase TLC method adequate for non-soluble in water compounds that led to experimental R f and calculated R M values. As electronic parameter a signal of the 1 H NMR spectra of the studied compounds was selected. Owing to the chemical variability of the studied compounds, i.e. palladium or platinum and three different families of ligands, the cyclopentadienyl-moiety was selected as common feature to determine the contribution of the compounds' electronic effect on the measured anti T. brucei activities. The displacement \u03b4 of the 1 H NMR signals of the protons of the cyclopentadienylframework resulted indicative of the coordination and the nature of compound. Consequently, \u0394\u03b4 defined as the largest difference between \u03b4 of cyclopentadienyl-framework protons in the complexes and \u03b4 of cyclopentadienyl-framework protons without coordination was used as electronic descriptor. Additionally, an indicator variable, IV Pd , was defined that adopts value 1 for palladium compounds or 0 for platinum complexes. According to the QSAR study, ligands with electron withdrawing substituents and with high lipophilicity and having platinum as central atom would result in complexes with increased anti T. brucei activity. Among all these descriptors, the electronic properties and the nature of the metal ion were the most relevant ones. QSAR studies are relevant to guide the rational design of further bioactive compounds. However, they are not common in inorganic medicinal chemistry due to the need of having numerous structurally related compounds to perform them (Rivas et al., 2021) .",

In this sense, the development of palladium and platinum compounds described in this review constitute an example of this rational phenotypic approach. In fact, from the selection of the metal centers and the bioactive ligands to the inclusion of different co-ligands, the design was based on both chemical and biological arguments. The establishment of structure-activity relationships and the deep insight into the molecular modes of action of the metallic compounds also aided to redesign new compounds with improved pharmacological properties. In this sense, the development of structurally related series of compounds has let us perform quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies that are not common in Medicinal Inorganic Chemistry.",

In particular, the hypothesis of developing broad spectrum drugs that affect more than one trypanosomatid parasite, based on the discovery of common genomic features for T. cruzi, T. brucei and L. major, was verified in the case of the 5-nitrofurylthiosemicarbazone M-dppf-L complexes. These compounds showed IC 50 values in the submicromolar or micromolar range on both, T. cruzi and T. brucei. Some of these compounds were good candidates for in vivo studies.
