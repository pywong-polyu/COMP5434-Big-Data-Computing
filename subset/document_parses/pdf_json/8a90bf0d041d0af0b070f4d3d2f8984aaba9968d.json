            "text": "Nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes have been developed, with variable display capacities. Three well-known proteins capable of self-assembly into higher order structures include Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LS) [7] , Geobacillus stearothermophilus E2 [8] , and a modified 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase, commonly known as 2-Keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase, named I3-01 [9] . All three multimeric protein scaffold particles (MPSPs) require limited post-translational modifications and can be efficiently produced in E. coli (or in other expression systems). When the Cor Nterminal ends of the monomeric proteins in the assembled particle are surface-exposed, this facilitates fusion of antigens to tags or linker modules. Although antigen subunits can also be genetically fused to the Cand N-terminal ends of the proteins, nanoparticle assembly and integrity could be compromised with increasing structural complexity and size of the antigen. The need for a coordinated folding between the scaffold and the antigen subunit is circumvented when the components are produced separately and subsequently coupled. Chemical conjugation is a generally complex procedure, requiring specific conditions and reagents. Moreover, chemical coupling may result in a heterogeneous decoration of the nanoparticle, compromising efficient presentation to the immune system. Novel technologies are today available that enable highly efficient coupling of antigens to nanoparticles, maintaining their native conformation. A particularly promising technology is referred to as the SpyTag-SpyCatcher \"bacterial superglue\", in which a covalent, intermolecular isopeptide bond is formed between the 13 amino acid \"SpyTag\" peptide and a small (12.3 kDa) \"SpyCatcher\" protein [10, 11] . This two-component superglue is an extremely versatile tool to covalently decorate nanoparticles with antigens and is now being broadly applied to develop vaccines against viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases [12] .",

The zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is used as one of the model pathogens to assess the efficacy of the platforms. RVFV is a mosquitoborne bunyavirus (family Phenuiviridae, genus Phlebovirus) that is pathogenic to ruminants and humans. The virus contains a tri-segmented RNA genome, comprising a small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segment. The S and L segments encode the nucleocapsid and polymerase protein, respectively, involved in genome transcription and replication. The S segment additionally encodes a non-structural protein named NSs, which counteracts host innate immune responses [13] . The M segment encodes a polyprotein precursor protein that is co-translationally cleaved into the two structural glycoproteins Gn and Gc, which are involved in host cell binding and fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane. The M segment additionally encodes a 14-kDa non-structural protein named NSm, which was shown to counteract apoptosis and to be important for dissemination in mosquitoes [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

The elucidation of the cryo-electron microscopy structure of RVFV and the crystal structures of Gn and Gc, followed by the fitting of the protein structures into the T = 12 icosahedral virion, have demonstrated that the Gn head domain (Gn head ) is fully exposed on the virion surface, explaining that Gn is the dominant target of neutralizing antibodies [20] . However, before these structures were described, we reported the vaccine efficacy of the Gn ectodomain (Gn head region + stem region) produced in insect cells, formulated with Stimune waterin-oil adjuvant, in the mouse and lamb model [21, 22] . A single vaccination protected lambs from morbidity and mortality, although low levels of viral RNA were detected after challenge infection, suggestive of low-level viremia [21] . Whereas the latter is of little concern for non-pregnant animals, previous studies have demonstrated that even low-level viremia may result in vertical transmission of the virus in pregnant ewes [23] . A seemingly more efficacious candidate vaccine was developed by co-expression of Gn and Gc in insect cells, resulting in the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) [22] . This candidate vaccine induced nAbs in mice after a single vaccination, even in the absence of adjuvant. However, the yields of these VLPs seemed insufficient to develop a cost-effective vaccine.",

The Gn head domain consists of three subdomains: domain A (also called domain I), \u03b2-ribbon (domain II), and domain B (domain III) [20, 30, 32] . Here, we genetically fused a SpyCatcher domain to the N-terminus of Gn head (SC-Gn head ) to facilitate conjugation to scaffolds displaying SpyTags, and additionally a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag to facilitate purification (Figure 1 ). The fusion protein was expressed with the baculovirus expression system. As a control for conjugation experiments, the Gn head domain was also expressed without a SpyCatcher domain. Both the Gn head domain with and without the SpyCatcher were produced at a small scale in around 10-20 mg/L of a culture medium of baculovirus-infected High Five cells. Purity was analyzed via sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and proteins were found to be of the expected sizes (Figure 2a) . ",

As a control, we took along Gnhead lacking the SpyCatcher domain. Optimal coupling, defined as achieving antigen-saturated particles, were obtained after mixing MPSP monomers with SC-Gnhead at a molar ratio of 1:2.6 for LS, 1:4 for Aldolase, and 1:3.9 for E2 (Figure 2) . The TEM analysis of unconjugated particles subsequently showed particle morphologies in line with literature [33] [34] [35] , and morphology was not visibly compromised by the coupling of antigen to the MPSPs. Three different scaffold proteins were produced as well; all three self-assembled as 60 monomers into MPSPs of different sizes (Figure 1 ). The first MPSP is based on Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LS), a 20-kDa protein that assembles via 12 pentamers into an icosahedral particle of 15 nm. The second nanocarrier is based on I3-01 (I3), a modified KDPG aldolase of 24-kDa, that assembles into a 25 nm dodecahedron. The third nanocarrier is based on Geobacillus stearothermophilus E2 of 26-kDa, which assembles into a pentagonal dodecahedral scaffold of 27 nm. All three MPSPs were produced in E. coli with a C-terminal SpyTag (Figure 1 ). Small scale production resulted in yields, after purification from E. coli fermentation pellets, of approximately 80, 30, and 20 mg/L, respectively, for LS, E2, and Aldolase. Purity was analyzed via SDS-PAGE and proteins were found to be of the expected sizes (Figure 2a) . with either Gnhead or SC-Gnhead for 1 h at room temperature (RT) at a ratio just above particle saturation.

In the lamb trials, we made use of the TS6 O/W adjuvant. In the first lamb trial, complete protection from viremia and clinical signs was achieved, which depended on coupling to MPSPs. Despite the clear difference in vaccine efficacy between the two groups, neutralizing antibody levels did not significantly differ at the moment of challenge virus administration. This suggests that cellular immune responses contributed to vaccine efficacy, especially in animals vaccinated with antigen coupled to MPSPs. The induction of cellular immune responses following nanoparticle immunization is expected to be mediated by cytotoxic T-cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) cross-presentation [12, 45, 46] .",

As we did not observe significant differences in antibody responses and vaccine efficacy, we proposed prioritization among these three MPSPs based on large scale manufacturing yields, easiness of downstream purification, stability, and costs of goods. The results so far suggest that MPSPs E2 and I3-03 hold more promise. However, to conclude that the type of MPSP is a minor determinant with respect to immunogenicity, additional head-to-head comparisons are needed. Of note, the three MPSPs used in this study each result from assembling of monomeric scaffold proteins into 15-30 nm particles with 60 sites for antigen conjugation.",

We here fused the SpyCatcher domain to the N-terminus of Gn head , whereas fusion to the C-terminus of Gn head may have resulted in a more optimal presentation of the Gn subunit. Domain A (I) and domain B (III) were considered the dominant targets of neutralizing antibodies in a virion context [30, 32, 47] . Whether the individual subdomains A (I) and B (III) are potent immunogens capable of inducing protective immunity awaits further study. In general, production yields of smaller antigens is superior to large antigens and smaller antigens are expected to face less spatial constrains with regard to conjugation to the MPSPs. However, from a veterinary vaccine perspective, we note that, in the current setup, a double vaccination regimen has to be used, which does not yet compete with live-attenuated vaccines or vector-based vaccines providing singleshot immunity [25] and data on long-term memory responses is still lacking. Nevertheless, further construct optimization combined with the use of novel production systems like Myceliophthora thermophila, also referred to as C1 [48] , is likely to result in an efficacious and cost-effective MPSP-based RVF vaccine.",
