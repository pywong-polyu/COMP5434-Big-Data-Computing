Screening tests like rapid antigen test (RAT) can identify the population at high risk [4] . Though, RAT has lower sensitivity, is comparatively cost-effective, rapidly deployable and faster [1] . RAT reduces the dependence on real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), where cost of the RT-PCR kits and technical expertise are major concerns [5] . RAT is helpful if done at early stage of infection where viral load is high. Such individuals if isolated faster can limit the disease spread [1] . However, antigen levels may drop below the limit of detection in specimens collected beyond 5-7 days of onset of the symptoms [6] .",

In our study, the date of onset of symptoms was not known in many cases as it was not a mandatory field in the ICMR specimen referral form. However, the date of RAT and collection of the sample for RT-PCR was the same. Hence comparison of these are possible. Moreover, the RAT for COVID-19 showed lower sensitivity than RT-PCR test both for symptomatic (single or multiple symptoms) and asymptomatic infection. Confirmation of antigen negative tested individuals by RT-PCR especially for asymptomatic or high-risk groups is critical for prompt isolation and clinical management. Our results suggest need for focussed and intensive (multi-modality) testing in groups at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and strongly support the use of RT-PCR as the first line of testing instead of RAT in asymptomatic high-risk group.",
