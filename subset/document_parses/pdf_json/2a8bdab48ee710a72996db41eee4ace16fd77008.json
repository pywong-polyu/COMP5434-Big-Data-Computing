Several candidate therapeutic agents have been reported for treatment of COVID-19 [1] . As there is an urgent demand for therapeutic drugs, some have been rapidly approved after a few clinical trials. However, consecutive monitoring for their effectiveness and safety is needed. A meta-analysis is a powerful and useful methodology to integrate and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a drug based on different published trials. A report on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine based on systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that it was not sufficiently effective to be used alone or in combination with azithromycin [2] . Recently, results from three randomised controlled trials (RCT) using remdesivir reported its effectiveness for the treatment of COVID-19 [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment using a meta-analysis.",

Of these, six were further examined in detail, excluding 9408 that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, three studies [3] [4] [5] were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 1879 patients (1080 remdesivir-treated patients) were included in this analysis. The study characteristics are given in Table S2 . All studies were RCTs; however, the study by Spinner et al. [4] was not blinded. Therefore, blinding risk was observed in Spinner et al. [4] (Fig. S2 ). In the studies by Beigle et al. [3] and Wang et al. [5] , remdesivir was administered at 200 mg/day on the first day, followed by 100 mg/ day for 2-10 days; however, in Spinner et al. [4] , remdesivir was administered at 200 mg/day on the first day, followed by 100 mg/ day for 2-5 or 2-10 days (Table S2 ).",

The mortality rates reported in the three studies were different. Beigle et al. [3] reported 15-day mortality rates, Spinner et al. [4] 11-day rates, and Wang et al. [5] 28-day rates. Remdesivir tended to reduce the mortality rate, but this was not significant (Fig. 1B) . We compared all adverse events and total SAEs between the remdesivir and placebo groups and found a significant reduction in SAEs in remdesivir-treated groups compared with those receiving placebo (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.62-0.90) (Fig. 1D ), but the To search the literature, we used MEDLINE, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov as electronic databases (24 August 2020). Four reviewers independently searched for literature using the following terms: 'COVID-19 0 and 'remdesivir' (details in Table S1 ). A study was considered eligible if it met the following criteria: RCT on patients with COVID-19, use of remdesivir as an interventional drug, placebo or standard care as a comparison treatment, and comparison of the effectiveness as an outcome. The exclusion criteria were as follows: no association with COVID-19 treatment and insufficient data on comparisons of the effectiveness of initial therapy as an outcome. Four reviewers independently conducted the screening. Two reviewers independently extracted data from the studies. In each study, the data of the total patient population and intention to treat were extracted. The author, country, study design, duration of study, patient age, drug administration regimens, treatment duration, follow-up duration, and disease severity were extracted. Regarding the outcome measures used to assess clinical improvement, the rates of clinical response, treatment success, and clinical improvement were used as the primary outcome measure, and the mortality rate, all adverse events, and serious adverse events (SAEs) were used as secondary outcome measures. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias. Risk assessment was performed in reference to the Cochrane Collaboration. We performed a meta-analysis using the Review Manager for Windows (RevMan, version 5.3, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014), and forest plots were prepared. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed using I 2 .",
