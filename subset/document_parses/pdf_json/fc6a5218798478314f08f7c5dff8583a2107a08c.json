The results show that: perceived risk has positive and negative impacts on negative emotions and service recovery satisfaction, negative emotions have a negative impact on service recovery satisfaction, and corporate reputation plays a positive moderating role in the relationship between perceived risk and service recovery satisfaction. This study is helpful to better explain the impact mechanism of the service recovery effect of OTAs, and to provide a theoretical reference for improving the service recovery effect of OTAs.",

The OTA Expedia was founded in 1996 (Ling et al., 2014) , and it has become the online sales channel with the highest booking rate. The main function of the OTA is to obtain commission by providing travel related services, integrate products and reduce costs, and provide consumers with cheaper solutions (Kim et al., 2009) . In essence, OTAs are intermediaries that rely on Internet platforms to provide online consulting, commenting, and booking services; because OTAs can easily compare products, prices, discounts, independent reviews, and photos of various hotels to meet the needs and preferences of consumers, they have developed rapidly, and some famous brands have appeared, such as Priceline, Expedia, and Ctrip.",

For example, the \"10.1\" holiday in 2020 is the first holiday in China since its COVID-19 situation went under control. Some Chinese OTA brands, such as Ctrip, Qunar, and Tuniu, have become the object of consumer complaints. Mr. Han of Hangzhou, China, is a tourist who experienced failure in the OTA service. On October 1, 2020, he booked a reservation at a hotel in Sanya, China through the online platform of Ctrip, a famous OTA in China. On October 2, 2020, Mr. Han and his family arrived at the hotel and found that the hotel room was not as large as Ctrip had promised. The sanitation was poor, and it was not convenient to wash in the hotel room. Therefore, Mr. Han asked for a refund, but the hotel and Ctrip refused to give a full one, only 20%, and members of the hotel service staff were arrogant. In the dispute, they attacked Mr. Han personally, causing his anger. Later, Mr. Han made a complaint through the Chinese consumer protection agency and exposed it through the media, which had a negative impact on the image of Ctrip and the hotel.",

Service failure is a kind of service that fails to meet customer expectations and that causes customer dissatisfaction (Peng and Jing, 2005; Nikbin et al., 2015) . The current literature discusses the quality measurement system of online shopping service recovery (Liu and Li, 2017) and the relationship between online shopping service, service recovery, and customer satisfaction and loyalty (Jian and Ke, 2017) . At present, academic circles have also studied the impact of word-of-mouth on the service recovery effect of travel agencies, and the service recovery effect is measured by customer satisfaction and customer loyalty (Pai et al., 2019) . They developed a practical manual on service failure and service recovery for the travel industry (Inkson, 2019) . However, the current literature still lacks research results on OTA service failure and service recovery, so in reality it cannot fully explain and guide the service failure and service recovery of OTAs, thus it needs to be further studied.",

The impact of perceived risk on negative emotions has been discussed in academic circles, such as in the studies conducted by Yoon and Lee (2014) , Mi et al. (2019) , and Zheng et al. (2019) . It is generally believed that perceived risk will strengthen the negative emotions of customers. However, the current research still lacks relevant research results in the context of OTA service failure and service recovery. Corporate reputation is also operational. It can affect customer perceived value and then affect consumer intention and decision-making behavior (He et al., 2018 ). An OTA is a kind of intermediary that provides online consultation, comment, and reservation services based on an Internet platform, and it is also an online platform. With the rise in the number of Internet services, some researchers, such as Li (2014) , Zhao and Wang (2012) , and Olavarria-Jaraba et al. (2018) , have studied the reputation of online platforms. In the service recovery scenario, whether the corporate reputation of OTAs will play a moderating role among some variables still lacks discussion.",

OTAs provide an effective platform for consumers to browse, purchase travel services, and share travel information through websites, mobile devices, apps, and call centers.

In the hotel and tourism industries, OTAs, through online distribution channels, play a key role in providing consumers with more attractive products (Kim and Lee, 2004) . OTAs have profoundly changed the way consumers buy tourism products, and they have a great development potential.

Service recovery is not only an action taken against service failure, it is also the hard work of an enterprise to make the service meet the expectation of a customer (Zhong et al., 2011) . Some scholars have discussed service recovery strategy, and they think that it is necessary to confirm, evaluate, explain, apologize, and compensate for service failure, so as to improve the satisfaction of service recovery (Boshof, 1999) . Heejung (2012) has suggested that service recovery should consider personality and preference, such as taking different service recovery strategies according to the education background, age, and preference of a customer. The influence mechanism of service recovery satisfaction is a research hotspot. The current literature focuses on the influence of customer misconduct, time perception, cultural differences, customer psychological contract violation, economic compensation, and emotional compensation on customer satisfaction after service recovery (Valenzuela and Cooksey, 2014; Albrecht et al., 2017) .",

Perceived risk is subjective. No matter how big the actual risk of a product or service is, if it is not perceived by consumers, it will not affect their consumption behavior . Cui (2015) believes that perceived risk exists in six aspects: body, performance, property, time, society, and psychology. Sj\u00f6berg (2007) found that emotion does play an important role in perceived risk and related attitude, in which people found that interest in risk (positive emotion) is positively correlated with perceived risk. In the online shopping situation, because of the virtual characteristics of a network environment, the online shopping behavior of consumers often faces more perceived risks. Some scholars divide perceived risk into information, transaction, distribution, and after-sales (Wang, 2020) , while others divide perceived risk into financial, functional, time, and privacy (Ren et al., 2019) . For the research on influencing factors of perceived risk, Byun and Ha (2016) discussed the relationship between information usefulness, source credibility, perceived risk, impulsive purchase, and purchase intention in online shopping behavior. The research shows that information usefulness has a negative impact on perceived risk. Ren et al. (2019) suggested that in an online shopping scenario, the reputation, product quality, and website construction of a seller and other factors significantly negatively affect the financial, functional, and time risks in perceived risk, and that logistics support significantly negatively affects the financial, functional, time, and privacy risks in perceived risk.",

Liljander and Strandvik (1997) have suggested that customers will experience different positive and negative emotions on service, which affects customer satisfaction. Among them, negative emotions have a great impact on customer satisfaction. Ou and Verhoef (2017) have explored the incremental effects of positive and negative emotions on loyalty intention. The effects of these two emotions on loyalty intention are increasing, and positive emotions weaken positive connection (negative interaction).

Yao and Deng (2017) suggested that the two dimensions of perceived risk include financial and time risks, and that these risks have a negative impact on customer satisfaction. Hsieh and Tsao (2014) pointed out that in a network environment, user perceived risk has a significant negative impact on user satisfaction, and that the higher the perceived risk, the lower the user satisfaction. Scridon et al.

Chang and Hsiao (2008) conducted an empirical study on the service recovery of hotels, and suggested that perceived risk will reduce customer value and that the decrease in customer value will inevitably reduce customer satisfaction. However, there is no research on the relationship between perceived risk and customer satisfaction in an OTA service recovery situation. In the OTA service recovery scenario, if the perceived risk of customers increases, the customer satisfaction reduces, and if the perceived risk of customers is reduced, the customer satisfaction is improved. Therefore, the following hypothesis is put forward: H2: Perceived risk has a significant negative impact on service recovery satisfaction.

With the rise of Internet services, some researchers have studied the reputation of online platforms. Olavarria-Jaraba et al. (2018) think that because of the lack of sound network supervision and social credit systems, if the default of a borrower is not curbed in time, the reputation risk of an online platform will increase. A good reputation is not only the precondition for P2P to charge higher service fees but also an effective incentive to improve the service level of fund lending and establish and maintain the reputation of an online platform (He et al., 2018; Olavarria-Jaraba et al., 2018) .",

Some studies suggest that online platform enterprises can become a collective signal of online platform reputation through social discussion of electronic word-of-mouth, thus driving customer demand, and that the establishment of online platform reputation can maintain long-term psychological contract relationship and reputation (Li, 2014) . The credibility of online platform reputation information perceived by online platform buyers has a positive impact on the use level of reputation information and online shopping amount (Zhao and Wang, 2012) .

The results show that there is a weak negative relationship between age and negative emotions, and that the relationship between gender, origin, education, and perceived risk is not statistically significant. Model 2 showed that perceived risk had a significant positive impact on negative emotions (\u03b2 = 0.697, P < 0.01).

When corporate reputation is high, perceived risk has a weak negative impact on service recovery satisfaction (\u03b2 = \u22120.316, P < 0.05). Therefore, when corporate reputation reduces the negative impact of perceived risk on service recovery satisfaction, it plays a positive moderating role.

Therefore, the above results support hypotheses H1, H2, and H3. H1 is supported, which shows that in the OTA service recovery scenario, the greater the perceived risk, the greater the negative emotion. This research conclusion extends the research scenario to that of OTA service recovery, which is an extension and enrichment of the conclusions of Lee and Jung (2015) and Mi et al. (2019) . This study verifies hypothesis H2, which confirms and extends the conclusions of Hsieh and Tsao (2014) , Chang and Hsiao (2008) , and Scridon et al. (2020) that perceived risk has a negative impact on customer satisfaction and service recovery satisfaction. This study confirms that the perceived risk of customers will have a negative impact on service recovery satisfaction in the OTA service recovery scenario. At the same time, this study also verifies research hypothesis H3, which indicates that negative emotions of customers will also have a negative impact on service recovery satisfaction. In previous studies, Du and Fan (2007) and Yoon and Lee (2014) have suggested that negative emotions will negatively impact customer satisfaction and service recovery satisfaction. The conclusion of this study is an extension of previous studies. In short, through empirical research, research hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 are supported, which expand the connotation and applicable scenarios of the relationship between perceived risk, negative emotions, and service recovery satisfaction, and expand the connotation and applicable scenarios of the relationship between negative emotions and service recovery satisfaction. Second, according to the results of this study, corporate reputation plays a positive moderating role in the relationship between perceived risk and service recovery satisfaction. Therefore, hypothesis H4 is supported. In the OTA service recovery scenario, with the improvement in OTA corporate reputation, service recovery satisfaction will increase faster. The corporate reputation of an OTA will positively moderate the relationship between perceived risk and service recovery satisfaction, that is, reduce the negative impact of perceived risk on service recovery satisfaction. The existing literature suggests that the corporate reputation of an online platform can maintain long-term psychological contract relationship, create better relationship, and improve demand (Li, 2014) . However, there is insufficient research on the moderating role of corporate reputation between perceived risk and service recovery satisfaction under the OTA service recovery scenario. This study verifies that the corporate reputation of an OTA can positively moderate the negative impact of perceived risk on service recovery satisfaction, which makes up for the lack of current research. This study provides a theoretical and empirical explanation to further explore the regulatory mechanism of the corporate reputation of OTAs and is helpful for the majority of service enterprises, especially OTAs, in improving their reputation or re-evaluating their image.",

However, for an OTA, a good corporate reputation cannot be formed overnight. It needs a long-term accumulation of OTA, which is the embodiment of corporate image. In the era of the Internet, OTAs should be honest, put an end to cheating customers, do everything possible for customers, and establish a good brand image. At the same time, OTAs need to carry out public relations and promotion work, and use news media, hot events, and public welfare activities to improve corporate reputation.",

Therefore, in OTA service recovery, we should pay attention to the formation of service recovery satisfaction. OTAs should take scientific and effective service recovery measures to reduce perceived risks and negative emotions of customers, scientifically guide customers, be good at approaching customers, resolve negative emotions of customers, solve concerns of customers about money and time, and improve service recovery satisfaction.
