For the three-class classifier, the accuracy obtained for InceptionV3, ResNet50, and VGG19 was 97%, 98.55%, and 98.55%, respectively. The confusion matrices for two-class classifiers obtained for Inception V3, ResNet50, and VGG19 models are shown in Figure  7 . The confusion matrix of InceptionV3 shows that 70 typical images' values were predicted correctly, while four normal images were not predicted correctly. Similarly, 66 COVID-19 X-ray images and 65 pneumonia X-ray images were correctly predicted. Two pneumonia X-ray images were not predicted correctly.",

Secondly, if the noise in data increased, then the performance would also be decreased. Thirdly, our model is significantly slower due to an operation of logistic regression and transfer learning of various CNN architectures in the pipeline. Due to several layers, the training process takes a lot of time if the computer does not have a good GPU. Fourthly, the decisions of multiple radiologists are not considered in the final prediction. Lastly, our architectures have excellent performance while classifying images that are very similar to the dataset.

Countries are hastening their vaccination process according to their resources and availability of vaccine supply. Quick identification of positive corona patients and their isolation is effective in reducing spread, according to WHO. Because of this fact, a deep transfer-learning approach with Apache Spark architecture was created to recognize the coronavirus in chest X-ray images. Our image classification system relied on deep-learning pipelines and logistic regression, and three CNN-based models were used in this study, namely InceptionV3, ResNet50, and VGG19.
