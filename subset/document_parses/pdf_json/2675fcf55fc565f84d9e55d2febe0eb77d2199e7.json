            "text": "Discussion: These results point to the social diversity of bilinguals' language use as being associated with executive control, but the direction of the effects may depend on social context (university vs. non-university) . Importantly, the results also suggest that some of these effects may only be detected by using more sensitive measures, such as pupil dilation. The paper discusses theoretical and practical implications regarding the language INTRODUCTION It has been theorized that the life experience of using more than one language contributes to enhanced domain-general executive control in bilinguals, 1 as they are constantly required to regulate the simultaneous activation of multiple languages in one mind (Kroll et al., 2012) . However, defining \"bilingualism\" is perhaps an impossible feat (Surrain and Luk, 2019) . There is now a general consensus that it is unattainable to accurately represent the dynamic, multifaceted, and complex nature of bilingualism by treating it as a binary construct (Bialystok, 2021, this special issue) . Recent work examining bilingualism on a continuum has suggested that individual experiences place different demands on language control and domain-general cognitive systems, each differentially shaping language processing, cognitive functioning, and brain structure and function (DeLuca et al., 2019; Beatty-Mart\u00ednez and Titone, 2021; Gullifer and Titone, 2021b) . Despite recent attempts to unravel the complexity of bilingualism and its consequences for cognition, much remains unknown about how bilingual experiences may be responsible for these neurocognitive adaptations. Importantly, to capture these intricate effects, sensitive methodologies are required (Poarch and Krott, 2019) . This study investigates how the social diversity of language use relates to behavioral and pupil indices of executive control in bilinguals.",

These static and dynamic experiences likely interact in modulating cognitive performance in bilinguals, but recent years have seen a particular focus on the diversity of language use, rather than knowledge, in shaping neurocognitive adaptations in bilinguals (Abutalebi and Green, 2016) . This idea was put forward by Green and Abutalebi (2013) in the Adaptive Control Hypothesis. Specifically, Green and Abutalebi identified three types of interactional contexts: a single-language context (SLC), a duallanguage context (DLC), and a dense code-switching context (DCS). In the SLC, bilinguals use their languages for different purposes and in strictly separate contexts (e.g., communicating in the L1 at home and in the L2 in educational settings). In the DLC, bilinguals engage in highly integrated language contexts in which their languages may be used in a more balanced manner (e.g., speaking both the L1 and L2 at work, but with different people). Finally, in the DCS, language use is also highly integrated, but fewer restrictions are placed on when to use which language and with whom. According to the Adaptive Control Hypothesis, each context places different demands on language-and domain-general executive control in bilinguals, with the DLC being the most challenging for the executive control system.",

Similarly, Hartanto and Yang (2016) classified bilinguals into SLC bilinguals and DLC bilinguals and found that DLC bilinguals showed lower switching costs than SLC bilinguals. In a follow-up study, the authors reported that DLC bilingualism predicted enhanced set shifting abilities and that DCS bilinguals were more likely to perform better on tasks requiring inhibitory control and goal maintenance (Hartanto and Yang, 2020) . Likewise, Yow and Li (2015) found a relationship between enhanced goal maintenance (operationalized as mixing cost) and more balanced language use in bilinguals. Altogether, these findings suggest that demands that are placed on bilinguals by the environment differentially modulate cognitive adaptations, on an aggregated level and within bilingual groups.",

            "text": "Despite the empirical importance of investigating theoretical propositions in such aggregated groups, individual variation in bilingual language use is perhaps best captured using continuous measures (Luk and Bialystok, 2013) . Bilinguals may not always find themselves in a purely SLC or DLC (cf. Lai and O'Brien, 2020) , and on an individual level, some social settings may be characterized as DLCs and others as SLCs (e.g., two languages are spoken at home, but only one language is spoken at work). In this light, Gullifer and Titone (2020) proposed a novel continuous measure of the social diversity of language use: language entropy. Entropy is a concept adapted from information theory (Shannon, 1948) and is generally used to quantify the diversity or uncertainty of a phenomenon. Language entropy reflects a spectrum of language use across or between communicative contexts, and it draws on the concepts proposed in the Adaptive Control Hypothesis. 2 Crucially, language entropy is not restricted to Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org a set number of languages, as its values range from 0 to log n (where n is the number of languages that entropy is computed over). It is calculated in such a way that it captures the inherent variability in bilingual language use, where the lowest values approximate compartmentalized language use (i.e., only one language is used in a context), and the highest value represents fully integrated language use (i.e., all languages are used equally). In fully compartmentalized contexts, one language is used much more than the other(s) and, as such, the predictability of which language to use is very high. In highly integrated contexts, the languages are used in a more balanced way and so the (appropriate) language to use is less predictable. It then follows that the degree of unpredictability is also affected by the number of languages a person speaks. That is, when all available languages are used in a fully integrated manner, the unpredictability of which language to use increases as the number of available languages increases. The extent to which the management of this unpredictability is needed is argued to drive neurocognitive adaptations, which consequently increase behavioral efficiency and optimize decision making (Gullifer and Titone, 2021a) .",

To reiterate, the Adaptive Control Hypothesis posits that, in contexts where the predictability of which language to use is low, bilinguals need to engage domain-general executive control processes to adapt to changing environmental demands (e.g., a change in interlocutor with whom another language needs to be spoken) to a larger extent than in high-predictability contexts. In other words, they must keep speaking the appropriate language without letting their other language(s) interfere (goal maintenance, also termed proactive control), scan the environment for changes (e.g., conflict monitoring), and switch to another language when this is required (mental set shifting, henceforth set shifting). Previously, higher language entropy has been associated with increased reliance on proactive control Gullifer and Titone, 2021b) , and with functional brain patterns related to enhanced conflict monitoring, set shifting, and goal maintenance (Li et al., 2021) , underscoring the possible relationship between the diversity of language use and individual differences in executive control. Importantly, language entropy may reflect a distinct aspect of bilingual language use, as it has been shown by Ka\u0142ama\u0142a et al. (2021) that other indices of bilingual language use, such as codeswitching and language-mixing habits, only moderately correlated with language entropy.",

The cued-switching paradigm is difficult enough to result in large RT costs even in young adults (Monsell, 2003) . Despite this, reaction times may not always be sensitive enough in capturing individual differences in certain groups. For example, young adults, a commonly studied demographic, showcase less individual variation in cognitive performance and, as such, in RTs, than other age groups (Hultsch et al., 2002) . This may be due to the fact that young adults are at their cognitive performance peak (Park et al., 2002; Bialystok et al., 2012) . Perhaps unsurprisingly then, behavioral effects of bilingualism have been found least consistently in young adults (Antoniou, 2019) . It is therefore paramount that a measurement is used that is sensitive enough to yield relatively large effects and individual variation when studying young adults, while also capturing a form of processing that is expected to be modulated by bilingual experiences.",

            "text": "It is worth mentioning that cognitive effects of bilingualism have been found in brain indices in the absence of behavioral effects between bilingual and monolingual groups, as well as between bilingual groups with different characteristics (e.g., Bialystok, 2017; Lehtonen et al., 2018; DeLuca et al., 2020) . Thus, to further increase sensitivity of the assessments, behavioral indices may be supplemented with a proxy of brain activity, such as pupil dilation. Pupil dilation in response to task demands is commonly thought to be modulated by phasic activity in the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005; van der Wel and van Steenbergen, 2018). The LC-NE system receives information from the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex about task demands. In turn, the LC adjusts its activation patterns to ensure that behavioral responses are optimal (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005). As such, pupil dilation can serve as a window into processes related to task performance. An increase in pupil size has often been used as an index of higher resource allocation (i.e., increased cognitive effort and attention allocation to complete the task). This effect has been found in a variety of cognitive tasks (for a literature review, see van der Wel and van Steenbergen, 2018). For example, Rondeel et al. (2015) showed that switch trials elicited larger pupil dilation than non-switch trials in a number switch task. To date, there have been no inquiries regarding the cognitive effects of bilingualism on set shifting using pupil dilation as an outcome measure.",

The study was conducted in November and December 2020 at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, when COVID-19 restrictions were in place. Specifically, the data were collected at a time when teaching took place fully online. The University of Groningen's student population consists mostly of native speakers of Dutch but also includes international students from all over the world (University of Groningen, 2020). This diverse student population is the result of many of the study programs at the University of Groningen being taught exclusively in English. The Dutch student population starts to formally learn English from a young age (the end of primary school or even earlier) and is regularly exposed to the language through media input, as Dutch television subtitles its foreign programs, for instance. At university, students may speak English in the classroom but Dutch or English or yet other languages with their fellow students during breaks. Their multilingual experience may extend to contexts outside of university, as the North of the Netherlands is a highly multilingual region in itself (Schmeets and Cornips, 2021) . In this part of the Netherlands, some speak a regional minority language such as Frisian (in the province of Frysl\u00e2n) or a form of the Low Saxon dialect in addition to Dutch. In sum, the sample that was targeted in this study was linguistically diverse and likely to vary in how they used their languages across social contexts. This allowed us to assess the impact of inter-individual differences in the social diversity of bilingual language use on executive control.",

As described previously, bilinguals who mainly use their languages in separate contexts are not regularly required to monitor the interactional context for linguistic changes. However, bilinguals who use two or more languages within one context need to engage these precise executive control processes more often to appropriately regulate the activation of their languages, thereby possibly increasing their efficiency over time (Green and Abutalebi, 2013) . Thus, we predicted bilingual individuals with higher language entropy to demonstrate enhanced conflict monitoring, set shifting, and goal maintenance abilities relative to those individuals whose language use is more compartmentalized. Crucially, the CSST was adapted to allow for simultaneous recording of pupil size over time, permitting an additional, and potentially more sensitive, measure of set shifting in addition to RTs. Behavioral versions of the CSST have been used regularly in this field (see meta-analysis by Lehtonen et al., 2018) . However, to our knowledge, only one study has examined set shifting with simultaneous tracking of pupil size (Rondeel et al., 2015) . Changes in pupil size occur very slowly and require slowerpaced task designs than purely behavioral tasks (Math\u00f4t, 2018; Winn et al., 2018) . Therefore, our secondary objective was to validate whether our version of the CSST captured the expected additional effort of completing switch trials over non-switch trials, henceforth denoted as pupil switching cost, and whether a smaller pupil switching cost was related to higher language entropy. In the case of the CSST, we proposed that a smaller difference in pupil size between switch and non-switch trials would reflect enhanced set shifting efficiency. We explored the possibility that increased efficiency in set shifting is visible in the pupil data only, given that pupil size over time may be more sensitive in detecting individual differences than RTs in our young adult sample.",

Global RT is represented by the overall RT in the mixed blocks and has been used previously to relate language entropy to conflict monitoring (Li et al., 2021) . Switching costs were calculated as the difference in RTs between switch trials and non-switch trials in the mixed blocks and were used as a proxy for set shifting (Prior and MacWhinney, 2010) . Mixing costs were calculated by the difference in RTs between non-switch trials in the mixed blocks and single trials and have been considered to tap goal maintenance abilities (Mar\u00ed-Beffa and Kirkham, 2014). As engaging in contexts where language use is more integrated requires a speaker to monitor the environment for linguistic changes, we expected that bilinguals with more integrated language use would have more efficient conflict monitoring abilities, as manifested in faster global RTs. Furthermore, we predicted that more integrated bilingual language use would be associated with smaller switching and mixing costs in RTs, taking into account the findings by Li et al. (2021) , , and Gullifer and Titone (2021b).",

Following Prior and MacWhinney (2010) , the participants completed two single-task blocks of 36 items each (color and shape), followed by three mixed blocks of 48 trials each, and ended with two single-task blocks of 36 items each. The order of the single-task blocks, as well as the dedicated response keys, were counterbalanced across participants, resulting in four versions of the experiment. Responses were made pressing the \"d\" and \"f \" keys with the left hand and the \"j\" and \"k\" keys with the right hand. One hand always responded to the \"color\" criterion and the other always responded to the \"shape\" criterion. Experimental blocks were preceded by eight practice trials in single-task blocks, and 16 practice trials in mixed blocks. The practice blocks were repeated until the participant reached an accuracy of at least 80%, to ensure a correct understanding of the task. Participants received feedback on their performance during the practice trials only. In total, the experiment contained 144 single-task block trials (72 color and 72 shape task trials) and 144 mixed trials (72 switch and 72 non-switch trials).",

The usage data for the home, university, and social contexts were elicited using Likert scales, with the prompt \"Please rate the amount of time you actively use the following language(s)/dialect(s) in [context] on a scale of 1-7 (1 = no usage at all, 7 = all the time). \" Following Gullifer and Titone (2020), these scores were baselined by subtracting 1 from each response, such that a score of 0 represented \"no usage at all. \" Subsequently, these scores were converted to proportions by dividing a language's score by the sum total of the scores in each context. For reading and speaking, language use was elicited by percentage of use (e.g., \"When choosing a language/ dialect to speak with a person who is equally fluent in all your languages, what percentage of time would you choose to speak each language/dialect?\"). All percentages added up to 100%. These percentages were converted to proportions, which were then used to calculate the entropy values per context for each participant.

We used varimax rotated components and selected our final number of components using a biplot and correlation matrices of the PC scores and individual entropy scores. This resulted in two PC components. Home, social, reading, and speaking entropy loaded into one component and explained 43.2% of the data. University entropy, with some cross-loading from social entropy, loaded into the second component and explained 26.7% of the data. The individual varimax component loadings are provided in the Supplementary Table 1 . As a PCA can only be computed over complete cases, work entropy was not included in the PCA, as a considerable number of participants (n = 13, 29.5% of the sample) reported to be unemployed. Component scores for each participant were extracted and served as indices of university entropy and entropy anywhere else (non-university entropy) in the subsequent analyses.

Then, we applied subtractive baseline correction (pupil size-baseline) for the 200 ms preceding the 150 ms gap in the trial. During the artifact rejection procedure, we excluded 3.98% of the data in the entire dataset in several steps. First, we removed trials that missed >25% of the data. Then, following recommendations by Math\u00f4t et al. (2018) , we rejected unlikely pupil values by visually inspecting a histogram of pupil values per participant. Any value that was clearly much higher or lower than the majority of the data was deleted. Lastly, we estimated the mean absolute deviation and removed observations for which the pupil size changed quicker than physiologically probable. As a next step, we aligned the event start time to the presentation of the cue. Finally, we downsampled the data to 50 Hz (i.e., time bins of 20 ms).

These smooths are made by combining a set of basis functions in such a way that they fit the data (for more details, see Wieling, 2018, p. 91) . GAMMs then apply a non-linearity penalty to prevent overfitting. This penalty is called wiggliness. This method is especially suitable for analyzing time-course data, as it can take into account autocorrelation and because the signal needs not be averaged over a prespecified epoch. For this reason, GAMMs have become quite popular in recent years for studying event-related potentials (Meulman et al., 2015) , dynamic phonetic data (Wieling, 2018) , and pupillometric data (van Rij et al., 2019; Boswijk et al., 2020) .",

The social diversity of language use was calculated by looking at self-reported language use in several contexts (at home, speaking, reading, in social settings, and at university). These five contexts were reduced to two components using a PCA, namely, a university entropy component (language use at university) and a non-university entropy component (language use in all other contexts). Based on previous studies, we predicted that language entropy scores would modulate the performance on the CSST, such that individuals who engaged in more integrated language contexts (i.e., had higher entropy scores) would perform the task more efficiently. For RTs, higher university entropy scores were related to slower global RT. In addition, we found reduced mixing costs for individuals with higher non-university entropy scores but not reduced switching costs. However, in the pupillometric data, we found a smaller difference in pupil size between switch trials in comparison with non-switch trials (i.e., a smaller pupil switching cost) for participants with more integrated bilingual language use in non-university contexts. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide evidence for the beneficial effects of the diversity of bilingual language use on executive control using pupillometry.

In other words, we needed to establish whether the CSST captured robust switching and mixing costs. The pace of the CSST version used in the present study was slower than in previous studies, which was required in order to let the task-induced pupil size return to baseline levels. We therefore took the main effects of trial type on RTs as a starting point for our analysis. The size of the switching and mixing costs was generally smaller than in previous studies using faster paced versions of the task (Prior and MacWhinney, 2010; Hartanto and Yang, 2016; Li et al., 2021) . Despite the slower pacing, however, significant switching and mixing costs emerged in our behavioral data.

These results suggest that those bilinguals with more integrated language use at university showed poorer conflict monitoring skills. Surprisingly, we observed an opposite pattern for the non-university entropy scores, such that bilinguals with higher entropy outside of university were faster at responding in the mixed blocks, albeit not significantly so. These results suggest that the diversity of language use in separate communicative contexts (in our case, university and non-university contexts) may differentially affect executive control. However, we believe there are several potential alternative explanations for these findings. First, our data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, when most teaching had been online for several months. Paired with the observation that a number of participants had moved to the Netherlands during the pandemic, it is fair to conclude that these participants only had minimal exposure to university as a social context. Even participants who had been studying at the University of Groningen for more than a year had not taken in-person classes in the 9 months preceding their participation in the current study. Additionally, the quality and quantity of participation in online classes are generally not found to be as high as in-person education (e.g., Meeter et al., 2020) . While it is possible that language entropy is not as reliable in assessing bilingual language use in all social contexts, we deem it unlikely that these unexpected results can be attributed to the language entropy measure itself, considering the circumstances. As with any tool, the quality of the measure depends on the quality of the data it is fed. Comparing the university entropy scores to the other examined contexts, we observed a considerable disparity between university and non-university contexts. This was further supported by our PCA that resulted in two clear components with only minimal crossloading from the other contexts to university entropy. Altogether, this raises the question if the university context was accurately represented as an interactional setting in our study, and consequently, if our outcomes are reliable in this respect.",

The results are therefore not in line with our prediction that people with higher entropy scores would show a reduced switching cost. These results are not consistent with previous work by Hartanto and Yang (2016) either, who found that DLC bilinguals (i.e., bilinguals with more diverse language use) had significantly lower switching costs than SLC bilinguals. Moreover, our behavioral results do not align with those presented by Li et al. (2021) , who found a reduced switching cost for individuals with higher entropy scores. We speculate that the absence of this interaction for switching FIGURE 6 | Contour plot showing the interaction between non-university entropy, time, and the pupil switching cost.

The white bars indicate missing data (i.e., non-existing entropy values in our dataset). cost in our study could be caused by the timing of our adapted CSST, as it included a lag of 1,000 ms between the cue onset and stimulus onset to accommodate for the relatively slow pupillary trajectories. Even though our paradigm captured a significant main switching effect, the effect was relatively small (82.9 ms), as compared to 144 ms for bilinguals in Prior and MacWhinney (2010) , 199 ms for DLC bilinguals in Hartanto and Yang (2016) , and 185 ms in Li et al. (2021) . This may be indicative of lower task difficulty, corroborated by the near-ceiling accuracy scores in our task. As such, it could be the case that the relatively small switching effect was not substantial enough to also capture intricate interaction effects, especially if one keeps in mind that there is less individual variation in the RTs of young adults (Hultsch et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "While the present study presented novel results as to the effects of language entropy on executive control, it was subject to several limitations. First, our study set out to investigate one index of bilingual language use, namely, language entropy. For the current calculation of language entropy, we did not take into account individual differences in the amount of time spent in the communicative contexts. A more accurate picture of the diversity of bilingual language use could be obtained if entropy scores were weighted with the amount of time spent in each social context, as was first done in Ka\u0142ama\u0142a et al. (2020 Ka\u0142ama\u0142a et al. ( , 2021 ) and subsequently in Li et al. (2021) . This way, one can control for the disparity in engagement in the various contexts. This could be a more appropriate approach, as the diversity of language use in contexts in which an individual spends more time likely has a larger effect on domain-general executive control (Abutalebi and Green, 2016) . Moreover, to obtain a more complete image of bilingual language use patterns and their effects on executive control, variables quantifying language switching and mixing behaviors should be considered in conjunction with language entropy (e.g., Ka\u0142ama\u0142a et al., 2021) . This would simultaneously enable future research to test the full set of predictions made by the ACH. The second limitation relates to our adapted CSST task. Despite its ability to capture behavioral switching and mixing costs, we propose it can be improved in two ways. First, in its current form, it does not allow for a direct comparison of pupil size during trials in the single blocks and non-switch trials in the mixed blocks to obtain pupil indices of goal maintenance. One way this can be approached in the future is to alter the trial procedure, such that the cue (i.e., \"COLOR\" or \"SHAPE\") is presented in mixed blocks as well as in single blocks. This way, trials are comparable in nature and length across single and mixed blocks, which would enable the investigation of a \"pupil mixing cost. \" Second, the relatively long lag between cue onset and stimulus onset may explain the lack of an interaction effect between entropy and switching cost in the RT data in our study. This lag was initially introduced to accommodate for expected slow changes in pupil size. However, in the pupillometry analyses, we found that larger pupil dilation for switch trials occurred almost immediately after cue onset, and even that this difference became significant before the stimulus onset. This result strongly suggests that pupillometry is an appropriate way to measure an increase in effort exerted during switch trials. However, it is also likely that the slower pace of our CSST made the task easier to complete, which would explain the generally smaller switching and mixing costs in the RT data, as compared to other studies (Prior and MacWhinney, 2010; Hartanto and Yang, 2016; Li et al., 2021) . To capture the behavioral effects better while still measuring pupil dilation patterns over time, we recommend a faster paced design in future studies. Such a design will shorten the task and also increase task demands, possibly leading to an optimal sensitivity in capturing behavioral and pupil size effects.",

            "text": "A final and obvious limitation to discuss is the fact that this study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results currently point toward the possibility that the diversity of language use in separate social contexts (university and non-university contexts) is differentially associated with executive control. This suggests that language use varying per social context may be a key variable in neurocognitive adaptations resulting from bilingual experiences. It could be argued that there is a difference between the two components in terms of voluntarity of language use. While language use in non-university contexts may be more of a choice, students at the University of Groningen are often required to speak English during class, and so it is more predictable when which language to use at university than in other contexts. However, as discussed above, we question the validity of the university entropy component in our study due to the circumstances imposed on the university system during the pandemic. It is therefore difficult to speculate if the contradictory results can indeed be explained as such. Hence, we recommend that future work replicates this study when restrictions regarding in-person teaching have been lifted.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our study's findings provide further evidence for the relationship between the social diversity of bilingual language use, as measured by language entropy, and executive control. We demonstrated reduced switching and mixing costs, reflecting enhanced set shifting and goal maintenance abilities, for bilinguals with a higher diversity of language use relative to lower diversity in non-university contexts. No such relationship was found for university contexts, but higher university entropy was associated with weaker conflict monitoring. This potentially illustrates that the effect of the diversity of language use differs per social context. Alternatively, it is possible that university simply was not a valid social context during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, replication of this study is warranted. We also showed that our adapted CSST effectively captured switching and mixing cost in the RTs. The pupillometry data were able to capture effects that were not visible in the behavioral data. These findings additionally highlight the utility of pupillometry as a sufficiently sensitive tool to assess the effects of individual bilingual experiences on executive control.",
