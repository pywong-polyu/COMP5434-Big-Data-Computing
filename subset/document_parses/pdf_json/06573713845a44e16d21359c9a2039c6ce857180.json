Coronaviruses are spherical in structure and have spiked glycoprotein on their surface that makes them appear like a crown, the reason for their name corona.

Teleconsultation via a live video is helpful in sharing health information such as radiographs and photographs through a secure electronic communications system with the practitioner to evaluate the patient's condition or provide virtual health service following an informed consent for the same [27] . (ii) If needed, patients can be prescribed analgesics or topical agents via a teledentistry appointment itself. (iii) In lieu of the fomite spread, every surface in the reception area must be presumed to be a potential risk. All nonessential items such as dental display models, brochures, and magazines should be removed, and chairs in the waiting area should be placed 6 feet apart [28] . (iv) All staff should change into different office clothing once they reach the office. Dentists, staff, and patients should be asked to hold-off on accessories such as bracelets, necklaces, and watches.
