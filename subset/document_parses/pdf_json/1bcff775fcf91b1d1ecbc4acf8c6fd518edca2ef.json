            "text": "In our simple model, we assume that infection probabilities are known when constructing optimal pool sizes and efficiency statistics. However, the prediction of infections in a fast-changing pandemic is an extremely difficult inference problem (see, e.g., ref. 19) . Given this issue, it is appropriate to worry that uncertainty and potential misprediction will make pool size choices challenging, reduce pooled testing efficiency, and render our conclusions void. For example, testing data from Massachusetts in the fall of 2020 shows high average testing positivity rates (7%) that vary widely across time and space (SD of 6%) in potentially unpredictable ways. (These data are publicly available at https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting.) Using one-off pooled testing given this population-which has an extremely high positivity rate partially due to self-selection of people who desire a test-will be very inefficient given the high rates and the potential for misoptimization. However, as discussed above, frequent testing of a consistent population reduces the mean and variance of infection probabilities at the time of testing because there is little time between testing for mean-and variance-inducing spread to occur, and the selection issue is removed. For example, as noted in ref. 20 , the town of Wellesley, MA, employed weekly testing of consistent subpopulations in the fall of 2020, and the average positivity rates stayed low (0.3%) and didn't vary considerably (SD of 0.3%). When positivity rates have low mean and variance, we show that the efficiency of pooled testing is strongly robust to reasonably miscalibrated estimations and constant pool sizes, such that pooled testing remains very attractive. Finally, we note that better estimation of the positivity distribution is also helped by frequent testing, which naturally produces a constant stream of recent test result data from the relevant population.",

This does not impact our results when the time between tests is less than the recovery period, but it lowers the relative cost of pooled testing when frequency is low, because the prevalence is lower due to recoveries.

First, there is a natural negative impact: Combining samples can potentially dilute the viral load below the limit of detection of the test. However, this implies that the false negatives will occur when the viral load is very low and the person is less likely to be infectious. * Second, this dilution concern is counteracted, when testing frequently, by the large increase in overall sensitivity coming from running a larger number of tests. \u2020 Third, as noted in ref. 22 , false negatives may result from poor-quality samples.

            "text": "Finally, we largely abstract away various practical implementation costs and constraints. First, we assume that every test, whether individual or pooled, has the same cost. However, pooled testing necessitates a more complicated setup in the laboratory, requiring more space and trained personnel (or a robotic setup) to correctly mix the samples together. While these costs are relatively moderate if spread over a long period of time, a laboratory might be reluctant to change their operations when the duration of the pandemic is very unclear. Second, we assume that there is no time delay between testing and receiving the test result. In reality, it takes time to transport samples to the laboratory and test them, and pooled testing takes more time than individual testing because it potentially requires an additional retesting step. Fortunately, the difference in these delays can be minimized when using the common \"hold-out\" method: Only a portion of each individual sample is used to construct the pooled sample, such that the remaining portions of the individual samples can be immediately individually tested if the pooled sample tests positive. However, even if the difference is minimized, any delay still impacts our analysis. In particular, by assuming no delay, increasing the testing frequency minimizes the likelihood of undiscovered new infections in the time between tests, such that the infection probability at the time of testing can be kept arbitrarily low. But, when there is a delay in receiving test results, it is not possible to stop infection and spread during the delay period even if testing is continuous. Therefore, it might be simply impossible to lower the infection probability below the \u223c5% threshold at which the cost benefit of pooled testing is considered clear. In this extreme case, we do not recommend pooled testing. However, if the risk and spread are so extreme that 5% of a group is expected to be newly infected every few days even with very frequent testing, an alternative policy relying on isolation seems far more likely.",

The first paper draft of the paper was completed in June 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. At that point, testing supply was low and prices were high because laboratories were building up testing capacity in a relatively strict regulatory environment. By early 2021, multiple organizationssuch as Mirimus, Ginkgo, and the Broad-were offering frequent pooled testing at much cheaper prices than individual testing, and multiple organizations with correlated risk-such as employers, cities, and school districts-were employing these tests. For example, in February 2021, Massachusetts implemented a policy of providing universal weekly pooled testing for all K-12 students * Furthermore, empirically, the sensitivity loss of pooled testing given reasonable pool sizes has been shown to be negligible in other domains (24, 25) and, more recently, shown to be similarly low for COVID-19 in pool sizes of 32 and 48 (26, 27) , although the results of ref. 28 show lower specificity (81%) for pools of 50. \u2020 For example, if pooled testing leads the sensitivity to drop from 99 to 90% on a single test, sampling x times as frequently will increase overall sensitivity to 1 \u2212 (0.10) x if errors are independent. Even with extreme correlation in the error-suppose the false negative rate for a pool given a previous false negative for that pool is 50%-pooled testing 4 to 5 times as frequently will recover the same false positive rate as individual testing. and faculty and staff. \u2021 And, nationally, the Rockefeller Foundation called for use of frequent pooled testing as an essential aspect of school reopening (30) . \u00a7 The authors, based on the main insights of this paper, supported many of these policy initiatives and recommendations. Interestingly, the cost of pooled testing in Massachusetts (between $3 and $10 per student per test) is almost precisely the predicted amount using pooling in the first draft of the paper, providing a useful empirical validation of the model.",

To understand the basic benefits of pooled testing, consider a simple example: 100 people, each with an independent likelihood of being positive of 1% and a test that (perfectly) determines whether a sample is positive. The conventional approach of testing each person individually requires 100 tests. Suppose, instead, that the individuals' samples are combined into five equally sized pools of 20, and then each of these combined samples is tested using one test. If any one of the 20 individuals in a combined sample is positive, everyone in that pool is individually tested, requiring 20 more tests (21 in total). The probability that this occurs is 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 0.01) 20 \u224818%. However, if no one in the pool is positive-which occurs with probability \u223c82%-no more testing is required.

By focusing on situations in which p is relatively low, we are not focusing on low-risk populations but rather focusing on frequencies in which p remains relatively low for the given population.

            "text": "Infection Probability and Pooled Testing. As noted by many previous authors, for all the different incarnations of pooled testing, the benefits of pooled testing rise as the infection probability falls in the population. Lower probabilities reduce the chance of a positive pooled test, thereby reducing the likelihood that the entire pool must be retested individually. This is clear in Eq. 2, as expected tests 2 \u00b7 \u221a p \u00b7 n drop with infection probabilities. For example, if the probability drops from 1 to 0.1%, the optimal pool size rises, and the number of tests falls from around 20 to 6.3. There is still a large gain if the pool size is fixed: Expected tests drop from 23 to around 6.9 using a fixed pool size of 20. Similarly, if the probability rises from 1 to 10%, the expected number of tests using the optimal pool size rises to around 59 (or 93 given a fixed pool size of 20). The full relationship is shown in Fig. 1 , which plots the expected number of tests in a population of n people given different pool sizes and visually highlights the results based on 1) individual testing-which always leads to n tests, 2) using pools of 20, and 3) using optimal pooling given two stages. For simplicity, we construct these figures by assuming that n is large to remove rounding issues that arise from breaking n people into pools sizes that are not divisible by n. There are large gains from pooled testing at many infection probabilities, although they are appreciably larger at lower probabilities. We note that this figure replicates many similar figures already in the literature going back to ref. 1. testing (equivalent to a pool size of one), which always requires n tests regardless of infection probability. The results from using a pool size of 20 is shown in orange, while the blue line represents the number of tests given the optimal pool size for a given probability. Finally, the green text notes that benefit from pooled testing is the distance between the black individual-testing line and those from pooled testing. For example, as noted in the text, using a pool size of 20 for a probability of 1% leads to 0.23 \u00b7 n tests rather than n tests, while the optimal pool size (10) leads to 0.20 \u00b7 n tests.",

Testing individually at this frequency requires 10 times the number of tests, for 1,000 total tests. It is therefore natural to think that pooled testing also requires 10 times the number of tests, for more than 200 total tests. However, this estimation ignores the fact that testing 10 times as frequently reduces the probability of infection at the point of each test (conditional on not being positive at the previous test) from 1 to only around 0.1%. \u00b6 This drop in probability reduces the number \u00b6 Our analysis assumes that background risk is spread uniformly across time. Instead, one might consider a model in which the risk is changing. In this case, a main question of interest becomes when to test. That is, when the background risk is constant, it is appropriate to test at equal intervals because this places an equal amount of infection risk at each test. However, if the risk is changing, it is appropriate to test at unequal of expected tests-given pools of 20-to 6.9 at each of the 10 testing points, such that the total number is only 69. That is, testing people 10 times as frequently only requires slightly more than 3 times the number of tests. Or, put in a different way, there is a quantity discount of around 65% by increasing frequency. The same conclusion holds for optimal pool sizes: The one-time pool test would require 20 expected tests, while testing 10 times as frequently requires 6.3 tests at each testing point, for a total of 63. The savings relative to the 1,000 tests using individual testing are dramatic, with only \u223c6% of the total tests required. Fig. 2 represents this effect more generally for different levels of frequency given an infection probability of 1% over the course of a month. Note that, at a frequency of once a month, the numbers match those in Fig. 1 , which was based on one test given a probability of 1%. Unlike in Fig. 1 , we do not include the results for individual testing in this graph, as testing individually every day requires 20 to 30 times more tests than pooled testing, which renders the graph unreadable. The dashed orange line represents the naive (and incorrect) calculation for pooled testing by extrapolating the cost of testing multiple times by using the number of tests required for one test. That is, as above, one might naively think that testing x times using a pool size of 20 in a population of n would require x \u00b7 0.23 \u00b7 n tests given that testing once requires 0.23 \u00b7 n tests. Pooled testing is, in fact, much cheaper due to the reduction in the probability of infection at the time of each testing-the central contribution of this section. We therefore denote the savings between the extrapolation line and the actual requirements of pooled testing as the \"frequency benefit.\"",

As we have noted throughout the paper, it is therefore not correct to observe high self-selected positivity rates in the general population and conclude that frequent pooled testing on a consistent subpopulation would be inefficient. Even though frequent testing reduces the mean and variance of positivity rates, there is still uncertainty. However, we now show that this uncertainty has little impact on our conclusions. In particular, suppose that, rather than being known, the infection rate is uncertain and drawn from a gamma distribution with mean \u03bc and SD \u03c3 (we chose the gamma distribution as it has the ability to reasonably match the empirical distribution of positivity rates for both Wellesley and Massachusetts as a whole). In our previous analysis, we effectively assumed that the pool designer is aware of the exact realization of the infection rate and can optimize pool size accordingly. What if, instead, the designer knows the distribution but not the specific draw? And what happens if the designer (mistakenly) believes that the distribution is actually characterized by\u03bc = \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03bc and\u03c3 = \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3? Does this uncertainty or misprediction destroy the efficiency from pooled testing?",

            "text": "Interestingly, reasonable uncertainty and misprediction have very little impact on efficiency. For example, in the case resembling Wellesley where \u03bc = 0.003 and \u03c3 = 0.003, the expected number of tests given full knowledge of the infection realization is 0.093 \u00b7 n. When the designer knows the distribution but is unaware of the realization, the optimal pool size is 19, and the resultant expected number of tests only rises to 0.103 \u00b7 n. That is, the lack of knowledge only costs 0.01 \u00b7 n tests in expectation. Finally, given mistaken beliefs where \u03b1 equals 0.5, 0.75, 1.5, and 2, tests only rise to 0.109 \u00b7 n, 0.105 \u00b7 n, 0.106 \u00b7 n, and 0.109 \u00b7 n, respectively. That is, mistaken beliefs have little impact on efficiency. This lack of impact is a result of the robustness of efficiency to wrongly chosen pool sizes. For example, whereas the correct beliefs about the distribution lead to an optimal pool size of 19, mistakenly using pool sizes of 10, 15, 30, and 40 only increases tests to 0.126 \u00b7 n, 0.109 \u00b7 n, 0.113 \u00b7 n, and 0.130 \u00b7 n, respectively. The main driver of efficiency is not perfect optimization of pool sizes but rather the mean infection rate, which is suppressed by frequent testing. \u00a7 \u00a7 Finally, we note one additional benefit of frequent testing with respect to uncertainty. When performing a one-off test on a random new population, it is very challenging to create an accurate estimate of the risk distribution. However, performing frequent testing on a consistent population naturally generates a byproduct of past positivity realizations for the same population, which can be used to create a more accurate estimate. \u00b6 \u00b6 For example, a surprisingly high positivity rate one week might shift beliefs about the next week's distribution upward, leading to smaller pool sizes or more frequent testing. \u2021 \u2021 The use of frequent testing was not randomly assigned to Wellesley. Therefore, one fear is that Wellesley's rates are fundamentally low due to specific population characteristics. While only (nonexistent) random assignment can solve this identification problem, we do note that Norfolk County-the home of Wellesley-had infection rates similar to other counties in December 2020, when Massachusetts began publishing county-by-county statistics. \u00a7 \u00a7 While efficiency losses rise with mean and variance, reasonable robustness to uncertainty holds more generally. For example, for \u03bc and \u03c3 of [0.01,0.01], [0.03,0.03], and [0.06,0.06], the efficiency costs of lacking knowledge about the realization of distribution are 0.018 \u00b7 n, 0.026 \u00b7 n, and 0.032 \u00b7 n, respectively, and the efficiency losses from a mistaken belief of \u03b1 = 0.5 are 0.026 \u00b7 n, 0.036 \u00b7 n, and 0.045 \u00b7 n, respectively. \u00b6 \u00b6 In a previous version of the paper located at https://www.nber.org/papers/w27457, we discuss how employing machine learning techniques on known data can create moreaccurate estimates and increase testing efficiency.",

            "text": "To understand the benefit of correlation given pooled testing, it is useful to broadly outline the forces that determine the expected number of tests with simple two-stage testing with a pool size of g and a large testing population n. In the first stage, a test will be run for every n/g pool, while, in the second stage, every n/g pool faces a probability q that at least one sample will be positive, such that all g people in the pool will need to be individually tested. Combining and simplifying these factors leads to a simple formula of the expected number of tests given a pool size: n \u00b7 (1/g + q). As noted above, in the case of infections with independent probability p, q = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) g . However, as infections become more positively correlated, q falls for every pool size g > 1. For example, with two people in a pool whose infections have a correlation r, q can be shown to be 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) 2 \u2212 r \u00b7 p \u00b7 (1 \u2212 p). That is, when r = 0, we recover the original formula 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) 2 , while raising r linearly drops the probability until it is p when r = 1. Intuitively, the pool has a positive result if either person 1 or person 2 is infected, whichholding p constant-is less likely when infections are correlated and therefore more likely to occur simultaneously.",

            "text": "To understand larger pools, we repeatedly simulate each individual, drawing an N (0, 1) random variable and assigning them to be infected if their draw is above a critical value (i.e., 2.326 for a 1% infection rate). To simulate correlation, an individual's draw is a convex combination of a shared and individual normally distributed variable, where the weights are calibrated such that the pairwise correlation between any two people is r. As an example of how q falls with more people and consequently reduces the number of tests, suppose that p = 1%: When infections are uncorrelated, q is around 9.6%, 18.2%, 26.0%, and 33.1% given respective pool sizes 10, 20, 30, and 40, while q respectively drops to around 3.1%, 3.9%, 4.4%, and 4.8% when every person is pairwise correlated with r = 0.5. Therefore, the respective expected number of tests given these pool sizes falls from 0.196 \u00b7 n, 0.232 \u00b7 n, 0.294 \u00b7 n, and 0.356 \u00b7 n when uncorrelated to 0.131 \u00b7 n, 0.089 \u00b7 n, 0.077 \u00b7 n, and 0.073 \u00b7 n when r = 0.5. First, note that the number of expected tests is universally lower at every pool size given correlation (and the savings are very significant). Second, note that, while the pool size with the lowest number of expected tests given these potential pool sizes is 10 when there is no correlation, larger pool sizes are better given correlation. This statement is more general: A higher correlation raises the optimal pool size. The intuition is that the marginal benefit of higher pool size (reducing the 1 g first-stage tests) is the same with or without correlation, but the marginal cost (increasing the probability of second-stage testing) is reduced with higher correlation, thus leading to a higher optimum. As an example, while the optimal pool size given p = 1% is 10 given no correlation, the optimal pool sizes given r of 0, 0.2, 0,4, 0.6, and 0.8 are 11, 22, 44, 107, and 385, respectively.",

Our key insight is that repeated testing reduces the infection probability at the time of each test andsince pooled testing is more efficient given lower probabilitiesincreases the efficiency of pooled testing. Therefore, contrary to a commonly stated rule, pooled testing is appropriate and cost effective even for high-risk populations, as long as the frequency of testing rises in relation to this risk. ## In fact, we are starting to see frequent pooled testing offered at prices of $3 to $10 per person per test. Consequently, frequent pooled testing is increasingly being adopted at scale, such as in the state of Massachusetts where all K-12 students are offered weekly pooled testing. The cost of testing in those programs validates these estimates and demonstrates the feasibility of these strategies. Data Availability.

All opinions and errors are our own. ## However, the initial round that begins the frequent testing is an exception: When testing starts in a high-risk population, infection probabilities at the time of testing are likely to be high because there have been no actions taken to contain spread. It is therefore potentially cost effective to use individual testing for this one initial round before switching to pooled testing for all following rounds. For these later rounds, infection probability is kept low because frequent testing is allowing for the constant removal of infected individuals.",
