The heavily O-glycosylated gel-forming mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B eliminate pathogens by mucociliary clearance while transmembrane mucins MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 restrict microbial invasion at the apical surface of the epithelium. In this study, we determined the impact of host mucins and mucin glycans on SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated epithelial entry. Human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells have endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and express high levels of glycosylated MUC1 on the surface but not MUC4 and MUC16. Removal of the MUC1 extracellular domain (ED) using the O-glycan-specific mucinase StcE greatly enhanced spike binding and viral infection. By contrast, removal of mucin glycans sialic acid and fucose did not impact viral invasion. This study implicates the glycosylated ED of MUC1 as an important component of the host defense that restricts the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The major components of mucus are heavily O-glycosylated mucin glycoproteins. Soluble mucins are secreted by Goblet cells and provide mucus threads for mucociliary clearance (MCC) of particles and pathogens. Transmembrane mucins are expressed on the apical membrane and cilia and prevent access to epithelial surface receptors 1 . SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belong to the \u03b2 coronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family 2,3 . SARS-CoV-2 preferentially utilizes receptorangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as entry receptor by interaction with its envelope-anchored spike (S) protein 4 . In addition to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 entry requires proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein that can be mediated by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) 5 . Human coronaviruses have also been described to depend on sialic acids linked to glycoproteins or gangliosides as primary attachment sites in the respiratory tract 6 .",

The expression and glycosylation profiles of mucins are directly influenced by colonization and invasion by bacteria and viruses and are altered during inflammation of the respiratory tract 9 . Transmembrane mucins form filamentous structures that extend above the apical surface of the epithelium and these mucins consist of a heavily O-glycosylated N-terminal extracellular domain (ED), a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (CT) with signaling capacity. In the lung, MUC1 primarily expresses around microvilli and protrudes at least 100 nm from the cell surface whereas MUC4 (\u223c300 nm in size), and the even larger MUC16 are expressed on the surface of cilia 10 . Together, the TM mucins form a barrier that restricts access to the underlying epithelium, act as releasable decoy receptors, and sterically hinder the binding of pathogens to underlying cellular receptors 11 . MUC1 has been most extensively studied and implicated in defense against respiratory infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 12 and respiratory syncytial virus 13 and Influenza A virus infection 14 . In this present study, we determined the impact of transmembrane mucins on spike-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human respiratory cells. MUC1 is the dominant transmembrane mucins and removal of the extracellular domain greatly enhances spike binding and viral infection. This study points to critical importance of MUC1 in limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

We first determined the expression of different mucins and their glycans on Calu-3 cells by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Multiple Z-stack images were collected which showed expression of MUC1, MUC4, and MUC5AC and only very limited expression of MUC16 (Fig 1C, S1A respectively) . To distinguish which mucins are expressed on the extracellular surface, we performed immunofluorescence staining without permeabilization of the Calu-3 cells. Using this method, MUC1 was clearly detectable on the surface whereas MUC4 and MUC5AC could not be stained indicating an intracellular localization ( Fig 1D) . Next, we determined the expression of the terminal mucin glycans sialic acid and fucose on Calu-3 cells. Immunofluorescence with SNA, MALII, and UEA-I lectin showed the presence of \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid, \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid, and fucose on Calu-3 cells, respectively ( Fig 1E) . The \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid and \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid signals (SNA and MALII) were more prominently detected at the edge of the cell island compared to the fucose signal (UEA1) and some colocalization with MUC1 could be observed. These results demonstrate that Calu-3 cells endogenously express MUC1 on their surface and have abundant expression of sialic acids and fucose.",

We previously applied this bacterial mucinase and its inactive point mutant E447D to remove the MUC1 ED 19 . To investigate the effect of StcE on endogenous MUC1 expressed by Calu-3 cells, confocal microscopy was performed on non-treated, StcE-treated and E447D-treated Calu-3 cells and stained with \u03b1-MUC1-ED antibody 214D4, \u03b1-MUC1-SEA antibody 232A1, and \u03b1-MUC1-CT antibody CT2. StcE treatment efficiently removed the glycosylated part of the MUC1 extracellular domain as indicated by a complete loss of \u03b1-MUC1-ED 214D4 staining after incubation with the enzyme (Fig 2A) . The MUC1 SEA domain and CT are predicted not to be digested by StcE and indeed both domains remained detectable after enzyme treatment ( Fig   2B, 2C) . We next investigated the effect of StcE, E447D, neuraminidase, and fucosidase treatment on MUC1 by Western blot. Calu-3 cells were incubated with the enzymes for 3 h and then subjected to Western blot analysis with the \u03b1-MUC1-ED antibody 214D4 and \u03b1-MUC1-CT antibody CT2. After incubation with StcE, the glycosylated part of the extracellular domain of MUC1 (about 450 kDa) was no longer detectable. The high molecular weight MUC1 band was not affected by treatment with the inactive enzyme E447D or fucosidase. After neuraminidase treatment on the other hand, we did observe a reduction of the MUC1 signal which could be caused by a change in antibody recognition or altered protein transfer to the membrane ( Fig 2D) . The observed banding pattern for the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail was not affected by the enzymatic treatments ( Fig 2E) . Furthermore, we wanted to determine the effect of enzymatic treatment on ACE2 stability because the ACE2 receptor itself is glycosylated 20 . No change in expression of the full-length glycosylated ACE2 (nearly 140 kDa) could be observed after treatment with StcE, E447D, neuraminidase, or fucosidase. Interestingly, the soluble form of ACE2 (around 70 kDa) was more prominently detectable after fucosidase treatment ( Fig 2F) .",

A small reduction of viral infection was observed when the cells were treated with only heparanase in comparison to the control cells without treatment.

Together these results show that enzymatic removal of the MUC1 extracellular domain allows more virus attachment to cells and thus increases infectivity.",

However, mucins can also serve as attachment sites for bacterial and viral pathogens. The findings presented in this study demonstrate that the transmembrane mucin MUC1 plays a substantial protective role during SARS-CoV-2 infection at the respiratory surface. We show that MUC1 is the dominant mucin in ACE2-positive cells in the respiratory epithelium and that human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells expressed high levels of MUC1, while TM mucins MUC4 and MUC16 and secreted mucin MUC5AC were barely detectable (Fig 1, 2) . In various SARS-CoV-2 infection studies, we demonstrate that the large MUC1 glycoprotein forms a protective layer that prevents access of the virus to the underlying ACE2 receptor (Fig 3) . Our experiments indicate that enzymatic removal of the extracellular domain of MUC1 enhances viral infection of lung epithelial cells (Fig 3) . In the absence of the MUC1 glycosylated domain, increased binding of purified spike protein and virus to the cellular surface was observed (Fig 4) .",

In the course of COVID-19, elevated levels of gel-forming MUC5AC and shed MUC1 can be detected in sputum aspirated from the trachea of patients 23 . The MUC5B genetic variant rs35705950 is associated with higher expression of the soluble mucin MUC5B, is underrepresented in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals, suggesting a protective role for MUC5B 24 . It cannot be excluded that decreased mucus production and weakened MCC contribute to the higher susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in aged individuals 25 interact and/or are in the same protein complex on the respiratory surface 28 . Our data indicate that steric hindrance of the large glycosylated extracellular domain of MUC1 prevents the virus from reaching the ACE2 receptor (Fig 5) . This is in line with a recent study that used mucin mimetics glycopolymers that were capable of shielding surface receptors 29 . In a previous study, we have shown that MUC1 ED alters the cell membrane to tubulated morphology and reduce \u03b21-integrin-mediated bacterial invasion 19 . In the present study, we have not observed any influence of MUC1 ED on membrane architecture. Different studies describe that for viral entry SARS-CoV-2 benefits from negatively charged residues like sialic acid-containing glycans or membrane glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface 30, 31, 32, 33 . In contrast with this findings, neuraminidase treatment of Calu-3 cells modestly increased SARS-CoV-2 infection 34 ",

Our findings on the role of protective endogenous MUC1 are supported by a recent genome-scale CRISPR loss-and gain-of-function study for SARS-CoV-2 entry in human lung epithelial cells overexpressing TMs such as MUC1, MUC4 or MUC21 26 . Gain-offunction (GOF) cell lines overexpressing MUC1, MUC4 or MUC21 showed reduced infection by SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped VSV compared to cells with non-targeting guide (NTG). The study showed, enzymatic removal of overexpressed MUC4 also resulted in increased viral entry showing that different TM mucins might have a shared protective function during SARS-CoV-2 infection. MUC4 was previously implicated in protection against SARS-CoV in a study with female mice in which MUC4 knockout mice had enhanced inflammatory cytokine responses and poor prognosis 27 . Our single-cell analysis showed that in MUC1 is the dominant mucin in ACE2-positive cell in the respiratory tract in healthy people. Single cell sequencing data of COVID19 patients demonstrated that MUC1, MUC4, MUC13 and MUC21 are all highly upregulated in patients with active disease 26 . Establishing the function of the different mucins during infection is an important future challenge.The studies that are currently available underscore the importance of extracellular domain of transmembrane mucins during viral entry. Our confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that the MUC1 glycosylated extracellular domain is covering the ACE2-positive surface. Enzymatic removal of the MUC1 glycosylated domain did not affect the underlying SEA domain or cytoplasmic tail and ACE2 expression remained detectable. As was previously hypothesized, it is possible that MUC1 and ACE2",

            "text": ". In our live virus experiments we observed a modest increase in SARS-CoV-2 efficiency after neuraminidase treatment and no effect of fucosidase treatment. We addressed if the negatively charged sialic acids or heparan sulfates were important for viral entry after removal of the glycosylated mucin domain. Consecutive treatment with StcE and neuraminidase or heparinase was performed but did not result in a difference in viral entry.Differences in viral dependence on negatively charged surface molecules maybe be explained by levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protease expression and accessibility of the receptor for the viral spike protein in different cell systems. Therefore, our findings reveal that during infection of human respiratory Calu-3 cells the MUC1 extracellular domain rather than individual mucin glycans prevents the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the underlying receptor.In addition to the role of transmembrane mucins in preventing viral entry into epithelial cells, mucins can have a detrimental effect during the later stages of COVID-19. Overproduction and excess accumulation of gel-forming mucins in the lungs of COVID-19 patients can lead to airway obstruction and eventually cause life-threatening ARDS35,36,37 . Several studies are focusing on the reduction of mucin expression as a therapeutic strategy38,39,40 . Compound R406, the active metabolite of FDA-Approved Fostamatinib that inhibits MUC1 expression is now in clinical trials for hospitalized patients with advanced COVID-1941 . Our results on the important function of MUC1 in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection could point towards a strategy to promote MUC1 expression, boost mucosal defense mechanisms and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first place.",

            "text": "//www.genomique.eu/cellbrowser/HCA/. Dimensionality reduction was done using the Seurat Package 42 in Rstudio (version 1.2.5019), starting with a principle component analysis. After visual inspection of the principal components using and elbow plot, the first twenty components were used for graph-based clustering analysis. Clusters of cells were then visualized as diffusion maps (uMAPs). To determine gene expression in ACE2-and TMPRSS2-positive versus negative cells we created two additional metadata slots, in which normalized transcript counts of these genes above 0 were considered positive. Then, cell type assignment and normalized expression of a panel of genes of interest was determined by sub-setting single or double-positive epithelial cells. Cell culture Calu-3 cells (ATCC Catalog # HTB-55), HEK-293T (ATCC Catalog # CRL-3216) and BHK-21 cells (ATCC Catalog # CCL-10) cells were routinely grown in 25 cm 2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.",

The next day, cell lysates were thawed, thoroughly resuspended, and transferred to white, opaque-walled 96-well plates and relative luminescence unit (RLU) was measured. Renilla luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay Systems (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Raw luminescence values were recorded as counts per 5 seconds by Berthold Centro LB 942 plate luminometer. For SARS2-S pseudotyped VSV-GFP mediated infection, GFP positive signal captured using an EVOS microscope (Thermo Scientific) at 4X magnification and quantified using EVOS software. For infection experiments with the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, Calu-3 cells were prepared as described above and inoculated with approximately 200 pfu of SARS-CoV-2. At 8 h post-infection, cells were washed in PBS, fixed in formalin, permeabilized in 70% ethanol and washed in PBS again. Immunofluorescent stainings were performed as described for SARS-CoV-2 stock production and scanned plates were analyzed using ImageQuant TL software.
