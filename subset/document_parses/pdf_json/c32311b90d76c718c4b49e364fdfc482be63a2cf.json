However, such problem presents an ever-growing challenge related to the huge number of degrees of freedom borne from the high-dimensional spaces in which increasingly high-fidelity material models are defined. One way is to simulate the arrangement of atoms by minimizing the potential energy. Among various mathematical models describing the interaction, the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential [9] has attracted a lot of theoretical and computational attention due to its mathematical simplicity yet practical importance of discovering low energy configurations of clusters of atoms. There are two main difficulties in solving this problem. First, the non-convexity and highly non-linearity of many variables lead to a large number of local minima [3, 13] , and second, the intensive computational burden of many variables leads to slow convergence [3, 6] . Therefore, an acceleration of LJ potential with potentially better local minimum is desired.",

One known property is that the Mackay icosahedron [4, 10, 19, 20] dominates the structures of LJ clusters at least in the size range of 10-150 atoms. In this work, we observe similar property as icosahedronal packing by examining the local minimum obtained by truncated-Newton method [12] using random initial guess. This observation inspires us to adapt the successive refinement [2, 15] developed in traditional multigrid method to accelerate the LJ convergence. Therefore, we propose a novel interpolation method as part of a successive refinement framework so that a better initial guess can be obtained for a larger system from the solution of a smaller system. We benchmark our method on various sizes of systems and show that the proposed method can lead to a much faster convergence. Furthermore, in our examples, we show that the proposed hierarchical approach can potentially lead to an overall better local minimum with a lower energy than using random initial guess.",

We can further extend this visualization to E 3 , where we fix v 1 at the origin and v 2 on the y-axis at the optimal distance of r * = 2 1 6 (discussed more in Sect. 3) from the origin, then we examine the optimization performance by freeing v 3 on x-y plane. Again, through the paper, we use truncated-Newton method [12] to perform all optimization procedure due to its robust performance. Figure 2a shows the number of iterations (indicated by color intensity) needed for convergence at different initial locations of v 3 on x-y plane. Figure 2b shows the corresponding energy (indicated by color intensity) obtained while optimization converges. Again, even for the three atoms case, the basins of attractions are so rich in its complexity that a good initial guess is desired for a fast optimization process. ",

This fact inspired many researchers to leverage the geometric principles of LJ minima to generate good initial guesses (e.g., [17, 22] ). For example, for minimizing E N , instead of random initial guess, we initialize the iterate by simply adding an atom randomly to a local minimum of E N \u22121 . As we can see in Fig. 3 , compared to a random initial guess, using the initial guess built upon the local minimum of E N \u22121 requires much fewer number of iterations to converge, without sacrificing the quality of the local minimum.

Therefore, the global minima of E 3 and E 4 in 3D are equilateral triangle and tetrahedron, respectively, with pairwise distance r * . For larger systems, we first define the neighboring atoms of the atom v i as the ones connected with v i by edges of Delaunay triangulation [7] . Notice that the optimal pairwise distance of r * is not maintained between all neighboring atoms for N > 3 in 2D and N > 4 in 3D. Then an intuitive expectation is that an arrangement of the atoms, where all the pairwise neighboring distances are approximating r * , can be a good initial guess.

This trilateration technique of circle-circle intersection in 2D or spheresphere-sphere intersection in 3D has been used in various applications such as surveying and GPS systems [5, 14, 23] . After performing trilateration on every edge on the boundary of the atomic configuration, a list of candidate locations for the new atoms are obtained as shown in Fig. 6 . Each location is evaluated by adding an atom there and seeing if the resulted system has smaller energy, since the energies of stable systems should decrease as the number of atoms increase. If adding an atom at a location increases the energy of the system, this location is discarded. For simplicity, we summarize the detailed procedure (denoted as trilateration-based multilevel method) in 2D as follows (Fig. 4) , \u2022 Select edges that only have two atoms lying on it.",

We exploit the hierarchies embedded in the atomic configuration with different sizes so that a good initial guess can be obtained by interpolating through trilateration from a local minimum of a smaller system. We observe that for 2D, the interpolated initial guess can save the number of iteration greatly comparing to random initial guess, without sacrificing the quality of the minimum. Although only preliminary results for 3D are shown for limited sizes of system, it is promising that the proposed method can be scaled to practical use.

Alternatively, one can utilize multistart framework for global optimization (e.g, [16] ) with the proposed trilateration-based multilevel method for each subproblem.
