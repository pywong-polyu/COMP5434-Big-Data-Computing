The primary outcome was the intention to use a decision aid. Secondary outcomes were psychosocial variables of intention, knowledge, satisfaction, acceptability, perceived usefulness, and reaction to the pedagogical approach. All outcomes were self-assessed through web-based questionnaires, including the space for written comments.

Pregnant women face several possible options: whether to take the test, and if so, which one (biochemical test, fetal DNA, or nuchal translucency ultrasound) [2, 3] . Prenatal screening is a value-laden decision, and the probabilistic nature of the evidence makes it a difficult decision for expecting parents. It is also complex because new difficult decisions may arise if the results of screening indicate a high probability of Down syndrome in the fetus-that is, whether to perform a more invasive procedure to confirm or deny the screening results (which includes risks of miscarriage) and, ultimately, whether to continue or terminate the pregnancy, given that prenatal treatment options are not available [4] .",

SDM improves the health care experiences of both patients and health professionals and leads to better health care processes, patient experience and outcomes, and optimal health spending [9] [10] [11] [12] . To implement SDM in clinical practice, several approaches have been proposed in the literature, including interactive skills workshops for health professionals and implementation of SDM tools known as decision aids (DAs) [13, 14] . DAs are tools used by health care professionals to assist patients in their decision-making by providing information on treatment or screening options and their associated benefits and harms and by clarifying their values and preferences regarding the decision to be made [15] .",

One of their roles is to initiate laboratory examinations and diagnostic tests, such as prenatal screening [18] . Thus, they are in a strategic position to implement SDM as they accompany pregnant women and their families in decision-making about prenatal screening [18, 19] . Owing to their close and trusting relationship with patients, their intimate understanding of their community environment, their understanding of biology, and their communication skills, nurses could be powerful allies in implementing SDM in prenatal care [20] . Most SDM implementation studies focus on physicians [21] , but with the transformation of health care systems, nurses are increasingly involved in clinical decision-making, and their crucial role urgently needs acknowledgment [22] . Patients themselves have expressed that nurses could play a significant role in SDM; they could provide information and support as well as communicate with other clinicians [23] . Moreover, many studies highlight that an interprofessional approach to SDM, in the context of team-based health care, has benefits for SDM implementation [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Investigating nursing training in SDM not only gives us an underexplored perspective but could also inform us about the complexities involved in interprofessional SDM.",

The course aimed to integrate SDM into prenatal care by focusing on the use of a DA. It was divided into four main modules: (1) SDM, (2) Down syndrome prenatal screening, (3) DAs, and (4) communication between health care professionals and patients. Course development was based on the SDM model [39] and its central concepts [14, 39] . These include assessment with the patient and health care professional that there is a decision to be made, exploration of the options available and their pros and cons, discussion about patients' preferences, support of the patient by health care professionals in their decision-making, and discussion surrounding the decision to be made. The course depicted a DA and included a video of a clinical encounter in which the DA was used by a clinician with expecting parents. The DA was created by our research team [40] using the International Patient Decision Aids Standards [41] . The model used in the course was in paper format. Its core element is the decision of whether to undergo prenatal screening for Down syndrome. It describes Down syndrome; presents the various prenatal tests and their benefits, harms, and consequences; and provides an exercise for users to clarify their values regarding the options.

Intention was chosen as the primary outcome because of the literature supporting intention as a strong predictor of behavior [44] [45] [46] . Intention is defined as the degree to which a person has formulated conscious plans to perform or not perform some specified future behavior, that is, the subjective probability that they will perform the behavior [47] . According to the integrated model of the theory of planned behavior for health care providers by Godin [46] , their intention to change their behavior can be predicted by four variables: social influence, beliefs about capabilities, moral norms, and beliefs about consequences, as well as by individual and environmental characteristics. The intention to use a DA could act as a proxy for level 3 in the Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick [42] model, that is, a proxy for changes in behavior. Thus, although nurses' mid-or long-term behavior was not evaluated in this study, we assumed that their intention to use a DA in clinical practice with pregnant women could predict their future SDM behavior in clinical practice after receiving the training and once the DA is implemented in clinical settings. Further details on the rationale for the choice of primary outcome can be found in the protocol by Poulin Herron et al [37] .",

            "text": "First, there was no difference in intention scores between the intervention and control groups. This was a comparative effectiveness study [56] , as both arms presented an active intervention. Although the control arm developed by nurse experts in prenatal screening excluded an SDM focus, it covered ethical aspects of the decision and information on the importance of adapting prenatal care to each pregnant woman, a core value in the nursing profession [57, 58] . Consequently, it is possible that there was not enough difference between the study arms in terms of generic decision support for prenatal care. Indeed, previous research has shown that of all health professions, genetic counselors have the highest SDM scores during prenatal consultations, even in the absence of SDM training [59, 60] . In addition, we observed a ceiling effect with the primary outcome at baseline, which may have limited our ability to observe the effect of the intervention. Similar ceiling effects were seen in a study assessing change in behavioral intention after CPD activities [48] and in another study assessing the impact of a patient-professional coproduced digital educational intervention [61] . Our initial high scores may also be because of the training that Canadian nurses had already received. Nursing programs emphasize fundamental knowledge of relational approaches that influence health outcomes for individuals, families, and communities [57] . In fact, the essence of nursing is based on a deep understanding of the biopsychosocial aspects of patients and on advocating for them [62] . Finally, participants may have been subjected to social pressure to state that they intended to use a DA [49, [63] [64] [65] . Thus, we do not have insight into the full set of factors that may have contributed to their intention (apart from the CPD-Reaction constructs), because the theories explain only part of the variance in intention [46] . Second, we found a statistically significant difference in scores for knowledge about SDM between the intervention and control groups but not for knowledge about the topics covered in both arms, such as prenatal screening and Down syndrome. Thus, the intervention arm (the SDM training program) did distinguish itself from transmitting knowledge about SDM. In addition, the intervention group found their course more acceptable and had a more positive reaction to its pedagogical approach than did the control group. This can be explained in part by the speakers, as participants in the control group expressed difficulties in understanding the speaker in their course. The course format may also have made a difference. The SDM course included a DA and a simulation video, which, especially in the context of web-based pedagogy and regardless of its content, may have been a more acceptable and effective format than the control course [37] .",

Indeed, in their written comments, nurses mentioned that organizational barriers prevented them from using DAs in their clinical setting, regardless of their intention, and that they had little time to share decisions with their patients given the speed of lead up to prenatal screening procedures. Another organizational barrier that could defeat nurses' best intentions may be related to the role they are assigned in interprofessional teams or their ability to collaborate with other professionals to ensure that SDM occurs [28] . The organizational environment and care pathways need to be adapted so that pregnant women and nurses can engage fully in SDM, which is already a good fit with nurses' role in the health care system.",

Nevertheless, the study was controlled and allowed us to compare the intervention and control groups. Second, nurses who agreed to participate in this trial may not be representative of all nurses involved in prenatal care in Quebec because of our web-based recruitment methods. For example, in this study, there was only 1 nurse practitioner who had a different scope of practice than other nurses. In addition, our findings may not be generalizable to nurses' engagement in SDM in other areas of their practice, such as disease management. Prenatal care does not usually involve disease management, as pregnancy itself is not an illness. Third, these results cannot be generalized to other health professionals involved in prenatal care in Quebec, as studies show that each approaches the topic of SDM in a different way [16, 53] . Training nurses using an interprofessional approach to SDM might encourage interprofessional interaction and information exchange about SDM [28] .
