            "text": "Since understanding molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely important for developing effective therapies against COVID-19, we focused on the internalization mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 via ACE2. Although cigarette smoke is generally believed to be harmful to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments were surprisingly found to suppress the expression of ACE2 in HepG2 cells. We thus tried to clarify the mechanism of CSE effects on expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells. Because RNA-seq analysis suggested that suppressive effects on ACE2 might be inversely correlated with induction of the genes regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the AHR agonists 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) and omeprazole (OMP) were tested to assess whether those treatments affected ACE2 expression. Both FICZ and OMP clearly suppressed ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner along with inducing CYP1A1. Knock-down experiments indicated a reduction of ACE2 by FICZ treatment in an AHR-dependent manner. Finally, treatments of AHR agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero E6 cells as determined with immunoblotting analyses detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid protein. We here demonstrate that treatment with AHR agonists, including CSE, FICZ, and OMP, decreases expression of ACE2 via AHR activation, resulting in suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is rapidly and continuously spreading all over the world [World Health Organization (WHO)/Coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2 induced disease: COVID-19) pandemic] (WHO website). Many epidemiological studies have suggested that smoking habits have serious effects on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Vardavas et al., 2020; Berlin et al., 2020; Guo, 2020; Kashyap, 2020) . Expression of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was also reported to be higher in smoking mice and humans, suggesting that smokers may be at a higher risk of infection (Smith et al., 2020) . On the other hand, several reports suggested fewer smokers among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or lower numbers of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases among smokers than among non-smokers Miyara et al, 2020; Lusignan et al,2020; Williamson et al., 2020) . Therefore, the impact of smoking on SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear. Cigarette smoke contains a variety of compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrosamines, and cellular responses to cigarette smoke exposure are thus diverse (Zhang et al., 2012; AlQasrawi et al., 2020) . PAHs bind to and activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR, which is an intracellular receptor type transcription factor), and induce various cellular physiological and pathological responses through the regulation of gene expression (Hankinson, 1995; Moorthy et al., 2015) . AHR is also activated by a broad variety of exogenous and endogenous small molecular weight compounds, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 3,3',4,4',5-pentac hlorobiphenyl-126 (PCB126), 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ), and omeprazole, and their physiological and pathological significance, especially in regard to the immune system, have received much attention (Denison et al., 2003; Guti\u00e9rrez-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2018; Rothhammer et al., 2019) .",

Results demonstrated that ACE2 expression level varied among the cell lines, and HSC2 (oral cavity origin), PC9 (lung origin), and HepG2 (liver origin), which had the highest levels of ACE2 expression, were used in the first experiment. The cells were treated with various doses of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 24 hours, after which expression level of cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1) gene, which is known to be CSE-inducible, was evaluated with qRT-PCR. As expected, CSE treatment induced expression of CYP1A1 in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1a ). CSE treatment also induced expression of CYP1A1 in PC9 cells, but expression was only slightly increased in HSC2 cells (Supplementary File 1b) . Interestingly, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced in CSEtreated HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and was slightly reduced in PC9 and HSC2 cells (Figure 1b and Supplementary File 1c).",

Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that signals regulated by FICZ and OMP were relatively more similar than they were with those regulated by CSE, but the transcriptome of FICZ differed from that of OMP, as judged from the PCA result (Figure 2b , c). The RNA-seq data suggested that the CYP1A1 gene was strongly induced in HepG2 cells with FICZ and OMP treatments, but expression of the ACE2 gene was clearly inhibited Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that commonly regulated genes were related to metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, which is known to be regulated by an AHR signal ( Figure 2f , g, j, and k). Interestingly, an RNA-seq dataset composed of SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments (Coronasacape: a customized version of Metascape bioinformatic platform that provides a central clearinghouse for scientists to laser focus their OMICS analysis and data-mining efforts) suggested that the commonly regulated genes noted here overlapped with the genes modified after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2h , l).",

ACE2 expression was significantly decreased in CSE-treated HepG2 cells, whereas CYP1A1 expression was induced. ACE2 expression was slightly decreased in PC9 and HSC2 cells, in which CYP1A1 expression was slightly increased. These results suggest that ACE2 reduction is inversely correlated with induction of one of the wellknown AHR target genes, CYP1A1, although treatment optimization is necessary in each cell line. RNA-seq analysis of CSE treated HepG2 cells also demonstrated that CSE treatment modified a variety of intracellular signals that are regulated by the transcription factors PPAR, AHR, HNF1A, and GATA4 (Figure 1c -f). Furthermore, treatment with FICZ or OMP modified many important signals, such as response to wounding, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, the matrisome, and leukocyte differentiation, which were strongly suggested to be regulated by AHR (Supplementary File 2). As expected, treatment with FICZ (a tryptophan metabolite) or OMP (a proton pump inhibitor) effectively induced CYP1A1 expression in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, both AHR agonists clearly reduced ACE2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, knockdown experiments of AHR confirmed that reduction of ACE2 with FICZ treatment was dependent on AHR, although details of the molecular mechanism are as yet undetermined.",

One is that AHR suppresses thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) gene expression via phosphorylation of p300 by Protein Kinase C (PKC) \u03b4, resulting in decreases in acetylation and DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB (Jeong et al., 2019) . Another is decreased expression of the AP-1 family member Junb, which was substantially upregulated in the inflamed skin of Ahr-deficient mice (Di Meglio et al., 2014) . Finally, AHR was further demonstrated to form a complex with Stat1 and NF-\u03baB in macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), resulting in inhibition of promoter activity of the IL6 gene (Kimura et al., 2009) . Since Genome Browser notes that ChIP-seq datasets in ENCODE actually indicate p300 and JUN binding on the human ACE2 gene, ACE2 downregulation by AHR agonist treatments might occur via functional interactions between AHR and those transcription factors. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis in the present study revealed that treatment with several AHR agonists downregulated some GATA4-regulated genes in HepG2 cells, so crosstalk between AHR and GATA4 might also be a possible mechanism of ACE2 regulation (Supplementary File 2g).",

FICZ seemed to affect ACE2 expression early and suppression by FICZ was quickly reduced, but the effect of OMP seemed to be more gradual and suppression by OMP remained up to 72 hours. This may be because of different activities and kinetics of their metabolism. Several other tryptophan metabolites, indole 3-carbinol (I3C), indoleacetic acid (IAA), tryptamine (TA), and L-kynurenine (KYN), and proton pump inhibitors, rabeprazole sodium (RBP), lansoprazole (LSP), and tenatoprazole (TNP), were also tested as to whether they regulate ACE2 expression; it was demonstrated that most of them decreased expression of ACE2 with a variety of actions and increased expression of CYP1A1 ( Supplementary File 3a, b) . Similar differences were also observed among cell lines tested here (Figure 1 ). Optimization of each compound will be necessary in the next steps (in vivo experiments and clinical studies), although most of the tryptophan metabolites and proton pump inhibitors seem to be safely applicable to clinical therapeutic research. One limitation of this strategy might be that these drugs do not target the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself but just modify cellular susceptibility to it. Combination therapies of AHR agonists with anti-virus drugs, such as favipiravir or remdesivir, are therefore possible strategies for clinical application.",

Treatment with 100 nM of FICZ increased CYP1A1 expression to a maximum at 24 hours, after which it decreased up to 72 hours, whereas ACE2 expression was suppressed to the greatest extent at 24 hours followed by a return to the original expression level at 72 hours(Figure 3h, i). Treatment with 100 \u03bcM OMP produced delayed responses in comparison with FICZ, the highest CYP1A1 induction and greatest ACE2 suppression being at 48 hours(Figure 3h, i).
