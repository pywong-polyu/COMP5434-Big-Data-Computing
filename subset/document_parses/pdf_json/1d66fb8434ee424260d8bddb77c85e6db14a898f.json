Here, we developed and piloted Serosurveillance for Continuous, ActionabLe Epidemiologic Intelligence of Transmission (SCALE-IT), a platform through which we systematically tested remnant samples from routine blood draws in two major hospital networks in San Francisco for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the early months of the pandemic. Importantly, SCALE-IT allows for algorithmic sample selection and rich data on covariates by leveraging electronic health record data. We estimated overall seroprevalence at 4.2%, corresponding to a case ascertainment rate of only 4.9%, and identified important heterogeneities by neighborhood, homelessness status, and race/ethnicity. Neighborhood seroprevalence estimates from SCALE-IT were comparable to local community-based surveys, while providing results encompassing the entire city that have been previously unavailable. Leveraging this hybrid serosurveillance approach has strong potential for application beyond this local context and for diseases other than SARS-CoV-2.",

Serological data, particularly when collected at high spatial and temporal resolutions, are a key resource for addressing many key epidemiological questions since they directly quantify the proportion of the population that has been infected by a pathogen 1, 2 . For SARS-CoV-2, serology is particularly useful given the high levels of disease under-ascertainment: serologic surveillance is the gold standard for estimating attack rates (the proportion of the population that has been infected) and highly complementary to virologic and syndromic surveillance systems for providing vital information on where a population is along the epidemic curve 3 . Population-based serosurveys that employ a probabilistic sampling frame are considered to be the gold standard for estimating seroprevalence. However, performing large population-based serosurveys can be prohibitively resourceintensive to initiate swiftly or perform repeatedly, especially during an ongoing outbreak, as demonstrated by the relative sparsity of population-based versus convenience sampled serosurveys for SARS-CoV-2 that have been conducted to date 3 . For example, to date, no population-based serosurveys have been conducted for the city of San Francisco or wider Bay Area, and few have been conducted in the United States, limiting our ability to identify of risk factors for infection, understand populationlevel immunity, and determine which populations and localities may be in need of targeted public health resources such as testing, contact tracing, or vaccine allocation 4 .",

Such studies were found to be useful in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , facilitating analyses on a broader spatial and temporal scale than typical cross-sectional serological surveys allow.

Relative to many other US cities, few cases were detected in San Francisco during the early months of the epidemic, a pattern which continued as the pandemic progressed 15 . However, like many other areas, a high proportion of asymptomatic infections and limited access to diagnostic testing during this time makes it difficult to interpret these numbers. Results from an early San Francisco seroprevalence study conducted on convenience samples in late March to early April 2020 suggested that <1% of the population had been infected overall 16 , in contrast to a seroprevalence of >6% estimated by a community study focusing on a specific neighborhood, particularly among the Hispanic/Latinx population 17 but consistent with a survey of a rural Bay Area community 18 .

Although several other neighborhoods had similarly high seroprevalences, there was much more uncertainty around these estimates (Fig. 4b) .

First, we compared these results to a cross-sectional serosurvey carried out in a census tract within the Mission District (census tract 022901, zip code 94110) between April 25 and April 28, 2020 17 . Chamie et al. tested 2545 census tract residents for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and estimated seroprevalence to be 3.1% (95% CI: 2.5-3.9%). This is consistent with our findings of 3.8% seroprevalence (95% CrI: 1.8-6.3%) between April and June 2020 in the broader Mission District neighborhood. Second, we compared our results to a cross-sectional serosurvey carried out in two census tracts in San Francisco's 10th District between May 30 and June 2, 2020 (https://unitedinhealth.org/sf-district-10), located in the Bayview neighborhood. Among the nearly 1600 individuals tested for antibodies, seroprevalence was estimated at 5.6% in Hispanic participants (n = 320), 2.3% in Black participants (N = 397) and 0.4% in white participants (n = 231). The relatively high seroprevalence we detected in the Bayview neighborhood through our study is comparable to the results of this community-based study, and the disparities by race/ethnicity were similar in direction, though different in magnitude, to those identified through our remnant sample study as well. It is worth noting that the community studies available for comparison also rely upon convenience sampling as participation in the studies was voluntary, and therefore may contain inherent selection biases themselves.",

Through this effort, we estimated seroprevalence during the early months of the epidemic to be relatively low throughout San Francisco (4.2%), but still representing more than 20 times the number of infections identified by PCR-confirmed cases at that time. This may be due to the limited availability of PCR testing during the beginning of the pandemic, and the lack of testing of asymptomatic individuals. We also identified important disparities in seroprevalence at the neighborhood level, with the highest seroprevalence in the Bayview neighborhood in the southeast region of the city, as well as disproportionately higher seroprevalence in individuals experiencing homelessness and those identifying as Hispanic, Black/African American, or male. Leveraging this hybrid serosurveillance approach has potential for broad application beyond this local context and for diseases other than SARS-CoV-2.",

Specific to San Francisco, our results provide estimates of SARS-CoV-2 cumulative exposure at a granular spatial resolution with a scope covering the entire city; despite low overall seroprevalence, we identified specific neighborhoods with disproportionately higher seroprevalence. Interestingly, we also found seroprevalence to be approximately twice as high in those identifying as male compared to female. Potential explanations for this difference include differential pathogen exposure by sex, which is supported by findings of other studies elsewhere 14 PCR positivity in males, and also that the majority (74%,) of those who tested positive by PCR or were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 were frontline workers and unable to shelter-in-place 17 . It has been found that males and females mount different immune responses and infection severity 21 , which could affect assay sensitivity, however, we believe this is unlikely to explain the large difference we see in our estimates as we do not see sex-based differences in the sensitivity of our assay on the positive controls used in the study, which represent a range of disease severities. While a key strength of our approach was leveraging residual sera from two large health system networks and using data from EHRs to algorithmically select samples for inclusion, there are limitations to this type of surveillance that require consideration. Most obviously, patient samples may not be fully representative of the underlying population. This may be particularly true during \"shelter-in-place\" periods, when behavioral changes may affect the availability and characteristics of the patient population. These issues can ideally be mitigated by careful sample selection, as done here by focusing on a subset of outpatients, with the possibility of further refinement by inclusion of additional selection criteria (e.g., by restricting or weighting sampling to consider specific visit types or underlying conditions). Representativity of the serosurveillance system could also be enhanced by including a broader network of local health systems. We also recognize that the generalizability of our findings may differ by age groups, and is likely to be lower in children who were underrepresented in our sample set despite the stratified sampling framework. Additional study designs, such as school-based serosurveys, could be leveraged to augment these data to prospectively assess seroprevalence in specific age groups, possibly by using non-invasive, saliva-based antibody testing 22 . Despite including over 5000 samples, our study was not powered to detect differences between covariates or by time in a multiple regression framework, in part due to San Francisco's success in maintaining low transmission and thus low seroprevalence during this time period. Lastly, while we validated our estimates against results from available community-based studies, further validation would be ideal to assess validity of results and findings.",

This was particularly true for the Bayview/Sunnydale surveys where we estimate a seroprevalence of 8.1% (95% CrI: 4.6-12.3%) for Bayview/Hunter's point neighborhood, whilst a community survey in the census tract 231.02 which lies within the neighborhood, found a raw seroprevalence estimate of 24/784 (3.06%). This difference may be due to heterogeneity within the neighborhood, i.e., higher seroprevalences in other census tracts not sampled in the community survey, or differences in the underlying population sampled. There are also differences in the timing of sample collection; we collected samples up until the end of June 2020, whereas this study was conducted between May 30 and June 2, 2020. In addition, the difference could be caused by our study sampling individuals more at risk of exposure than the community surveys. It is also interesting to compare our results to other serosurveys, which sampled the wider San Francisco Bay Area during the early months of the pandemic. A serosurvey across the wider San Francisco Bay Area found a seroreactivity 0.1% in 1000 blood donors, and 0.26% in 387 hospitalized patients admitted for non-respiratory indications in early April 2020 23 . An additional study of residual sera in the San Francisco Bay area between 23 and 27 April found a seroprevalence of 1.0% 14 . These results are quite a bit lower than our estimate for April of 4.6% (2.7-6.3%), but not directly comparable as the source populations drawn for these studies are not fully characterized and are unlikely to be representative of the San Francisco population. In addition, samples in both studies included residents from outside of San Francisco county, including counties known to have experienced very low transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during this time period.",

This could also be explained by a lack of power to detect small changes at such low seroprevalence. If implemented in a context where there was more power to detect changes and/or stratify by additional demographic variables when selecting samples, then our approach could provide valuable data to explore additional questions of public health interest, such as the impact of interventions and changes in ascertainment rates over time.",

Using EHR data, we were able to develop a stratified sampling frame, ensuring improved representativeness of the results in contrast to serosurveys performed using convenience samples without these key pieces of information 14 . At the same time, we used these data to identify important spatial and demographic heterogeneities in seroprevalence within our study site; serosurveys performed on residual samples are often limited to coarser levels of meta-data on the sampled population 24 .

Second, as serosurveillance efforts will be fundamental to monitor SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and evaluate the impact of control interventions (both Non Pharmaceutical Interventions and pharmaceuticals) over the coming months and years, future work could leverage these and prospective serological data to parametrize mechanistic models and to study the effects of control strategies on infection rate. Third, as discussed by others 1,2 , our local SCALE-IT platform could easily be expanded to contribute to a 'Global Immunological Observatory' to perform serosurveillance for other pathogens beyond the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Data generated by such an observatory could be used to address specific public health gaps including serosurveillance for seasonal pathogens such as influenza or emerging infections.
