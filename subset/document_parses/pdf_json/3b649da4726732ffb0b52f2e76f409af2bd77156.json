            "text": "The sex discordance in COVID-19 outcomes has been widely recognized, with males generally faring worse than females and a potential link to sex steroids. A plausible mechanism is androgen-induced expression of TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 in pulmonary tissues that may increase susceptibility or severity in males. This hypothesis is the subject of several clinical trials of anti-androgen therapies around the world. Here, we investigated the sex-associated TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human and mouse lungs and interrogated the possibility of pharmacologic modification of their expression with anti-androgens. We found no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 expression in the lungs of males compared to females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide did not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2. On the other hand, ACE2 and AR expression was sexually dimorphic and higher in males than females. ACE2 was moderately suppressible with enzalutamide therapy. Our work suggests that sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes attributable to viral entry are independent of TMPRSS2. Modest changes in ACE2 could account for some of the sex discordance.",

Indeed, both mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 were strongly induced by the synthetic androgen R1881 and suppressed by Enz-mediated AR blockade ( Fig. 1A and 1B) . Moreover, ChIP-seq analysis of AR cistrome revealed multiple AR-binding sites upstream of the ACE2 region that were lost upon Enz treatment (Fig. 1C) .",

The lungs of male mice, however, expressed significantly higher amounts of AR protein compared with females (Fig. 4D) . As mentioned previously, this may be due to AR stabilizing effects of abundant circulating androgens in males. Similar to AR, ACE2 expression also showed clear sexual dimorphism, with males expressing substantially higher levels of protein (Fig. 4D ) and modestly but significantly higher amounts of mRNA (Fig. 4B) in bulk lungs compared with females. Treatment with Enz lowered the transcript levels in males down to female levels ( Fig. 4B) and also partially reduced protein quantities (Fig. 4D) as evidenced by immunoblotting. The modest Enz-mediated suppression of ACE2 was not clearly captured in our IHC analyses. This could be explained by possible marginal changes of ACE2 within pulmonary cells that may fall below the IHC detection limit, however, accumulatively can be observed through total protein detection methods performed on bulk tissue. Overall, these data indicate sex-discordant AR and ACE2 regulation, and a potential androgen-regulated mode of expression for pulmonary ACE2. Therefore, androgen-AR-mediated mechanisms could explain sex-specific differences in COVID-19 outcomes by TMPRSS2-independent mechanisms.",

Although the p-values range widely across different data sets, almost all show changes in a consistently increased direction for current smokers including multiple data sets with small p-values ( Fig. 5A and 5B) . Finally, for both TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5C) and ACE2 (Fig. 5D) , there was no correlation between smoking pack-years and mRNA expression in either current or former smokers, suggesting that the change does not build up over time but is instead a rapid process akin to a switch.",

Sex steroids (i.e., androgens and estrogens) are possible mediators of these biologic differences. For COVID-19, potential androgen-mediated biologic differences include 1) SARS-CoV2 cellular receptor regulation and 2) immune modulation (5, 13) . Our study addresses the first of these possibilities. In both humans and mice, AR protein is clearly more highly expressed in the lungs of males compared with females. Detection of AR protein in male compared with female lung might be surprising in the absence of a detectable difference in AR transcript. This might be explained by stabilization of AR protein in the presence of androgens, which is recognized to occur in prostatic tissues (19) . To our knowledge, there are no prior reports of this sexually dimorphic pulmonary AR expression. The specific presence of AR protein in male lungs raises the question of its transcriptional program -namely expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2.",

Our observations are in agreement with a new study that provides evidence for the absence of AR-binding and open chromatin state within the TMPRSS2 locus in lung as compared with prostate cells (26). We do find evidence for an increase in TMPRSS2 transcript but not protein expression with smoking.

Therefore, TMPRSS2 regulation in the lung appears to fundamentally differ from clear androgen-dependent regulation in prostatic tissues. In contrast, there is a sex discordance in AR and ACE2 expression in lungs of mice and humans. In humans, elevated ACE2 expression is apparent in the lungs of male smokers compared with female smokers. Pulmonary TMPRSS2 regulation appears not to account for the sex-discordance in COVID-19 clinical outcomes. In contrast, ACE2 expression is elevated in smokers and particularly in males. The magnitude of ACE2 suppression with enzalutamide in mouse is modest. The ultimate effects of antiandrogens on human pulmonary ACE2 expression and COVID-19 outcomes are not yet known. Smokers could partly mitigate their increased risk by quitting smoking.",

            "text": "Approximately 40-50 mg freshly frozen lung was added to soft tissue homogenizing CK14 tubes (Betin Technologies) with 200 ml RIPA buffer containing HALT protease and phosphate inhibitor cocktail. Lung tissues were then homogenized with a homogenizer (Minilys, Betin Technologies) three times (60 s each time) at the highest speed, with 5-10 minute intervals on ice to cool lysates. The lysates were then centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 x g and the supernatants were collected for immunoblot analysis with antibodies for TMPRSS2 (Abcam: ab92323 and Proteintech: 14437-1-AP), AR (EMD Millipore: PG-21 and Santa Cruz Biotechnology: N-20), PSA (Cell signaling: D6B1) and GAPDH (D16H11). Total RNA was harvested by homogenizing 25 mg lung tissue in 350 \u00b5l RLT buffer (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis were then carried out with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was conducted in triplicate in an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) using iTaq Fast SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad) with the following primer sets: Seq analysis was performed in LNCaP cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) or Enz 10 \u03bcM. Briefly, 106 cells were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde (reconstituted in 1X PBS) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by quenching with Glycine (final concentration 125 mM) and further incubation at room temperature for 5 min. Fixed cells were lysed in SDS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA), and sonicated at 4 degrees using Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode) for 20 cycles on high setting: 10\" on/10\" off. The lysates were then immunoprecipitated in ChIP Dilution Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1% Triton-X 100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl + PIC), using 3 \u03bcg chromatin, 10 \u03bcl of anti-AR (Millipore, EMD Millipore: PG-21), and 50 \u03bcl of blocked A/G beads. Recovered DNA was used to prepare libraries using the Illumina Nextera library prep method, subsequently sequenced on a NextSeq 500 and analyzed using the ChiLin analytical pipeline. Finally, genomic AR occupancy was visualized and compared using the Integrated Genome Viewer. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry staining was performed using the Discovery ULTRA automated stainer from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN). In brief, antigen retrieval was performed using a tris/borate/EDTA buffer (Discovery CC1, 06414575001; Roche), pH 8.0 to 8.5, at 95 o C for 32 minutes. For AR staining only, 64 minutes of antigen retrieval time was applied. The slides were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature with the following dilutions: TMPRSS2 (ab92323), 1:3000; TMPRSS2 (ab214462), 1:200; Androgen Receptor",
