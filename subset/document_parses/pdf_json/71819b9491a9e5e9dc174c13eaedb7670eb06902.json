Case Presentation: We describe the case of a 16-year-old female who presented with clinical symptoms suggestive of appendicitis and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) that revealed features concerning for appendicitis. After laparoscopic appendectomy, histopathology of the appendix demonstrated only mild serosal inflammation and was not consistent with acute appendicitis. Her overall clinical presentation was felt to be consistent with MIS-C and she subsequently improved with immunomodulatory and steroid treatment. Conclusions: We note that MIS-C can mimic acute appendicitis. This case highlights MIS-C as a cause of abdominal imaging with features concerning for appendicitis, and MIS-C should be considered in the differential for a patient with appendicitis-like symptoms and a positive COVID-19 IgG. Lab criteria, specifically low-normal white blood cell count and thrombocytopenia, appears to be of high relevance in differing MIS-C from acute appendicitis, even when appendix radiologically is dilated.",

The attending pediatric radiologist's review of the prior CT concluded that the imaging was consistent with acute appendicitis as there was dilation of the appendix, measuring 8 mm, mild appendiceal mucosal hyperenhancement and adjacent mesenteric fat stranding (Fig. 1 ). The patient's care was re-discussed with pediatric surgery and together the multidisciplinary team was unable to definitively rule out appendicitis as a concurrent pathology. While a diagnosis of MIS-C generally requires exclusion of other etiologies, it was felt that she could have appendicitis and MIS-C simultaneously. Empiric treatment for appendicitis was started with piperacillintazobactam. The surgical team reviewed the risks and benefits of non-operative management with continued antibiotics versus diagnostic laparoscopy and appendectomy. Surgical management was selected. Echocardiogram was obtained to assess for cardiac involvement and showed normal cardiac function and no dilation of the coronary arteries. She remained stable on the acute floor on hospital day two and therapy with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and aspirin were ordered for treatment of MIS-C. However, given the timing of when surgery could take her to the operating room, she underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and appendectomy first. She was found to have a grossly normal appendix with no inflammation to suggest appendicitis (Fig. 2) . As a surgeon's intra-operative \"eyeball\" assessment of appendicitis is not perfect and the risk of appendectomy while undergoing laparoscopy is low the decision was made to complete appendectomy. Histologic findings revealed only mild chronic serosal inflammation and edematous mesothelium; it did not show the transmural acute inflammation diagnostic of appendicitis. Piperacillintazobactam was discontinued and the patient was returned to the acute care floor for post-surgical monitoring and MIS-C treatment with IVIG infusion (2 g/kg) and aspirin (81 mg).",

A prior report described a case of MIS-C that mimicked appendicitis clinically and on ultrasound imaging, prompting IV antibiotics and surgery (open appendectomy and resection of an inflamed segment of ileum) before treatment with IVIG and steroids was initiated. Pathology did not show appendicitis but did show necrotic mesenteric lymphangitis and vasculitis. [13] A South African series described four children with appendicitis, confirmed by surgical findings, in the setting of SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR. MIS-C was diagnosed in three of these children after appendectomy. [14] Other case series have described appendicitis in the setting of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. [11, 12, 14] In addition, an increase in the rate of appendiceal perforation in children without SARS-CoV-2 infections has been found during the COVID-19 pandemic, presumably due to reluctance to present to the hospital for evaluation [15] . The hyperinflammatory state seen in COVID-19 and MIS-C may play a role in the pathogenesis of intestinal involvement. There is a similar known association with Kawasaki disease and gastrointestinal manifestations, including appendicitis. [16, 17] Others hypothesize the contributory role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that is expressed in the intestine, especially the terminal ileum, [18] allowing SARS-CoV-2 to invade gastrointestinal cells.
