The situation presented enormous challenges for many mathematics lecturers who had not delivered lectures or tutorials online before. This study looks closely at what a traditional (in-person) mathematics tutorial encompasses and examines learners' needs with respect to support within a remotely delivered module. The work focuses on how well various formats of remote support address the affordances of the traditional in-person tutorial. The range of support formats explored here includes live tutorials, written homework with feedback, group work via breakout rooms in Zoom, a discussion forum and instant formative feedback through Canvas quizzes and the e-assessment tool Numbas. The effectiveness of the different formats of remote support is assessed through examining student engagement and student and lecturer feedback. Six student cohorts, of levels ranging from first year to MSc level, across three different departments, taking either a mathematics or statistics module, participated in the study and were surveyed on their experience and future preferences. The work highlights some of the key issues surrounding remote support within mathematics modules and discusses the findings in the context of the implications for a lecturer and the factors to consider when deciding on a strategy for remote learning. The paper also analyses student interaction and notes the aspects of remote mathematics support that will have value beyond the pandemic.",

The subsequent move by all higher educational institutions to remote learning presented enormous challenges for many mathematics lecturers who had not delivered lectures or tutorials online before. It quickly became clear that the challenges experienced by mathematics educators worldwide were as new as they were universal. The steep learning curve of mastering new technologies for giving live lectures or producing pre-recorded videos in addition to the increased workload associated with the preparation and delivery of online materials took the entire focus and time of the lecturers. The general challenges associated with the overnight switch to online delivery are discussed further in several papers (Drumm & Jong, 2020; Gamage et al., 2020; Hodds, 2020; Lishchynska & Palmer, 2021) . In this study, we focus on the remote delivery of the traditional, in-person tutorial, a cornerstone of teaching mathematics and statistics at a higher level.",

At the start of the pandemic, the challenge of transitioning from in-person to online teaching gave lecturers little room to think of, let alone to deliver, a comprehensive form of support in lieu of traditional in-person tutorials. Yet, in mathematics, tutorials are an important and indispensable component of the learning process that involves close student-lecturer and studentstudent interactions. As the partial lockdown continued in Ireland, in September 2020, it became clear that both lecturers and students were facing a full semester of remote teaching and learning. At this point, appropriate mathematics supports, in lieu of in-person tutorials, had to be put in place in order to (a) motivate the student to do the practical work that is essential in learning mathematics; (b) let the student know they are not alone with their mathematics struggles; and (c) provide a solid, reliable mechanism for interacting with the lecturer on the module material to receive support and feedback.",

            "text": "In MTU, tutorials have been an integral part of in-service mathematics provision and an indispensable one for many of our students. Traditional tutorials in mathematics/statistics modules in MTU typically involved students having one timetabled hour a week where they worked on problems in small groups (max 20) with the lecturer helping them individually as needed. This level of in-person interaction has been an effective way of ensuring students did the work (attempted questions and practiced) and obtained tailored help and regular feedback. Notably, the in-person tutorials also gave the lecturer feedback on students' progress in a module, allowing them to gauge how students receive the new material, what topics and techniques they found the most challenging for understanding and application, as well as highlighting common misconceptions. This would in turn inform the content of lectures in terms of the points to clarify, reinforce or dispel. Equally important, the in-person tutorial also afforded an opportunity to address the 'invisible' issues and errors that the students might not have been aware of, for example, misconceptions, incorrect notation, missing steps in solutions, accumulation of errors that incidentally resulted in a correct final answer and similar. The other positive aspects of the traditional tutorial format were the all-important student-student interaction and peer instruction, the atmosphere in class being conducive to good concentration and productive work and the sense of security of help being available on the spot. On par with in-person lectures, traditional tutorials are also instrumental to creating the all-important sense of 'belonging' to the learning community by building relationships with the lecturer and peers. The authors' schematic dissection of a mathematics tutorial is shown in Fig. 1. ",

The question arose as to what is the meaning of a mathematics tutorial if the lecturer and the student are not in the same room? The needs of the student regarding the tutorials, and the mathematics support within a module, have also changed. A student co-author points out that 'the action of having to be self-disciplined and self-directed . . . made it just that much harder to commit to lectures' (Drumm & Jong, 2020, p. 2) , which for a mathematics module would result in a disconnect making the student less likely to avail of support options. Previously a student, who has missed a few lectures, could turn up at a tutorial hoping for some quick one-to-one tuition on the topic. The basis for this has disappeared with having all the lecture material recorded and available through online platforms (Canvas is adopted at MTU). Moreover, a student, who had otherwise relied on an opportunity to ask questions on the spot to help understand a topic or proceed (be prompted) with a practical exercise, has now lost that opportunity to some degree and may require more tailored help in some other format. With a lecturer not seeing their students' work on a regular basis, as would have been the case with in-person classes (tutorials or lectures), important feedback loops feeding into (a) one's teaching and (b) students' confidence in their workings are also broken. The latter issue also calls for rethinking of the (increased) role of formative feedback in a remote teaching setup.",

Crucially, several common errors and other inaccuracies in students' homework were noted at various times throughout the semester.

Students were able to ask questions using their microphones or by typing in the chat window.

The main intention was to get students to think about the topics and self-test, as well as bring their attention to common errors and misconceptions. Upon submission, Canvas quiz produces a student report that shows incorrect answers and provides feedback relevant to an incorrect choice. Feedback also included hints and references to the lecture material. All feedback was coded into the quiz by the lecturer.

While the humble in-person tutorial has been the staple of mathematics education since mediaeval times, suggesting its effectiveness proven and unquestionable, the research on this topic is rather modest (Jaworski, 2002) . In recent years, much of the emphasis in the literature was placed on measuring the effectiveness of mathematics support centres in higher educational settings (Dowling & Nolan, 2006; Gillard et al., 2011; Jacob & N\u00ed Fhloinn, 2018; Grove et al., 2020) . Though not exactly the same matter, in the remote format, some aspects of the offerings of support centres overlap with the potential offerings in online tutorial work and general mathematics support within a module. Hence, some of the metrics used for support centres also apply to remote tutorials. Typically, there are two types of metrics used: qualitative (students' and lecturers' perspectives) and quantitative (evidenced from ratings, attendance, performance and other quantifiable measures). In the current study, a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics was used. The focus was on gauging various aspects of student satisfaction and evaluation of available support as well as ranking of potential future approaches via an online survey. Another aspect of this study was to collect lecturers' observations and reflections on the different teaching approaches. ",

The survey questions were of three types: closed, open (with free text answer boxes available) and ranking. The questionnaire is provided in Appendix A and any further references to survey questions are labelled as per the questionnaire. The closed form and ranking questions were summarized using descriptive statistics and graphs calculated using the built in MS Forms summary tools and the statistical programming language R (R Core Team, 2020). The open questions were analysed and presented following the six stages of qualitative data analysis outlined by Wellington (2000) . Responses to open questions were classified into positive and negative categories, but since the number of free text responses was small (the maximum was 13 responses for Q2 across all cohorts), the positive and negative aspects were described rather than quantified. In addition to an overview of the positive and negative themes emerging from the student survey, representative excerpts of student responses are included to help the reader build a richer understanding of the feedback.",

Notably, while only three student cohorts were offered live tutorials and only one group availed of homework with feedback, respondents in all cohorts ranked these tutorial formats the highest. This points to the importance of the lecturer's availability to provide individual feedback to each student. Although no single cohort experienced both live tutorials and homework with feedback during this study, the availability of the instructor and regular feedback on written work are key features of learning mathematics at school so respondents are likely to understand the benefits of both formats.",

The on-screen nature of the statistical analyses undertaken by the PT cohort meant screen sharing was an effective way to share work and receive feedback. For the pen-and-paper work undertaken by Year 4, more structured tasks and further supports to enable students to share their work effectively might improve the learning opportunities provided by breakout rooms. It is worth noting that the top preference for remote mathematics support among some students who experienced breakout rooms was live tutorials with the opportunity to ask the lecturer questions rather than breakout rooms, which perhaps shows the value that students place on the lecturer's presence.",

The student proposes that 'an ideal strategy would be to combine the quizzes and graded checkpoints to make a graded checkpoint quiz, where after a lecture video, students had to complete an easy 20 multiple choice quiz (within 48-72 hours of the video being made available) to assess the learning outcomes of the video. The quizzes could then contribute to 1% of our grade, just to give it an incentive to be completed.'

The social interaction afforded by an in-person tutorial can also add to the enjoyment of learning, making it more likely that students will attend and interact with the lecturer (Bryson & Hand, 2007; Hardy & Bryson, 2016; Everingham et al., 2017) .",

Common study spaces are often a feature for home departments but for students participating in service mathematics courses, there is often no dedicated space to study mathematics with peers.

Despite all the efforts, 38.8% of respondents to Q4 found the remote mathematics support inferior in comparison to traditional in-person tutorials. Based on lecturers' observations, the following two important deficiencies in remote learning of mathematics were identified: (1) a lecturer being unable to see students' written work and students being unable to share their written work with each other and (2) the loss of close studentlecturer and student-student interactions that underpin relationship building and peer learning. The second deficiency has important implications for student engagement; 'feeling disconnected from the module' was the most frequently mentioned challenge to students' participation in remote support. Going back to class where we all belong is highly desirable for all parties involved.",

Though no single remote format is perfect in emulating or affording the same range of benefits as a traditional in-person tutorial, a combination of several approaches may provide workable and functioning support mechanisms within mathematics modules.
