Confirmed and likely working COVID-19 decedents were predominantly male (76.3%), Latino (68.7%), and foreign-born (59.6%), with high school or less education (67.9%); 7.8% were Black. The overall age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate was 30.0 per 100,000 workers (95% confidence interval [CI], 29.3-30.8). Workers in nine occupational groups had age-adjusted mortality rates higher than this overall rate, including those in farming (78.0; 95% CI, 68.7-88.2); material moving (77.8; 95% CI, 70.2-85.9); construction (62.4; 95% CI, 57.7-67.4); production (60.2; 95% CI, 55.7-65.0); and transportation (57.2; 95% CI, 52.2-62.5) occupations.

A study of deaths that occurred from March to November 2020 among Californians 18-65 years old found relative excess all-cause mortality in specific occupational sectors, suggesting differential impact of COVID-19 on California's workers [11] . However, the authors used the occupation listed on the death certificate, which assumed that working-age decedents had been actively engaged in employment around the time of death. This standard approach undoubtedly led to misclassification of some unemployed, retired, or otherwise not working decedents as working in a particular sector. Furthermore, this study included causes of death other than COVID-19. These definitions of exposure and outcome could obscure the association between occupation and COVID-19 fatality. Hence, methodologic improvements in the assessment between occupation and COVID-19 fatality are needed.",

To increase specificity, we focused on decedents who were working at the time of death and on laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 deaths.

This burden was unevenly distributed across the state's population, with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 decedents ages 18-64 years differing systematically in terms of age, sex, race/ ethnicity, country of birth, education level, and possession of a social security number. Among those COVID-19 decedents identified as confirmed or likely working at the time of infection, most were male, Latino, and foreign-born, with a high school education or less. The highest age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rates were in occupational groups in which work is typically carried out in person: farming, material moving, construction, production, transportation, installation, cleaning, and food service. Our finding of higher COVID-19 mortality for these occupational groups is consistent with prior studies among Californians and other populations. A study of excess all-cause mortality among Californians 18-65 years old during the first nine months of the pandemic found the highest relative and per capita excess mortality in food/agriculture, transportation/logistics, manufacturing, and facilities sectors [11] . Investigation of COVID-19 deaths among people 16-64 years old in Massachusetts from March through July 2020 also documented above-average mortality rates in the occupational groups we identified, except farming [17] . An occupational analysis of 2020 COVID-19 decedents aged 20-64 years in England and Wales found the highest mortality rates in those working in process plants, security, caring personal services, food service, and transportation [18] .",

Our findings reflect a growing body of literature documenting a disproportionate burden of severe and fatal COVID-19 cases among men and racial/ethnic minorities [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . It is important to note that the occupational disparities in COVID-19 fatalities that we found could not be attributed solely to differences in employment by sex or race/ethnicity. Within each demographic subset, there was a gradient of occupational risk, with remarkable consistency in terms of which occupational groups had higher mortality. One exception was the high mortality rate among Black decedents in arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations. These findings, coupled with the temporal consistencies in working status we observed, suggest specific occupational risks for California's workers and highlight the intersecting contributions of occupation and other socioeconomic factors to COVID-19 health inequities [26] [27] [28] .",

            "text": "In contrast to Massachusetts, England, and Wales [17, 18] , we did not find above-average COVID-19 mortality in healthcare occupations in California. In Massachusetts, healthcare support occupations had the highest age-adjusted mortality rate of all occupational groups at nearly three times the average [17] . In England and Wales, care workers, home carers, nursing auxiliaries and assistants, and nurses were among the occupations with the highest mortality rates [18] . In California, we found that male, Latino, Black, and, in some cases, Asian workers in healthcare occupations had mortality rates that were higher than the overall rates for these occupational groups, but healthcare occupations were not identified for prioritization by the Prevention Index. The reasons for these discrepancies are uncertain, but they could reflect differences in the time course of the pandemic and COVID-19 deaths. Massachusetts and the United Kingdom were impacted early, with peak numbers of daily deaths for 2020 occurring on days in April [29, 30] , whereas deaths peaked in California in December (Fig 2) . Given the improvements in understanding of disease transmission and access to personal protective equipment that occurred over the course of 2020 [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , California may have been better positioned to protect its healthcare workers during the state's later epidemic peak. In addition, the potential contribution of California's longstanding Aerosol Transmissible Diseases standard, which requires healthcare employers to have written safety plans, provide personal protective equipment including respirators for protection from novel pathogens (considered under the standard to be potentially airborne), and train employees on safety procedures, merits further inquiry [37] . A recent study found healthcare workers had the highest rate of COVID-19 related complaints to Cal/OSHA during 2020 despite their relatively low mortality, suggesting a high capacity to advocate for better protections that could prevent infection and death among this group [38] . In addition, compared to the occupational groups that we found to have higher mortality rates in California, healthcare workers in California may have benefited from fewer comorbidities and greater access to care once infected.",

            "text": "A unique strength of our study is the use of state employment records to confirm working status of COVID-19 decedents. Death certificates collect information about a decedent's \"usual\" occupation, but do not confirm that the decedent was employed at the time of death [39] . Yet the increase in specificity imparted by state employment records comes at a cost of decreased sensitivity, as many workers are excluded from official employment statistics [12] . In particular, we were concerned about the exclusion of workers in the underground economy, such as day laborers and independent contractors, who make up substantial proportions of some California industries and may be more vulnerable on account of socioeconomic disadvantages [40] [41] [42] . Thus, we included a \"likely working\" group of decedents who did not match to state employment records but for whom there was no documentation of not working status. Over 60% of the likely working decedents were foreign-born and nearly a third lacked a valid social security number, suggesting this group included undocumented immigrants who continued to work in person out of economic necessity [43] . Increased opportunities for exposure in the workplace, in crowded housing, and in other community settings; high rates of comorbidities; and limited access to care are all potential contributors to fatal outcomes among this group that merit further study. Notably, among the top 20 detailed occupations identified by the Prevention Index, the ratio of likely working to confirmed working decedents (2.5) exceeded the ratio for all 6,607 working decedents (1.7). Despite our use of state employment records to confirm employment, our analyses were not designed to assess a causal relationship between employment and COVID-19 infection and death. The COVID-19 deaths that we identified among working decedents may have resulted from transmission of infection in the workplace, at home, or elsewhere in the community. Yet, there is reason to think that work contributed to the high COVID-19 mortality rates in certain occupational groups. The occupations with highest mortality in California overlap with the critical infrastructure sectors that were exempted from that state's stay-at-home order [5] . These occupations tend to involve manual labor or in-person provision of services that cannot be done remotely, and many require proximity to others at work [44, 45] . Furthermore, inadequate access in the workplace to exposure controls including ventilation and personal protective equipment may be contributory. One study found strong correlations between worker complaints to federal and state OSHA that raise concerns about workplace conditions and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent COVID-19 cases and deaths [46] . Even the occupations that we generally associate with outdoor work, like agriculture and construction, can put workers into close contact within poorly ventilated spaces, such as in produce packing sheds, indoor construction sites, and vehicles. Furthermore, a study of agricultural workers found working outdoors and working in the fields to be risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, perhaps because a lower perceived risk of outdoor work affected behavior or practices [47] . Thus, the conditions of work in these high-mortality occupations may have created opportunities for workplace exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Workplace outbreaks provide further evidence. In Los Angeles County, nearly 60% of non-residential, non-healthcare workplace outbreaks that occurred through September 30, 2020 were in industrial sectors related to many of the occupations that we identified as having elevated mortality: manufacturing, retail trade, and transportation and warehousing [10] . In Toronto, Canada, a similar analysis through June 2020 found the majority (68%) of workplace outbreaks in manufacturing, agriculture, and transportation and warehousing [48] . In Europe, analysis of outbreak data from March through July 2020 revealed large numbers of clusters in the food packaging and processing sectors, in factories and manufacturing, and in office settings [49] .",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. Our definition of COVID-19 fatality required a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, COVID-19 decedents in California who did not undergo PCR testing were excluded, potentially underestimating the occupational burden of COVID-19 deaths. However, in light of the substantial increases in other causes of death in California in 2020 [50] , our use of a specific definition of COVID-19 fatality had advantages over analyses of all-cause mortality [11] . Further study of any differential impact of defining COVID-19 fatality using the COVID-19 ICD-10 code would be useful, although the comparability of our findings and those of the study of Massachusetts deaths that used ICD-10 is reassuring [17] . The working status of some decedents may have been misclassified, such as unemployed decedents classified as likely working. Despite this possible misclassification, matching to state employment records to confirm working status is, to our knowledge, unique among California mortality studies and represents an advance that can be applied to other occupational diseases in the future. Another limitation is that our use of \"usual occupation\" listed on the death certificate may have misclassified the occupation of some decedents who were working in a different occupation at the time of infection. In addition, we used ACS data from 2019, as 2020 data were not yet available. Pandemic-related changes in employment that occurred in California in 2020 may mean that denominators were overestimated [51] . As a result, we may have underestimated the COVID-19 mortality rates for some occupations. Finally, by focusing on working-age decedents, we did not address the potential burden of COVID-19 on workers 65 years of age and older. Nonetheless, given their lower participation in the labor force, our decision to exclude older decedents undoubtedly reduced misclassification among the likely working group.",

Given the likelihood that COVID-19 fatalities among working Californians included work-related cases, the occupations with elevated mortality rates should be prioritized by public health and regulatory authorities to ensure that non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as use of respiratory protection or face coverings, adequate ventilation, and surveillance testing, are implemented in the workplace [37, 52, 53] . These high-mortality occupations also should be highlighted in COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, as they represent populations at high risk of severe outcomes regardless of where transmission occurs. As we plan for future SARS-CoV-2 variants and other respiratory viral pandemics, the occupational burden of COVID-19 mortality in California needs to be considered when crafting policies to mitigate disease transmission, including early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions in high-mortality occupations, rapid deployment of wage replacement programs that would allow those at high risk of poor outcomes to avoid in-person work, and prioritization of workers in high-mortality occupations for testing and vaccination when available [46, 54] . More broadly, future pandemic responses must consider the concentration of historically disadvantaged racial/ethnic minorities, including undocumented immigrants, in high mortality occupations.",
