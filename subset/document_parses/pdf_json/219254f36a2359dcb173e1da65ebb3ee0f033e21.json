To highlight moments of resilience during a crisis while also attempting to operationalize rapid community innovation, vignettes were collated from faculty, staff, and students across our campus community. Unfortunately, the traditional social science literature (e.g. economics, management, community development) is scant on defining rapid, small-scale forms of community innovation, especially during times of crises. Other more emergent and critical fields regarding space such as tactical urbanism (e.g., Lydon and Garcia 2015; Mould 2014) and DIY urbanism (Douglas 2014) can be drawn upon to expand mainstream social science understandings of rapid innovation tied to community well-being. For now, this piece intends to start discussion on these matters in the local development and community well-being literature.",

Geneva demonstrates proportionally greater numbers of children living below the poverty line and households needing food assistance/ SNAP benefits compared to national U.S. figures (Talmage et al. 2020b ). Many local residents are also politically active, holding local protests and rallies even during the pandemic (e.g., post-George Floyd death by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota) (Buchiere 2017; Cutillo 2020) . Aside from dormant winter months, the area showcases food abundance with robust regional agricultural systems, including farm-to-table restaurants, farmers' markets, food/farm-stands, food pantries, community-supported agriculture, compost/growing cycle programs, alcoholic/nonalcoholic beverage enterprises, and university research stations. Finally, Geneva is home to approximately two hundred nonprofit entities (TaxExemptWorld 2020). While HWS is the fourth largest employer in Ontario County, it is only one of many social institutions that has responded to the substantial needs in the area during the pandemic. This commentary continues by supplying a collection of vignettes from individuals affiliated with CCESL (some who serve on SLAC). These vignettes are presented in no particular order, but they highlight various rapid community innovation that occurred at HWS and in/with Geneva to sustain or enhance community well-being during the pandemic. After the vignettes, comments are made about commonalties and unique variations to enhance local/community well-being.",

The website featured information and videos from community agencies and individuals. In particular, the website provided information regarding food distribution efforts and financial assistance opportunities. The website also allowed individuals to provide feedback about their pertinent local needs and issues. While individuals needed to be socially/physically distant, the website was aimed to bring people together virtually to share their experiences and address their needs. Also, the website provided socially distant in-person and virtual volunteering opportunities to the broader community. Finally, CCESL worked with ENTR 220 -Social Innovation at HWS to garner feedback to enhance the website and corresponding social media to promote user access (HWS 2020a).",

When classes are in traditional session, community partners welcome students to their organizations to collaborate on service-learning, community-based research, and internships. With the unfolding challenges precipitated by COVID-19 and students adjusting to off-campus and on-line learning, CCESL redistributed the time that would have been spent supporting Alternative Spring Break trips, tutoring programs, and the annual HWS Community Sale to ConnectGeneva.com. Through related weekly COVID-19 community task force meetings with social service providers and through co-managing ConnectGeneva.com, it became apparent to CCESL staff that Geneva community members did not have full zoom account privileges or a full familiarity of opportunities available to keep important conversations moving forward with the use of technology. CCESL staff thus hosted numerous advisory board meetings so that sessions would not expire at 40 min, taught partners Zoom tips and protocols, coorganized a bike collection for local youth, and helped facilitate a mask distribution effort in the local community. The collective impact initiative, known as Geneva 2030, also adjusted and created a YouTube channel of America Reads tutors who sought to engage students remotely. This initiative cultivated a list of virtual tutors to support summer learning and distributed a list of in-person and virtual summer programs available to K-12 students that honored NY state COVID-19 guidelines and regulations. This shift will hopefully bolster the value that HWS and CCESL place on being an active, invested, and engaged partner with the Geneva community whether students are physically present or not.",

After completing units on rubber cultivation in colonial Borneo and shrimp farming in Thailand, we prepared to transition into a discussion of the intimate relationship between rice cultivation and rituals in the lives of the Balinese. Before we could embark on our Bali unit, however, the way in which we would interact for the remainder of the semester abruptly shifted from in-person to remote teaching/learning due to the recent emergence of COVID-19, a novel coronavirus that would soon bring life as we knew it to a halt. As I prepared to teach about Bali in an asynchronous teaching/learning environment, I found myself taking refuge in the Balinese principle of Tri Hita Karana, which Fox (2011) describes as the three pathways for \"achiev[ing] well-being\" (p.x). The more I read about Tri Hita Karana, the more convinced I became that I needed to dedicate more class time to this idea, particularly in the context of a global pandemic that was \"chang[ing] what we do and how we do it\" (Phillips 2020, p. 107) in immeasurable ways.",

Others went on to document specific instances in which individuals united to protect and advance community well-being the face of a common enemy: COVID-19. For some, care-work involved neighbors pooling resources such as cleaning products and personal protective equipment (PPE) to redistribute scarce items to those in need. For others, examples of mutual assistance were best captured by local efforts to keep every member of their communities fed, whether through public schools offering free meals to their students and their families or by local businesses delivering prepared meals to those on the front lines of our collective battle with COVID-19. Regardless of the particular example they elected to showcase, each student's submission expressed a similar sentiment: A desire to see people put the well-being of their communities first from here on out. Thus, I am left wondering whether we might be on the cusp of a major shift in how we interact with one another.

The course instructor shared this information with the local community by posting a link to a Google spreadsheet in a Facebook group for parents in the local community, 1 sending it to teachers at a local elementary school and distributing it via email to faculty and staff in the college community. Several students in the course also shared the link with their own local communities (e.g., a mother who was an elementary school teacher, neighbors with young children). The students' contribution to the community did not stop there. The second assignment with implications for the well-being of the local community occurred during the portion of the course focused on emotional development. In a discussion post, students were asked to identify a children's book dealing with the topic of emotion, to briefly describe the specific emotions included in the book and the lessons conveyed in the story, and to make connections with course material. Once again, the books were consolidated onto a Google spreadsheet, 2 which categorized the books by type of emotion and included YouTube links to full-length versions of most of the books. The spreadsheet included books examining a wide spectrum of emotions including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, anxiety, empathy, compassion, and frustration. The course instructor shared the spreadsheet link with a local community reading organization called Geneva Reads (https://www.genevareads.org/) who, in partnership with the CCESL Office on campus, created a poster containing a brief description of the assignment and a link to the spreadsheet. In addition to being posted on the Geneva Reads Facebook page, the poster was shared through the various channels mentioned previously to serve as a resource for parents who were looking for books aimed at helping children cope with their emotions during this incredibly challenging time when local libraries were closed.",

Our second goal was to apply our learned theory to practice through the design and implementation of a local project in Geneva, NY. Within the literature of Creative Placemaking, we quickly found our focus in public art events and how they impacted the cultural, social, political, and economic well-being of communities. We were particularly inspired by planned events that were accessible to everyone and used the power of shared art-making and interactive storytelling to bring community members together in collaboration with local leadership. In addition to the ideas in Creative Placemaking, we also found inspiration in the work of two artists doing place-based work, Amanda Maciuba and Sarita Zaleha.",

Maciuba's work aims to show how human actions alongside uncontrollable factors of time and nature (including something like COVID-19) comingle to affect both what our landscape looks like and what our human agency is there (Maciuba n.d.) . The artist Sarita Zaleha similarly engages with local places, but more directly through community dialogue in on-site textile workshops with visitors at her exhibitions. For Zaleha, visitor-participant storytelling at the exhibition site is as important as the \"art,\" the textiles collaboratively produced (Zaleha n.d.) .

This commentary documents a number of ways teachers, students, and activists have adapted to COVID-19, but also have embraced the opportunity to innovate. Several have underscored how empathy and kindness can be bolstered amidst increased isolation or taking on the challenge to make one's work accessible and useful to those beyond one's immediate community; still others have highlighted transnational connections during a time when distances between local and global lives are digitally condensed. These are hopeful and perhaps enduring innovations that can be applied to a post-COVID-19 world, though all are dependent on the resiliency of our social institutions. It should not be a surprise that calls for racial justice have emerged during this period of enforced distancing. Greater social equity and access for all citizens will strengthen the institutions that knit us together. This commentary describes initiatives to overcome physical distance through pedagogical connection. All of the examples originate from an academic institution. Several of them express the intention to connect, support, and give voice to neighbors who are not affiliated with the college. While connections are being made, the town-gown divide between the campus and local community that often exists remains an ongoing challenge, despite the economic and social benefits noted at this commentary's outset (Maranto and Dean 2015) .",

Still, these various actors can and likely must act together to bolster community resilience and well-being. What if these efforts were better woven together from the outset? Where might communities be economically, socially, politically, or environmentally, among other domains? The pandemic and our community (campus and locality) have unearthed new strategies and partnerships to build upon even after COVID-19. Hopefully, others will be inspired to share their responses and act similarly (or uniquely, with their own creativity!) in the future.",
