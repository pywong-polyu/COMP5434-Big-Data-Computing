As we are currently experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not sufficiently leverage the rich toolset that risk management offers to prepare for and mitigate the resulting uncertainty. This article highlights four aspects of risk management, and their practical and theorical implications. They are: 1) Risk (in the narrower sense), where possible future outcomes can be captured through probability distributions. 2) A situation of uncertainty, where there is transparency regarding what is not known, but probability distributions are unknown, as well as causal relationships influencing the outcome in question. 3) A situation of ignorance, where there is no understanding that certain possible future developments are even relevant.

A definition following Knight (1921) understands risk as uncertainty that can be modelled and quantified monetarily: risk is uncertainty that can for example be expressed as a probability distribution. As such, risk can be effectively insured against, or be weight and traded off against other risks and opportunities. To what extent this category is truly relevant in managerial practice is debated (Aven, 2012 (Aven, , 2017 Ward & Chapman, 2003) , but it is firmly established in organizational practice. Examples include the already mentioned insurances, resource allocation, or the design and optimization of investment portfolios. The ISO 31000 standard (ISO, 2018) defines risk more broadly as the 'effect of uncertainties on objectives', generalizing from financial impacts to impacts on any type of stakeholder value (including, for example, well-being or reputation). This general definition and understanding of risk promotes professionalization of risk management practice (Olechowski, Oehmen, Seering, & Ben-Daya, 2016) and underpins many existing practitioner standards for risk management -from domains such as systems engineering (Incose, 2015) , to finance (Allen, 2012) , to supply chain management (de Oliveira, Marins, Rocha, & Salomon, 2017; Zsidisin & Ritchie, 2008) , to project management (PMI, 2019) and of course data analytics (Jaynes, Edwin, & Bretthorst, 2003) . Despite multiple established standards in the field, there remain considerable foundational challenges. Very simply, for example, consider situations with unclear or conflicting objectives-what are 'risks' under those circumstances (Aven, 2012) . It is an interesting paradox that risk management focusses on uncertainty and its potential impact, yet the prescriptions found in the risk management literature can be shrouded in uncertainty and hidden assumptions (Willumsen, Oehmen, Stingl, & Geraldi, 2019) . In practice, risk management ranges from gut-feeling-based risk matrices with illdefined (or undefined) evaluation scales for probability and impact (Cox Jr., 2009) , to highly sophisticated quantitative models (Allen, 2012; Jaynes et al., 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 65, "end": 76, "text": "(Aven, 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 77, "end": 90, "text": "(Aven, , 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 116, "end": 129, "text": "Knight (1921)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 493, "end": 504, "text": "(Aven, 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 505, "end": 518, "text": "(Aven, , 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 519, "end": 540, "text": "Ward & Chapman, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1077, "end": 1124, "text": "(Olechowski, Oehmen, Seering, & Ben-Daya, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1252, "text": "(Incose, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1279, "text": "(Allen, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1354, "text": "(de Oliveira, Marins, Rocha, & Salomon, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1380, "text": "Zsidisin & Ritchie, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1481, "text": "(Jaynes, Edwin, & Bretthorst, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1728, "text": "(Aven, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1991, "text": "(Willumsen, Oehmen, Stingl, & Geraldi, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2158, "text": "(Cox Jr., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2218, "text": "(Allen, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2219, "end": 2239, "text": "Jaynes et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Risk management: dealing with probabilities"}, {"text": "These foundational issues in risk management create challenges for practitioners.
