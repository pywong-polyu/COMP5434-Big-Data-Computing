Herold et al. collected the admission value and maximum of CRP and IL-6 before intubation. They found that the maximum of IL-6 and CRP value could be used as indexes to predict the need for mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients (10). Moreover, laboratory values during pre-partum and post-partum were analyzed to detect the changes of CRP during the pre-partum and post-partum. The results revealed an increased white blood cell (WBC) while decreased lymphocyte (LYMPH) but higher CRP value in COVID-19 confirmed pregnancy than normal pregnancy after partum (11). Researchers reported dynamic profile of WBC count, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count, etc. of 33 COVID-19 patients in different outcomes since symptom onset, but didn't study the changes of CRP (12). Similarly, the temporal changes in D-dimer, lymphocyte count, IL-6, serum ferritin, etc. of patients with different outcomes were reported by Zhou et al. from disease onset but didn't contain the changes of CRP (13). Therefore, there lack of systematic research on the changes of CRP with different initial time or during transformed period of severity classification and the relationship between CRP and the evolving illness in COVID-19 patients. In order to reveal the features of CRP during different periods, we included all confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 People's hospital, and analyzed all CRP results tested in outpatient and hospitalization.",
