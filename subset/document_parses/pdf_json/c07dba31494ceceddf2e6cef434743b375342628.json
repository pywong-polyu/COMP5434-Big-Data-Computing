The report identified a path to steer the domestic energy system toward net-zero emissions by 2050, while achieving India's sustainable economic development ambitions. To reach a net-zero emissions energy system by 2050, India will need to deploy clean energy technologies on a massive scale. It will require more and faster deployment of large-scale solar, wind, and hydro power -replacing coal -to power greater electrification across the country. It will also require the development of new fuels, such as liquid biofuels and biogas. In addition, carbon removals (from technology and nature) will likely be required to play an additional critical role. There have been recent studies also investigating the high penetration of renewable energy in the electricity system with low economic costs including reports by Deshmukh et al.

In this paper, we further investigate the potentially important changes in the costs and structure of India's energy system resulting from the application of renewable hydrogen.",

Surplus electricity can be used to produce hydrogen through water electrolysis. This hydrogen can be stored and made available subsequently to produce power when sources from sustainable generation, primarily wind and solar, are temporarily unable to keep up with demand. In addition to its application in the electricity sector, the analysis that follows suggests that green hydrogen can be employed to phase out the current fossil fuel derived demand for hydrogen in the industrial sector, with further opportunities to decarbonize hard-to-abate industries, with additional contributions to meet the demand for power in elements of the transportation sector. Specifically, hydrogen can be employed as a substitute for coal in the iron and steel industry as a heat source for various industrial applications and as fuel for long distance truck and bus transport.",

Hydrogen is produced primarily from either natural gas or coal, mainly natural gas in most regions of the world with an important contribution from coal in China. In India, hydrogen is used mainly in the oil refinery sector and in the production of nitrogen fertilizer. The annual hydrogen demand for these two sectors amounted to 4.36 megatons (Mt) in 2019 and is projected to grow to 137 Mt in 2050 considering future expansion. Hydrogen in India is produced mainly from natural gas and is classified consequently as gray rather than green. Production of 1 kg of gray hydrogen is associated with the emission of about 10 kg of CO 2 . The Indian government implemented a policy in 2015 to ensure uninterrupted supply of natural gas to urea manufacturing plants (Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, 2015) . The fertilizer industry, India's largest consumer of natural gas, was responsible for 12.9 Mt of natural gas consumption in 2018, accounting for 28% of total national consumption (Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, 2020). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) (International Energy Agency, 2019), the cost for gray hydrogen in India is about $1.8 kg \u00c01 . In what follows, we shall argue that a significant quantity of green hydrogen could be made available in India at costs competitive with current production from natural gas.",

The hydrogen in scenario 3 (S3_GH 2 P) is deployed in only the electricity sector, providing an opportunity to compensate for shortfalls that would arise otherwise in meeting the demand for power from what would amount otherwise to an intrinsically variable source. Scenario 4 (S4_GH 2 All) explores a more expansive application of green hydrogen, with deployment to facilitate decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors in both industry and transport, at the same time eliminating totally the current industrial dependence on gray hydrogen.

On the seasonal scale, requirements typically peak in summer, attributable both to the intrinsically higher demands for electricity in that season and amplified by increased requirements for air conditioning (AC). The demand pattern corresponds generally well with the physical potential for wind, which also peaks during summer responding to the higher wind conditions associated with the summer monsoon. In contrast, the analysis indicates a minimum in the potential for solar generated power in summer, reflecting a combination of iScience Article higher temperatures (which reduce the efficiency of solar panels) and cloudier conditions because of the monsoon. Given the pronounced diurnal variability in the solar and to a lesser extent the wind resource, it is clear that if renewables are to provide the dominant future source of electric power, important investments will be needed in storage and transmission facilities to address anticipated shortfalls in supplies of power particularly during evenings in summer. That being said, as indicated in Figures 1 and S1 , there are abundant potential resources for both solar and wind, which suggests that the combination can make a major contribution to India's future path to ultimate decarbonization. On the local level, there is significant overlap between zones of highest demand and regions of largest renewable potential, particularly in the South and West regions ( Figure S1 ). Production and storage of green hydrogen and all components of India's electricity system involving wind, solar, hydro, coal, gas, storage, and interregional transmission are optimally configured and operated to meet these spatially distributed and temporally defined demands for power and hydrogen. To meet the power demand on an hourly basis at the regional level, we explore these inputs further using our integrated renewable energy-hydrogen planning model.",

In iScience Article scenarios 2-4, wind (in the South and West) and solar (North and West) are both significant sources of electricity, consistent with the renewable resources available in these regions ( Figure S1 ). Under the hydrogen pathways (scenarios 3 and 4), the bulk of the electricity consumed in the East and Northeast is derived from other regions and used, in large part, for electrolysis. Notably, the overall electricity generated from wind is much larger relative to that from solar power, reflecting the larger capacity factors associated with the former (indicated also in Figure S2) . The diurnal and seasonal patterns for solar and wind power can have an important impact on hourly system operations throughout the year, particularly for the scenarios featuring large capacities of renewables. The 2050 hourly power balance for a typical day for each season is displayed for each of the selected scenarios in Figure 3 . In S1_Base, thermal power remains the predominant source of India's electricity in all seasons, with relatively minor contributions (8.7%) from wind and solar. Under S2_100%RP, wind and solar emerge as the predominant sources of electricity, with solar a significant contributor in the afternoons with wind playing a major role throughout the day, particularly in the evenings. However, with the adoption of these two intermittent sources of electricity without compatible storage options, large amounts of both wind and solar generated electricity are curtailed, most notably during the monsoon season when curtailment could account for more than 50% of the potential source. This underscores the importance for the integration of hydrogen technologies in scenarios 3 and 4, which allows for much of the curtailed electricity to be used for electrolysis of water rather than wasted (as seen in Figures 2C and 2D ). It is noted that hydrogen power is generated mainly in transitional seasons (spring and autumn) compensating for the shortage of renewable generation during morning and evening hours (as indicated by green bars in Figure 3C ). The national average annual renewable power curtailment rate is reduced from 35.7% under S2_100%RP to 7.3% and 3.3% in the scenarios which include hydrogen, S3_GH 2 P and S4_GH 2 All, respectively.",

Notably, hydrogen operates as a long term (seasonal) storage mechanism to increase the overall utilization rate of renewable power, while batteries can store energy only for more limited time intervals (as indicated by the SOC variation in Figure S3 versus Figure S4 ). Consequently, the utilization of battery systems improves significantly under S3_GH 2 P compared to that under S2_100%RP, the annual output per installed capacity (MWh) of battery in the two scenarios is 298 MWh and 89 MWh, respectively. Even though the annual output from hydrogen to power systems is relatively lower compared to the battery source ( Figure S5 ), it's vital for operational safety to have storage capable of supplying power for the longer term. Hydrogen to power systems once operated continuously in the model for more than two weeks during low renewable power periods. With the inclusion of green hydrogen to meet demand for the power sector (S3_GH 2 P), the national installed capacities for both solar and wind power are lowered significantly compared to the estimates in the 100% renewable power scenario (S2_100%RP). However, compared to the large amount of hydrogen consumed by industry and the transport sector (totaling 136.7 million metric tons iScience Article in 2050) under S4_GH 2 All, the amount of hydrogen (roughly 4 million metric tons) used for power generation is much less. Annual electricity consumption (excluding curtailment) increases from 8800 TWh under S2_100%RP to 9,578 TWh and 15,483 TWh under S3_GH 2 P and S4_GH 2 All, respectively. Larger installed capacities of renewables are required for a deep decarbonization pathway. This potential source for green hydrogen is used also to reduce system costs and emissions.",

The system costs for S1_Base are high -exceeding $500 billion -and are surpassed only by results obtained with the 100% renewable scenario. S2_100%RP is particularly costly as significant capacities for wind, solar and electricity storage are required in order to deal with intermittencies in the source of renewables. At lower levels of commitment to renewables (40%-80%), the annual costs associated with the generation mix are less than the costs identified for S1_Base, reflecting the fact that the levelized costs for wind and solar power are much lower than costs for fuel and operational expenses associated with thermal power ( Figure S6 ). Although the renewable power scenarios studied here can contribute to a reduction in emissions of CO 2 from the power sector, emissions from other sectors -particularly long-range transport and industrial uses -would remain unabated. The scenarios with hydrogen penetration (S3_GH 2 P and S4_GH 2 All) can reduce the overall system costs relative to S1_Base, with the ancillary benefit of significantly curtailing CO 2 emissions. Compared to S3_GH 2 P, the marginal cost of hydrogen supply for industry and transport in S4_GH 2 All is roughly 1.3 $ kg \u00c01 , representing a relatively low CO 2 abatement cost for the hard to abate sectors at about 5.1 $ ton \u00c01 (with an average value at 1.7 $ ton \u00c01 for all the sensitivity scenarios). Compared to S1_Base, a negative CO 2 abatement cost, \u00c05.3 $ ton \u00c01 , is realized under S4_GH 2 All. This suggests that absent a significant investment in green hydrogen, a 100% renewable power sector may be less economical.",

Compared to the moderate trend, these different scenarios consider G20% cost variations for renewables (including the wind and solar power systems, electricity storage and transmission), fossil fuels (including thermal power plant and fuel price) and hydrogen technologies (including electrolysis, hydrogen compression, delivery, storage, and power generation). We consider a scenario where the hourly capacity factors for wind power decrease by 10%, representing a lower availability of wind resource, consequently scaling down the national annual average capacity factor from 22.7% to 20.4%. With another scenario using the meteorological data for the year of 2020 to account for changes in both total output and tempo-spatial variability in wind resources, the iScience Article estimated national annual average capacity factor is roughly 7% lower than that of the base year. Accounting for potential high hydro and nuclear buildout in the future, we investigate another scenario which assumes that the capacities of hydro and nuclear power could expand to 73,445 MW and 16,880 MW respectively, following the scenario from Deshmukh et al. (2021). It is found that an expansion of hydro and nuclear power is likely to reduce the overall energy supply cost in 2050. As for hydrogen implementations -with the exception of the low fossil fuel cost scenario -the national expenses with hydrogen application for deep decarbonization (S4_GH2All) are always lower than that for fossil fuel dominated alternatives (S1_Base). Meanwhile, a 100% renewable power sector without the application of long-term storage (S2_100%RP) is the most expensive of all the sensitivity scenarios, indicating the importance of practical hydrogen applications in reducing electricity costs and associated emissions. Although wind variability of an alternative year is taken into account, the simulated results are consistent with that from other scenarios, which ensures the robustness of the main findings. Capacity breakdown is provided in Figure S7 reflecting also the economic competitiveness and optimal combination of the studied technologies.",

Taking iron and steel as an example, demand for iron and steel products involves mainly three components: residential and commercial buildings, household appliances, and vehicles in the transport sector. Thus, iron and steel demands in this study are aggregated in terms of requirements for buildings driven by population and GDP, household appliances driven by population and incomes, and demands for the transport sector driven by population and growth in GDP. The demands for iron and steel predicted in our study correspond to 222.5 Mt in 2030 rising to 364.6 Mt in 2050, consistent with data from the NITI and UNEP studies (National Institution for Transforming India, 2017; Vishwanathan et al., 2017) .

Finally, the daily demands are downscaled to hourly resolution according to representative daily demand profiles (Parker, 2003) . The total transportation electricity demand was allocated first to each region according to the current geographical distribution of registered vehicles (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, 2018a, 2018b), downscaled then to hourly demand ignoring potential variations in daily shares.

This database defines hourly wind speeds with a spatial resolution of 0.50 longitude by 0.67 latitude from 1980 to present. Wind speeds at 100 m were extrapolated from data at 10 and 50 m using the vertical profile of the power law described by Archer and Jacobson (2005) . The friction coefficient in the analysis was evaluated using wind speeds represented at 10 and 50 m for each grid cell, as in Lu et al. (2013) . Onshore wind power was computed on an hourly basis using the power curve for the Goldwind 2.5 MW turbine (Table S9 ). The potential for offshore wind is small in India (given the relatively large depth of waters in the country's near shore coastal environment); so we chose in this study to exclude that option. The solar data used here were derived from NASA's GEOS-5 FP database (Lucchesi, 2013) , which identifies hourly temperatures and incident solar radiation at a spatial resolution of 0.25 latitude by 0.31 longitude. We employed an integrated solar PV assessment model in evaluating the performance of solar PV systems, following the approach described by Chen et al. (2019) . Capacity factors (CFs), defined by the ratio of electricity generated by a given technology relative to the realization of its full capacity over the same period, were evaluated on an hourly basis for both onshore wind and solar PV. The spatial variation of factors impacting solar CF were modeled consistently, accounting for tilt, packing density, sun shading, and temperature. Hourly solar power values were calculated assuming installation of fixed-tilt polysilicon PV modules with a 16.2% conversion efficiency.",

The area for each latitude/longitude grid cell was divided in this manner to compute the number of turbines that could fit maximally into a given cell. The potential installed capacity (in GW) was computed by multiplying the number of turbines in a cell by the turbine power (2.5 MW in this case). The solar power PV capacity potential (in GW) is defined by the packing factor obtained by multiplying the power per unit area of the PV panels (161.9 W m \u00c02 ) by the area available for their placement (factoring in solar filter constraints as described above). The spatialized packing factor here refers to the effective panel area per square meter of land area, which is determined by the solar PV tilt, azimuth angle (east-west orientation), and the spacing between neighboring PV panel footprints. The tilt setting assumed in the study follows the method proposed by Jacobson and Jadhav (2018), and the orientation of the panels was set to face the equator. The principle to determine the spacing between footprints is to ensure that minimal shading will occur for most of the sunlight hours throughout the year. The spacing was calculated using the solar altitude angle for 3 PM at the winter solstice, the day for which shading is likely to be most significant. Daily and hourly variations in the potential for wind and solar are indicated in Figure 1 for the national total and in Figure S1 for the five regions. While reanalysis data can overestimate the quality (and underestimate the variability) of the wind resource in parts of the world, we do note that the wind CFs used in our calculation are notably consistent with analysis conducted at the state-level by other India studies (Bhushan et al., 2014) . We do acknowledge that reanalysis data may not perfectly represent fluctuations in the wind quality; however, our additional scenarios should account for the model's sensitivity to lower wind output. Due to the computational demands associated with evaluating the optimal siting locations for renewables we calculate physical potentials for wind and solar at each of the five regions according to the spatial constraints indicated in Figure S2 . That is to say, for the regional CFs, we computed the average CF across the region, acknowledging that this may actually underestimate the wind and solar generation potential relative to the real-world values.",

We assume further that green hydrogen can be used as a feedstock for the production of ammonia and other chemicals and as a heat source in the manufacture of cement and other industrial commodities. We emphasize additionally the role it can play as an energy source for fuel cell vehicles and as an input for the production of (green) ammonia with applications for shipping and potentially also for other elements of India's future transportation system.",

At each time step, the power demand plus electrolyzer and compressor consumption equals the sum of the power outputs from all thermal units, hydropower and nuclear power plants, electricity storage systems, wind, solar and inter-regionally transmitted power. The hydrogen demand is equal to the sum of the hydrogen outputs from the electrolyzers and hydrogen storage:where J k defines the set of regions connected to region k. D t,k and H t;k denotes the power and hydrogen demand at time t for region k; p h t;k and p nu t;k represent the hydropower and nuclear power; h i t; k indicates the hydrogen consumed by the i th category of hydrogen turbines at time t for region k.The forecasting errors in energy demand R d and wind R w and solar R s output are considered in the following reserve constraints:The constraints of downward reserve are not considered in the model because wind and solar can provide the downward reserve by curtailing their power output in real time during contingency, and thus the downward reserve is not binding in day-ahead scheduling. The minimum load (over generation) problem is captured mainly by the minimum power output and ramping constraints in this formulation.To meet requirements for system reliability, the system invested capacity must be no less than the required capacity standard:where D max k is the required capacity to satisfy reliability standards; l w k , l s k , l h k and l es;z k denote the capacity credits for wind, solar, hydro power and electricity storage in region k.Constraints for renewable portfolio requirements are incorporated to set different levels of renewable penetration for the energy system:where G (40 % G % 80% in the second scenario of this study) is the required renewable percentage for the overall renewable portfolio target.The above optimization model minimizes the overall costs for power grid operation and capacity investment under a specified renewable penetration, as indicated in Equations (5), (6), and (7), constrained by Equations (1), (2), (3), and (4) associated with investment and operational decisions, unit commitment, The amortized investment cost a x and fixed O&M cost f x for technology x are computed using the following equations: ll OPEN ACCESS",
