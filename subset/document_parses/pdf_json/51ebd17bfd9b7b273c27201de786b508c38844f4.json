Identification of Nocardia at the species level is essential to assess the susceptibility and pathogenicity of antimicrobials. However, there is no suitable method for rapid and accurate laboratory detection of N. cyriacigeorgica. In this study, we combined PCR amplification with the CRISPR-Cas12a system to establish a novel detection platform, named CRISPR-PCR, and applied it to the detection of N. cyriacigeorgica in clinical samples. The Cas12a protein exhibited collateral cleavage activity following CRISPR RNA binding to specific targets, then indiscriminately cleaved nearby single-stranded DNA, and this was evaluated for diagnostic nucleic acid detection by measuring the fluorescence signal using a fluorescence reader. The assay takes only 2 h, including DNA extraction for 20 min, nucleic acid pre-amplification for 70 min, and fluorescence detection for 20 min. The limit of detection for N. cyriacigeorgica was 10 -3 ng and the specificity was 100%. Thus, the N. cyriacigeorgica CRISPR-PCR assay is a rapid and specific method for detecting N. cyriacigeorgica, and the CRISPR-PCR fluorescence detection platform has great potential for detection of other pathogens.",

The genome sequences of Nocardia species are highly similar (Conville et al., 2018) , hence biochemical identification methods are not adequate to allow discrimination among species. The gold standard for N. cyriacigeorgica identification is 16S rDNA sequencing, but this is time-consuming and it requires sophisticated equipment, which makes it challenging for routine laboratories (Barnaud et al., 2005; McTaggart et al., 2010) .

Briefly, 20 negative sputum specimens, which were shown to be free of N. cyriacigerogica by isolated culture, were divided into two equal parts; one part was used for preparation of positive sputum specimens, and the other served as a negative control. The 20 positive sputum specimens consisted of 900 mL of sputum and 100 mL of bacterial liquid, and equal volumes were added to 100 mL of phosphate-buffered saline as negative controls.

The results showed that F4 yielded significant fluorescence values, and we selected F4 as the forward primer. During screening of reverse primers R1 to R5, R3 performed best ( Figure S2B) . Thus, the optimal primer pair was F4+R3, and this pair was used in subsequent experiments. A PCR test at six gradient annealing temperatures (from 62\u00b0C to 67\u00b0C, at 1\u00b0C intervals) was performed to determine the optimal reaction conditions. PCR products were detected by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The results indicated that there was no non-specific amplification at 65\u00b0C, and the target band at 187 bp was bright ( Figure S2C) .

In addition, 16S rDNA is expensive and difficult to apply in routine laboratories. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-timeof-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is widely used in clinical practice. However, differences in the cell wall structure of Gram-positive bacteria leads to poor extraction of proteins from microbial cells, resulting in insufficient spectral information for accurate identification (Croxatto et al., 2012) .

Isothermal amplification methods are used to detect nucleic acids in combination with CRISPR-Cas techniques. Although the isothermal amplification efficiency is 10\u2212100 times that of PCR, it is easy to form an aerosol and cause false-positive results. Conventional PCR amplification is more stable than isothermal amplification, and has a wider range of clinical applications. Herein, we selected PCR as the nucleic acids amplification method in the first step, which has the advantages of affordability, reagent availability, and stable experimental results.

The rapid identification of Nocardia is helpful for early and rational use of antibiotics. Our CRISPR-PCR assay showed significant advantages compared with traditional detection methods based on growth characteristics, colony morphology, and biochemical reactions, which are time-consuming, laborious, and unable to achieve species-level identification. The CRISPR-PCR assay could directly detect nucleic acids extracted from clinical samples to rapidly and accurately identify N. cyriacigeorgica, and the entire process can be completed within 2 h. The LoD of the CRISPR-PCR assay was 10 4 CFU/mL for clinical sputum specimens, significantly better than 10 5 CFU/mL for isolated culture. The results showed that CRISPR-PCR enables rapid and sensitive detection of N. cyriacigeorgica and avoids the subjectivity of visual observation, hence the assay may be more suitable for the detection of N. cyriacigeorgica infection in clinical samples. Our previous work CRISPR-CPA and CRISPR-PCR were CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection combined with PCR preamplification. However, the detection strategies of the two methods were different. In CRISPR-CPA system, a Protospacer adjacent motif site (PAM) sequences TTTA and a protective base were added at the 5' end of forward primer, and the crRNA was designed at the downstream of the PAM site (Qiu et al., 2021) . Nevertheless, CRISPR-CPA may not be suitable to detect N. cyriacigeorgica, because the species-specific gene used in this study was not conserved enough, which was due to the high intraspecific variability of N. cyriacigeorgica. our CRISPR-PCR assay, TTTA sequence was not used as a recognition site for Cas12a to initiate CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection. We used non-canonical C-containing sequences as PAM sites to guide the Cas12a/crRNA complex to bind to the target sequence. According to previous studies, LbCas12a possessed extensive PAM sites and non-canonical Ccontaining sequences could be suboptimal PAM sites (Tran et al., 2021; Dronina et al., 2022) . The application of Cas12a to nucleic acid detection relies on trans-cleavage activity. The collateral cleavage activity of the CRISPR-Cas12a system is independent of target sequences cleavage and trans-cleavage activity is triggered upon binding of the Cas12a/crRNA complex to target sequences . Therefore, in this study, our system is sufficient to trigger trans-cleavage activity to detect the target.",
