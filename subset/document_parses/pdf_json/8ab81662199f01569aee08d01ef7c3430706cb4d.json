DWT decomposes an image into subbands with different coefficients: LL, HH, HL, and LH as shown in Fig. 1 . While the coefficient of subband LL is called approximation coefficients, the coefficients of subbands HH, HL, and LH are called detail coefficients. These coefficients have either noise or important signal features. Small coefficients are mostly caused by noise, while large coefficients are caused by important signal features. The wavelet thresholding algorithm filters only small coefficients in the HH, HL, and LH subbands using a threshold function. There are two types of thresholding procedures, soft-thresholding and hard-thresholding. The soft-thresholding procedure sets the wavelet coefficients less than or equal to threshold T to zero and shrinks the coefficients greater than threshold T toward zero by the threshold T. The difference between the soft and hard thresholding procedures is that the hard thresholding procedure keeps the wavelet coefficients greater than the threshold T. There are different shrinkage methods to determine the threshold T, VisuShrink [15] and BayesShrink [16] . VisuShrink provides a threshold value for an image, while BayesShrink provides a threshold value for each detail subband. After filtering the wavelet coefficients, inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) is used to obtain the filtered image.",

If the processing time is not important, when the functions with longer filter length shown in Fig. 3 are compared, the results obtained from the functions are very close to each other. Thus, we can conclude from Fig. 3 and Table 1 that sym or db function should be preferred to coif function to reduce the noise in CT image for COVID-19 disease. After the orthogonal functions, the biorthogonal functions are evaluated to find the proper wavelet function for CT imaging of COVID-19. These non-orthogonal functions are symmetric and use two different functions to analyze and to synthetize signals. The high noisy CT images employed for orthogonal functions are used to evaluate the biorthogonal functions. The biorthogonal functions used in this paper are bior1.1, bior1.3, bior1.5, bior2.2, bior2.4, bior2.6, bior2.8, bior3.1, bior3.3, bior3.5, bior3.9, bior4.4, bior5.5 and bior6.8.

The effect of choosing different wavelet functions each with its properties of orthogonality, filter order, and symmetry is investigated. The obtained results show: (i) the orthogonal functions have better performance than the biorthogonal functions, (ii) db and sym functions have similar results, (iii) the wavelet functions with higher filter length are more effective to de-noise very noisy CT images, (iv) the function db3 or sym3 gives better results than the function coif1 (the functions db3 and coif1 have equal filter length). Therefore, if the processing time is important, the function db or sym should be used instead of the function coif, (v) if the processing time is not important, the functions have similar results for the longer filter lengths. Thus, sym or db function can be preferred to coif function to reduce the noise in CT image for COVID-19 disease.",
