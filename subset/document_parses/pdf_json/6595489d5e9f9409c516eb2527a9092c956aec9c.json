At a virus density comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, an UV-C dose of just 3.7 mJ/cm 2 was sufficient to achieve a more than 3-log inactivation without any sign of viral replication. Moreover, a complete inactivation at all viral concentrations was observed with 16.9 mJ/cm 2 . These results could explain the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 and are important for the development of novel sterilizing methods to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus 1 has had an enormous, as yet barely understood, impact on health and economic outlook at the global level 2 . The identification of effective microbicide approaches is of paramount importance in order to limit further viral spread, as the virus can be transmitted via aerosol 3,4 and can survive for hours outside the body 5-7 . Non-contact disinfection technologies are highly desirable, and UV radiation, in particular UV-C (200-280 nm) has been suggested to be able to inactivate different viruses, including SARS-CoV 8-12 . The interaction of UV-C radiations with viruses has been extensively studied 13-15 , and direct absorption of the UV-C photon by the nucleic acid basis and/or capsid proteins leading to the generation of photoproducts that inactivate the virus was suggested to be one of the main UV-C-associated virucidal mechanisms 16, 17 . Some models have been proposed to correlate the nucleic acid structure with the required dose to inactivate the virus, but a reliable model is still unavailable 18 . This is also due to the fact that UV-C measurements were conducted using different viruses and diverse experimental conditions [19] [20] [21] [22] . This led to an extremely wide range of values for the same virus and, e.g., in the case of SARS-CoV-1 values reported in the literature range from a few mJ/cm 2 to hundreds mJ/cm 219, 22, 23 . Likewise, recent papers reported values for UVC inactivation ranging from 3 to 1000 mJ/cm . A better understanding of the effects of UV-C on SARS-CoV-2, which take into account all the key factors involved in the experimental setting (including culture medium, SARS-CoV-2 concentration, UV-C irradiance, time of exposure, and UV-C absorbance) will allow to replicate the results in other laboratory with different devices. Moreover, as recent evidences suggest that UV light from sunlight are efficient in inactivating the virus 28 , these measurements will be relevant for the setting up of further experiment considering the role of UV-A and UV-B on SARS-CoV-2 replication.",

After UV-C exposure, viral replication was assessed by culture-polymerase chain reaction (C-RT-PCR) targeting two regions (N1 and N2) of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene, as well as by analyzing SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect. Analyses were performed in the culture supernatant of infected cells at three different time points (24, 48 and 72 h for SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 1000 and 5; 24, 48 h and 6 days for SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.05), as well as on cell lysates at the end of cellular culture (72 h: MOI 1000 and 5; 6 days: MOI 0.05). This approach allows to follow the kinetic of viral growth and to verify whether the used dose is sufficient to completely inactivate the virus over time. This is useful from a practical point of view, when UV-C devices are used to disinfect surfaces and the environment. The effect of the UV-C exposure on SARS-CoV-2 replication was extremely evident and independent from the MOI employed; dose-response and time-dependent curves were observed. Figures 1, 2 and 3 report for different MOI the number of SARS-CoV-2 copies for the three concentrations as a function of the UV-C dose and time, quantified on a standard curve from a plasmid control. The corresponding normalised curves of the virus copies are reported in the same figures.",

Notably, a different course of infection was observed, in which the inhibitory effect was not accompanied by viral suppression for the UV-C dose of 3.7 mJ/cm 2 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ ( Fig. 4A ,B,D). Indeed, a relevant reduction in N1 e N2 copy numbers was observed in a UV-C dose-dependent manner as early as 24 h (by a factor of 10 3 at 3.7 mJ/cm 2 and 10 4 at 16.9 mJ/cm 2 , Fig. 4A ,B,D), but longer culture times resulted in an increase in N1 and N2 copy numbers for the UV-C dose of 3.7 mJ/cm 2 . This indicates that the residual viral input left by the 3.7 mJ/cm 2 was able to replicate and sufficient to generate an effective infection. This is not the case in cultures exposed to higher UV-C doses, as no replication could be detected in these conditions. All the results were further confirmed by 2-ANOVA statistical analyses performed on viral replication at intracellular level ( We compared our results with data available in the literature and observed that our inactivating dose is much smaller than that reported in Heilingloh et al. 26 (1000 mJ/cm 2 for the complete inactivation). This discrepancy is likely to be the consequence of the UV-C absorption by the medium used in Heilingloh et al., which has a fourfold higher thickness compared to the one used in our experiments. This possibility is supported by the observation that 200 mJ/cm 2 of UV-A, which is not absorbed by the medium, was sufficient to reduce viral replication of 1-log. As UV-A light is significantly less efficient (order of magnitudes) than UV-C, the reported UV-C inactivating dose (100 mJ/cm 2 ) seems to be questionable.",

It has to be underlined that in the dried film a shielding 28 , who demonstrated that the dose required to obtain a similar degree of viral inactivation was twice in dried samples from gMEM compared to the ones resuspended in simulated saliva. Notably, the two mediums differ for their composition, mainly in terms of protein and solid percentage, with higher values for the gMEM. Inagaki et al. used a 285 nm UV LED and showed that a dose of about 38 mJ/cm 2 was sufficient to completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2. This dose is greater compared to the one we established; this discrepancy can be explained by the observation that the 285 nm is less efficient than the 254 nm wavelength 24 . Finally, in an elegant study Storm et al. 27 compared the virucidal effect of UV-C in wet and dry systems. Results were based on the use of a very small volume of viral stock in DMEM (5 \u03bcl) and showed that a dose of 3.4 mJ/cm 2 inactivated wet samples, whereas a dose that twice as high was needed in dried samples. These results are comparable to the ones herein, and the shielding effect in dried samples is almost evident. Such comparisons show how the experimental conditions adopted significantly impact on the definition of the dose of UV-C resulting in virus inactivation. It is therefore crucial to accurately describe all the details of the experiments to perform a reliable comparison.",

Even at the highest viral input concentration (1000 MOI), viral replication was totally inactivated with a dose \u2265 16.9 mJ/cm 2.

UV-C-untreated virus served as positive controls. Cell cultures were incubated with the virus inoculum in duplicate for three hours at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Then, cells were rinsed three times with warm PBS, replenished with the appropriate growth medium and observed daily for cytopathic effect.
