It leads to 7.5 million annual deaths in children under 5 years of age. 1, 2 Previously, in 2012, sepsis was defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the presence of or as a result of suspected or proven infection by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. Infection could be bacterial, viral, or fungal. Culture and nonculture-based diagnostic methods might be helpful for identification of these pathogens. 3 Various viruses could cause sepsis, which are influenced by age and underlying immune status. [4] [5] [6] [7] Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) among infants can cause morbidity and mortality. 8 Limited data exist on their proportion in sepsis. Numerous cases of clinical deterioration sepsis remain without bacterial evidence. Thus, viruses may also be considered as causative pathogens. [4] [5] [6] Respiratory viruses are ubiquitous in the surroundings of the children and are the most common source of respiratory infection among healthy and immunocompromised individuals. Several respiratory viruses may also cause severe respiratory disease mainly in infants but also in children. These viruses are well known as influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses type 1 to 3 (PIV 1-3), adenovirus (AV), enteroviruses (EV), human rhinovirus (hRV), and human bocavirus (hBoV). 9, 10 Despite their clinical expansiveness, RVIs are usually not considered to be of clinical significance among septic patients. Influenza is one of the most common causes of viral sepsis in children with the highest rate of hospitalizations and the number of death. 11 The management of pediatric sepsis should be arranged according to the age, the immune capacity of child and severity, site, and the source of the infection. 1 Currently, there are few studies about the etiology of nosocomial or community-acquired sepsis in children. 12, 13 The aim of the current study was to evaluate the proportion of respiratory viral pathogens in infants under two years of age with possible sepsis.

Taking the detection rates of each RVIs, it is possible to conclude that infection by some viruses can lead to clinical findings of sepsis in infants. The results show that the identification of RVs in infants with sepsis is frequent and this is really important for several reasons such as respiratory isolation and specific therapeutics as in influenza infections. However, the study design does not allow inferring in a causal relationship since there is no control group without sepsis. It is possible that in some cases the identified viruses are not the cause of the symptoms. It is also possible that in the cases which received antibiotics before the collection of blood cultures, the cause of the infection might still be bacteria, even when in RVs detection. With a wide range of clinical findings in virus-related sepsis, cough has increased the risk of having a viral infection 4.1-fold in patients with sepsis in our study population. Kidszun et al showed that increasing episode of apnea, bradycardia, and respiratory deterioration were more common in neonates with detected of RVIs treated for possible of bacterial sepsis. 4 They emphasized that septic infants with the need for prolonged or increased respiratory support, RVIs should be kept in mind.

All patients who were included in this study had sepsis symptoms as defined by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign in 2012. 3 Information recorded includes clinical and demographic characteristics, medical history, complaints on admission, physical examination, laboratory findings, type of infection (bacteremia and pneumonia), duration of hospitalization, and prognosis. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 90 pediatric patients with sepsis aged between 1 and 24 months. The virology department of our hospital processes all clinical specimens from pediatric departments. Airway secretions were obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab and analyzed using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral pathogens within 72 hours of initiation of antibiotic therapy. Patients who died during the treatment were included in the assessment as infection-related mortality if the death had been caused by the infection. 14 All samples from infants aged between 1 and 24 months with suspected sepsis received at the microbiology laboratory and tested for respiratory virus infections during the study period were eligible for inclusion. Newborns, patients older than 24 months or without sepsis diagnosis were excluded. Samples that did not have test results, because of failure of PCR or insufficient sampling, were evaluated as a loss to follow-up. Blood was collected and inoculated into the BACTEC aerobic culture bottle (BD BACTEC blood culture system) before antibiotic administration in the first hour of patient evaluation. Urine culture was collected from all patients and cerebrospinal fluid culture was sent for patients who had any sign of meningitis. Community-acquired sepsis (CAS) was defined as the presence of positive blood culture and SIRS criteria before or within 48 hours of hospital admission. Hospital-acquired sepsis (HAS) was defined as new-onset sepsis after 2 days of hospital admission. 15 Empirical therapy was defined as therapy instituted before microbiological evidence of infection. Empirical therapy was switched according to susceptibility tests if the pathogen was resistant to empirical therapy. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hacettepe University (Number: GO 15/503-16). Informed consent was obtained from the parent or legal guardian of each participant. Specimens were received from inpatient infants having sepsis symptoms and analyzed by multiplex RT-PCR to detect viral pathogens. We tested samples for 15 viruses (influenza virus A-B, PIV 1-2-3, Human adenovirus, RSV A, RSV B, CoV, EV, hRV, hBoV, CoV 229/NL63, and CoV OC43/HKU1).

However, the application of sensitive PCR-based detection techniques immediately led to a dilemma about the prevalence of asymptomatic infection with RV.
