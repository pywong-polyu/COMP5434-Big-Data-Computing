The spectrum of pathology in COVID-19 is wide and ever increasing with a burgeoning number of case reports and case series published on a daily basis that provide some preliminary insights to the disease and its complications. However, it is certain that larger case series and population-based studies will follow, as is the usual pattern with novel diseases. In this month's journal club, and in a break from the normal format, we have attempted to provide an early snapshot of the current literature describing neurological manifestations of this novel disease in a very fast moving subject area, but in the certain knowledge that this will be superseded in due course by more comprehensive studies.",

Thirteen patients had thrombus detectable on imaging; 6 within the middle cerebral, 2 posterior cerebral, three vertebral/basilar and 1 internal carotid. A further case had multiple sites of thrombus. Of the remainder, four were consistent with large-vessel occlusions but the presence of thrombus was not explicitly stated; the remaining two were lacunar infarcts. Several of the reports note other thrombotic events; four patients had pulmonary emboli (three bilateral), one patient presented with myocardial infarction and ischemic limbs, while ischemic limbs and renal infarction were also noted in other cases. Of the 19 patients with ischemic stroke, four patients died, six were still supported on an intensive care unit (ICU), one remained on a stroke unit, two were at a stroke rehabilitation facility and five made a good recovery. Outcome in one case was not stated.",

In common with previous pandemics including Zika and SARS-CoV, stroke, GBS and meningoencephalitis are emerging as the commonest specific neurological complications but causality remains difficult to prove. Stroke in particular may have a plausible biological mechanism whilst GBS and meningoencephalitis have a compelling temporal relationship and are likely to represent parainfectious phenomenon. However, whether they are specific to COVID-19 or whether they simply represent the consequence of a burden of infection remains unclear. In addition cognitive impairment is also emerging as a common sequelae in COVID-19 patients discharged from ITU and we can expect an increase in referrals to memory clinics in the short to medium term. Only longer term epidemiological studies will clarify some of these issues and will need to be supported by research on the neurotropic nature of the virus and biological mechanisms.",
