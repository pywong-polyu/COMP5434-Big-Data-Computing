Regrettably, these tests are based on living beings with a response time of up to 6 weeks. In compliance with the Italian law decree of 17 March 2020 n. 18 (art. 15) , alternative in vitro tests for irritation and sensitisation effects were proposed in an effort to rapidly produce biocompatible FMs. On this regard, ISO TR 15499:2016 ( \u00a76.3 Device Testing Consideration, [4] ) recommends the adoption of a phased approach with the execution of an in vitro test first to reduce the use of in vivo assays, hence to limit the use of resources and animals. ISO TR 15499:2016 [4] has been completely incorporated into ISO 10993-1:2018 [3] both of which strongly encourage the use of scientific advances in understanding basic mechanisms in order to minimise the number and the exposition of test animals by giving preference to in vitro models and to chemical, morphological, and topographical characterisation testing, in situations where these methods yield equally relevant information to that obtained from in vivo models. Furthermore, as indicated in ISO 14971:2020 [5] , if health risks for the people in contact with the medical device are low by scientific evidence, then the devices do not require further mitigation measures.",

On the contrary, HDPE and Extract100 of tested CFM showed a viability of >70%, thus excluding their cytotoxic potential. As expected, the viability of Extract46.41 was found to be similar to or higher than Extract100, satisfying the acceptable criteria recommended by ISO10993-5:2009 [18] . Tested CFM1, CFM2, CFM3 revealed a similar trend in viability, confirming the reproducibility of the approach (Table 1) . Four hours of HFF stimulation using Extract100 on CFM1, CFM2 and CFM3 did not induce a nitrite secretion (value close to 0), and this was also observed in the negative control (p > 0.05). On the contrary, Triton X (as positive control) administration increased nitrite levels, confirming the irritant effect of the compound (Table 2) . Concomitantly, the product's inflammatory potential was assessed by the quantification of IL-6 secretion. As shown in Table 3 , we could not detect significant levels of IL-6 in CFM1, CFM2, or CFM3 compared with the negative control (p > 0.05). Instead, LPS drastically increased IL-6 secretion, as also reported in [20] . The RSD% of each value was, on average, less than 20% of the expected for biologic samples [21] . Table 3 . IL-6 levels in the supernatant of three single internal parts of CFM1, CFM2, and CFM3 after exposure to Extract100 for 24 h. Results shown are as average values \u00b1 RSD (%).

Therefore, the multi-test approach was validated using three different commercially available CE-marked FMs. As reported, each sample was tested in triplicate and in three different experiments.

These results guarantee the assessment of the safety for FM end-users, predicting the most common skin adverse events such as skin oedema and irritation. Most of the samples that failed the tests reported a high level of inflammation markers rather than cytotoxicity. In detail, the IL-6 test seems to be more sensitive than nitrite evaluation. The high number of analysed FMs allowed us to identify possible responsible factors of the increased concentrations in nitrite and IL-6. These included cleaning approaches applied during or after the manufacturing process to reduce bacterial burden, as recommended by EN14683:2019+AC:2019 [24] . In general, the addition of antibacterial or silver compound in the outside layer of the mask could partially contaminate the inner layer, which can potentially cause an irritation or sensitisation effect. Among others, several antibacterial chemicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, bleach, alcohol, soap solutions, ethylene oxide, ozone decontamination, and physical approaches, such as the use of heat with steam or with dry air, ultraviolet rays, gamma irradiation, or microwaves should be further investigated [25] . For example, although PP was extensively used as medical device components, it often showed irritation and sensitisation potential. We hypothesised that an altered extrusion process could induce many different chemical and physical surface properties, potentially causing the failure of the tests.",

In particular, most of these inflammatory assays are based on the use of murine macrophages and monocytes [12, 13] . The novelty of our approach, which significantly differs from those, is the introduction of human primary fibroblasts with a better predictivity of the assay [26] . Human sources allow the reduction in inter-species variability. In addition, skin fibroblasts were selected, on one side, for their critical and underappreciated role in the switch from acute inflammation to adaptive immunity [27] and, on the other, considering this cell population representative of the skin and their fibroblasts, as the first tissue on which FMMs come into contact [28] .",
