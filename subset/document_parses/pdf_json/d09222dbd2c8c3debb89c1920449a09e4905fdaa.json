It exists \"whenever the availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods, or the ability to acquire acceptable food in socially acceptable ways, is limited or uncertain\" [1] . Food insecurity is often seen in residents of low-and middle-income countries. However, food insecurity is also prevalent in high-income countries, with higher rates seen among some population groups. In the USA, 10 .5% of households were reported to be food insecure. This meant that they did not have access to food for an active and a healthy life for all household members [2] . The most recent Canadian national estimate suggests that one in eight households do not have adequate access to food [3] . In Australia, the prevalence of food insecurity was approximately 4% during the period 2011-2012 [4] . However, a recent systematic review reported that food insecurity in Australia ranged between 2% and 90% [5] among different population groups. The majority of studies included in the systematic review used a single-item measure to ascertain food insecurity, with results ranging from 2% among older Australians to 76% among remote Indigenous communities [5] . A few studies used the seven-item USDA measure and reported food insecurity to be as high as 48% among university students and up to 90% among asylum seekers in Australia [5] .",

Australia produces large quantities of high-quality food to meet the needs of its population and sustain vigorous exports [7, 8] . Food for domestic consumption is further supplemented by imports. Additionally, higher employment levels and an income support safety net ensure that food is affordable and accessible to most Australians. According to the Household Expenditure Survey 2015-2016, Australians spend approximately 16.1% of their average income on food and non-alcoholic beverages [9] . Despite this, research has shown that some families still find it difficult to access and afford nutritious food [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

According to an Australian systematic review, factors associated with food insecurity among refugees include unemployment, low income, limited time available for shopping, and the low availability and high cost of culturally appropriate foods [14] . Food insecurity, specifically among migrant or refugee families, is exacerbated by isolation [13] . However, there is limited research on food labelling and its impact on food insecurity among the general Australian population. This is further scarce among migrant communities in Australia [15, 16] . A recent Australian study [15] reported that food insecure participants were less likely to comprehend food labels compared to their counterparts. Furthermore, food secure participants were twice as likely to report that they had a healthy diet than those who were food insecure. In an Australian study, food insecure participants were 1.4 times less likely to use nutrition information panel [16] . However, factors such as recent migration and language other than English that might contribute to this finding were not explored. Other limitations include the under-representation of vulnerable populations such as those living in remote areas, those with low levels of literacy, and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) groups [16] . There exist significant gaps in the literature related to food security and label comprehension in migrant populations.",

It also indicates that such foods should be consumed rarely and in small amounts [17, 18, 24] . Already adopted in the UK, the system has received support elsewhere in research [17] .

As most Libyans migrants are Muslim, they may wish to observe particular dietary guidelines (which identify certain foods as legal or halal and others not) as part of their religious practice [30, 31] .

Univariable logistic regression analysis was then conducted to ascertain the factors independently associated with food insecurity and understanding of food labels. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the relationship between the socio-demographic and socio-economic variables and the two main outcome variables (food security using the 18item measure and the understanding of food labelling using the FSANZ question). Binary logistic regression using backward stepwise procedure analysis was used to develop models, remove non-significant variables, and predict both food insecurity status and the understanding of food labelling with an adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals. Finally, variables that had a significant statistical association (p < 0.05) with food insecurity and understanding of food labelling remained in the final model. Multicollinearity in logistic regression was used to investigate any significant collinearity among variables prior to entering them into the models.

The mean age of the respondents was 38 \u00b1 7 years with a slight majority of women (60.5%) among the survey respondents. Most of the respondents (83.4%) were educated at the university level (undergraduate or postgraduate), with 57.2% of respondents having studied at the postgraduate university level. Families ranged in size from two to ten members, with a mean of five members per family. The majority of participants reported residing in NSW (55%) followed by Victoria (21%) (Figure 1 ). Pensioners or unemployed individuals formed about 65% of respondents. Approximately 33% of respondents resided in postcodes recognised as highly or most disadvantaged areas (21% and 11.6%, respectively). In terms of food requirements, 98.5% of respondents preferred halal food. Only 5.2% of participants had vegetarian/vegan preferences or required specific food due to allergies. Some respondents (28%) purchased supplies solely from supermarkets while others (27.3%) bought solely from local food stores (such as a baker, butcher, or store selling traditional foods). About 44% of respondents purchased their food from both supermarkets and local food stores to satisfy their diverse requirements. In terms of ease of access, 70% of respondents found it difficult to obtain culturally appropriate foods. Another barrier to obtaining food of sufficient quality and quantity was product price, with 60.5% of respondents finding this to be the case. Moreover, 42% of respondents reported facing some difficulty getting to and from the shops with issues around the location of food stores and transport availability between their residence and food stores.",

In this study, on average, larger families were more food insecure than smaller families or households. A similar pattern of results was obtained in other research among similar populations [49, 50] . In contrast to our findings, some studies demonstrated that food insecurity status is negatively related to family size [2, 51] . These studies suggest that families receiving government assistance may offset disadvantages otherwise associated with increased family size (such as lower per head income). In terms of food security barriers, our study found that the location of food stores and the price of food were highly significant. These results were consistent with prior studies [16, [52] [53] [54] [55] that have shown that food secure people are likely to compare prices to buy healthy food at the best prices. In contrast to other findings, a Tasmanian study found that less than 10% of persons in a similar population reported going without food. When this occurred, factors included a lack of affordability (high food price/insufficient funds), distance to shops, limited availability and high cost of culturally appropriate foods in Tasmania [52] . However, food labelling and its impacts were not considered [52] .",

Similar observations were reported among migrants in the US, where food label skills were associated with higher education, higher income, and gender (men) [22] . Our findings partly align with a study conducted among the general population in six European countries (United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Germany, Poland, and Hungary) [57] .

It should be noted that the term \"social grades\" was used as the measure of socio-economic status and annual incomes were not recorded.

More highly educated people are more likely to secure higher incomes which enable them to afford quality foods, including fresh food and imported culturally important food. Moreover, they are more likely to be able to understand food labelling that will enable them to access to accurate food knowledge. In the European study [57] , although comprehension was higher in Sweden, Germany, and the UK than in the remaining countries, comprehension was higher than use across all six countries. This may be attributable to the role played by motivation which is needed to transform comprehension into use. Other factors may include the respondents' interest in healthy eating, their knowledge of nutrition, and their social grade [57] .

Some of the strengths of this study include a good sample size and a good response rate. It also has comprehensively explored factors involved in food insecurity and food label knowledge that has not been extensively studied in Australia. Nonetheless, there are several limitations to this study. Generalisability is limited due to the nature of the population studied and the type of sampling adopted. Despite the risk of lower levels of representativeness compared to random sampling, it was necessary to use convenience sampling because of the small number of the difficult-to-reach population of Libyan migrants in Australia. Data may therefore be limited due to selection bias and the possibility that the studied population may not be typical of Libyan families in general. Moreover, the majority of Libyan migrants arrived in Australia as advantaged populations, often highly educated students (some with families) who had not previously experienced food insecurity (unlike typical refugee populations) but found themselves suddenly dispossessed due to a revolution. Thus, not all cultural characteristics of the sample are shared with other Australian migrant and refugee populations. This might limit its generalisability to these groups both here and overseas.",

Although labelling comprehension was not an apparent significant factor, more than one-third of the participants had a limited understanding of food labels. This study also revealed that gender, private health insurance, household annual income, education level, and food store type and location were significantly related to the understanding of food labelling. However, it does not mean that food labelling is unimportant, rather other factors have been shown to have greater significance. Nevertheless, simplified labelling could benefit recent migrant populations and others in Australia.

Education programs that target specific minorities in their most familiar language could increase label comprehension and knowledge of appropriate substitutes for culturally familiar foods that might be expensive or unavailable in their area.
