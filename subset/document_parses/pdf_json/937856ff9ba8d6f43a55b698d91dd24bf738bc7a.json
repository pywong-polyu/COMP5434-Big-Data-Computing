SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the two members of a family without any history of (H/O) travel abroad. Both the virus isolates (8003 and 8004) showed CPE on day 3 post-inoculation, viral antigens by immunofluorescence assay and produced distinct, clear and uniform plaques. Infectious virus titers were 5 \u00d7 10 6 and 4 \u00d7 10 6 Pfu/ml by plaque assay and 10 7.5 and 10 7 by CPE-based TCID50/ml, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis grouped our isolates with the Italian strains. On comparison with Wuhan strain, 3 unique mutations were identified in nsp3 (A1812D), exonuclease (P1821S) of Orf1ab and spike protein (Q677H) regions, respectively. Both the viruses grouped with Italian strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggesting possible source being the virus imported from Italy. These fully characterized virus isolates will be useful in developing neutralization/virological assays for the evaluation of vaccines/antivirals.",

No cytopathic effects were observed for the remaining 3 samples even after one blind passage into T-25cm 2 flask. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay using serum sample from a convalescent-phase (27 days post-disease onset) COVID-19 patient. On day 2 post-infection, viral antigen(s) were detected only in infected cells (Fig. 1b) . Successful virus isolation using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) was reported from Korea [5] and United States [6] (Vero CCL-81), Italy [7] (Vero E6) and Australia [8] (Vero cell line expressing human signalling lymphocytic activation molecule). Other countries used different sample types and cell lines for virus isolation. In the very first report of SARS-CoV-2 isolation from China, bronchoalveolar lavage sample was inoculated into primary culture of human airway epithelial cells [9] . Caco-2 cells were used for SARS-CoV-2 isolation in Germany [10] . Isolation of the virus from ocular fluid of COVID-19 patient suggests that human ocular cell types may be supporting SARS-CoV-2 replication [11] .",

            "text": "Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1d) revealed that IRSHA isolates were closely related to the Indian strains isolated from close contacts of infected patients with travel history to Italy (EPI ISL 420,555, EPI ISL 426,179). The nucleotide divergence within these sequences was found to be 0.02% while nucleotide identity with cluster of sequences with travel history to Italy was 99.97 \u00b1 0.01%. The SARS-CoV-2 sequences of Italy origin were further segregated into two subgroups: IRSHA (Pune, western India) isolates clubbed with two other Indian sequences (India/c31/2020, India/c32/2020, Delhi, north India) from contacts of patients returned from Italy and viruses from Israel, Greece, Russia, Brazil, Germany and Netherlands (Fig. 1d) . The other subgroup clustered with Indian isolates obtained from Italian tourists who visited India /their contacts and viruses from Italy and Spain [15] . Similar to Wuhan isolate, all these sequences belonged to the L strain of SARS-CoV-2, with C at 8782nd and T at 28114th position [16] . IRSHA sequences clustered together with sequences derived from Italy and other European countries are classified as clade G due to the presence of D614G mutation in the spike protein. Origin of D614G variant, located in the S1 domain of spike protein, was associated with accelerating the spread of infections in Europe and North America [17] . In our isolates, a unique mutation Q677H located near the S1-S2 junction region (681-684) might affect the SARS-CoV-2 fusion with cell membrane. Importantly, attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 variants was obtained following 15-30 bp deletion at S1-S2 junction region of the spike protein [18] . Detection of deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR in 3 clinical samples from Guangdong, China, is noteworthy [19] . In addition, circulation of other genetic variants such as 382 nucleotide deletion in orf8 region from eight hospitalized patients in Singapore and 81 nucleotide deletion in orf7a gene in a patient from Arizona, USA [20] , has been reported and effect of such mutations on the transmissibility of the virus should be available soon.",
