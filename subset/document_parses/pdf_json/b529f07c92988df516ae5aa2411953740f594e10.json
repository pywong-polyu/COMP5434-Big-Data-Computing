IR divisions are forced to adapt to care for a growing population of coronavirus patients while maintaining a safe work environment and preventing cross infection. Since most procedural suites with fluoroscopic capability are positive pressure rooms, we describe our experience utilizing a positive pressure IR suite to create a safe, optimized environment for healthcare workers and patients. No IRB approval was required as human and animal subjects were not involved.",

In consultation with hospital Infection Prevention and Control, the largest and most secluded IR suite was chosen for the treatment of COVID-19 patients (figure 1). If present, a small passageway connecting the procedure room and control room can be converted into an anteroom with the use of two plastic barriers secured to the ceiling and floor (figure 2). These barriers have zippers that allow one individual to safely enter and exit the space at a time.",

A standardized case-by-case approach was implemented for each inpatient consult to decide the safest and most efficient procedural location (table 1) .",

Cases deemed medically necessary were screened for symptoms via telephone by IR scheduling staff. Non-urgent symptomatic patients (fever, cough, recent travel, COVID-19 positive test or recent close exposure) were delayed/postponed. For those patients who could not be postponed, a protocol was crafted in which the patient would be immediately escorted to their procedure room on arrival, bypassing the front desk and the holding bay. From registration to recovery, a COVID-19 positive outpatient or person under investigation (PUI) remained in the procedure room. Depending upon availability of COVID-19 testing, different workflows could ultimately be established. With rapid same-day testing, COVID-19 confirmed and PUI patients can be scheduled in the modified IR suite while nonmodified IR suites can be designated for COVID-19 negative patients or as back-up holding rooms for overflow COVID-19 positive patients on the floor.",
