Strong preference discernable alignment between their leaders' decision-making and their internal moral compass of values (demonstrating \"internalized moral perspective\") was described, as was clinical leaders demonstrating \"self-awareness\" (having a self-reflective process that informs the leader's decision-making).

            "text": "environment, and shared governance [5] . Healthcare professionals in academic settings face particular challenges related to burnout, given the multifaceted and sometimes conflicting missions of patient care, research, and education. In addition, the individuals who create and contribute to this institutional mission are diverse and have unique needs that must be met to thrive in their professional lives. These individuals include trainees, clinical faculty, researchers, and administrative staff. Though many conceptual models exist for burnout and work-related well-being, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) developed their own model that applies across all healthcare professionals and career stages [5] . Their model focused on the relationship between wellbeing and outcomes for clinicians, patients, and healthcare systems [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The NAM model includes external factors (socio-cultural; regulatory, business, and payer environment; organizational; and learning/practice environment), and individual factors (healthcare role, personal factors, and skills and abilities) [5] . One of the overarching themes that resonated across several of the model domains is leadership. Effective leadership styles can likely mitigate many triggers of burnout by enhancing autonomy and control, empowering individuals, and optimizing the work environment [10] [11] [12] [13] . There is a relative paucity of data about how specific leadership styles impact burnout in healthcare workers, particularly among leaders who are pursuing a multidimensional academic mission [14, 15] . A review of the leadership theory literature suggests that authentic leadership may be an ideal style to mitigate burnout [16] [17] [18] [19] . Authentic leadership is defined as a process that draws from both positive psychological capacities and a highly developed organizational context, which results in both greater selfawareness and self-regulated positive behaviors on the part of leaders and associates, thereby fostering positive self-development [20] . Authentic leadership influences staff attitudes and behaviors through the key psychological processes of identification, hope, positive emotions, optimism, and trust [16] .",

These leadership traits have the effect of engendering a sense of trust amongst the work group. The participants in this study described selected and persuasive experiences during which their leaders exhibited relational transparency. Yet, these behaviors were described mostly as aspirational; meaning-leadership traits they reported would be ideal yet were rarely experienced, in their unit or research setting. Valuing relational transparency-and recognizing its absence in current leaders-was described by members of each affinity group in our study. Experiences of openness and self-disclosure from leaders were described as instrumental to trainees to develop their own approach to challenging situations. It was particularly reassuring to participants when a supervisor interacted with them by simultaneously recognizing a difficult situation and acknowledging that they too had experienced the same challenges. Additionally, when told by their leaders that their emotions were understandable and acceptable, participants described it as important for their ability to remain healthy within demanding work settings. For example, a clinical faculty member described a patient's death that was particularly hard to handle when she/ he was a fellow: \"When she died my attending justshe cried. And then that gave me the permission that\u2026 it was okay to feel sad and take the time to experience that\u2026I think just the fact that we are not devoid of our personhood\u2026I've found that to be one of the most helpful things. \" When present, experiences of leaders who were selfdisclosing helped these employees embrace their own experiences and trust in their own abilities to handle work demands. Participants described a \"transparent\" leader as someone who does \"not keep us in the dark about current events that can help us understand about increased demands on us. \" Having a leader be transparent about constraints and pressure was valued by each affinity group. Having increased demands at work was described prevalently throughout all twelve focus groups. Failure by leaders to demonstrate relational transparency appeared to have negatively impacted the quality of interaction between employees, their sense of wellness, and tended to promote more adversarial interactions amongst employees (see Table 2 ).",

These programs could be based upon action learning principles and focus on authentic leadership development by working through real problems, activities, and case studies. In addition, healthcare professional schools and hospitals could consider recruiting their leaders based on possessing an authentic leadership style [16] .",

Although our goal was to conduct this study at as many sites as possible, some DOM members may have been excluded because of their location, given the broad geographic distribution of the DOM. We did not solicit the perspectives and experiences of DOM leaders. However, the experiences and perceptions of leaders would provide a valuable perspective and would complement the focus group findings of healthcare professionals' experiences of leadership attributes in an academic medical center. The analyses conducted comparing results by affinity group are limited by an unequal number of focus groups conducted per affinity group and limitations stemming from the finite ability of qualitative research methods to compare results by subgroups. Nonetheless, the insights gained from comparing the affinity groups' findings may prove insightful for medical leadership targeting their efforts to address burnout specifically to employee types or roles within the healthcare institution. Finally, we focused on an authentic leadership style. The most effective leaders utilize multiple leadership styles depending on the situational context.",

Adoption of an authentic leadership style at various levels in academic medical centers could help mitigate the growing burnout crisis in healthcare. Future studies will be needed to determine the best methods to teach authentic leadership styles to emerging healthcare leaders. Similarly, future research is necessary to determine the most effective method to recruit individuals who utilize an authentic leadership style in order to enhance job satisfaction and improve retention of our healthcare workforce.",

That's how I feel--kind of disenfranchised. I don't really have much agency in actually making any change. You're just kind of this cog, but you can't really do anything about it because you don't have the power. \" Participant B: \"We just have no negotiating power, if you will. And so to the hospital, it feels like we're just cheap labor to get the work done\u2026like we're in this training program until we're done with it. And if we don't finish it, then we're not a trained physician; we can't go get an actual job. We have no power (to influence decisions). \"Participant A: \"If the first issue that you raised were better addressed and there were better communication and transparency and inclusiveness [from the clinical leadership], you wouldn't need-so, the thing is that you can get the unintended consequence of becoming sort of a lobby group with an antagonistic thing going on. \" Participant B: \"\u2026if they [the leadership] had the transparency and they were open to us and kept us informed, we wouldn't need another [advocacy] group. This would be [needed] if they're not willing to do that. \" Leadership values and shows trust in staff It's not enough just to pay lip service [to the importance of clinical care]. You have to have something to back that up. One faculty member explained a previous experience this way: \"\u2026when you signed your letter of offer, it said '60 hours' and then the Dean would lean in and say 'Of course, if you're going to be successful and advance, you're going to work 70 or 80 hours a week. ' And so, when I came here [and no one in Leadership expected 70-80 hours/week], I realized that people, in part, take-they are better about putting some limits around their practice so that they have that personal time. \"",
