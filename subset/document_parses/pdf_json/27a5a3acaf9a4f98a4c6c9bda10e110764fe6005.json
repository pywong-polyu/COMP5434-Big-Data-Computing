            "text": "Background: In the healthcare landscape, various protective factors are identified, such as meaning in life (MiL), namely what gives sense to life events. However, little is known about this construct in the healthcare population. Objectives: To describe MiL among healthcare professionals employed in palliative care and neuro-rehabilitation medicine, unveiling possible differences related to medical specialty and socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: In this cross-sectional and multicentre study, palliative care and neuro-rehabilitation professionals were recruited. MiL was evaluated with the Schedule for Meaning in Life Evaluation (SMiLE), which provides a list of meaningful areas, as well as related overall indexes of satisfaction (IoS), weighting (IoW), weighted satisfaction (IoWS). Descriptive statistics, t-test, chi-square, linear and binary logistic regressions were performed. Results: Overall, 297 healthcare professionals (palliative care=89, neuro-rehabilitation medicine=208, 47% of participants \u2264 40 years old) completed the evaluation. The sample was intra-and inter-groups heterogeneous, in particular concerning age and professional role. Conversely, no significant group differences emerged in MiL indexes comparisons, nor in the number of MiL listed areas. As for MiL areas, the category \"family\" increased the IoWS index, while terms related to \"finances\" contributed to decrease it. Comparing specialties, palliative care professionals were more likely to report areas like \"partnership\", \"social commitment\", and \"satisfaction\". Nurses (n=116), nurse aides (n=47), and therapists (n=67) were more likely to mention health-related terms (e.g. health, physical wellbeing) than physicians and psychologists (n=65). Conclusion: This study highlighted MiL areas among professionals employed in palliative care and neurorehabilitation specialties, providing informative suggestions for tailored health prevention programs which should pay particular attention to social and family relationships, socio-economic status, and health.",

They both have a specific and critical role in the sanitary context. On the one hand, palliative care professionals are constantly asked to alleviate the sufferance of patients in life-threatening conditions; in this role, they are exposed to potential moral and existential dilemmas [2, 3] . These professionals strive to improve the quality of life of patients and their families addressing the difficulties intrinsic to life-threatening conditions, through the prevention and relief of suffering [4] . On the other hand, working in rehabilitation medicine exposes to deal with patients suffering from chronic illnesses or incidents of varying complexity, still having life chances even if with possible disabilities of different severity degrees. Thus, the first ones take care of patients on the verge of death intending to provide relief from suffering, and the last ones provide care to critical patients with the aim of healing them. Despite this different healthcare framework, these professionals are exposed to challenging clinical situations, emotional burden, as well as to legal and bioethical issues [5] [6] [7] . This represents for this professional category a fertile ground for burnout, moral distress, and impoverishment of quality of life [3, 5, 6, 8] .",

Of these, Meaning-in-life (MiL) has gained attention. According to Reker [9] , MiL refers to the cognitive (i.e., making sense of one's experiences in life), motivational (i.e., pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals), and emotional (i.e., feelings of satisfaction, fulfillment, and happiness accompanying goal attainment) components sustaining individuals to give sense to their own life. Despite the growing interest, literature has however evidenced a need for more robust conceptualization to overcome the definitional ambiguity and the simplified approaches that ignore the complexity of this construct. Following this line, researchers have adopted a three-dimensional model of meaning so far, distinguishing three different facets, namely coherence (i.e., sense of comprehensibility and one's life making sense), purpose (i.e., sense of core aims and direction in life), and significance (i.e., sense of life's value and of having a life worth living) [10] . The adoption of a shared and integrated framework represents an essential condition for current research on this topic, which so far has shown methodological limitations related to the absence of a clear consensus and to the fact that MiL strongly depends on individuals' characteristics and circumstances, especially in the face of stressful events [11] . Generally, the evaluation of MiL has been conducted extensively and among different populations and contexts so far [12] . In particular, when aiming to explore the relationship of this construct with health-related outcomes, the majority of the studies has considered MiL as an indicator of psychological well-being and quality of life (QoL) among individuals facing different advanced diseases and palliative care [13, 14] Specifically, according to World Health Organisation, positive QoL is rooted in significant areas which provide people with awareness of their position in their culture and values system, predisposing them to achieve their goals and address their needs [15, 16] .",

Prior studies on healthcare professionals suggested the positive influence of MiL on both health and professional outcomes [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . For instance, a positive association was found with optimism and professional self-esteem among physicians and nurses providing intensive care [19] . Another study reported evidence of MiL as a moderator and mediator in the relationship between stress and trauma [24] . Furthermore, more recently, the meaningmaking process has been positively associated with the cognitive and affective dimensions of well-being among healthcare professionals at risk of contracting COVID-19 [25] . Nevertheless, despite its relevance, research on the specific relationship between subjective characteristics and MiL in this working population is scant. To the best of our knowledge, only one study indicated that higher MiL is associated with older age among nurses, and with greater exposure to death during the previous six months among physicians [19] . Purposely, the present study aims to shed light on the associations between sociodemographic features and MiL in healthcare professionals.",

Considering this, The Schedule for Meaning in Life Evaluation (SMiLE) may be a promising instrument [27] , since it provides an individualized assessment of MiL, focusing not only on personal meaning areas, but also on their perceived intensity and weight. These characteristics led to choose this instrument to carry on the present study. Concerning its implementation, SMiLE was adopted in a representative sample of Germans, French, and Italians [28, 29] , in different clinical populations [27, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , and with bereaved informal caregivers [37] . Only one study implemented the SMiLE among palliative healthcare professionals, providing results from a comparison with professionals working in maternity wards [38] . Further studies are needed to investigate MiL among medical disciplines deeply. Indeed, it is noteworthy to underline that, despite some possible similarities, each medical discipline addresses different medical needs.",

Between July 2018 and March 2019, the participants were asked to complete a paper-pencil questionnaire and place it in a cardboard box located in a common hall of the hospital where they were employed. To guarantee anonymity and maintain a sound statistical power, few socio-demographic data were collected (gender, age group, and professional role).

The differ-ence in occupation was expected, considering the intrinsically wider variety of professionals working in palliative care and neuro-rehabilitation medicine. Similar to a previous study [38] , significant group differences were found for age too. These differences may probably be ascribable to the fact that palliative care units are more recent in Italy in respect to neuro-rehabilitation units, leading therefore to observing younger healthcare professionals in the former [40] . However, these possible explanations need to be verified with further studies posing attention to demographic differences between the health workforce [41] and possible effects of age impact on healthcare professionals' experiences and meaning construction [42] . Furthermore, it would be interesting to deepen the investigations of possible psychological characteristics that may influence the choice of working in specific healthcare settings along the life span. The present findings are not however sufficient to draw robust conclusions on this topic and, thus, our data exclusively allow to pave the way to broader reflections and to future studies able to address the interplay between age and profession. Conversely, no between-groups differences emerged in the number of MiL areas listed and the SMiLE indexes. It is possible that dealing with critical care patients and tasks may activate a similar process of meaning definition. Additionally, the nature of the profession characterized by providing care may prevail whatever the specific specialty. This hypothesis is supported by the study comparing palliative care providers with professionals working in the maternity unit, where no differences in the MIL indexes were unveiled [38] .",

Although further studies are necessary, this data could be supported by Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development [48] explaining that people generally pass through a series of stages centered on social and emotional development. Specifically, in line with the current findings, during the young adulthood stage (i.e., between 19 and 40) individuals generally tend to search for partnership and to develop intimate relationships, while with increasing age the focus is on leaving a contribution to society, such as a meaningful work [48] . This is also supported by prior research [49] showing that younger adults focused more on optimizing their future through interpersonal relations, whereas older adults' concerns were mainly with enhancing the meaning related to current activities and achievements. In a broader sense, this aspect could be supported by what emerged from another study [18] on meaning in life across the life span, which evidenced that those at earlier life stages reported higher levels of searching for meaning. Concerning the professional role, nurses were more likely to mention terms linked to \"finances\" and \"health\" than physicians and psychologists. Regarding this, previous literature reported that nurses are not satisfied with their salary [50] and they are among the healthcare workforce more at risk of developing psychological malaise [51] . Thus, they may pay more attention to financial and health-related issues than other healthcare professionals. In addition, physiotherapists and other therapists were more likely to report terms related to \"health\" area than physicians and psychologists, too. Finally, nurse aides were less likely to list \"social relationship\" and more likely to indicate \"health\" as meaningful areas in respect to physicians and psychologists. It is possible that they were more likely to mention the \"health\" category as these professionals, and in particular nurses, are usually the closest to patients [52] . However, these findings regarding the professional role need further investigation. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few studies regarding the role of socio-demographic variables on MiL, with no one referring to possible differences among the professional roles [18, 53, 54] . Therefore, this research is the first attempt to unveil differences concerning socio-demographic characteristics on MiL, as well as the first study investigating this construct within professionals employed in palliative and neuro-rehabilitation medicine.",

This category, which is also the most frequently reported by all participants, is therefore confirmed to be one of the most relevant areas concerning MiL [27, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37] . It is already reported that family support contributes to better health and increased professional outcomes [55] . In addition, the category \"finances\" significantly reduced the overall index of IoWS. To better explain this data, it is noteworthy to underline that, when asked to attribute a subjective score of satisfaction and importance on the finance area, professionals reported lower mean scores on satisfaction than in levels of weight. Since these two indexes contribute to the overall index, IoWS may be low because the \"finances\" area is considered important but not adequately satisfied. Regarding this, previous studies suggested that individuals considered their annual income and household economic wellbeing to be of the utmost importance for them, and the financial aspect was described to be positively associated with job satisfaction [56] and, in turn, with satisfaction in life [57] . Previous literature has also unveiled that Italian healthcare professionals complained their low and frozen salary [58] . It has to be considered that the present investigation has been conducted after the 2008 global financial crisis: the European healthcare sector has been subject to tough austerity measures comprising salary cuts, downsizing and freezing [58, 59] . However, these data have been collected more than ten years after this crisis, so other variables possibly linked to culture and personal understanding of rewards and recognition systems may play a relevant role. Thus, further sociological investigations are suggested to interpret better these data with the lens of the actual socio-political and economic scenario.",

Firstly, detailed sociodemographic data are missing for anonymity purposes, and the sample was heterogeneous within and across sites, specifically concerning age and professional role. These characteristics prevented further analyses, but they aim to provide tips for further studies on healthcare professionals' MiL. For instance, it would be interesting to better investigate the relations between age and profession focusing on health workforce demography [41] , or relations between age discrimination, MiL, and wellbeing [41, 42] . It is also recommended to investigate psychological characteristics which may support the choice of different healthcare settings. This analysis can be particularly interesting in the modern time as COVID-19 pandemic has been disruptive for healthcare professionals [60] , such that it is possible to speculate a relevant impact on psychological dimensions and MiL too. Secondly, response rates were not homogeneous among the institutes involved in this research. Notably, the discrepancy between the two samples size and divergencies in response rate must be noted and, thus, all the results that emerged should be interpreted cautiously and intended as suggestions to propose novel studies. Data generalization in the general healthcare population is therefore difficult. Thirdly, since MiL strictly refers to individuals' experiences, the presented data could be considered contextually biased and, therefore, intercultural studies are needed to corroborate them. Fourthly, this study has a cross-sectional design focusing on a single construct. Thus, the investigation of causal relationships is not possible at this stage.",

Above all, this study implemented a specific idiographic instrument for MiL area, enabling to detect areas that are important for an individual but where satisfaction lacks as well [34] . Thus, this schedule may be more able to capture the professionals' perspective than other instruments. Despite heterogeneity inter-and intra-groups, another added value of this research is comparing palliative care providers with neuro-rehabilitation professionals for the first time. Further research is welcomed for strengthening this data in more homogeneous and wider samples.",

The emerged results, which deserve further investigation, may provide suggestions for health prevention programs that consider MiL as a relevant protective factor to be fostered. For instance, interventions trainings to consciously perceive the significance of what healthcare professionals are doing or experiencing are pivotal for the empowerment and the restoration of resources threatened by the constant exposure to death and sufferance. An interesting example of effective intervention is provided by Fillion and colleagues [61] , who adapted for nurses a meaning-centered group intervention (MCI) grounded in Viktor Frankl's logotherapy approach [62] . Moreover, giving space for periodical confrontation meetings on MiL among healthcare professionals may enhance well-being, by providing the roots for a supportive and resilient environment allowing the sharing of personal concerns and emotions with colleagues and superiors [63] [64] [65] [66] . Since these findings described social relationships, socio-economic status, and health as relevant meaningful areas in healthcare professionals' life, healthcare services and policymakers should pay particular attention to these aspects and understand which position they have in the individual's value systems to better address subjective needs and self-actualization.",
