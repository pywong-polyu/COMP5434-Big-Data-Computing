This is done by a phase-field methodology, which has been used to study a variety of systems based on the Helfrich theory for cellular membranes [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Our description is mesoscopic considering a two dimensional diffuse interfase, in contrast to the microscopic view, which describes the rearrangement of bilayers 13 . The phase field approach allows to study not only the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ equilibrium shapes, but also the dynamics of the formation of vesicles, in the same spirit as the Landau-Ginzburg framework.",

As the Gaussian curvature is an intrinsic property of the surfaces, no matter their dimensions or the metric relations that can be exerted within them 46 , it certainly has an influence on the way membranes can change their shape. However, Gaussian curvature has not been considered in phase field models because its contribution to the energy is a topological invariant. Nonetheless, it has to be included in the study of membrane dynamics because the whole curvature energy depends on it and not only on the usual bending rigidity modulus due to the mean curvature. Minimization of the entire curvature energy allows to describe, not only the shape changes that membranes must acquire, but some processes that involve a change of genus, such as fission and fusion.",

Substituting these expressions into Eq. (9), and considering isotropic perturbations, one obtains the dispersion relation Here, \u03b4 represents terms of order O (\u03c6 2 ) . The detailed derivation of the dispersion relation is given in \"Appendix B\". The main contribution to the instability comes from the first term in Eq. (11) , in which the spontaneous curvature predominates. As the Gaussian curvature (due to \u03ba \u2032 ) is not present in Eq. (11), it does not alter the region of unstable wavelengths. The Gaussian curvature acts by causing topological changes of the membrane right in the sites where the instability occurs. The periodicity of the instability is determined by a critical length, l c = \u03c0/q c , where q c > 0 given by the point in which the unstable branch ceases to be positive (\u03c9(q) = 0) . This quantity represents a scale for the formation of the necks. The dispersion relation for typical values of the parameters is depicted in Fig. 4 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Finally, we explore the regime in which the Gaussian bending modulus \u03ba \u2032 determines whether vesicle formation happens or not. The results in Fig. 5 show the equilibrium configurations for a single continuous membrane with tubular shape. For negative \u03ba \u2032 the transition from a single vesicle to to many small vesicles, occurs along the line where 8\u03b5 4 \u03ba + \u03ba \u2032 = 0 (dotted line in Fig. 5 ).

For instance, in Fig. 3 eight vesicles can be formed in a tube of length L = 75 and a spontaneous curvature of C 0 = \u22120.5 , as the critical length is l c \u2248 10 in domain units for this case.
