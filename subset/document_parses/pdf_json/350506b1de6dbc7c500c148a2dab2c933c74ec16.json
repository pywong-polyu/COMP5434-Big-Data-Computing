In this paper, an investigation is conducted on the use of transfer learning in the task of detecting COVID-19 from lung scans.

Given the reliance of deep learning models on a large quantity of data for optimal training, the transfer of knowledge from a largescale generic dataset such as the ImageNet database to a specific COVID-19 dataset can allow for the development of high performing models that compensate for the limitations in training data for the latter. is approach is useful when highly accurate models need to be developed to tackle \"Black Swan\" events, such as the emergence of a new virus, and the requirements of mass testing. e use of deep convolutional networks also allows the automatic mass feature extraction.",

A higher importance to the recall metric is more valid in this task as a framework that has a greater capability of classifying a confirmed COVID-19-positive lung scan as COVID-19 positive would be more beneficial than a framework that is more capable of classifying a confirmed COVID-19-negative lung scan as negative. is is due to the fact that the recall or sensitivity of a test being higher means that, after testing, there is a lower chance of COVID-19-positive patients being reintroduced into society, having being tested as negative, and spreading the virus further.",

CNN models have been proven to perform extremely well on many computer vision tasks; however, they require a large amount of training data to avoid overfitting [20, 21] . Overfitting refers to the phenomenon where a machine learning model learns a function with a high degree of variance, such that the model perfectly models the training data, but has a low degree of generalizability. Unfortunately, in many cases, the ability to access large amounts of data for the optimal training of a CNN is not possible. An example can be seen when a new disease emerges, and we initially have a small amount of radiological images to train a model. Data augmentation comprises a variety of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets, such that better deep learning models can be built using them. e use of these techniques creates \"dummy data\" which differ from the original data, in that it has been subjected to various rotations, width shifts, height shifts, and zooming. e use of these augmentation techniques also allows for the training of models that are more invariant to the range of orientations and configurations that different radiologists may use when inputting images to be classified. is study performs data augmentation by using the Python Image Data Generator library, to create images that see a Examples of the augmented images can be seen in Figures 12-14 .",
