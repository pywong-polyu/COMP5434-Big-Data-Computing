In this Commentary, we discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of social accountability strategies in promoting the availability of a full range of SRH services for excluded and historically oppressed populations. We accomplish this by describing four programs that sought to promote access to quality SRH care for stigmatized populations and/or stigmatized services. Program implementers faced similar challenges, including stigma and harmful gender norms among providers and communities, and lack of clear guidance, authority, and knowledge of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) entitlements at local level. To overcome these challenges, the programs employed several strategies, including linking their strategies to legal accountability, budgetary expenditures, or other institutionalized processes; taking steps to ensure inclusion, including through consultation with excluded or stigmatized groups throughout the program design and implementation process; specific outreach and support to integrating marginalized groups into program activities; and the creation of separate spaces to ensure confidentiality and safety. The program experiences described here suggest some general principles for ensuring that social accountability efforts are inclusive both in terms of populations and issues addressed. Further empirical research can test and further flesh out these principles, and deepen our understanding of context.",

Broadly defined, social accountability refers to \"ongoing and collective effort[s] to hold public officials to account for the provision of public goods which are existing state obligations\" [1] . This paper is a reflection on social accountability practice in the domain of SRHR. We discuss the use of social accountability to promote access to quality Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) care for stigmatized populations and/or stigmatized services. We are concerned with SRH services where all who seek them may be stigmatized to some extent, such as abortion; populations who by nature of their identity may face 21:19 discrimination in seeking any SRH service, such as lower caste populations or persons with disabilities; and, populations who are stigmatized due to their violating prevailing social norms in seeking a particular SRH service, such as adolescents seeking contraception. We raise key points from the theory and practice of social accountability to explore the ways in which common social accountability approaches may exclude stigmatized populations or issues. We go on to share relevant experiences from four programs, and to present factors for success and challenges these programs faced.",

            "text": "Social accountability programs typically entail community actors assessing government performance against an agreed set of standards; a deliberative consensus building or priority setting element, wherein community members use these data to discuss and identify priorities; two-way dialogue between communities and the health system about these priorities; and follow up to ensure that these priorities are addressed. For example, a community group may compile a scorecard delineating key elements of the government maternal health strategy, assess gaps at their local health facilities, and, through a deliberative process, decide which gaps they wish to discuss with the government; or, jointly agree on budget priorities in a participatory budgeting or budget monitoring process [2] [3] [4] . Deliberative processes often yield widely shared priorities, potentially leaving out the specific needs of the few. In addition, prevailing power dynamics may serve to diminish or exclude certain voices. As described in the deep body of literature on community participation and the emerging evidence from studies on accountability for SRHR, deliberative processes may be dominated by members of the community who have the most power, marginalizing or tokenizing women, people with disabilities, young people, racial and ethnic minorities, lower caste populations, and other historically oppressed groups [5] [6] [7] . Moreover, everyone -but especially marginalized people -may face significant risk and repercussions in speaking out, such as health care providers refusing to treat them, violence in the home, or community censure [7] [8] [9] . Many program models for accountability fail to account for these hierarchies, such as by having facilitators who are skilled at supporting engagement from community members who feel unsafe or unable to speak [4, 10] . As a result, the priorities identified may not reflect the needs or priorities of those who are the most harmed by the status quo. Few studies on social accountability for SRHR assess the inclusiveness of the social accountability process or the extent to which the outcomes favor equity, though some programs have gender or age specific groupings in order to encourage participation among marginalized people [11] [12] [13] . One study that set out to examine explicitly the extent to which pregnant adolescents participated in a community scorecard project focused on maternal health, found that the while pregnant and recently pregnant adolescents reported stigmatizing and rude treatment by health providers, they were unlikely to participate in or benefit from the community scorecard project [14] . The meetings were inconveniently timed, the adolescents felt uncomfortable discussing their own pregnancy, and the priorities arising from community meetings did not include their particular challenges [14] . On top of these concerns related to marginalized groups' desire and ability to participate, there are also broader ethical concerns about expecting marginalized individuals to articulate their concerns in contexts where collective action among particular groups is unsafe and responsiveness by the state is unlikely [7] .",

The health system is a social institution, reflecting these political and social dynamics characterizing the society at large [10, 19] . Values, norms, and judgements related to issues such as single motherhood, sexuality, and fecundity may influence provider and policy-maker attitudes regarding key SRHR issues, as well as the quality of care provided [15, 20] . Moreover, national law, policy, and health entitlements often reflect these broader social norms, such that the rights of particular populations -such as trans individuals -are not protected; access to SRH services and information, such as comprehensive sexual education or contraception for adolescents, is limited by law; or particular SRH services, such as abortion, are criminalized.",

Given that most social accountability efforts aim to promote the realization of rights enshrined in national laws and policy, advocacy for SRHR that are enshrined in international human rights law but not national systems may be limited in many social accountability projects. The social norms and values of program implementers, participants, and likely respondents, such as health providers, may also influence which elements of SRHR are ultimately chosen as the focus of social accountability efforts. For example, a 2004 review of community participation in 18 World Bank-supported health reform projects in Asia found evidence suggesting that community participation translated into gains in maternal health and family planning services, but less -if any -impact on more stigmatized areas, such as Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), abortion services, and health services for violence survivors [21] . Similarly, a systematic review of accountability efforts for SRHR concluded that controversial issues tend to be given less priority, including contraception for adolescents, single women, and elderly people, and the SRH needs of sex workers [15] . We describe how four programs aimed to promote inclusion and equity, and navigated the stigma and politicization relating to SRHR in particular. The programs discussed were selected based on their stated intent to apply social accountability strategies to SRHR. The program successes and challenges presented were chosen following discussions among the authors; the content of each section is derived from the authors' own program management experiences, as well as from internal and external evaluations. While we justify our statements with examples, this paper is in the style of a practice reflection or commentary, rather than a research study. Thus, the findings and principles we present are intended as hypotheses for further consideration by program implementers and exploration by researchers with expertise and engagement in social accountability and/or SRHR; we argue for fuller programmatic and research engagement with the topic. We also expect that this paper will contribute to broader discussions within the social accountability field about promoting inclusion. Table 1 summarizes the programs discussed.",

However, they found it more difficult to communicate successfully to decision-makers and providers regarding adolescent sexual health, in part because providers seemingly held stigmatizing attitudes about adolescent sexuality and lacked knowledge of the public health evidence base in this area. For example, recent SAHAJ research found that a Community Health Worker (CHW) threatened to report a woman seeking information about abortion to her in-laws, and some CHWs expressed a desire to \"control\" young women who putatively exhibited sexuality in the \"way they walk\" [22] .",

Lack of capacity undermines many social accountability efforts, but it is possible that this challenge is greater for stigmatized issues and populations. Pursuant to a policy of decentralization, the constitutionally protected right to health is now the primary responsibility of the local government. To ensure that access to SRHR, including safe abortion services, is fulfilled, Ipas Nepal is working with local civil society actors on a social accountability effort that supports and mobilizes women from the community to use community scorecards (a type of community monitoring), participatory planning and budgeting with local health authorities, and social audit (public hearings). These local civil society actors make particular efforts to engage adolescents and women/girls with disabilities. Nepal has recently decentralized its health system, and local governments have the authority and responsibility to manage health service budgets and service provision, including safe abortion services. In this new context, local governments were more responsive to community members and local NGOs assessing abortion service delivery as part of a social accountability program run by Ipas Nepal and local partners in two rural districts. Despite this, local Ministry of Health staff tasked with managing service delivery at the local level sometimes lacked the information and capacity required to fulfill their responsibilities. The Ministry of Health had instituted accountability mechanismssuch as a citizens' charter and health facility operation and management committees, but awareness of these mechanisms within communities was poor. An Ipas program evaluation revealed that knowledge of these mechanisms increased significantly in the areas where the social accountability program is being implemented as compared to a control, but still, 38% of community members did not know about these mechanisms in program areas; the percentage was even higher in comparison districts at 62%. SAHAJ has realized that some front-line service providers in program districts in India lack important knowledge or skills regarding adolescents' sexuality related concerns, including menstruation; SAHAJ team members have thus begun to train them on adolescent SRHR issues. Building on this, peer leaders have used the training as a basis to identify what they feel is lacking in service delivery, including support for boys seeking advice on nocturnal emissions and STIs.",

The complaints protocol included a procedure for prioritizing the problems affecting the most marginalized; the Council has addressed issues such as unavailable health commodities for STI treatment; denials of antiretroviral treatments for new refugees arriving in the settlement; inaccessibility and unacceptability of medical equipment for women with disabilities; and disrespect and abuse experienced by refugee women seeking antenatal care.",

SAHAJ and partners documented the deaths of poor tribal women in sterilization camps in central India, revealing that the government was failing to ensure standards for sterilization care laid down by the Supreme Court [28] . Local NGOs working with Ipas in Nepal promoted the implementation of comprehensive SRH programs by engaging directly in the budget process. They approached local government bodies to advocate for the inclusion of safe abortion services in the budget, and to institutionalize this inclusion. As a result, the local health system had the resources to meet their obligation to ensure access to free comprehensive abortion care. The governments used the funds allocated in the budget to train service providers; to raise awareness about SRH entitlements among girls by providing sessions on reproductive health and rights -including abortion -in schools; and to directly fund abortion services.",

Youth participants in the social accountability program appreciated that this structure offered access to Ministry of Health representatives and service providers.

First, in the context of stigma and discrimination, it is perhaps even more important than for programs addressing less stigmatized issues and people, that efforts rely on legal and other formalized commitments, obligations, and rationales. Invoking these formal commitments may create space to surface unacknowledged persons and issues, making them issues of acceptable public concern. Second, inclusion should be built into the program, and permeate all stages of implementation. Depending on the context, this may require creating specific processes for excluded groups. Further empirical research can test and further flesh out these principles and hypotheses, and deepen our understanding of context. ",
