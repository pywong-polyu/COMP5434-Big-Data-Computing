Method. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS model group is established on rats by tail vein injection. A medicine group is established on ARDS rats by prophylactic administration using YQHYJD. Materials are collected, and tests are conducted according to experimental processes. Result. e rats in the medicine group gained weight compared with those in the ARDS model group. Pathological sections from the medicine group indicated improved condition in terms of pulmonary and interstitial edema in the lung tissues of rats compared with that from the ARDS model group. e percentage of neutrophil of the medicine group was significantly brought down compared with that of the ARDS model group (P < 0.001). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the changes in the level of inflammatory cytokines. It was observed that the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in serum of the medicine group significantly decreased (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01), the contents of TLR4 and NLRP3 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the medicine group decreased, and the contents of TLR4 and NLRP3 in lung tissue homogenate of the medicine group significantly decreased (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05). In further mass spectrum identification of the proteins from the same animal groups, it was observed that the expressions of inflammatory proteins TNFRSF1, LBP, and NOS2 of the medicine group were reduced. e differences were statistically significant.",

ARDS is most often induced by pneumonia, septicemia, and aspiration of gastric content or severe trauma. About 10% of ICU patients worldwide suffer from ARDS [2] . In-hospital mortality on a 90-day account of moderate to serious ARDS patients stays at 43% [3] . e COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 was extremely contagious, and patients with critical conditions would develop into ARDS followed by death, making it a pressing challenge in the research of respiratory diseases to discover effective treatment approaches against ARDS. Major Western medicine therapies against ARDS include the treatment of primary disease, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), drug therapy, and the use of the neuromuscular blocking agent. Symptomatic treatment remains lacking in effective approaches. e clinical drug therapy includes the use of glucocorticoid, activated protein C, antiendotoxin antibody, interferon, and pulmonary surfactant. It is usually difficult for a single symptomatic preparation to deliver ideal clinical results [1] . Chinese medicine therapy emphasizes a holistic view and syndrome differentiation. e pathogenesis of ARDS is characterized by deficiency, toxicity, and stasis. Accordingly, the treatment principle of increasing the patient's own power of healing to resist and dispel pathogenic factors is established to supplement Qi, detoxification, and break stasis, with the aim to alleviate the injury of pulmonary interstitium [4] . Meta-analysis indicates [5] that an integrated Chinese traditional and Western medicine therapy presents a promising advantage in bringing down mortality. e adoption of Chinese medicine compound combined with differential treatment demonstrates greater clinical advantages than the use of single blockers, providing a brighter outlook for the prevention and treatment of ARDS.",

TLR family receptors play an important role in pathogen recognition and immune response [10] . e binding of LPS and TLR receptor activates NF-\u03baB dimer and induces acute lung injury [11] [12] [13] . erefore, NF-\u03baB plays a critical part in immune and inflammation regulation, as it not only facilitates cytokine transcription but also remains important in the activation of NLRP3 [14] [15] [16] inflammasome. e inflammasome is a cytoplasmic complex composed of sensor molecule NOD-like receptor (NLR), adapter protein ASC, and effector protein caspase-1. NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by multiple stimuli [17] . e component combination of the NLRP3 complex facilitates pro-caspase-1 to invert to caspase-1, followed by the activation of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 [18, 19] . Two steps are taken to activate the inflammasome: the inflammasome is activated and transcripted to inflammasome complexes, and then, cytokines pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 [20] are activated and released. e activation of NLRP3 can be realized in two ways. One approach involves the activation of TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway and the expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-1\u03b2, and pro-IL-18. NLRP3 expression remains at a low level under normal circumstances, but when the NF-\u03baB pathway is activated, a large number of NLRP3s are transcripted and translated [21, 22] . e other approach involves pathogens in the cytoplasm and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including NOS2 that transduce and activate NLRP3 and facilitate the assembly of inflammasomes.",

            "text": "ARDS is an inflammatory response caused by increased permeability of alveolar epithelial tissue. is inflammatory response is induced by the activation of an inflammatory signaling pathway that triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines. Pathological sections of lung tissues indicated that the alveolar structure of the model group exhibited obvious injury with congestive edema in pulmonary interstitium and a large amount of inflammatory exudates in the alveolar cavity. Under prophylactic administration of YQHYJD, the medicine group demonstrated improved conditions in terms of alveolar injury and pulmonary interstitium edema. is was consistent with pathological results of inflammatory response and confirmed the general anti-inflammatory effect of YQHYJD. It was observed from the inflammatory exudates of the model group that lung wet weight and neutrophil content in BALF increased, while the inflammatory response of the medicine group was regulated demonstrating reduced pulmonary injury. TLR4/NLRP3 pathway is a typical inflammatory pathway. Its activation stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, which further aggravates the inflammatory response. Preliminary research studies indicated that YQHYJD could regulate the expressions of major proteins NF-\u03baB p50, p65, and p38 MAPK in the inflammatory pathway [7] . Experimental results of the medicine group showed that content levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in blood serum on the TLR4/NLRP3 pathway decreased and the expressions of inflammatory proteins TLR4 and NLRP3 in BALF and lung tissue homogenate were inhibited, compared with the model group. is was closely correlated with YQHYJD's effect of inhibiting TLR4 activation, NF-\u03baB transcription, and the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasomes that helped to reduce the IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 release. To further verify the relevance between YQHYJD's pharmacological actions and TLR4/NLRP3 pathway, proteomic mass spectrometry analysis was conducted to detect the premedicinal and postmedicinal changes in upstream proteins TNFRSF1 and LBP and downstream protein NOS2. e analysis indicated YQHYJD could inhibit not only the expression of upstream proteins TNFRSF1 and LBP and downstream protein NOS2 on the pathway but also the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, bring down the content level of inflammatory protein, curb the binding of TLR4 receptor, and downregulate the inflammatory response.",

            "text": "Inflammasomes in inflammatory cells and immunocytes play an important role in immune reaction. NLRP3 inflammasome is being widely studied. e inflammatory cell is stimulated into an active form, NLRP3 inflammasome functions together with pro-IL-1\u03b2 and ligand ASC [25] . NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated under 2 conditions: first, signal activation and, second, activation of caspase-1. When externally irritated, TLR4 binds with LPS and triggers the activation of NF-kB on the signal pathway, by upregulating NLRP3 and pro-IL-1\u03b2. Activated NLRP3 assembles with pro-IL-1\u03b2 and ASC into NLRP3 inflammasome, which activates pro-caspase-1 into cleaved caspase-1. By enzymatic action, pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 are released in mature forms causing inflammatory response [26] [27] [28] [29] (Figure 8 signal pathway). YQHYJD is composed of Astragalus membranaceus (Huang-qi), Panax pseudoginseng (San-qi), Paeoniae radix rubra (Chi-shao), Fructus immaturus (Zhi-shi), Lonicerae flos (Jin-yin-hua), Scutellaria baicalensis (Huang-qin), Cortex Mori (Sang-bai-pi), and Semen lepidii (Ting-li-zi). Research studies revealed that the major active ingredient astragaloside IV (AS-IV) derived from Astragalus membranaceus could significantly reduce the expression of TLR4 and downstream adaptor proteins, regulate NF-\u03baB phosphorylation, and inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [30] . e major active ingredient Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) from Panax pseudoginseng has the pharmacological effect of anti-inflammation and antioxidation, which plays a part in regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism, oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial autophagy, and membrane channel status [31] . Paeoniae radix rubra is characterized by its effect of antiinflammation and immunoregulation. It also inhibits the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway and downregulates the protein expression of MAPK [32] . Fructus immaturus extract is an ingredient with anti-inflammatory activity, which is effective in inhibiting MAPK and NF-\u03baB signal pathway activation [33] . Lonicerae flos is effective in anti-inflammation, antibacteria, and antivirus. Lonicerae flos extract HS-23 can reduce septicemia mortality, enhance bacterial clearance rate, and relieve multiple organ failures. Lonicerae flos's action mechanism is related to reducing the protein expression of TLR4 [34] . Lonicerae flos extract flavonoids are effective in regulating inflammatory cytokines and mediators, which are related to the regulating of nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and phosphorylated Akt [35] . Lonicerae flos extract luteolin can significantly inhibit NF-\u03baB activation and plays a role in anti-inflammation by lowering Ca 2+ level to regulate expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, and COX-2 [36] . Scutellaria baicalensis extract baicalin (BAI) can regulate inflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and TLR4/NF-\u03baB signal pathway [37] . Scutellaria baicalensis extract baicalin can reduce inflammatory response by downregulating the activation of NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK and by reducing TLR4 and MyD88 expressions [38] . Cortex Mori extracts mulberroside A and oxyresveratrol are effective in anti-inflammation and antioxidation, which might be related to the regulation of iNOS expression by downregulating the binding activity of NF-\u03baB and COX-2 activities [39] . Semen lepidii extract total flavonoids (TFH) can regulate the nuclear translocation of Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine activated NF-\u03baB, downregulate TLR4 and NF-\u03baB, and are effective in antifibrosis [40] . Compared with ARDS treatment using a single blocker, this study studied the integrated regulating effect of YQHYJD on the TLR4/NLRP3 pathway in ARDS treatment. e micromechanism of traditional Chinese medicine compound was thoroughly explored. is innovative research provided evidence for the identification of therapeutic targets in ARDS treatment using Chinese medicine therapy, introducing a novel approach for the treatment of ARDS. However, Chinese medicine compound is composed of complex ingredients. is study did not focus on the action mechanism of any specified ingredient from the compound against ARDS, nor was it verified by cellular experiments.",

Pre-and post-YQHYJD treatments were further detected to observe the changes in upstream proteins TNFRSF1 and LBP and downstream protein NOS2 on the TLR4/NLRP3 pathway. It was observed that the Chinese medicine compound could inhibit the expression of upstream proteins TNFRSF1 and LBP and downstream protein NOS2, confirming YQHYJD's antiinflammatory effect against ARDS through TLR4/NLRP3 pathway.",
