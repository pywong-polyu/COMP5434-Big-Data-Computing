Jones and Salath\u00e9 reported that engagement in protective behaviors shows individual variation and may be affected by several factors [2] . A community-based survey by Harper et al. indicated that fear of COVID-19 was the only predictor of positive behavior changes [3] . Recent studies suggest that some super-spreaders unintentionally transmit the virus because of their hyperactivity [4, 5] . These individuals are unlikely to be anxious about infection and tend not to listen to or trust official government information [6] .",

We chose the UK because it provides a good contrast to Japan; the UK is an island, like Japan, but has experienced a high COVID-19 infection rate. Spain was chosen as an appropriate contrast to the UK, as it has a similar high infection rate but different political and geographical characteristics.

At the time of this investigation, the spread of COVID-19 in Japan was limited to several areas, but a few days after the questionnaire was administered, the number of infected people rose sharply, and the government declared a state of emergency (although in some prefectures, it was announced on April 7 [11] that residents were highly recommended to stay their homes unless it was urgent). After the end of May, the government began to gradually relax the restrictions [12] . In contrast, during the period of questionnaire administration in the UK, the spread of COVID-19 in the UK was much more severe than that in Japan. Residents were required to stay home unless there was an essential need to go out. Public business activities were prohibited, with few exceptions, until the government relaxed the restrictions on May 11, 2020 [13] . The number of deaths from COVID-19 increased linearly during the questionnaire period. In Spain, a very strict lockdown had been in place since March 14, 2020. Citizens were forbidden from leaving their homes unless necessary to obtain food or medical care, or to walk dogs. The Spanish government relaxed this regulation after a drop in the number of new infection [14] , but people were required to wear face masks on public transport [15] . However, the government subsequently declared another state of emergency. To summarize, it is possible that a higher infection rate increases both anxiety and an awareness of the need for knowledge about the virus, driving the need for more precise information.",

The WHO did not recommend that healthy people wear a face mask unless there are clear reasons to do so [18] . The UK government did not encourage citizens to wear face masks, as there is little evidence of the effectiveness of masks for preventing infection [18, 19] . In contrast, it is well known that Japanese people are willing to wear masks partly because many individuals experience spring allergies. Approximately 40% of Japanese university students wear masks in the spring, according to a previous survey [20] . The high percentage of mask wearing in Japan before the rapid increase in symptomatic COVID-19 cases may have contributed to the reduction in the number of infectious cases, because wearing a mask can prevent splash infection by blocking saliva containing the virus (although it does not block the coronavirus itself ) [21] . However, a recent report indicates that many SARS-CoV-2 transmissions occur from presymptomatic carriers [22] .

Japanese respondents trusted very few sources of information about the pandemic. Cultural factors and recent political conflicts may have contributed to these differences in basic trust in officials. It was reported very recently that many individuals in England believe conspiracy theories about COVID-19, and that these theories are associated with less adherence to official guidelines for precautionary behaviors [25] . We observed that respondents who had an acquaintance who was infected with the virus were likely to trust official information about COVID-19. These results suggest that Japanese residents may be vulnerable to conspiracy theories partly because of the (relatively rare) experience of having an infected acquaintance, although there is no evidence for the spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories in Japan.",

The survey period differed between Japan and the other countries, which may have influenced the results. The standard of COVID-19 testing also varied between countries. In addition, as a series of web-based questionnaires was used, we cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias among participants. We obtained responses only from individuals willing to complete online questionnaires. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Internet services were available for 95.8 and 91.4% of citizens in the UK and Spain, respectively, in 2019 [26] . In Japan, 79.8% of citizens used Internet services in 2019, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications [27] . However, our participants may not be representative of the Internet users in each country because only people who had registered with the monitor database of the Cross Marketing Group Inc. Additionally, participants' residential areas may have affected the perception of COVID-19. As we did not record the residential area of participants in the UK and Spain, we could not examine the effect of area on anxiety and behavior.",

These differences suggest the need to establish region-and country-specific solutions. For example, in Spain, providing accurate information through nonofficial channels, such as social network services, would be beneficial, because many people do not trust official announcements. In contrast, compensation for absence from work may encourage people in Japan to avoid work and public transport. In the UK, the low rate of mask wearing and relatively high trust in the government suggest that an official framework to encourage individuals to wear medical masks would help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.",
