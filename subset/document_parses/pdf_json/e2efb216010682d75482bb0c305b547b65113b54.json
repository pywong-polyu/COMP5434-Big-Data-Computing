The Ministry of Health in Peru published the symptomatic pharmacological treatment options for COVID-19 to control the pandemic (22). These options included the clinical use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for mild cases of COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and/or chloroquine phosphate plus ivermectin for moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 (6, 22). However, this recommendation led to self-medication reports in Peru (6, 20), which also gets accompanied with the use of medicinal plants. This practice has become increasingly common in Peru as panic spread in the general population, who anxiously wait for positive news about the prevention, treatment and vaccination (20). The idiosyncrasy of the population has also focused on the use of medicinal plants, natural products or preparations, with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties to strengthen the immune system or treat respiratory diseases (23). Countries, such as China, India, Bolivia, Morocco, Nepal, Peru and Brazil, are using traditional medicine against COVID-19 (23-32). There are approximately 50,000 plant species with medicinal uses, and the WHO has estimated that 80% of the population of developing countries use traditional medicine as their main source of medicines (33). In Europe, the clinical use of medicinal plants is approved under the directive 24/2004 for the treatment of colds (34); these treatments are accessible and available. In Latin America, the Regional Office of WHO for the Americas (AMOR/PAHO) indicates that 71% and 40% of the population of Chile and Colombia, respectively, use traditional medicine (35, 36). In Peru, a megadiverse country, the use of medicinal plants for the treatment of various conditions, such as malaise and gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases, dates from the Inca period (24, 36-39), and currently approximately 1,400 species are used for medicinal purposes in both native and urban communities (24, 36). It comes as no surprise that traditional medicine is currently being used by the Peruvian population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess factors associated with the use of medicinal plants as an .",

The study of Biniam et al. found a greater tendency for women to use medicinal plants than men (58). This relevant role of women is not only in medicinal plants but also in food safety practices (59). This factor is relevant in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is relevant to focus on females as an important element for the prevention and rational treatment of patients with COVID-19. Regarding the significant association between the use of medicinal plants with primary and secondary education, this is explained by the fact that those with professional training are more likely to use a scientifically validated treatment, abandoning the use of medicinal plants. It has been reported that elder and low education people could be at higher risk of disease complications because they prefer the use of medicinal plants over the adherence to pharmacological treatment (60). This could potentially be riskier for patients with COVID-19.",

In different countries, there is also a worldwide wealth of knowledge, theories, and practices on the use of plants as natural medicines for the treatment of diseases. Medicinal plants have been used since prehistoric times -a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the Natural and Traditional Medicine, which includes treatment with medicinal plants, as the most natural, safe, effective, and affordable medicine (66). The use of medicinal plants for respiratory conditions has also been reported in various parts of the world from China (29), India (27), Sau Arabia (67) to Mexico (68) and Ecuador (69).
