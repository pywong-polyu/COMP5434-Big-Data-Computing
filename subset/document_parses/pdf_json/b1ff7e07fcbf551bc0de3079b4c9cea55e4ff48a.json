However, current available literature assessing the body composition before, during and after adolescence in female and male rodents by in vivo techniques is scarce. Thus, by using computerized tomography, we aimed to define the baseline of the weight and body composition during the adolescence and young adulthood of female and male Sprague-Dawley rats (on P30, P60 and P90) under standard diet. Then, we determined the effect of 18 days of forced exercise on the body weight and composition during the early adolescence (P27-45). The highest percentual increments in weight, body volume and relative adipose contents occurred during the female and male adolescence. Forced running during the early adolescence decreased weight, body volume and relative adipose delta and increment values in males only. The adolescence of rats is a period of drastic body composition changes, where exercise interventions have sex-dependent effects. These results support a model that could open new research windows in the field of adolescent obesity.",

According to critical neurobiological changes observed in the neural circuits of the prefrontal cortex, the adolescent period of rats can be defined between P30 and P60 1,2,5 . Adolescence is a key period to determine the body composition since it can predict diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular diseases later in life 8 .

            "text": "The first studies in rodents that determined the body composition included ex-vivo dissection 26,31-33 and invivo bioimpedance or gas uptake techniques 34-36 . Unfortunately, these methods do not allow to assess minimal changes or analyze the whole-body composition, specific anatomical locations or perform longitudinal studies. Among the recent imaging techniques, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) could be a reliable method to regionalize body composition 37 . On the other hand, magnetic resonance (MR) allows to accurately identify hard and soft tissues and distinguish brown (BAT), subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissues 38-40 . However, only high-resolution MR techniques allow to regionalize different tissues of the body. This is also achieved with similar accuracy by using positron emission tomography (PET) 41, 42 . Nonetheless, MR and PET require costly resources that are out of reach for many laboratories. One increasingly used method to analyze OPEN the body composition in animal studies is the computerized tomography (CT) [43] [44] [45] [46] . CT shows a high correlation with MR imaging regarding adipose and lean tissue volumes when no post-filtering processes are used during the image analysis 47 . In addition, CT techniques are not as costly as MR and PET, while providing an accurate measurement of body composition and its distribution. Recent studies highlighted the importance of individually analyzing subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue due to their differentiated metabolic relationships in a wide range of diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and metabolic syndromes 48, 49 . In this sense, computerized tomography (CT) imaging is revealed as an appropriate method for body composition studies in longitudinal studies 50, 51 .",

Then, during the early adolescence (P27-44), we determined the effect of a forced wheel training program on the weight and body composition. The forced running wheel modality allows to accurately determine the effects of physical activity during adolescence since it ensures the exposure to similar loads of exercise (volume, speed and frequency) and can avoid unspecific stress responses in rodents 52-54 . Our study derived in a detailed assessment of the body composition by using CT. According to our baseline, the highest percentual increments in weight, body volume and relative adipose contents mainly occur during the adolescence when compared with the young adulthood. Finally, we observed that an aerobic physical activity program during the early adolescence has sex-dependent effects on the body composition of Sprague-Dawley rats. These results highlight the relevance of including both sexes in the animal studies and suggest that future studies revealing the differential mechanisms of exercise between females and males could open new research windows about obesity in the adolescence.",

Male training group (MT; n = 6; litter E) and male control group (MC; n = 6; litter E) were weight-matched and housed in a separate room under the same conditions. Standard size cages, of 50 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 cm with a 2-3 cm dry cork shavings layer, were replaced every 4-5 days. A 12:12 h dark-light cycle was set, being zeitgeber (ZT) 0 when the lights turned on (rat's passive phase), and ZT12 when the lights turned off (rat's active phase). All the experiments were performed during the rats' active phase (dark cycle) under a source of dim orange light (600 nm), at ZT14 and/or ZT20 to minimize circadian disruptions. The rooms were maintained at 22-25 \u00b0C temperature with a relative humidity of 45-60%. Standard chow diet (ENVIGO, diet 2014) and filtered water were available ad libitum.",

The training was designed and supervised in collaboration with graduates in physical activity and sport science, certificated and with permission to work with experimental animals. The handling procedure consisted of picking up one rat at a time and petting it for 2 min. From postnatal day 26, female and male animals of the experimental groups were exposed to an 8-days exercise habituation protocol in a forced running wheel system (Campden Instruments, 80805A) as described previously (Fig. 1) 52 . The training program consisted of two sessions per day, on ZT14 and ZT20. The active period of SD rats occurs during the darkness (ZT12-ZT23). ZT14 session was defined as morning (AM) session, since it occurs in the first half of the active phase. ZT20 was defined as afternoon (PM) session, since it occurs in the second half of the active phase. On each session (AM and PM), the rats were weighted (Gram S3R-2KD) before entering the wheel system. The sessions consisted of 10-min bouts of continuous running, with 5 min of resting between bouts. The speed and/ or total duration increased every day (Fig. 1) . The rotation speed of the wheels was established according to the response of the rats in preliminary experiments.",

On postnatal day 30, 60 and 90 of the FB and MB groups and postnatal day 27 and 45 of the FT, FC, MT and MC groups, the rats were screened using an Albira trimodal preclinical-scanner and software (Bruker\u00ae, Billerica, MA, USA). The rats were anesthetized (MSS isoflurane Keyed Filler Cagemount, MSSVAP03) through inhalation of isoflurane (ZOETIS, IsoFlo) at 5% in a 30 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 15 cm chamber until the absence of voluntary movement. After the anesthesia induction, the rats were weighted (Gram S3R-2KD) and prepared for image acquisition. Then, the isoflurane flow was reduced to 2.5-3% and mixed with a 1.6-1.8 L/min of oxygen flow (DeVilbiss Healthcare, 5 L Oxygen Concentrator) until the end of the scanning. The image scanning process took between 25 and 40 min per rat. The x-ray intensity parameters were set to 45 kV and 0.4 mA. P27 and P30 rats were exposed to approximately 893.9 SDE mSv (or 89.4 rem) and 550 DDE mSv (or 55 rem), while P45, P60 and P90 rats received approximately 1,430.24 SDE mSv (or 143 rem) and 880 DDE mSv (or 88 rem).

            "text": "Image analysis. The 3D image segmentation was performed using the pMod version 3.5. With the software's reduction tool, the image resolution was halved to substantially improve the processing time. The full volume of the rat was calculated by using the \"isocontour\" function of the software with the following parameters: algorithm '3D'; search mode 'hot'; inner holes 'no'; multi regions 'no'; mode of searching 'automatic'; absolute threshold 'value'; threshold '-450' . The thoracoabdominal (TA) region was analyzed and defined as the contents from the intervertebral space C7-T1 (cervical and thoracic) to the intervertebral space between S2-S3 (sacral). A broader region was analyzed and defined between the posterior boundary of the olfactory bulb and the anus (olfactory bulb-anus; OBA region) ( Fig. 2A,B) . The method did not permit to differentiate between white adipose tissue (WAT) or brown adipose tissue (BAT) ( Fig. 2A' ,A\"), and therefore we only considered the visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue. To split the VAT from the SAT, a contour was drawn manually with the software. The VAT region was defined as the contents comprised by the mentioned contour, inside of the muscle/bone plane of the thoracoabdominal wall of the TA region (Fig. 2B ,B\"). The adipose tissue outside the described limits was defined as SAT. To ensure the accuracy of the compartment separation, 2 contours were drawn by 3 different researchers, and then compared for differences to reach an agreement. Due to the limitations of the image quality, separating VAT from SAT was not possible in the OBA region. Therefore, the analysis www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of the OBA region does not include the separation between SAT and VAT. The sum of VAT and SAT was defined as the total adipose tissue (AT) content. Based on calibration standards that were validated previously in data from humans and rodents 43, 56 , using the \"segmentation\" functionality of the software, three ranges of signal were obtained and considered in terms of adipose (\u2212 200 to \u2212 31 HU), lean (\u2212 30 HU to 189 HU; note that lean tissue includes mainly muscle, but also includes the parenchyma and stroma of organs like kidneys, liver or intestines) or bone tissue (\u2265 190 HU). The raw segmentation of the image was used in all the calculations. Therefore, no post-processing was used after the segmentation. Body composition contents were reported as the percentage of the corresponding body volume. The 3D images (Sup. 2; Sup. 5; Sup. 6) were created by loading the CT raw images in VolView 3.4 (Kitware), adjusting the radiodensity parameters until only the bone is visible, and merging it (by clicking on Plugins > Utilities > Merge volumes) with the segmented SAT and VAT volumes, prior to choosing a different color for every tissue. The 3D videos (Vids. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] were created by using the VolView tools (Review > Movie > Create).

Next, we determined the effect of a forced wheel training during the early adolescence period of female and male rats. In the results below, we show the absolute values of the whole-body weight and the TA or OBA volume of the rats. Then, we normalized the volume of the rats' adipose, lean and bone volumes, obtained by CT, to the volume of the TA region (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) or OBA region (Sup. 1; Sup. 3; Sup. 4) and expressed it as a percentage (relative content). The delta values were reported as the difference between two age points (e.g. P30 to P90 difference = P90 value -P30 value). The percentual increment values were reported as the percentage difference between two age points (e.g. P30-P60 increment = P60 value * 100/P30 value -100). Baseline female and male SD rats experimented the highest increment in the adipose content during adolescence. In the thoracoabdominal region, the relative adipose (AT%) content -or body fat-increased with age without differences between females and males ( Fig. 4A ; Sup. 2; Vids. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . No differences were found between females and males regarding the AT% delta and increment values from P30 to P90, adolescence (P30-60) or early adulthood (P60-90) ( Fig. 4B -C\"). Comparing adolescence (P30-60) with young adulthood (P60-90) the AT% increment was higher during adolescence in both females and males ( Fig. 4C ' ,C\"). Note that the delta AT% values in the adolescence and young adulthood were similar ( Fig. 4B' ,B\") (see discussion). The analysis of the OBA region revealed similar differences to the TA region, except that no difference was observed between adolescence and young adulthood OBA AT% in females (Sup. 3A-C\"). In relation to the SAT%, it increased with age in both females and males ( Fig. 4D ; Sup. 2A,D,G,J,M,P).

            "text": "The literature assessing the body composition before, during and after adolescence in female and male rodents by in vivo techniques (e.g. MRI, CT) is scarce. Studies determining the body composition in rats, were mainly developed in young or adult periods 32, 49, 58, 59 . The relative body fat (or adipose tissue) of SD rats determined by Schoeffner et al. 33 , with an ex-vivo technique, was lower than in our study, and did not seem to increase during the adolescence and young adulthood. These differences might be explained by the gravimetric method used to determine the lipid content, as well as the data acquisition (grams) and its normalization method 33 . In addition, ex-vivo techniques imply the utilization of cohorts, which might induce bias due to the litter differences. CT scan is appropriate to evaluate longitudinal changes in body composition, assuming that the exposure to radiation www.nature.com/scientificreports/ during our study is not in range to produce tissue damages or morphological alterations in rats 60, 61 . Nonetheless our CT images and data, normalized with the volume, indicate there are drastic changes in the relative adipose content during adolescence. Tekus et al. 49 proposed that the body composition of the region between L1-3 can be used to estimate the whole-body composition. Nonetheless, in our study, we observed some differences between the body composition in the TA region and the OBA region, especially regarding relative lean and bone contents ( Fig. 5A -F\"; Sup. 3A-F\"). Thus, we suggest that estimating the body composition from relatively lesser portions of the body could result in errors, since further studies are required to understand how body composition is regulated in different body regions and organs. On the other hand, many works reported their body composition data as absolute values or relative to body weight 29, 30, 58 . Some of these studies also include delta body weight 30 or the percentual increment 59, 62 . In order to obtain the delta and incremental values, it is necessary to perform pre and post data acquisition. In our data, the absolute value (e.g. weight) or relative content (e.g. adipose tissue) highlighted the general trend of the values throughout the experiment. On the other hand, the delta value was used to determine the size of the change between two points in time (e.g. females vs. males during adolescence). However, the percentual increment better reflected the fold change from the initial to the final time points, and therefore was better for the comparison of two periods (e.g. adolescence vs. young adulthood), although it also detected the differences between conditions (e.g. experimental vs. control). As a result, the delta or the increment values were not used interchangeably. As an example the female delta VAT% was similar in adolescence and the adulthood, but the increment revealed the VAT% increased more in the adolescence (Fig. 4H ' ,H\",I' ,I\"). We found that a forced wheel training of 18 days during the early adolescence of rats has sex-dependent effects. AM and PM forced running during the early adolescence decreased weight, body volume and relative adipose delta and increment values in males only. The sex-dependent effects in -at least-the body weight could be partially explained by experiments showing that pre-adolescent gonadectomy in rats reduced the sex-dependent differences in body weight and prefrontal cortex maturation 63, 64 . In our results, males started with higher SAT% than VAT%, and exercise prevented both SAT% and VAT% gain compared to the control, with a higher effect on VAT% (Fig. 7E-F') . These results suggest that our exercise program has increased benefits in males' VAT, and therefore can potentially reduce the risk of developing pathologies related to visceral adiposity [65] [66] [67] [68] , and preventing critical COVID-19 illness 69 . The absence of effect in the adipose delta values of female rats might suggest that the prevalence of obesity during adolescence in humans is greater in females than males. However, epidemiological studies based on body mass index suggest there is no more prevalence of overweight and obesity in girls than boys 70 . Further studies are required to understand if a different exercise load is required to decrease the adipose content of adolescent female rats. The decrease of female SAT% observed in control rats between P27 and P45 contrasts with the observed increase between P30 and P60 of the baseline rats, suggesting that SAT% in females increases mainly after P45. Regarding the lean tissue, in our study both trained females and males showed higher delta lean values. On the other hand, trained females showed lower bone gains than their control, while trained males showed higher bone gain. These results are in line with the available evidence in adolescent humans showing that exercise enhances lean body mass [71] [72] [73] .",

Cortright et al. 25 observed sexdependent effects on the weight and body composition of male and female SD rats after 63 days of voluntary running from early adolescence through young adulthood (P21-84). However, only after 49 days of voluntary running the effects in weight were observed (P70, young adulthood). In Cortright's study, the body composition was determined ex-vivo on P84, and therefore the delta and percentual increment values were not obtained, but no effect was observed in females. Nonetheless, in our study we found that forced wheel running produced body weight differences in adolescent males even 10 days after exercise onset, and the body composition differences were observed in-vivo after 18 days of forced running. Complementarily, the study of Applegate et al. 58 found that after a training in forced treadmill during young adulthood (P78-100) of Osborne-Mendel rats, only males decreased in weight. In the same study, both males and females showed lower body fat after the exercise program, but the effect was higher in males than females. Finally, a voluntary running for 12 months in adult mice (1-year-old) decreased body weight, body fat and lean contents in both females and males 59 . Taken together, these data suggest that the sex-dependent results we observed with forced wheel exercise may occur mainly during the adolescence.",

Serum estradiol levels in female SD rats are detectable during adolescence and increases gradually, reaching adult values at P48 74 .

Further studies will need to determine if these hormonal increases occur in adolescent rats during the aerobic training and if these hormonal changes can be causally related with the changes in body composition.

Hypothalamic nuclei such as arcuate (through POMC and AGRP neurons) and dorsomedian, involved in the control of food intake and energy expenditure 76 are affected by the adipokine leptin, secreted by the adipose tissue. This hormone reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure, it shows higher sensitivity in females than males and was observed that exercise can decrease its concentrations in woman 77, 78 . Sexual dimorphism was determined in diet-induced rodent obesity models, with females being more resistant to storing fat 79 . Also, a better improvement in food intake and weight was observed in some obesity treatments in female mice, representing a sexual dimorphism probably dependent of leptin effects 80 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In summary, our data indicate that the most drastic changes in the body composition of SD rats occur during the adolescence when compared with the young adulthood, and that adolescent male rats showed higher susceptibility to body weight and body composition changes than females when subjected to forced wheel exercise. Also, this susceptibility seems to occur mainly in the adolescence. Future studies should analyze the molecular mechanisms which mediate the decrease of adipose tissue under physical activity in males but not females during the early adolescence.",
