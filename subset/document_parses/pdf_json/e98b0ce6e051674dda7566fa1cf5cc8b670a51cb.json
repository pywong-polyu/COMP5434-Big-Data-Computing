In this study, we aim to share our experience of telemedicine in our pediatric endocrinology clinic during the pandemic. Methods We were able to continue caring for children with endocrine disorders using various communication methods such as e-mail and e-message. Results A total of 267 patients received telemedicine care over the course of 608 contacts. The number of hospital visits and physical contact was effectively reduced to help protect against the COVID-19 infection. The patients were supported in terms of receiving their prescriptions and patient education also continued. No complications were observed. Conclusion The advantages and disadvantages of telemedicine were discussed and consequently, we propose that telemedicine can be utilized to maintain and continue the care of children with endocrine disorders during and even after the pandemic. Further studies are needed to standardize this method for general use.",

            "text": "In early December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin were identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [1] . As a result, a novel beta-coronavirus was named-the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-which resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2, 3] . The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the 2019-nCoV public health emergency was of international concern on January 30 and declared it to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [4] . In Turkey, the first positive case was detected on March 11, 2020 [5] . The number of cases of COVID-19 in Turkey had been rising daily and hospitals were instructed to receive acute cases only. Over the following days, the government's \"stay at home order\" for children, and families' fear of the COVID-19, infection led to changes in the delivery of health services. One of these changes was the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine is not novel, long-distance communication for health purposes has a long history. For example, consultation by written correspondence was common from the mid-1600 s through to the 1700s [6] . In the following years, telemedicine use developed and became widespread. A search of PubMed from 2010 to 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) using the keywords \"telemedicine\" and \"telehealth\" reveals more than 39,636 papers published.",

            "text": "We showed that telemedicine is an effective method for managing pediatric patients with endocrine diseases, especially in certain subgroups (hyperinsulinism, metabolic bone disease, diabetes, pituitary disorders, thyroid disease, and pubertal disorders) without complications. Telemedicine, which has been utilized since 1600, especially during periods of war and natural disasters, became popular again with the COVID-19 pandemic, which started locally in 2019 and then spread to the entire world [1, 4, 6] . Previous studies have focused on the advantages and disadvantages of telemedicine. Some of the listed disadvantages are a requirement of internet access, insufficient technological ability of the patients, and the inability to perform a physical [8] [9] [10] . Regelmann et al. reported that telemedicine provides a practical tool that can be utilized in pediatric endocrinology clinics [15] . We also evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of this method during the COVID-19 pandemic in our clinic ( Table 3) . Some of our patients who had difficulty using e-mail chose to use e-messages for communication. Those who could not use either method were contacted by telephone or scheduled a face-to-face appointment if necessary. The Italian Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Association recommendations include communication with the health staff by telemedicine, increased use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and continued insulin treatment along with precautions for protection from the COVID infection [16] . Another study on diabetic children and their families reported that the families were satisfied with telemedicine [11] . Our patients were also satisfied with having their regular follow-up by e-mail and e-message without needing to come to the hospital. Other studies similarly reported that face-to-face visits are essential, but technology helps the remote control of diabetes [12] . In a study from Sweden, patients with type 1 diabetes were followed by telemedicine with occasional hospital visits, and they showed an increase in the use of CGM and continuous insulin infusion with a decrease in HbA1c [13] . Studies in adult patients with type 1 diabetes have also reported successful diabetes education regarding hypoglycemia, stress, sick-day, ketosis management, and protection from COVID-19 [14] . In our study, telemedicine proved helpful in preventing ketoacidosis and none of our patients were admitted to the emergency room or hospitalized during the pandemic. Furthermore, our patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies or adrenal deficiency complied with their treatment, education for adrenal crisis management was reinforced, and hospital visits were reduced.",
