            "text": "Recent deep learning methods for fruits classification resulted in promising performance. However, these methods are with heavy-weight architectures in nature, and hence require a higher storage and expensive training operations due to feeding a large number of training parameters. There is a necessity to explore lightweight deep learning models without compromising the classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and attention module. First, the convolution features are extracted to capture the high-level object-based information. Second, an attention module is used to capture the interesting semantic information. The convolution and attention modules are then combined together to fuse both the high-level objectbased information and the interesting semantic information, which is followed by the fully connected layers and the softmax layer. Evaluation of our proposed method, which leverages transfer learning approach, on three public fruit-related benchmark datasets shows that our proposed method outperforms the four latest deep learning methods with a smaller number of trainable parameters and a superior classification accuracy. Our model has a great potential to be adopted by industries closely related to the fruit growing and retailing or processing chain for automatic fruit identification and classifications in the future.",

            "text": "In automated fruit classification, two major techniques, traditional computer-vision based methods and deep learning-based methods, have been researched. The traditional computer vision-based methods first extract the low-level features and then perform image classification using the traditional machine learning method, whereas the deep learning-based methods extract the features effectively and perform an end-to-end image classification [4] . In the traditional computer vision and image processing methods, imagery features, such as texture, color, and shape, have been used as inputs for fruit classification. For example, Muhammad et al. [5] proposed an automatic classification of 'Date' fruit using hand-crafted features. A classification accuracy of 98% was reported with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A cucumber shape classification system based on shape features, such as area, perimeter, eccentricity, extent, roundness, compresses, width-non-homogeneity and centroid-non-homogeneity, was proposed by Kheiralipour et al. [6] in which the neural network (NN) was trained to classify cucumber into two shapes: desirable and undesirable, which produced a classification accuracy of 97.10%. With the rise of deep learning (DL)-based methods in various disciplines, such as stock market [7] , scene images [8] , biomedical [9] , and privacy [10] , researchers have been working towards the development of deep learning-based methods for the fruits classification problem, using the transfer learning (TL) approach mostly [11, 12] . For example, Bhole et al. [11] explored the applicability of the TL approach in fruit classification utilizing a pre-trained model, called SqueezeNet [13] , to classify Mangoes into three grades: extra class, class I and class-II. They evaluated the proposed model for the classification of Mango ripeness and size, which achieved an accuracy of 93.33% and 92.27% on the RGB image dataset and thermal dataset, respectively. In a similar study, Xiang et al. [14] achieved a classification accuracy of 85.12% using the TL approach on lightweight MobileNetV2 [15] model with a dataset of 3,670 images for five fruits: apple, banana, carambola, guava and kiwi.",

A convolutional neural network (CNN) with four convolutional layers, each followed by a max-pooling layer, fully connected layer and finally, softmax layer, was used for the fruit classification.

Firstly, such methods mostly require a large number of trainable parameters although they claim that their models to be lightweight architectures.

These fruit images' features dimensions were first reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) [23] and then fed into the classification algorithms such as fedforward neural network (FNN) and support vector machine (SVM). They experimented with 1,653 color fruit images from the 18 different fruit classes and reported the highest accuracy of 88.2% with SVM. However, the fruit images used in the experiments are finegrained and they did not include the fruits in various conditions such as sliced, dried, and partially covered. Authors in [24] used a Random Forest (RF) method for three kinds of fruits classification: Strawberry, Apple, and Oranges. They used traditional feature extraction approaches to extract various features such as color, shape and scale invariant features (SIFT). Their results show that fruits with different shapes are difficult to classify than the fruits with the similar shapes. However, their experiments used the limited number of fruit samples (137 fruit images in total). The combination of machine learning algorithms and color space for Cape gooseberry ripeness classification was attempted in [25] . They used 925 fruit samples for model training and validation and reported that SVM produced the best F1-measure (70.14%) among twelve different machine learning classifiers. However, their method suffers from a limited performance and small dataset size. Their method is limited to the PCA-based feature fusion and have not considered the other feature fusion methods such as fusion of score or decisions. A local binary pattern based features were used in bark texture classification using multilayer neural network [26] . Similarly, a tomato classifier system was proposed in [21] using traditional image features such as color shape and size. A total of 100 tomato images were considered for classifying into large, small, and medium classes along with four grades. They achieved a mean grading accuracy of 90.7%. A similar study on post-harvest banana classification using machine learning method such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), SVM, and RF was investigated in [27] . They considered four classes of banana: \"extra class\", \"class I\",\"class II\" and \"reject\" and collected a banana dataset of 1,164 instances. The reported results show that RF classifier with an accuracy of 94.20% outperforms the remaining classifiers.",

These spectra were then fed into two machine learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The overall classification accuracy produced by their method was 87.25%. Also, a strawberry ripeness classification using multispectral imaging of 17 bands was proposed in [29] , where the PCA was applied to reduce the dimension of multispectral images' features. Then, these feature were used in three classifiers: Partial least square (PLS), SVM and ANN. Their results show that it achieved a higher classification accuracy of 100% when using the SVM classifier. The VIS (visual wave-bands) part of spectra were the main contributors in ripeness classification in their method.",

Basically, DL-based method consists of a larger neural network having a numbers of layers, nodes, and activation functions [30] . Recently, deep learning methods become very popular and widely used in image classification tasks. Many works [3, 4, 17, 31] reported the promising results on fruit image classification task using deep learning methods. For example, Rojas et al. [17] proposed a lightweight CNN model for the classification on Fruit-360 dataset, which showed that the performance of CNN is increased by including additional features such as Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color and histogram. The highest accuracy was 93% for fruit classification in their method. However, the dataset used in their work consists of a limited number of fruits classes for Banana, Orange, and Apple. Furthermore, Joseph et al. [4] proposed a CNN model for fruit classification on the Fruit-360 dataset, which achieved an classification accuracy of 94.35%. And Hossain et al. [3] proposed a lightweight CNN model and compared it with fine-tuned VGG-16 model [32] for fruit classification on two datasets. Their method achieved a classification accuracy of 99.49% and 85.43% for their dataset-1 and dataset-2, respectively. In the meantime, Femling et al. [31] developed the system to classify fruits in retail store by capturing video with installed camera. They used two convolutional neural networks: InceptionV3 [33] , and MobileNet [34] to detect and classify fruits and vegetable on video. The highest accuracy of 76% was achieved with InceptionV3 for ten-class fruit dataset. Furthermore, Chakraborty et al. [35] employed the MobileNetV2 model [15] with max-pooling and average-pooling to identify the rotten fruits.",

Their model considered its applicability in low-power and limited resource devices. They also added an extra convolution and a dropout layer on the top of base MobileNetV2 architecture. The MobileNetV2 pre-trained on 'ImageNet' dataset was used as a feature extractor, which was then fine-tuned with softmax layer on five-class fruit dataset with 3,213 training images. An accuracy of 85.12% was reported on fruit images (457 images) in validation set. However, this study is limited to five different types of fruits and has a limited number of samples. Similarly, Bahera et al. [41] conducted a non-destructive Papaya maturity classification using traditional machine learning method such as KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and transfer-learning with various pretrained CNNs such as ResNet101, ResNet50, ResNet18, VGG-19, VGG-16, GoogleNet and AlexNet. They reported the highest accuracy for maturity classification (100%) when using pre-trained model, VGG-19 in comparison to other models. Nevertheless, due to the small training samples (only 300 fine papaya images), their method seem to be over-fitted and couldn't be generalized for other unseen fruits samples. Besides fruit classification, a few studies attempted to classify the fruit diseases using computer vision and machine learning in the literature [22] . A citrus diseases classification was done using two lightweight pretrained models: SqueezeNet [13] and MobileNetV2 [15] , which was proposed by Khan et al. [22] . Their results show that the SqueezeNet model outperforms the Mobilenetv2 with an accuracy of 96% while classifying the features extracted from the corresponding pre-trained model for citrus disease using SVM classifier.",

In other words, the use of CNN for image recognition and classification is not only becomes a trend in fruit classification [3] but also in other domains such as biomedical image analysis [9] , scene images recognition [8] , remote sensing image analysis [45] and so on. Thus, convolutional operations are major contributors in computer vision tasks but they are computationally expensive when the network structure goes deeper and larger as in VGG-16 [32] , and Incep-tionV3 [33] . The MobileNetV1 [34] model brought the idea of depth-wise separable convolution, which divides the convolution into two sub-tasks: a depth-wise convolution that filters the input and a point-wise convolution (1 \u00d7 1) that combine these filtered values to create new features. The complete architecture of MobileNetV1 had a regular (3 \u00d7 3) convolution layer followed by 13 depth-wise separable convolution blocks [34] . The MobileNetV2 [15] model added the expand layer, residual connections and projection layers in addition to depth-wise convolution layers known as a bottleneck residual block. The expansion convolution layer (1 \u00d7 1) expands the number of channels according to the expansion factors whereas the projection layer reduces the number of channels into a tensor of lower channels. The residual connection helps the flow of gradients through the network. Here, each convolution layer is followed by the batch normalization and ReLu6 activation layer, ReLu6 being a variant of ReLu activation function limited to maximum size of 6. The complete MobileNetV2 architecture consists of 17 such bottleneck residual blocks followed by a regular (1 \u00d7 \u00d7 1) convolution, a average pooling layer, and a classification layer [15] (refer to Table 1) .",

As more researchers started working on attention mechanism, various models of attention evolved out [46] . Here, we are more interested in attention mechanism that not only points us where to focus on but also represents the spatial relationship of visual clues in the fruit images. Such attention module has been studies extensively in literature [46, 47] . Our attention module is based on convolutional block attention module (CBAM) proposed by Woo et al. [46] . In CBAM, it has two modules: channel attention and spatial attention modules. The channel attention module tries to capture \"what\" is important in the given images, whereas the spatial attention module focuses on 'where' or which part of an image is important (spatial). To focus on where is an informative part in the fruit image, the implementation of our attention module follow the spatial attention approach. Firstly, we perform the max-pooling and average pooling on the input from the convolution module. Secondly, the max-pooled tensor and average-pooled tensors are concatenated as suggested by Woo et al. [46] . Finally, convolution with a filter size of (7 \u00d7 7) is used to activate the visual clues in images with the sigmoid activation function. The overall steps for attention module are summarized in Eqs (2) and (3) F2\u00f0I\u00de",

However, our method outperforms the second-best performing method (MobileNetV2+TL [14] ) by 0.89%, and the least-performing method (Fruit-CNN [17] ) by at least 3.69% better in classification accuracy with the least number of trainable parameters (refer to Table 4 ). Table 3 . Precision, Recall, Kappa-score, MAF1, WAF1, and Acc. on D1, D2, and D3 using averaged metrics over five runs (%). For D3, our method is the only outstanding performer, bettered all other DL methods by large margins in all evaluation metrics. This is likely due to the fact that the images in this dataset contain the heterogeneous background that require more useful features extracted from the image so as to properly separate the fruits from the backgrounds. The other DL methods only use the convolution features from the images for fruit classifications and hence are likely to be negatively affected by the heterogeneous backgrounds in the images. However, our method combines both the convolution and attention features extracted from images together, resulting in a higher performance against other DL methods. While observing results for dataset D3, we can speculate that the three CNNs (Light-CNN [3] , Fruit-CNN [17] , CNN-Augementation [4] ) have the least performance in comparison to their own performance on other two datasets (D1 and D2). However, the MobileNetV2+TL [14] model has the consistent performance over all three datasets. The reason for this might be the features captured from the pre-trained model on 'ImageNet' dataset (which is the large image dataset with millions of images) while other three models are trained from scratch on the fruit-images only.",

With this strategy, we are able to reduce the training time (1774.10 seconds) compared to all other DL methods. This will makes our model easy for training and deploy in the new fruit image domains quickly.

We choose five pre-trained models (DenseNet-121 [37] , NASNetMobile [38] , VGG-16 [32] , MobileNetV1 [34] and InceptionV3 [33] ) for this comparison cohort as they are widely-used for fruit classification related applications. For instance, authors in [36] investigated the DenseNet [37] for oil palm fruit ripeness classification and produced the highest classification accuracy (86%). The transfer learning and fine-tuning of MobileNetV1 [34] , InceptionV3 [33] and other CNNs were implemented in [14] for fruit classification. The VGG-16 [32] is still popular CNN model for the feature extraction and has been used in various domains ranging for medical image analysis [54] to fruit classification [39] . Among these five models, 'NASNetMobile' and 'MobileNetV1' are lightweight models while the rest are considered as the large and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We believe that the comparative benchmarking of our model with both lightweight and heavy weight pre-trained models prove the robustness of our model. Our method outperforms all pre-trained models in comparison cohort in all performance metrics as shown in Table 6 . For D1, the DenseNet-121 [37] is the second-best performing model with an accuracy of 94.53 while MobileNetV1 [34] has the least classification accuracy (86.69%) being lower by 9.06% with our method. The similar pattern is seen in other two datasets (D2 and D3), too, where the DenseNet-121 [37] is the second-best performing model in most of the performance metrics while our method is the best performer among all other contenders in most of the evaluation measures. It is interesting to note that our method being a lightweight method has comparable performance to those large and deeper CNNs ('VGG-16', 'InceptionV3', 'DenseNet-121').",

While observing the first row, the feature map for Avocado fruits in convolution module is rendering at the centre of image while an attention module is more focused on specific salient regions such as corners and other regions than the convolution module. Similar patterns are observed in other fruits as well except the second row for banana fruit, where the attention module couldn't capture any region of interest. This might be due to the uniform textures present in this image which don't have any specific information to be captured by attention module. However, the convolution module is able to capture the sufficient features to distinguish the Banana fruits from other fruits as evident from higher classification accuracy of our model reported in Table 3 .

            "text": "In this paper, we presented a novel attention-convolution module based MobileNetV2 to classify the fruit images. Our method has achieved the stable classification accuracy of 95.75%, 96.74%, and 96.23% on Dataset 1 (D1), Dataset 2 (D2), and Dataset 3 (D3), respectively. Given the lightweight nature of our model, our method has a great potential to be adopted by industries closely related to the fruit growing and retailing or processing chain for automatic fruit identification and classifications in the future. Our method has some limitations. First, our method relies on MobilenetV2 architecture. Hence, our model has not been tried with other user-defined lightweight backbone architectures. Second, our method uses online data augmentation only for our experiments. The performance of our model could be further improved by using or partly using other advanced offline data augmentation techniques, such as the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Third, the combination of features obtained from other layers of MobileNetV2 would be worth exploring for improving the performance of fruit classifications. We also need to explore how our method can efficiently operate in a mobile environment, or on a cutting-edge computing platform, particularly in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. ",
