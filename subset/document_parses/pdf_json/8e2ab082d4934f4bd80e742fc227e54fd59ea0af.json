            "text": "We recall that the publication of this body of works is motivated by the progressively relevant challenge of managing information in the world where increasingly large amounts of loosely structured data are becoming available, e.g., due to the integration of information from heterogeneous data sources. It is acknowledged that traditional relational database tools and techniques alone are not sufficient to address this challenge, but complementing them with new techniques rooted in Knowledge Representation (KR) is believed to be a viable way to alleviate the problem. KR is an active research area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is developing methods for representing complex human knowledge in various formalisms, equipped with automated reasoning methods for a computer to draw useful conclusions from the represented knowledge. We recall that in this special issue we are mostly interested in knowledge captured in ontologies, expressed in Description Logics (DLs) as well as various rule-based languages. For a broader introduction to the area, we encourage an interested reader to see the dedicated survey [14] . DLs and rule-based languages are two prominent families of formalisms used in knowledge representation, yet they are orthogonal in many ways, and have their own advantages and disadvantages. DLs are more suitable for structuring knowledge and data, an advantage that has led DLs to be used as the logical foundation for the OWL family of ontology languages recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In contrast to DLs, rules are very suitable for expressing various information needs, which is witnessed by their use as query languages for relational databases (DATALOG being the most prominent rule-based query language). For this reason, understanding ways of combining the strengths of DLs and rule-based languages is an active research area, which we touch upon in this part of the special issue [1, 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] . In contrast to standard rule-based languages, in DLs one usually makes the open-world assumption, which is suitable for constructing generic, reusable, data-independent ontologies. In rule-based languages usually the closed-world assumption is made in order to draw some common-sense conclusions from the concrete available data. Combining the closed-world and the open-world assumptions naturally leads to non-monotonic reasoning over DL ontologies, which is another focus topic of the second part of the special issue [11, 16] . A prerequisite for the practical use of logic-based ontologies in data management is the ability to manage logical inconsistencies, which can easily arise due to human errors during the construction of ontologies, or due to the integration of information coming from incompatible data sources. This topic is closely related not only to non-monotonic reasoning but also to the ability to explain logical entailments and non-entailments in DL ontologies. This broad area is also represented in this special issue [3, 10, 12] . Finally, we note that there is a strong connection between rule-based languages and the Horn fragment of first-order logic, and thus various Horn DLs are also discussed here [9, 13] .",
