The findings also show that the optimal timing of easing of lockdowns while mitigating the possibility of re-emergence of a second epidemic wave requires avoiding the scenario of releasing too-many-too-soon. It is and sizes in China using an approach that integrated population migration and COVID-19 epidemiological data into a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model together with an artificial intelligence approach. Also, Carcione et al. [20] demonstrated how mathematical models can be used to generate meaningful insights amidst epidemiological and etiological data challenges. They simulated a COVID-19 epidemic for Italy based on an SEIR model and they emphasized the importance of assessing the effectiveness of lockdowns on epidemic burden. Relatedly, Chintalapudi et al. [21] concluded basing on outcomes of their data driven model analysis that if the Italian government extended the March 2020 country lockdown and self-isolation measures by 60 days, the number of registered cases would decrease by 35% while those recovered would increase by 66%. All these studies demonstrate the utility of mathematical models in assessing the impact of intervention measures on COVID-19 dynamics. On using modeling to assess how efficiently lockdown restrictions can be eased in the United Kingdom, Rawson et al. [22] applied an optimal control framework to an adapted SEIR model framework and found that the optimal strategy was a phased-out release.",

Additionally, although there are other approaches to modeling lockdown (e.g. [22] ), our approach of having a given percentage of the susceptible population being totally unavailable to mingle was motivated by Uganda's strictness in enforcing lockdown measures. Using this model, implications of complacency, non-adherence to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) to curb disease spread as well as the timing and magnitude of easing lockdown are assessed. Ultimately, the study generates information to guide to the design of intervention measures suitable for the country and by extension, for other countries with similar demographic and other generic characteristics.",

Moreover, if the population size remains more or less constant as an epidemic passes through, then density-and frequency-dependent models are equivalent [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . The underlying compartmental model is of the SEIHR(S) format with the population split into compartments determined by their disease status. These include S(t) representing the susceptible population E(t) representing the latently infected individuals, the I(t)-class split into I a (t) for the asymptomatic infectious and I s (t) for the symptomatic infectious individuals, H(t) for the hospitalized cases, and R(t) representing the recovered individuals.",

These results demonstrate that if we ease lockdown by releasing 50% of susceptible population for the Ugandan situation with 3200 hospital beds (of which only 55 were functional ICU as of 2018 [34] ) within 150 days, the COVID-19 related hospitalization demand would have already overwhelmed the current resources. Besides over-stretching the health care system, the number of undetected cases that would be living freely in the community, of whom a half would be asymptomatic and hence harder to detect, would further strain disease response efforts of contact tracing. Note that, even in the relatively ideal situations of maintaining only 10% or 30% of susceptible population mingling, the maximum hospitalization requirements would reach 369 and 844 beds respectively within one year, way beyond the number of functional ICU beds.",

Moreover, even in the near perfect scenario (C2) where all asymptomatically infected are blocked along with blocking 90% of arriving latently infected entrants, the disease will persist in the community past the one year simulated period.

Thus it can concluded that, even in a fairly ideal situation in which the control efforts in place (e.g., total elimination of imported cases manage to initially curb the spread of the virus, once the lockdown is hurriedly lifted, the yet-to-be detected cases in the community, no matter how few, have potential to start a second wave of infection.",

This impact of imported cases is also emphasized by the findings from the sensitivity analysis. Currently, these cases are being regulated through enforcement of mandatory screening for clinical signs and testing at border points. This screening faces a challenge of reagent limitation, imperfect test accuracy, arrival of asymptomatic and latently infected individuals that may pass as false negatives during screening as well as the porosity of some of the national borders. Thus, adoption of alternative less-risky means of essential cargo delivery (e.g., by rail and ship services) combined with quarantining of all entrants for a duration not shorter than the incubation period should be enforced. Besides improving test accuracy and sample handling, the number of false negatives can also be minimized by ensuring that individuals do not get infected so close to being tested as the disease is not detectable until the latent period is surpassed. Thus, avenues of infection at testing points need to be eliminated. With the worrying situation of increased reported cases in our neighboring countries, the impact of Uganda's interventions would be greatly affected.",

The results in Fig 4 reveal that, even in a fairly ideal situation with no new arrivals of imported cases, once the lockdown is hurriedly lifted to a 75% level, the yet-to-be detected cases in the community have potential to start a second and more disastrous epidemic wave.

Contact tracing can further be improved through increasing manpower, improving efficiency follow-up tools e.g., registry, public awareness and incentives to ensure voluntary/self-reporting and empowering of local response teams. Although the parameter influencing the number of hospital acquired infections was of relatively low impact on the number of symptomatic cases in the sensitivity analysis, field experience with handling COVID-19 in other countries (note that Uganda did not report any hospital acquired infection for the first two months of her epidemic) as well as diseases such as Ebola in Uganda dictates that this should be maintained at a bare minimum to ensure that health workers do not shun their duties. It is clear that hospital acquired infections go beyond merely increasing the number of cases, their mitigation should be given high priority. This can be achieved through ensuring appropriate use of properly fitting personal protective equipment, providing refresher training to the frontline medical personnel and ensuring adequate staffing at the treatment and sample collection centers among others.",

For example, the COVID-19 induced mortality rate derived for this study based on data from Uganda is relatively lower than global values (e.g., those reported in [36] ) and this may be validated in future. The other parameter that has been reported to vary widely across countries is the percentage of asymptomatic individuals. Several studies have estimated this proportion using data from different sources including hospitals and cruise ships and their estimated values have ranged from 18% to 81% [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .",

Although we assumed constant external disease pressure in this study, we recommend that future studies adopt the network modeling approach whenever relevant data to substantiate those network based models is available. On lockdown modeling, we assumed that a percentage of the susceptible population was isolated by the lockdown restrictions and hence impossible to become infected. This assumption is justified by the strictness in enforcing these measures in Uganda. However, for relatively lax implementation of the measures, alternative approaches such as that involving splitting the population into the quarantine and non-quarantine groups as done by [22] could be more suitable.",
