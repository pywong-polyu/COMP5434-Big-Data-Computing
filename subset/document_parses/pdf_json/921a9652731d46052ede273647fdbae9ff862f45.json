            "text": "December 2019 a new strand of coronavirus named SARS-CoV2, which causes novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan District, China. It is thought that COVID-19 outbreak has animal origins that slipped from animal species into the human population. [5] [6] [7] The COVID-19 outbreak still continues to spreading aggressively world-wide. Complex and highly contagious nature of COVID-19 had led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare this outbreak a public health emergency. [8] [9] [10] In spite of taken drastic preventive measures and implement entire lockdown policies by many governments, COVID-19 now becomes a notable pandemic in global scale, which made tremendous impact on the health and safety of people all over the world, as well affecting their health status and causing a significant number of deaths. There are also other induced critical situations as indirect impacts of this pandemic, such as psychological distress, economic crises and might lead to serious challenges and threats in many societies. [11] [12] [13] [14] The exponential daily increasing number of infected cases, and high rate mortality particularly in susceptible populations such as elderly, pregnant women, and people with underlying comorbidities such as low immune functions, cardiopulmonary diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, hypertension, and diabetes make it necessary to seek early detection and isolation positive cases as rapidly and accurately as possible for containing the transmission of the virus especially for asymptomatic cases in early stages. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Medical diagnosis is intrinsic and intricate task that demands principally being accomplished precisely and proficiently. [21, 22] In context of COVID-19, Owing to its unfamiliar many aspects of and the similarity of its primary symptoms to other respiratory infectious diseases, this makes it challenging for early differential diagnosis. [23, 24] So far real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are complicated in operation and can take up to 2 day or even longer to get the results. As well, due to the low virus loads in early infected COVID-19 patients, RT-PCR tests show false negative results in a number of cases. [25, 26] Besides RT-PCR, computed tomography (CT) scan has become a valuable method to assist in the diagnosis and management of symptomatic suspected COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, it findings are normal or with minor radiological signs in some patients at early stages of disease and the lesions are usually small and their appearances are quite similar with that of other pneumonia. In addition, these techniques are time-consuming and increase the infection risk of the clinicians and usually prohibited for all suspected cases due to the limitation of resources. [27] [28] [29] As a good alternative, artificial intelligence (AI) may be the unique preparation to take up this challenge. [30, 31] AI can enable the machine to learn from past experience, adjust to new inputs, and simulating human intelligence tasks. [32, 33] Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms seeking for hidden and previously unknown patterns from large sets of data. [34] A major focus of ML in health care is to automatically produce models and correlations from raw data and leverage this extracted useful information to make clinical decisions. [35] ML based predictive model is of great importance to prediction and prognosis of COVID-19 infection. [36] These are the important factors while the healthcare industry resources are limited to fighting against disease pandemic. Albahri et al. showed that the use of ML technologies to provide predictive models can be significantly helpful in a timely, effective, and economical diagnosis of the disease. [37] Sharma suggested the use of the ML algorithms compared to traditional methods is good choices for early stage disease screening. It is extremely important to identify the disease at early asymptomatic phases of COVID-19 and promptly confinement the infected cases. [38] The real-time and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 through the use of computational ML algorithms is the foundation for the prompt management of the patients. [36, 39] It could discriminate COVID-19 patients from other similar conditions with a better accuracy than other common and traditional approaches. [40, 41] Therefore, in this COVID-19 big data era, we aimed to construct predicting diagnostic models using of selected ML algorithms such as Na\u00efve Bayesian (NB), Bayesian Net (BN), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), K-star, C4.5, and support vector machine (SVM) on COVID-19 dataset. Then, the recital of selected ML was assessed on six diverse classification performance indices in presence and absence of chest CT-Scan features. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is also used for performance measurement. Finally, a data-driven predictive analytics model using the best performance was developed.",

The experts were asked to review the initial list of parameters to score each item according to their importance in developing COVID-19 based on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated \"not important\" and 5 indicated \"highly important\". Only the parameters with average score of 3.75 (70%) and higher were allowed into the study (predictors features).

[43] [44] [45] C4.5 C4.5 is an important decision tree algorithm. Its capabilities such as missing values accounting, decision tree pruning by determining confidence factors, extracting rule and considering continuous attribute value range, make the C4.5 algorithm a better choice than other tree algorithms. This algorithm uses divide and conquer strategies for decision tree making based on independent and dependent variables. In each node of the tree, the splitting function is done by attribute that can predict samples in each class more precisely. Initially, the C4.5 rule sets are made by unpruned tree and each path from root node to leaf transformed to a prototype rule that is associated to leaf node label. [46] [47] [48] ",

In contrary to other algorithms that the node splitting process are done by the best all variable split, in RF this process done by the subset of this predictors randomly. The diversity of trees is important in RF performance. [49, 50] Bayesian Net BN is a probabilistic graphical models and knowledge representation technique for uncertainty management and decision making that formulates a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies within an annotated directed acyclic graph. These graphical structures are used to shows the variables that each variable occurs independently. In particular, each node in the graph represents a random variable, while the edges between the nodes represent probabilistic dependencies among the corresponding random variables. [51, 52] Multilayer perceptron MLP is a feed forward ANN model for prediction of the class label of tuples that maps input data onto a set of appropriate outputs in three input, output and processing (hidden) layers. Each layer contains a group of neurons that are generally associated with all the neurons of the other layers in a directed graph. Except for the input nodes, every node is a neuron (or processing element) with a nonlinear activation. [53] [54] [55] K-star K-star is an instance based classifier that is the class of test instance is based upon the class of those training instances similar to it, as determined by some similarity function. It differs from other instance based learners in that it uses an entropy based distance function. [56, 57] Na\u00efve Bayesian NB is a probability-based model that works on the basis of Bayes theorem and assumes independence between variables to perform a classification task. It is greatly leveraged in to classify and label the objects or points. In addition, owing to its simplicity, this algorithm is very suitable for large datasets and produce highly accurate models.

The evaluation of diagnostic models was done using of 10-fold cross validation according accuracy, specificity, precision, sensitivity, F measure, and ROC criteria [ Table 2 ].",

However, in the RF, the value of all performance criteria increased by an average of 3.02. In nonspecialist medical centers, the diagnosis is usually made only on the basis of clinical examination and patient history. As a result, RF is the best model for screening people in these centers. Eventually, the RF tags was designed by Weka application software version 3.8 [ Figure 4 ] and it GUI developed by Visual Studio 2018 application software [ Figure 5 ]. ",

[59] In this regard, for appropriate preparedness against to ongoing global pandemic, WHO, and scientific community across the world have are suggesting for various innovative technologies and IT-based solutions to monitoring of infected patients, find best clinical trials, accurate patient screening and diagnosis, control the spread of virus, and tracking of infected patients. [60] Timely and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, provide a better plan for health policymakers and clinician in order to mitigating disease outbreak and improved patient survival probability. [61] Although multiple studies have shown that traditional statistical modeling can offer exact models, today AI-based solutions (computational techniques) could play a pivotal role to mining high-quality models and relationships. [34, 62] Nowadays, like prior pandemics, health-care industries, and clinicians worldwide employed various novel technologies such as AI (intelligent diagnoses based ML or deep learning (DL) algorithms) to fight against COVID-19 and address the challenges during this severe universal life-threatening disease. [63] Developing diagnostic prediction models for pandemic diseases such as COVID-19 is very imperative in determining their likely new cases at early stage. [64, 65] The purpose of the current study was to apply ML algorithms to devise a prediction model to identify of likely infected cases by providing an accurate and reliable tool to help medical decision makers and triage COVID-19 patients more effectively and accurately. Predictive models based ML models for COVID-19 diagnosis can greatly contribute to recognize high risk groups, early detection of disease, and adoption of effective treatment plans. Using of ML for mining of large amounts of dataset is essential for optimal prevention, screening, care, treatment and tracing of COVID-19. This led to reducing uncertainty and ambiguity by offering evidence-base medicine for risk analysis, prediction, and treatment. [66] Given that ML techniques can efficiently extract and exploring of hidden patterns in large datasets and identifying feature correlations, hence this article is focused on ML techniques to dealing with preparedness for COVID-19. This study aimed to the evaluation of seven ML algorithms on COVID-19 dataset in the presence and absence of CT-Scan findings. In addition, we performed feature selection to determine the most important feature set for this task by using an extensive literature review alongside expert consensus approach. These methods were validated using 10-fold cross validation and evaluated in terms of various performance measurements.",

            "text": "Several researches have been published focused on applying and evaluating of ML techniques in COVID-19 early prognosis, screening, risk assessment, and trend and Logistic techniques. [14] Moftakhar et al. showed that ARIMA prediction model was more accurate than ANN, SVM and RF techniques. [69] Alakus et al., assessed the performance of selected DL algorithms including ANN, CNN, LSTM, RNN, CNNLSTM, and CNNRNN for COVID-19 diagnosis and the best meaningful results observed from LSTM model. [70] It is proven using DL reached better accuracy, and AUC scores than ML classifiers. [68, 71] However in this study, we did not use of DL approaches. We developed seven different ML application models, and the empirical results reveal that RF algorithm yielded higher performance as compared to other six ML techniques. This study has several limitations that need to be addressed. First, the major limitation is the size of the dataset. 501 patient's information from only one medical center was considered as sample size although external validation of variables was conducted by multi-disciplinary of medical and public health experts. Second, some laboratory variables could not be measured for some patients. In addition to these, the data were imbalanced or uneven, thus we balanced the data by omitting some fields. The performance of these models can be enhanced with a larger dataset. Further studies need to be carried out with more optimized clinical parameters from bigger and multicenter databases. Third, we did not compare the performance of algorithms other than the seven algorithms that used in this study. It requires further investigations that exploiting different ML or even DL algorithms on COVID-19 dataset. In future research, the scope of application of the model should be expanded by incorporating more comprehensive training data. This study introduced the ML techniques as an effective and practical alternative to routine para-clinical measures for identifying COVID-19 positive patients. This is in particular beneficial in those developing countries like Iran which is exposed to heavy sanctions and suffering from shortages of essential healthcare resources.",

For that end, the data were standardized and used as inputs for the ML algorithms. Later, classification was performed and the performances of the models were measured. The best accuracy, recall and AUC values were obtained with RF model of 92.3%, 93.68%, and 90.00%, respectively. By comparing the results of model performance assessment, it could be found that after conduct feature selection, the performance of all seven algorithms was improved and better than the baseline model. Finally, after adding CT-scan data, the performance of suggested ML algorithm did not make much difference anyway.",
