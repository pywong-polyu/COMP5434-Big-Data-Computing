Preprocessing of an image improves the quality of an image increasing the intersection over union scores in segmentation of lungs from the X-ray images. The authors have implemented an efficient preprocessing and classification technique for respiratory disease detection. In this proposed method, the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) algorithm, Haar transform (Haar), and local binary pattern (LBP) algorithm were applied on lung X-ray images to extract the best features and segment the left lung and right lung. The segmentation of lungs from the X-ray can improve the accuracy of results in COVID-19 detection algorithms or any machine/deep learning techniques. The segmented lungs are validated over intersection over union scores to compare the algorithms. The preprocessed X-ray image results in better accuracy in classification for all three classes (normal/COVID-19/pneumonia) than unprocessed raw images. VGGNet, AlexNet, Resnet, and the proposed deep neural network were implemented for the classification of respiratory diseases. Among these architectures, the proposed deep neural network outperformed the other models with better classification accuracy.",

The huge impact of COVID-19 is due to a lack of testing and medical errors. COVID-19 is a disease that mainly affects the lungs [4] apart from pneumonia. This can exhibit various patterns or pathological symptoms in the lungs based on different causes, and no particular symptom can indicate its severe impact on the lungs. Hence, the diagnosis should be initiated at an early stage. Based on the symptoms, when a person approaches a clinic, few tests are done for confirmation of the disease along with X-ray images. X-ray images help in analyzing the condition of the lung and the stage of the disease. Preprocessing of these images is absolutely necessary for accurate diagnosis.",

The person who is suspicious of COVID-19 is suggested to undergo a chest X-ray. Analysis of X-rays by humans can lead to various human errors, which can lead to a huge impact on patients and society. So, a computer-aided system can help the doctors for proper analysis of lungs of the COVID-19 affected human. Throughout underdeveloped and developing nations, where the number of patients is high and medical care cannot be adequately delivered, these programs may be a tremendous benefit [6, 7] . The authors have worked on X-ray imaging techniques for the detection of bone fractures. They have applied edge detection and segmentation techniques to ease the process of the diagnosis system. These methods will reduce the processing time and other physical evaluation procedures [8] . So, while working with X-ray images, we need to consider the noises which have to be reduced. The random noises occurring during the process of image acquisition degrades the image quality leading to an incorrect diagnosis. Researchers suggest the application of the temporal recursive filter. Also, they propose an improved self-adaptive filter. This was a combination of FPGA with image processing techniques [9] . The authors have recommended region localization which offers a close level of precision. Few other image preprocessing techniques are adaptive histogram-based equalization, adaptive contrast enhancement, and histogram equalization. There is the presence of multiple noises during capturing the images because of device mobility and motion artefact [10] . But in X-ray images mostly Gaussian, salt and pepper noises are present. To reduce the noise, a digital median filtering technique is used as per the researches.",

The local binary pattern is a plain and gray-scale invariant feature descriptor which is highly used for extracting features for an image in a classification model.

In Figure 14 , the left and right lungs are detected after extracting thousands of features from the image in which the lungs have to be detected. Cascade classification is used to classify the image into lung or not. The cascade classifier uses the features extracted using Haar transform to get the best accuracy in the classification process.
