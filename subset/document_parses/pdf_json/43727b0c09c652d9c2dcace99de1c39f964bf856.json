In this regard, we first establish the well-posedness of the underlying problem by investigations concerning the existence, uniqueness, and influence of perturbed data on the behavior of the solutions as well as smoothness of the solutions under some assumptions on the given data. Next, from the numerical perspective, we develop and analyze a well-conditioned and high-order numerical approach based on an operational spectral Galerkin method. The main advantage of our strategy is that it characterizes the approximate solution via some recurrence formulas, instead of solving a complex non-linear block algebraic system that requires high computational costs. Moreover, the familiar spectral accuracy is justified in a weighted L 2 -norm, and some practical test problems are provided to approve efficiency of the proposed method.",

Therefore, designing efficient numerical methods plays a crucial role in examining the solutions of these equations.

Researchers have recently developed different approximate methods for the numerical solution of systems of single-order FDEs (SSFDEs), such as fractional-order generalized Laguerre pseudo-spectral method [2] , Petrov-Galerkin method [9] , fractional-order Jacobi Tau method [3] , hybrid non-polynomial collocation method [10] , spline Collocation method [14] and Jacobi-Gauss collocation method [20] .",

In particular, Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 assert that small perturbations in the input data cannot have a meaningful effect on the exact solution. Indeed, the existence of small perturbations in the right-hand sides of (2.2) and (2.5) will translate into small discrete perturbations in the numerical solution due to roundoff errors, and the well-posedness property does not allow a meaningful effect to enter the accuracy of the approximate solution. In what follows, we will discuss the properties dealing with the solution smoothness of the problem (1.1). Since the Caputo fractional derivative is a weakly singular integral operator, we cannot typically expect the solutions of FDEs to be smooth, even for smooth input functions. Clearly, this can lead to a challenge of constructing the numerical methods with reasonable orders of convergence. Hence, recognizing the singularity behavior of the solutions under imposing some conditions on the given functions g j is crucial to design high-order numerical methods. In this regard, in the next theorem, the regularity of solutions of (1.1) is explored by obtaining their series representations in a neighborhood of the origin. ",

E \u03b4 (x) is known for Mittag-Leffler function, J c (x) denotes the Bessel function for integer number c, and \u03be F \u03be ({a 1 , . . . , a \u03be }; {b 1 , . . . , b \u03be }; x) is generalized hypergeometric function. This problem is solved by our method, and the obtained results are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . From Table 1 , one can deduce that the proposed strategy provides approximate solutions with high accuracy, mainly because the numerical errors are considerably reduced in short elapsed CPU-time corresponding to the large values of N . Moreover, the semi-log representation of the numerical errors with \u03bc = \u03bd = \u2212 1 2 depicted in Fig. 1 , justifies the familiar spectral accuracy which predicted in Theorem 4.1 because the numerical errors in the semi-log report linearly varied versus N (note that we have {\u03b5 j } 3 j=1 = \u221e in Theorem 4.1). To solve a more challenging problem, we set \u03b3 1 = 1 3 , \u03b3 2 = 5 4 , \u03b3 3 = 13 5 in (5.1), and the forcing functions q j (x) with j = 1, 2, 3 are chosen such that the exact solutions are finds the unknowns via some recurrence relations without solving any non-linear algebraic system. Convergence analysis of the presented method was justified that confirmed the high accuracy of the scheme without enforcing the problematic regularity assumptions on the given data. Finally, through the numerical solution of various examples, the well-conditioning and high-order accuracy of the presented method was emphasized.Funding This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.Data Availability Enquiries about data availability should be directed to the authors.",
