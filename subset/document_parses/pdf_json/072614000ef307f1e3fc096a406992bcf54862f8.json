The latest viral infection endangering the lives of many people worldwide is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. This paper is aimed at detecting and differentiating viral pneumonia and COVID-19 disease using digital X-ray images. The current practices include tedious conventional processes that solely rely on the radiologist or medical consultant's technical expertise that are limited, time-consuming, inefficient, and outdated. The implementation is easily prone to human errors of being misdiagnosed. The development of deep learning and technology improvement allows medical scientists and researchers to venture into various neural networks and algorithms to develop applications, tools, and instruments that can further support medical radiologists. This paper presents an overview of deep learning techniques made in the chest radiography on COVID-19 and pneumonia cases.",

As of 29 th September 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in 215 countries and territories, involving 33,558,131 cases with 1,006,471 deaths globally, which is a 3% mortality rate [1] . Most reported infections were in the USA, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Chile, Spain, and many others [1] . Countries have declared emergencies and national difficulties in breathing [3] . Nevertheless, an immediate diagnosis of COVID-19 and the consequent application of medication and treatment can significantly aid and prevent the deterioration of the patient's condition, which eventually can lead to death [5] .",

The respiratory ailment spreads throughout droplets of air. The infection is transmitted primarily via close contact and infects through respiratory droplets distributed in the air when a person coughs or sneezes. When a person contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes, he or she produces respiratory droplets which range in size from large droplets visible to the human eye to smaller droplets. The tiny droplets can also form particles as they dry very quickly in the airstream [8] . Breathing difficulty is an indication of plausible pneumonia and requires prompt clinical deliberation and care. Research indicates that people suffering from COVID-19 often show hyperthermia and breathing problems [9] . Currently, there are no antibodies or definitive treatment for COVID-19 patients available to the public. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had no authorised or approved vaccine to prevent COVID-19 [8] until 12 December 2020, when the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against COVID-19, has been authorised as safe, effective, and only for emergency use [10] . However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) encouraged the facilitation of vaccines by public persuasion instead of making the injections mandatory [11] .",

However, when the pathological load is high during the symptomatic phase, the test is more accurate. The (RT-PCR) test kits are also limited in some geographical regions, especially third-world countries [13] . The turnaround time is 24 hours in major cities and is even longer in rural regions [9] . There is an urgency to explore other possibilities to distinguish the ailment and enable immediate referrals for the SARS-CoV-2-infected patient [9] . The chest X-ray plays a crucial role and is the first imaging technique to diagnose COVID-19 [14] . The virus presents on the Chest X-ray as ground-glass opacities, with peripheral, bilateral, and primary basal distribution [12] .

CT scans are discovered to be less explicit than RT-PCR but highly sensitive in sensing COVID-19 and can act as a fundamental role in disease analysis/treatment [13] . Nevertheless, the American College of Radiology has endorsed CT scans' practice as a primaryline assessment [16] . There are further concerns in using CT scans as a first-line test for the augmented risk of transmission, access, and cost, contributing to the recommendation [9] . As the pandemic became calamitous, radiological imaging is considered compulsory where portable chest Xrays are a useful and practical alternative [12] . However, the images' valuation placed a severe responsibility for radiological know-how, which is frequently lacking in regions with limited resources. Therefore, automated decision-making tools could be essential to appease some of this problem and to quantify and identify disease development [9] .",

Between ML and DL, DL can automatically classify features and provide accurate results with high-end GPU help whereas ML requires a wider range of data to be preprocessed as the features need to be extracted manually. ML integrates various computational models and algorithms to mimic the human neural system whereas the DL-based network is more profound and is created with many hidden layers compared to conventional ANN. DL algorithms do not require many feature classifications and acquire directly from the data to display their higher problem-solving aptitudes. DL can interpret data and extract a wide range of dimensional features, notwithstanding if the features are visible or invisible to the naked human eye. This diminishes manual data preprocessing such as segmentation. DL can handle complex data representations and mimic trained physicians by identifying and detecting the features to make clinical decisions.

            "text": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) most often apply to image processing problems where a computer identifies the object in an image. CNN can also be used in natural language processing projects as well. CNN modelling is adequate for processing and classifying images. A regular neural network has three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer has different forms, whereas the hidden layer performs calculations on these inputs. The output layer delivers the outcome of the calculations and extractions. Each of the layers contains neurons and has its weight connected to the neurons in the previous layer. Hence, the data that is provided in the network does not produce assumptions via the output layer. However, the regular neural network cannot be applied if the data consists of images or languages. This is where convolutional neural network (CNN) comes in. CNN treats data as spatial data. Unlike regular neural network, the CNN neurons are not connected to every layer from the input layers to the hidden layers, and finally, the output layers only choose the neurons closest to it with the same weight. CNN upholds the spatial aspect of the dataset, which means that it undergoes a filtering process that simplifies complex images to better-processed images that are understood. The CNN is made up of many layers, consisting of several individual layers known as the convolutional layer, the pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. Inside, the layer of the CNN also consists of the rectified linear unit layer (ReLU). The ReLU layer activates the function to ensure nonlinearity as the data progresses through each layer in the network. Without ReLU, the data that is provided at the input layer would lose the dimensionality that is required in the network. The fully connected layer performs classification on the datasets. The CNN works by placing a filter over an array of image pixels and creating a convolved feature map. The analogy is like looking at an image through a window allowing specific features within the image to be seen. This is also known as the typical 2D convolutional neural network. The pooling layer reduces the sample size of the particular feature map, which speeds up the process by reducing the parameters the network needs. The output is the pool featured map, consisting of two execution methods, i.e., max pooling and average pooling. Max pooling takes the maximum input of a particular convolved feature, whereas the average pooling takes the convolved feature's average. The next step is feature extractions, whereby the network creates a picture of the image data based on its mathematical rules. The images' classification requires the network to move into the fully connected layer by flattening and simplifying the images. A complex set of neural network connections can only process linear data. If the data is unlabelled, unsupervised learning methods can be applied by using autoencoders to compile the data in a low dimension space performing calculations, then, additional layers are reconstructed to upsample the existing data.",

The analysis of COVID-19 is hypothesised on the foundation of indications of pneumonia (e.g., dry cough, lethargy, myalgia, malaise, and dyspnea similar to symptoms of SARS and MERS) as well as past travelling activities to China or acquaintance with a COVID-19 patient. The development of the diseases and their severity rely on chest imaging to acquire valuation, discovery, and identification. A portable chest X-ray (CXR) is used as the first-line modality for COVID-19 patients instead of CT scans, as CT scans are applied in specific situations. Portable chest X-ray (CXR) has the benefit of discarding patients' need to travel from one location to another and diminish the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The arrangement is to avoid nonessential imaging and transportations to the radiology department. Czawlytco et al. discovered that chest X-ray is insensitive in the early detection of COVID-19 with a sensitivity of only 59% [33] . Chest X-ray is not recommended for patients with flu/influenza-like symptoms. It is also not recommended to be used on confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Therefore, chest X-ray is designated for COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory status or COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms but has high-risk factors for developing severe disease. Chest radiography and tomography cannot be used as first-line screening or diagnosis in COVID-19, even with a normal chest X-ray and CT images, the possibility of COVID-19 cannot be ruled out as a patient might be asymptomatic, and the lung condition maintains to be expected. However, information of COVID-19 patients initially declared hostile on the virus using the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was discovered to have COVID-19 via early CT findings [32] . In the meantime, initial findings in imaging may show normal conditions of the lungs. Hence, standard chest imaging does not rule out the possibility of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 [32] .",

However, LeNet has limitations, and thus, its successor AlexNet was the first deep CNN that accomplished outstanding results for the organisation and recognition tasks on the image. Due to hardware limitations in early 2000, deep CNN architectures' learning capacity was restricted to small sample size images. AlexNet was made applicable to all types of images-its depth was extended from LeNet's five layers to eight layers: five convolutional layers, two fully connected hidden layers, and one fully connected output layer generalised for different image resolutions. However, it caused overfitting issues. The overfitting issue was fixed with the dropout algorithm, which arbitrarily eliminated some transformational units during the training process. DenseNet is a modern CNN architecture that requires fewer visual object recognition parameters. It is the product of the previous layer that combines with the output of a future layer. The objective of DenseNet is to recognise visual objects by densely connecting all the layers. ResNet is known as the residual net, which divides a layer into two branches, where one branch does nothing to the signal, and the other processes ResNet adds the previous layer with the future layers. Usually, a deep neural network tends to randomly overfit and sometimes produce more preliminary results than a network with a few layers.",

Based on the table, the majority of the researchers used CXR images because of their availability. The CXR requires low memory space and high results performance which reassure researchers to apply these images into the respective deep learning models. There are a total of 52 researches using various deep learning methods to achieve results. Out of the 52 journals mentioned above, 34 of the studies used CXR images, 17 studies used CT images, and 4 of the studies used CT and CXR images. More CXR images from COVID-19 patients found in the public databases encouraged researchers to study deep learning utilising these images. Journals from the medical field often mentioned that CT images show higher accuracy performance, but these accuracies were debunked because it was not explicitly shown in the deep learning-based CAD systems. The nature of the CT images that produce many cross-sections just for one patient result in high memory usage for the facility to handle. In general, CT images were previously deemed more accurate than CXR images because the CT images' cross-section images are individually labelled. Hence, studies that utilised the combination of CT and CXR images show promising results. However, studies with 3D data have lower performance than 2D data, mainly because there are primarily 2D data available for the public to use. 6 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 10 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine",

The idea is impossible to achieve due to limited data availability or weak labels [9] . Despite many cases happening worldwide, we have very limited COVID-19 CXR or CT image data publicly available. Therefore, it is difficult to train the DL models and distinguish the images between COVID-19-related CXR and CT and non-SARS-CoV-2 viral, bacterial, and other pathogen-related CXR and CT images. The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) [97] and Imaging COVID-19 AI Initiative in Europe [98] are aimed at providing easily accessible data to the public. These data allow various features across categories to enhance interclass variance, leading to better DL performance. Due to lack of data, the model will overfit and produce weakly generalised results [99] . Hence, data augmentation has been proven to be effective in training discriminative DL models. Examples of data augmentation techniques are flipping, rotating, colour jittering, random cropping, elastic distortions, and generative adversarial network-(GAN-) based synthetic data generation [100] . Medical images found in ImageNet have different visual characteristics showing high interclass similarities [101] . Thus, traditional augmentation methods that perform simple image alterations are less effective [102] . GAN refers to the specialised algorithms and cavernous learning systems towards the compelling predictions and transformation of data from one to another that produce dynamic data and images so that better recognition and analysis can be done. GAN-based DL models are applied to generate data artificially. Therefore, to overcome the data-scarce situation, GAN is used to develop effective data augmentation strategies for medical visual recognition.",
