This research takes a first step in proposing several ways in which the blockchain technology can be used to improve current organizational practices, while also considering the ethical implications. Specifically, the paper examines the role that blockchain technology plays in three primary areas of people operations: (1) entry to the organization (via recruitment and selection), (2) intraorganizational processes (including compensation via smart contracts, retention and motivation via shared leadership and conflict management via network-based dispute resolution, and performance management), and (3) exit (offboarding). In each section, the paper reviews the ethical implications from the lenses of virtue ethics, utilitarianism, deontology and contractarianism. The paper concludes that in whole the implementation of blockchain technology in people operations processes can create a more ethical work environment. However, careful implementation is necessary and requires extensive examination of ethical implications in advance.",

As with most new change, there is great potential for positive advancement in organizations, however there are also ethical dilemmas that need to be considered. In this paper, we address both of these challenges. We coin the term decentralized people operations (DePo), for blockchain's application on people operations, and offer a systemic ethical analysis of DePo for organizations. Specifically, this paper explores the role that blockchain can play in people operations starting from recruiting and selecting 1 The terms \"people operations\" and \"human resource management\" will be used interchangeably throughout this paper. Human resources management is more commonly used in the academic literature, whereas people operations has become a staple term in industry, especially in large technological companies including Google, Apple and Facebook. In industry, there has been a pivot in the approach to understanding and working with employees. Whereas human resource management typically views employees as resources that need to be managed, people operations views employees as individual contributors that can provide competitive advantage for the organization (Farrar, 2019) . For the purposes of this paper, we will use both terms alike to speak to both audiences: academia and industry. employees, compensation, retention and motivation to performance management. Each section investigates the ethical implications of blockchain from virtue ethics, utilitarian, deontology, and contractarian viewpoints.",

At the entry stage, blockchain can change the recruitment and selection process. In intraorganizational processes, it can revamp compensation through smart contracts, retention and motivation through shared leadership and conflict management through a network-based dispute resolution to name a few. At the exit stage and offboarding, blockchain can provide opportunities for organizations to engage in more transparent and efficient processes.",

            "text": "Blockchain's ethical issues for organizations stem from its three main promises: immutability, disintermediation (distributed verification), and automation. Immutability results in the permanency of a human past record and raises ethical issues such as privacy and transparency concerns (Hofmann et al., 2017) . Disintermediation refers to horizontal decision-making and the numerosity of stakeholders in verifying outcomes (Quiniou, 2019) . Disintermediation raises ethical issues related to accountability and equal opportunity. Automation refers to the self-executing features of coded agreements called smart contracts (Szabo, 1996) which raises issues related to human dignity among others. This paper is among the first to map out DePo at various phases of people operations. First, this paper brings light to privacy challenges for the entry and exit stages of people operations while arguing that contractarianism-based on a hypothetical ex ante contract-can best capture the associated ethical issues. As for intraorganizational affairs, the paper offers fresh views of blockchain's potential impacts on compensation, shared leadership, conflict management, and performance evaluation. It suggests that each of the applications requires separate ethical analysis. For instance, on shared leadership and a new form of conflict managementwhat we call distributed conflict management (DCM)-virtue ethics with its focus on human flourishing best captures the associated ethical nuances. From a broader perspective, this paper contributes to the existing literature by showing how emerging technologies can foster the transition from the purely utilitarian view of human resources to a more collaborative environment. In achieving so, the paper analyzes the ethical ramifications of emerging technologies which requires in-depth understanding of their disruptive potentials and a more robust stage-by-stage analysis that is not merely related to the consequences of emerging technologies.",

At the heart of blockchain technology is a new form of \"consensus\" that makes it possible for the platform and users to make decisions without oversight and presence of a third party. For example, if person A is transferring a sum of money from her account to person B, banks record the transaction. In blockchain and crypto-economics, other users of the platform record the transaction. By multiplying the ledgers that include the transaction, blockchain makes it extremely difficult for a single user or even a group of users to manipulate the transaction or double-deal. The blockchain platform often includes an incentive mechanism to encourage users to participate in the record-keeping process. Most notably, in the Bitcoin platform, the users are rewarded if they solve complex mathematical problems (called mining) (B\u00f6hme et al., 2015) . In essence, blockchain is a crowd-based or peer-to-peer platform, which enables verification and storing of information with the help of all of its users (i.e., disintermediation). The information is stored in digital blocks, which creates a chain of immutable information (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2017) .",

Values, therefore, are created not by trust in a government (e.g., dollar) but based on verification of others (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2017) . Moreover, in blockchain platforms, users are often anonymous or pseudonymous which enables a new form of engagement with the network and a new type of decision-making (Aitzhan & Svetinovic, 2016) .

One difference between the distributed social network and the existing one is that AI algorithms allow for further decentralization (elimination of central planning) as the AI algorithms determine the information that is shared among users and added to new blocks. One can further imagine that both the AI algorithm and the types of information recorded can be modified pursuant to the consensus mechanisms (similar to a constitution) adopted as the underlying basic logic of this social network.

For instance, following the wide-spread contamination of romaine lettuce, Walmart launched a test pilot of blockchain for its supply chain to be able to find the source of its goods faster and more efficiently (Corkery & Popper, 2018) . In addition to Walmart, as many as fifty large organizations, such as Amazon, JPMorgan and BP have taken steps in adopting blockchain technology in some forms (del Castillo, 2019) . Blockchain technology also lies at the core of several hundred start-ups which are using the technology in insurance (e.g. encoding rules for damages reimbursement), governmental institutions (e.g. identity management by automating identity checks), healthcare (e.g. automating processes such as prior authorization for specific treatments), and the sharing economy (e.g. creating peer-to peer autonomous organizations replicating services such as Airbnb and Uber). Overall, aside from the startup scene, up until now blockchain has been primarily used in finance and supply chain logistics.

Dierksmeier and Seele (2020) provide a business ethics perspective to blockchain technology and its different applications. Specifically, they examine favorable, unfavorable and ambivalent dimensions of blockchain technology utilizing four theories of ethics (utilitarianism, contractarianism, deontology and virtue ethics). The authors highlight the need for thorough analysis of the ethics of blockchain considering that there may be many advantages yet at the same time disadvantages that arise from blockchain. Advantages include unprecedented degrees of transparency and accuracy in addition to cost reduction and efficiency of process. Disadvantages may include loss of jobs that consist of routine tasks which may lead to an increase in income inequality. Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies may also enable money laundering in addition to other illegal transactions. In their analysis of ethically ambivalent applications of blockchain, Dierksmeier and Seele (2020) discuss the ethics of the move from institutional trust to transparency, algorithms in job platforms and privacy that is limited to most but transparent to only a few.",

Although discussion about the need for formal organizations as whole exists in the literature, the majority of research on blockchain in business has focused on applying blockchain to improve certain aspects of organizational performance. Specifically, blockchain has been mainly applied in finance (cryptocurrencies) and supply chain (Akter et al., 2020; Chang & Chen, 2020; Felin & Lakhani, 2018; Treleaven et al., 2017) .

(2015) in a review of literature at the intersection of technology and human resources found that this area is very nascent with many avenues for future research. The authors specifically called for additional research to examine the extent to which the implementation of technology in human resource practices enables organizations to achieve their human resource goals. Existing reviews of blockchain and ethics have not thoroughly discussed the role that blockchain can play for human resources and organizational behavior (Tang et al., 2020) . The existing literature primarily has looked at the features of blockchain and its applications in different sectors (i.e. Kher et al., 2020) . There are handful of reviews related to the intersection of blockchain and management. However, in the majority of these reviews (i.e. Alkhudary et al., 2020; Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020; Kher et al., 2020; Kimani et al., 2020; Klarin, 2020; Xu et al., 2019) , human resource management was not even mentioned. The literature on blockchain in human resource management is nascent. Only a handful of scholars have started to investigate it from a management perspective. For example, Fachrunnisa and Hussain (2020) discussed the creation of a human resources training supply chain in which skills needed in the industry are found via blockchain algorithms. In the field of engineering, scholars have begun to develop protocols and platforms that will allow blockchain functionality in organizational recruitment processes (\u00d6ncu, 2019) and work history fraud prevention . Equally, discussion of ethics in blockchain is nascent (Tang et al., 2020) and does not engage discussions related to human resource management.",

Individuals' careers, prosperity, motivation, and overall happiness will be affected by these new forms of organizational decision-making. These changes will not only have micro impacts. These new forms of decision-making can ultimately lead to DAO. DAO aims to create organizations based on distributed decision-making (Wang et al, 2019) whereby the lines between leaders and employees become murky.

Rawls has proposed two primary principles: principle of equal liberty and principle of equality (Rawls, 1991) . The first principle indicates that all citizens have an equal right to basic liberties. The second principle suggests that economic principles should meet two requirements. The first requirement is that the least advantaged in society should receive a greater number of benefits.

Leaders and organizations benefit from employees who develop longlasting relationships with the organization (Meyer & Allen, 1991 ) partially because they save on turnover costs (both time and money), which again includes recruiting, selecting, retaining and motivating. In the gig economy, it is now very common for employees to frequently change their employment. In most organizations, employee turnover has steadily increased over the years and is now much higher than it used to be in the past (Work Institute, 2019). Organizations therefore spend a significant amount of time reviewing resumes, verifying degrees and previous work experience, conducting background checks, and so forth. For these reasons, it is important to have an effective system that makes the recruitment and selection process as streamlined as possible. Blockchain technology can assist with this.",

Making the application process transparent (Angel & McCabe, 2015; Meyer & Hudon, 2019) , blocks of information about potential employee recruits can be easily verified. Therefore, the use of blockchain in the recruitment and selection process provides a check of the applicants. For example, applicants may include false information on their resumes. They may include names of references that are not appropriate sources to judge their previous performance. Instead of listing a previous supervisor, they may list a friend from their previous company instead. They may also report higher performance evaluations than they actually achieved. When blockchain is used, all of the applicant's information is permanently recorded on different sets of blocks. Those items recorded on a \"block\" have been verified by stakeholders with knowledge of that individual in the voting process. For example, if an applicant submitted a performance evaluation from a previous company, this performance evaluation would be verified by those who have knowledge of the applicant's performance at that company. This, in effect, prevents applicants from overstatements or underreporting. Dierksmeier and Seele (2020) discussed at length the role that blockchain plays in assuring trustworthy information in the hiring and assessment processes of organizations. Therefore, blockchain offer us tools to verify the truth.",

Hence, when making hiring decisions, leaders can be confident in the backgrounds of their recruits because of information verified via blockchain. Assuming that blockchain can always record accurate information, it will result in unprecedented transparency in the recruitment process. A growing body of literature emphasizes and empirically shows the value of 'transparency signaling' in stakeholders' perception of organizations (Carroll & Einwiller, 2014; Rawlins, 2008; Rim et al., 2019) . This level of transparency once achieved by blockchain can create a higher level of trust in organizational decision-making. On the other hand, however, individuals' privacy will equally be affected. Increasingly, individuals' \"right to be forgotten\" is being recognized as a counterbalance to the intrusive effects of technology (see e.g. EU General Data Protection Regulation Article 17 on right to erasure or right to be forgotten). Blockchain's immutability feature presents a new challenge for privacy especially in areas in which individuals' background plays a critical role such as in recruitment and selection. ",

            "text": "As stated above, virtue ethics includes a long list of desirable virtues. In this paper, we view virtue ethics from the capability lens and focus on human dignity (Nussbaum, 2011) . If the use of blockchain in recruitment and selection results in actualizing human potential and flourishing, a virtue ethicist would find it ethical. Having a verified and transparent recruitment and selection process has long been a hurdle for applicants and people operations departments. Streamlining and verifying credentials and past performance can help a greater number of applicants have better access to flourish in the organization and realize their capabilities. It is therefore possible to conclude that virtue ethicists would favor the use of blockchain technology in the recruitment and selection process because the intention of the use of blockchain technology in itself is to provide a fair playing field to all applicants. The ethical road is perhaps bumpier if one adopts a utilitarian or deontology perspective as explained below. Utilitarians would examine the consequences of using blockchain technology in the recruitment and selection process. One primary consequence would be that the organizations would have accurate information by which to evaluate candidates. Since blockchain would provide verification of the information and documents that candidates are submitting with their applications, the applications could be considered very trustworthy. This would make the playing field fair for all applicants. Without blockchain technology, the possibility for inclusion of fraudulent information in the application process is greater. Another consequence, however, would be that blockchain technology reduces privacy. If employees do not have control over the background information provided to employers, they may feel the violation of privacy. For example, if a previous employer wrote a negative evaluation of an employee, this might be permanently recorded on one's file, which may have long-term consequences on that specific employee's job prospects. That negative evaluation could have been written by a previous employer who had a grudge against the employee for some reason. In sum, a utilitarian would look at the \"use\" of the blockchain technology for a greater number of people. Given that transparency in hiring can affect a greater number of people, it can be concluded that pursuant to this approach, blockchain-driven transparency outweighs privacy concerns. Relatedly, the way blockchain is implemented is important. For example, perhaps applicants may have discretion over which pieces of verifiable information could be shared with the organization. This would give candidates the choice of which pieces of information to share, while still providing verifiable data to the organization.",

From one lens, they would favor the use of blockchain technology in the recruitment and selection process because the rules would be consistent for all applicants. Blockchain helps the duty of candor in the entry phase. All applicants would be subject to submitting the same documentation and same procedures, all of which would be verifiable. On the other hand, the use of blockchain may cause harm to certain groups of people, especially those who aspire to change course in their lives. Put differently, the applicants' duty of candor is weighted against organizational practice of no harm particularly on those who do not want to be tied to their verified past. Deontologists may wrestle with this dilemma. Perhaps the greater good of transparency and equity in the application process would outweigh the possible harms.",

This hypothetical agreement (behind the veil of ignorance or without knowing one's status) would most likely emphasize fairness, transparency, and having an equal opportunity. Contractarians would like to see equal rights in the recruitment and selection process. Therefore, they would deem the process ethical if all applicants were subject to the same recruitment process. Since blockchain technology would make the process equitable for all of those who are applying to different positions, contractarians would consider this ethical.

A critical part of a blockchain platform is its smart contracts. Smart contracts are encoded agreements that make contracts self-executing and certain decision-making processes automated (Ghodoosi, 2021) . Smart contracts consist of if/then algorithms, which define the rules of the game from the start. Often, such rules cannot be modified and are immutable. A pioneer in blockchain technology and the person who coined the term smart contracts illustrated it by providing the example of transacting with a vending machine (Szabo, 1996) . Another example pertains to Bitcoin. The rules determining who receives Bitcoin lies at the core of this platform and can hardly be changed. Most famously, platforms such as Ethereum enable users to deploy smart contracts to automate all or part of contracting. For example, a user can deploy a smart contract whereby a digital asset will automatically be transferred to a user who has placed the highest bid in a digital auction (Chen et al., 2018) . This automation makes the \"breach\" of a contract extremely difficult, if not impossible.",

The use of pre-defined conditions will lessen the possibility of delay or denial of compensation after employees have met those conditions. The immutability along with the self-executing feature of smart contracts enable a more expeditious and less arbitrary compensation scheme. Blockchain helps to restore the customer-first orientation of competitive markets by removing the reliance on traditional intermediaries such as banks (Dierksmeier & Seele, 2020) . Moreover, conditions have to be clearly defined ex ante for a smart contract to be able to function (e.g., if an agent's sales volume meets a certain threshold, that agent is entitled to the pre-defined exact amount of bonus). The clear pre-determination of conditions will enhance objectivity and lessen discrimination and ex-post arbitrary denials. The challenges with smart contracts include lack of entry points and incompleteness of the computer codes (Ghodoosi, 2021) . Put differently, the immutability of smart contracts may result in undesired outcomes (lack of accountability) in unpredicted scenarios (i.e., scenarios that were not accounted for in the computer codes).

The consequences of using smart contracts for the enactment of compensation include providing more efficiency for organizations and employees. With streamlined payments, employees will be appropriately paid upon completion of a task. When work is completed, employees will be automatically paid. Since the breach of contract would be difficult, employees can feel secure that they will get properly paid for their work. Moreover, smart contracting incentivizes participants to include objective pre-determined criteria (codes) as the terms of the agreement are immutable. This way transparency and accountability are promoted. The existence of the possibility of incompleteness in computer codes will also incentivize users to pre-define their relationship with more accuracy and use an effective dispute resolution mechanism afterwards. Smart contracts formalize and automate the duty to perform. Deontologists would likely favor smart contracts because the rules are defined before the start of any employment contract. This helps minimize the possibility of breach and increases the possibility that parties abide by their duty to perform their promissory obligations. It is likely that smart contracts result in certain harms to individuals especially if the pre-defined terms are one-sided. However, this presents no different ethical issue than the boilerplate agreements of today (Radin, 2012) . Moreover, since the terms of smart contract need to be clearly defined for it to be selfexecuting, the chances that ambiguous terms are used will be reduced. Additionally, the possibility of shared leadership by blockchain as explained below provides more bargaining power to employees to include more equitable terms in smart contracts.",

Similar to the structure of many technologyfocused organizations, the span of control is reduced and blockchain organizations have a more boundaryless structure (Ashkenas, 1995; Devanna & Tichy, 1990) . Organizations relying on blockchain may encourage shared leadership in which leadership responsibilities are more distributed among employees in the organization (Pearce & Conger, 2002; Pearce et al., 2008) . This process of shared leadership can be seen in the consensus mechanisms on which blockchain is founded. For example, the consensus mechanism can be designed such that any assignment submitted by an employee can be voted on by any other employee in the system as defined. Employees have open access to a significant amount of data including the proposed blocks. All users in blockchain have the ability to vote for or against any block that is attempting to be added to the blockchain. Therefore, blockchain allows for a distributed and equal voting process to occur in which employees can voice their opinions. This allows for true distributed shared leadership. Moreover, this process saves significant amounts of time for leaders dealing with competing demands for their time. Actions that they choose can be distributed to other employees on the team. At the same time, the decision-making process may result in some delays since decisions that are made horizontally involve a large group of stakeholders. However, the idea of blockchain and its underlying game theory is to incentivize users to participate (e.g., by providing tokens) expeditiously and widely in the decision-making process.",

Whether it is called distributed justice (Metzger, 2018) , crowd arbitration (Gudkov, 2020) , or mob justice (Schmitz & Rule, 2019) , this new potential can lead to a new form of trust between individuals within organizations. Not only can certain decision-making processes in an organization be automated but they can be achieved (verified) by others within the organization (Chen et al., 2018) . For example, imagine a complaint by an employee about his or her working condition. Traditionally, it is expected of the leaders to fairly resolve the issue in silo without involving others in the organization. In a blockchain and smart contract model, the employee's grievance however can be resolved by a network of leaders and members alike who can submit proposals and vote on the issue. Organizational responses would then be recorded in the grievance process (White, 2017) . The consensus mechanism allows for a resolution to form a transparent block in the decision-making process of the organization. The decision forms a precedent for which all participants are aware. This model can be most helpful in big organizations where decision-making processes are often opaque and would not constitute precedent. The notion of the leader therefore changes to someone who can incentivize such participation.",

Organizations can expand the use of blockchain to their people operations including human resources and leadership. Additionally, organizations that are new to blockchain can start using blockchain in their people operations practices. Blockchain provides transparency, accountability and trust to commonly used human resource practices while also saving time and costs.

A contractarian would investigate a hypothetical social contract and determine that transparency may outweigh the privacy concern.

The vertical decision-making approach pertains to performance management. Blockchain can create more candor and truthfulness as deemed important by virtue ethicists through assignment verification and consensusbased evaluation. There is a danger of false information and organizational manipulation.

Field studies in which blockchain technology is implemented into daily human resource management and leadership practices will best be able to access the benefits and concerns with the technology. However, empirical research can also test the hypothetical impact of blockchain technology in weeks-long simulated experiences in which transactions are recorded on blocks and then verified by other participants.

With blockchain, it makes it more straightforward for individuals to act in an authentic way. This is because leaders and followers are expected to be authentic in order for the system to work.
