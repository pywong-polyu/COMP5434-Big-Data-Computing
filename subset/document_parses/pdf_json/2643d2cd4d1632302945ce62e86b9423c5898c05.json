Confirmed cases have been reported in all provinces of China. The growing number of confirmed and suspected cases, as well as the geographical spread of the disease, has raised public concern about infection, triggering public panic and psychological stress (1, 2) .",

Based on experiences of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it was suggested that these psychological problems were closely related to the severity of the epidemic (4) . The stress effects of infectious diseases may be qualitatively distinct from those of other disasters, especially for health care workers (HCWs) (5) . HCWs, overworked at the front line, have a high risk of occupational exposure and infection (6) . Infection rates among HCWs in various countries during SARS ranged from 3 to 51% (7) . As of February 17, 2020, Chinese officials reported that more than 3,000 HCWs had been infected with COVID-19. Another important reason for the psychological burden on HCWs is the greater fear of their family members being at a higher risk of infection (8) (9) (10) (11) . Therefore, when new epidemics break out, HCWs often suffer from huge psychological health problem, such as anxiety and depression (12, 13) .",

Therefore, in addition to identify pathogenic factors, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment, it is also important to study the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on people's mental health. Understanding the psychological impact during an outbreak, such as anxiety levels, can not only help predict key behavioral outcomes (e.g., wearing a face-mask) (4) , but may also have important implications for future psychological and behavioral research and public health interventions related to respiratory communicable diseases. Although there has been some research in this area, we have also studied the psychological conditions of the general public and HCWs in three different epidemic areas in China during the outbreak period. Specifically, this study investigated the levels of anxiety and depression of HCWs and non-HCWs, determined the impact of the severity of the epidemic on people in corresponding regions (The epidemic is worst in Wuhan, followed by other cities in Hubei except Wuhan, and the situation in other provinces in China except Hubei are better than these two regions), and evaluated the work perceptions of HCWs.",

Due to the severe situation of the epidemic, it was listed as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 30, 2020 (22) . In China, people's normal work and life were interrupted, all residents were quarantined at home, the situation was chaotic and China was pressed the pause button. There was a widespread feeling of perceived life threat, extreme vulnerability, uncertainty and helplessness at that time. This fear spread within the public and also the hospitals, causing panic. As with any disaster, the influence and trauma of COVID-19 outbreak will lead to anxiety and depression, the overall levels of anxiety and depression obtained in this study were similar to the results of other studies (23, 24) . Furthermore, we found that HCWs in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei except Wuhan had higher levels of anxiety and depression than non-HCWs, but there was no such difference in other provinces in China except Hubei. Compared with the other two regions, the HCWs in Wuhan was more anxious, and this anxiety might be caused by concerns about occupational exposure and wearing protective clothing for a long time daily. Compared with other provinces in China except Hubei, HCWs in the remaining two regions had more obvious depression, which might be associated with long days participating in epidemic work and wearing protective clothing for a long time daily. Meanwhile, 62.5% of HCWs were proud of their work. The anxiety and depression of non-HCWs in Wuhan were also the most serious. We assessed both anxiety and depression levels in HCWs and non-HCWs. The results suggest that HCWs are worse off than non-HCWs in both anxiety and depression. This is not hard to predict, as the burden on HCWs is greater, they faced high risk of infection, insufficient contamination protection, overwork, negative emotions from patient, exhaustion, discrimination, isolation, etc. (18, 25, 26) . A literature review concluded that rescue workers have a higher incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than the general population (27). In the early stages of the epidemic, the HCWs faced the uncertainty of encountering an undiagnosed COVID-19 patient every day, and there was no awareness of the need for systemic protection. When the epidemic broke out in full, the HCWs worked at the front line, and medical staff and resources were insufficient, their work intensity was high (28) . As a result, both the occupational exposure and the risk of infection have greatly increased. Coupled with the fear of cross-infection among family members due to them, their psychological burden is heavier and pressure is greater. In addition, the differences in anxiety and depression levels between HCWs and non-HCWs in the three regions also implies that HCWs in Hubei are under more pressure and that the epidemic situation in Hubei is more serious which is consistent with the reality. The existing research has rarely investigated psychological status of HCWs and non-HCWs in Wuhan, other regions inside Hubei Province and regions outside Hubei Province during the COVID-19 outbreak (5, 12) .",

Our results suggest that during the outbreak of COVID-19 in mainland China, HCWs in high risk areas may have a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression. A study involving 34 hospitals showed that health care workers in Wuhan had more serious psychological problems (12) . Other studies had also found that the proportion of frontline medical workers with anxiety and depression was significantly higher (29, 30) . A recent comparative study showed that, at a time when confirmed COVID-19 cases rose sharply in Hong Kong and the epidemic in Hubei was under control, the prevalence of depression among health workers in Hong Kong (50.4%) were more severe than in Hubei province (15.1%) (25) . It should be noted that the mental problems of both HCWs and general population in Hong Kong were reported to be exceptionally high (31) . Since the performance of depressive symptoms is affected by comprehensive and complex internal and external factors, this discrepancy may due to the differences of regions, time points of the research, evaluation scales or sample sizes. Study on SARS have also shown that high-risk HCWs experience fatigue and poor sleep, worrying about health, accompanied by increased depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress scores (32) . Moreover, we found that non-HCWs in Wuhan had a higher level of severe anxiety than other cities in Hubei except Wuhan, and a higher proportion of depression than the remaining two regions. In general, anxiety and depression levels among HCWs and non-HCWs in Wuhan, where the epidemic was most severe, were higher than elsewhere. Our conclusions were supported by a longitudinal study, which found that during SARS, anxiety levels were strongly correlated with the severity of the epidemic and closely mirrored the number of new cases per day (4, 25, 33, 34) .",

            "text": "Then, we assessed the perception of job among HCWs during the COVID-19 epidemic and the risk factors that caused different levels of anxiety and depression for HCWs in different regions were discussed. It was found that whether you often worry about occupational exposure and daily wear protective clothing time (hours) exerted significant independent effects for anxiety, and participation in epidemic work (days) and daily wear protective clothing time (hours) exerted significant independent effects for depression. Sex, age, and whether worried about family's crossinfection had no effect on the joint analysis. Fear of occupational exposure is a direct cause of anxiety. This not only increases their own risk of infection, but also threatens the health of their families. Wearing protective clothing for a long time daily reflects the high work intensity of HCWs, as well as an increased risk of infection, which not only causes anxiety but also induces depression. It is suggested that HCWs should not work too many hours a day (18, 26) . The results also indicate that depression is directly related to long-term participation in epidemic work. In our survey, 86.57% of HCWs in Wuhan, 89.37% of HCWs in other cities in Hubei except Wuhan, and 71.22% of HCWs in other provinces in China except Hubei were worried about their family's cross-infection because of them. Given the high infectivity of the virus and its transmission through respiratory droplets and close contact, fear of inadvertently endangering members of family and loved ones was a widespread concern among HCWs (8). The HCWs were torn between their own responsibilities and this concern. Although the work of HCWs is high-risk, fortunately, we find that 62.5% of HCWs are proud of their work.",

A further methodological limitation is the possible social expectation bias because of the use of self-report to assess psychiatric morbidity, some people may be inclined to underreport their psychopathology to avoid discrimination. We also cannot rule out the possibility that people with severe anxiety or depression was under-represented. Pre-COVID-19 anxiety and depression were not collected for HCWs and non-HCWs, so it was not possible to compare mental states before and after the outbreak. Finally, all residents in China are quarantined at home, so generalizations of our findings are limited, it may not apply to other countries. It would be meaningful to study the mental health status of HCWs and non-HCWs in different geographic regions at the beginning of the epidemic, the peak period, the remission period, and longer afterwards. Longitudinal studies with larger sample size are encouraged in future studies to conduct a more comprehensive assessment of this issue.",

What's more, improving the psychological health of HCWs is of great significance for maintaining their physical health, keeping higher efficiency and working state, and controlling the epidemic (35, 36) . The Chinese government has made some policies to address these psychological health problems and pay close attention to the psychological health of HCWs, such as caring for the elderly and children of HCWs to solve their worries, establishing a shift system so that front-line HCWs can take turns to rest, providing a professional psychological counseling platform, opening a public psychological hotline, and setting up psychological intervention teams to conduct psychological intervention and guidance to the masses through social platforms such as WeChat groups, etc.",
