Shedding of ACE2 from the cells is regulated by the metallopeptidase 17 (ADAM17) and is not affected by treatment with ACEi/ARBs. 10 Furthermore, ACE2 knockout in mice seems to aggravate ARDS induced by means other than SARS-CoV infection, 11 again suggesting a protective effect of ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, ARBs increase angiotensin II levels, which act on AT2 receptors and provide an increased amount of substrate to ACE2 followed by formation of angiotensin (1-7) and activation of Mas receptors (Fig. 1 ). The activation of AT2 and Mas receptors produces vasodilating and antiinflammatory effects in the lung.",

For patients treated with ACEi, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.89 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.1) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.07) compared with non-ACEi users. Similarly, the adjusted ORs were 1.09 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.37) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.05) for patients treated with ARBs. 12, 13 A third study applied propensity score matching and found median differences in risk of COVID-19 of \u00c02.5 (95% CI \u00c06.7 to 1.6) for ACEi users versus non-ACE users and 2.2 (95% CI \u00c01.9 to 6.3) for similar comparisons of patients treated with ARBs. 14 Finally, a study estimating risk of COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation reported adjusted ORs of 0.80 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.00) for ACEi and 1.10 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.37) for ARBs. 15 Observational studies on risk of COVID-19 are particularly difficult to conduct and interpret since several confounders and biases are hard to control for. 16 First, testing policies/strategies have evolved rapidly in most countries and often favoured testing certain risk groups. Combined with variations in testing capacity within and between countries during the course of the pandemic, this may result in significant time-dependent selection bias. Second, government appeals of for example, lockdowns, social distancing, hand washing and use of face masks seem to have been key factors for bringing virus reproduction numbers down in many countries. Yet, it remains unclear whether adherence to such measures and similar behavioural patterns differ between ACEi/ARB users and nonusers. For example, ACEi/ARB users may have enforced particularly strict isolation routines upon themselves since the hypotheses of increased risks with these drugs were announced early in a high-impact medical journal 3 and on social media.",

Thus far, prognostic studies have applied multivariable regression, matching and propensity scores, but none has incorporated active comparison to define the control group, for example, by comparing ACEi/ARB users with a control group of calcium channel blocker users. Calcium channel blockers do not interfere with ACE2, so this approach could further decrease the risk of confounding-by-indication. 16 Prognostic studies are also at risk of differential classification of nonfatal outcomes, for example, physician thresholds for ICU admissions may be lower for patients treated with ACEi/ARBs compared with nonusers. This would lead to an increased risk of severe disease in ACEi/ARB users. Nevertheless, clinical indicators of disease severity have been similar between ACEi/ARBs users and nonusers thus far. 12 The real-time nature of COVID-19 observational studies of ACEi/ARBs is additionally challenged by possible delays in exposure and/or outcome information. For example, prescription information may be delayed if based on registries and deaths may occur late during the course of disease. Another critical aspect of studies of ACEi/ARB is whether patients actually took this medication on the day of infection and/or whether they continued treatment after infection. Contrary to the recommendations of scientific societies 4 urging continued use of ACEi/ARBs in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, others have insisted on conversion to other antihypertensive drugs or stopping treatment in certain patient groups. 18 This raises concern about the exposure, particularly if exposure information is derived from 'historic' data in a registry and outcomes are recorded after these publications. Regarding continued ACEi/ ARBs use after a positive test, little is reported apart from a recent large study from New York state (n\u00bc5700) in which 50% of hospitalised patients treated Risk and prognosis of COVID-19 741 with ACEi or ARBs discontinued use during hospitalisation. 19 One reason for discontinuation could be development of hypotension, another could be the hypothesised concerns about these drugs. Future studies intended to address continued use of ACEi/ ARB and prognosis of COVID-19 should pay particular attention to avoid immortal time bias in outcome analyses.",
