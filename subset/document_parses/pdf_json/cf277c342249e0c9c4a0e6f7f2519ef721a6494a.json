Because of additional risk factors for transmitting and contracting the disease in healthcare settings, the World Health Organization (WHO) has specific guidelines in place to prevent or limit COVID-19 transmission in these settings. The WHO guidelines include the following: early recognition and isolation of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases; applying standard precautions for all patients entering the facility; and applying empiric additional precautions for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. 4 The standard precautions are in place to reduce transmission from both recognized and unrecognized sources and should be used in the care of all patients: diligent hand washing; maintaining greater than six feet of distance if possible, etc. Additional precautions that are required if a patient is either a suspected or confirmed case include contact and droplet precautions, as well as airborne precautions in aerosolgenerating procedures. 5 Although these precautions vary by hospital, contact precautions most commonly include a gown and gloves; droplet precautions include a gown, gloves, standard mask, and eye protection; and airborne precautions include all those of droplet in addition to donning of a fit-tested N-95 or higher-level respirator prior to room entry. Specific to the novel coronavirus, the US Centers for Disease Control and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have recommended that healthcare workers use full-face shields to protect against exposure to COVID-19. 6, 7 This recommendation is secondary to their covering of the three major areas of transmissibility: the eyes, nose, and mouth.",

            "text": "Given the critical areas of transmissibility they are protecting, it is important to understand how effective face shields act as physical barriers in limiting the spread of infectious particles. Although not always appearing complex, face shields are subject to strict regulation. The ANSI/ISEA Z.87.1-2015 standard in the US specifies physical features of a face shield that must maintain proper visual power, resistance to high-velocity impacts, and protection from droplets and splashes. 8 However, given the national shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE) that developed during the pandemic, on March 2, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) for personal respiratory protective devices during the COVID-19 outbreak. These EUAs are typically put in place in \"disaster\" situations, or when environmental demand outpaces medical response, or during public health emergencies with significant potential to affect the health and security of US citizens. On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that the rapid increase in the spread of the novel coronavirus fit such a definition. 9 As a result, a variety of alternatives to traditional FDAcleared masks became available over the course of 2020, many of which were difficult to manufacture, financially unreasonable, or potentially less effective in preventing transmission of respiratory droplets to the wearer. The typical face shield design includes a flat plastic shield, a headband, and brow foam. Most are designed to be low cost, discarded after a single use, and mass-producible. 10 Some, such as the Prusa shield, are intended for multiple use and considered superior in fit and function compared to disposable shields. However, as demand for face shields continued to increase and PPE shortages proliferated across the country, lower-quality face shields were less likely to be discarded after a single use, raising concern as to whether these lower quality shields maintained their efficacy and further increasing demand for more reliable, multi-use shields.",

We used Tukey-Kramer pairwise multiple comparisons in repeated measures analysis based on mixed model regression to compare the \"percentage area covered by particles\" between a mask and the control and between the masks. These comparisons were performed on the average of the percentage area covered by the particles across the five spray tests that were performed on each control and mask set-up. We measured the average particle size of the droplets by including a ruler in the photograph of a 0\u00b0 angle, frontfacing control at 30 cm, 60 cm, and 90 cm. The set scale function within Image J was then used to convert micrometers (\u03bcm) to pixels. The images were analyzed as above, but the distribution function was run after the particle analysis function. This generated the mode and range of the particle size for the droplets in micrometers squared.",

Table 4 depicts the results of the Tukey-Kramer multiple pairwise comparison for the percentage area covered by particles. These results show that all the facial PPE had a statistically significant decrease in particle contamination when compared to the control. This table also depicts the relative efficacy of the facial PPE when compared against all the masks tested in this study. The facial PPE that had a shield -surgical mask, Medline, PRUSA, and LCG -were also shown to offer significantly more protection compared to the basic mask. When the PPE with shields were compared against each other, we found no statistically significant difference in the protection offered between the surgical mask, the PRUSA face shield (which can be manufactured with a three-dimensional printer [Prusa Research, Czechoslovakia]), and the Medline face shield (Medline Industries, Inc., Northfield, IL). The LCG shield, however, was shown to be statistically more protective than all other forms of facial PPE tested in this study.",

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the healthcare system's response, institutions and providers have encountered countless types of PPE with significant confusion about their relative efficacy or durability.

Statistical power was limited by a limited number of trials performed on each mask from each position. Regarding droplet size detection, the Image J program cannot measure particles that are smaller than a pixel. As each pixel was 80 \u03bcm in diameter or 6400 \u03bcm 2 , the microscopic particles were often measured as one larger particle, especially when these smallest particles were clustered close together within the image. However, this is not expected to significantly affect surface area covered by particles between the different masks as the analysis of particles was done identically for every image.",

Hence, the smallest particles can continue to settle on mucosa minutes after they are expelled. While we allowed an equal pause after each spray to allow for smaller particles to settle prior to stepping into the study zone and removing the PPE to capture our images, allowing adequate time for the settling of these smaller particles as well as the accurate recording of them is another limitation of this study. Regardless, we believe this limitation could be mitigated but not eliminated by using higher resolution cameras, taking multiple pictures of facial sub-areas at different focal lengths and zoom distances, allocating multiple minutes for particle settlement, and more numerous and distributed ultraviolet lighting sources to increase droplet fluorescence intensity.",

It is challenging to simulate viral particle spread due to the many variables involved in the spread and visualization of microscopic particles. In this pilot study, we designed a simulated \"head\" and \"cough,\" along with a standard method of particle exposure and analysis, to quantify how well face shields can prevent the spread of aerosolized particles potentially carrying infectious contagions. We then compared the effectiveness of face shields with different sizes, shapes, and fits. Our method of analysis differentiated face shields quantitatively. We found that the LCG face shield was the most effective in reducing particle exposure because of its peripheral covering. The methods used here may also be useful in comparing other forms of personal protective equipment. This is critically important in its relevance not only to protection of high-risk persons during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to the day-to-day safety of high-risk persons in all infectious disease settings.",
