A recent study from Malawi showed that the risk of influenza was >2.5-fold higher among HIVinfected adults as compared with HIV-uninfected adults after adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors. 1 HIV was also independently associated with a nearly fivefold increased risk of severe disease (OR 4.98, 95% CI 2.09 to 11.88). 1 A meta-analysis of case fatality rates among 36 studies of ARI in Africa found an increased risk of death in HIV-infected as compared with HIV-uninfected (pooled OR 4.10, 95% CI 2.63 to 6.27), with the highest risk of death occurring among HIV-infected children under the age of 5 years. 2 The impact of HIV status on influenza and ILI in the USA and other high-income countries (HICs) is less clear. US studies performed earlier in the HIV epidemic identified HIV as a risk factor for increased influenza severity 3 4 ; however, whether this association persists in the era of cART has been questioned. In a 2011 review, Sheth et al suggested that HIV infection does not appear to increase susceptibility to influenza in the USA, although available data were limited regarding the 2009 pandemic strain H1N1pdm09. 5 Serological studies focusing on influenza incidence in the USA and Australia during the H1N1 pandemic did not detect any evidence of increased risk of influenza acquisition among HIV-infected individuals. 6 A 2010-2011 multicenter prospective US cohort study found that the duration of influenza virus shedding among HIVinfected adults diagnosed with influenza, 95% of whom were on cART, was similar to durations previously reported for HIV-uninfected individuals with influenza. 7 Specifically with regard to pandemic influenza, several studies from HIC reported disproportionate rates of HIV among individuals hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 influenza infection as compared with the prevalence of HIV in the general population. 8 However, in a 2009 study of hospitalized patients in the USA with H1N1pdm09, clinical outcomes, including rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and death, did not differ by HIV status. 9 A similar study of patients hospitalized with influenza in Spain in 2009 also reported similar clinical outcomes between HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected individuals. 10 However, in a separate Spanish study of patients with confirmed H1N1 admitted to the ICU during the 2009 pandemic and in the early postpandemic period (2010-2011), HIV was independently associated with a significantly increased ICU mortality in the postpandemic period (OR 19.835, 95% CI 2.236 to 175.954) but not during the pandemic (OR 1.362, 95% CI 0.279 to 6.648). 11 There is a dearth of published information regarding the impact of HIV on influenza and ILI in the extended postpandemic period. A systematic review commissioned by the WHO to assess risk factors associated with severe outcomes from influenza in HIC versus low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) attempted to assess the impact of HIV/AIDS, including data through March 2016. 12 However, only approximately 10% of included studies collected postpandemic data, and few studies specifically addressed HIV as a separate comorbidity. For those that did, HIV/AIDS was associated with increased risk of ICU admission and/or death in LMIC but not in HIC. 12 To our knowledge, there has been no analysis of ILI severity and outcomes in the postpandemic period among a predominantly outpatient cohort of otherwise healthy adults living with HIV in an HIC. Thus, the purpose of this analysis was to compare the prevalence and severity of symptoms as well as clinical outcomes associated with ILI in a US cohort of adult men with well-controlled HIV with otherwise healthy adult men who were HIV negative.",

In this prospective study of otherwise healthy adult male US service members and beneficiaries who presented with ILI between 2010 and 2015, the most common viruses identified were rhinovirus, influenza A, and coronavirus; the frequency of these viruses did not differ by HIV status. A significantly higher percentage of subjects with HIV had influenza B identified than HIV-negative subjects; however, the total number of influenza B cases was small (14 overall: 4 in HIV-positive, 10 in HIV-negative). Thus, the clinical significance of this finding remains unclear. The relative contribution of specific respiratory viruses to acute respiratory illness is likely to vary by season and patient population. For instance, in a Canadian study of 50 patients with well-controlled HIV (median CD4 325 cells/\u00b5L, median viral load <50 copies/mL) who presented with febrile respiratory illness during a 3-year time period (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) , a respiratory virus was identified as a contributory pathogen in 64% of patients; influenza A and influenza B were equally prevalent and accounted for 65% of the viruses identified, followed by human metapneumovirus, RSV, and human coronavirus. 17 Interestingly, although rhinovirus was included in the multiplex assay used in that study, none was detected in the Canadian cohort; however, rhinovirus was the most common virus identified in our study among both HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects and may have impacted our overall clinical severity scores. Symptom prevalence and severity were generally similar irrespective of HIV status in our predominantly outpatient cohort of otherwise healthy individuals with ILI, with the exception that HIV-positive subjects reported higher levels of diarrhea and fatigue. There were no appreciable differences in important clinical outcomes, including pneumonia, hospitalization, and need for intensive care between HIV-positive and HIVnegative subjects with ILI. These findings differ from contemporary African studies suggesting increased ILI severity associated with HIV positivity 1 2 ; however, they are comparable to case series data from hospitalized US patients with H1N1pdm09 in which HIVinfected patients had higher rates of diarrhea than non-HIV patients but otherwise similar symptoms and clinical outcomes. 9 Control of HIV may be a key factor in explaining why HIV status appears to impact ILI severity in LMIC but not HIC cohorts such as ours.",

This likely reflects a common perception that HIV increases the risk of complications from influenza. Although a differential time to presentation could theoretically impact receipt of antivirals since antiinfluenza antivirals are typically recommended within 48 hours of symptom onset, the median time to seek care did not differ by HIV status in this study. Receipt of anti-influenza antivirals was not independently associated with symptomatology, nor did antiviral use appear to influence the impact of HIV on composite symptom scores when accounted for in the multivariate analysis. However, we cannot discount the possibility that discrepancy in antiviral use may have impacted viral pathogen recovery or clinical outcomes.",

Also, due to the overall low event rate for important clinical outcomes such as pneumonia and hospitalization, differences may have existed that we did not have adequate power to detect.",

Whether the higher prevalence of moderate-severe diarrhea reported by subjects with HIV was attributable to the ILI itself, versus due to a combination of factors such as cART, HIV infection, and the ILI pathogen, is not discernible from the available data. There were no apparent differences in clinical outcomes by HIV status, although a higher percentage of subjects with HIV reported receiving antiviral treatment, likely reflecting differences in prescribing practices. Given current national policies promoting increased identification and linkage to care of HIV-infected persons in an enhanced effort to end the HIV epidemic, the otherwise healthy HIV-positive cohort included in this study is likely to be increasingly reflective of the general population of people living with HIV in this country. Thus, in addition to being informative for our military population, these results have potential broader relevance about ILI epidemiology and severity among men living with HIV in the USA.",
