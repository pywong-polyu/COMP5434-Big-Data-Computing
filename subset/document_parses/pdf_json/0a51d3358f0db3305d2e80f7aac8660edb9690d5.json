Many of the methods that they propose had existed for some time and had previously been applied in individual cases. For instance, the origins of upward pricing pressure can be traced back at least as far as Shapiro (1996) , which had already contained the basic idea for what would later be termed \"gross upward pricing pressure index\" (GUPPI). Since around 2005, the UK authorities had started implementing Shapiro's early formulas for illustrative price rises in UK merger cases. 2 And also the European Commission's 2004 Guidelines had emphasized the central importance of high diversion ratios and margins (the two main ingredients of upward pricing pressure) for assessing competitive effects. 3 The main virtue of the 2010 Guidelines was instead to bring together a disparate panoply of approaches that had been used in isolated cases to create a unifying framework for implementation. As Shapiro (2010) put it, the Guidelines reflect the transition of merger analysis \"from hedgehog to fox.\" Whereas the hedgehog knows one big idea (market shares), the fox knows many different ideas: the variety of economic tools that are tailored to different market environments as described in the Guidelines.",

            "text": "In Europe, the publication of the U.S. Guidelines coincided with an ongoing shift of EU merger control towards a more economic approach. That shift had been initiated several years earlier following a number of court defeats in which the Court of First Instance had criticized the Commission's (lack of) economic analysis. 4 These judgments had led to the creation of a Chief Economist Team (in 2003) , the adoption of a new Merger Regulation, and the publication of Horizontal Merger Guidelines (both in 2004). 5 When the U.S. Guidelines were issued in 2010, this transition of EU merger control towards effects-based analysis was already well underway. Arguably, the publication of the U.S. Guidelines with their focus on economic methods facilitated that process. Perhaps this can be felt most noticeably in two areas: First, the Guidelines supported the calibration of competitive effects through their endorsement of price pressure tools. In the decade that followed, the Commission employed such quantifications in a significant number of cases, in particular in consumer goods and mobile telephony markets. 6 Second, the Guidelines supported enforcement in the area of R&D competition, where they endorsed investigating innovation theories of harm. In recent years, the Commission has brought several such cases on the basis of economic mechanisms that were also described in the Guidelines. 7 On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the revised Horizontal Merger Guidelines, this article provides an overview of the state of economic analysis of unilateral effects in mergers with differentiated products. We discuss both static and dynamic competition, with a special emphasis on the calibration of competitive effects. Besides providing a comparative treatment of different economic methods, we also describe the practical enforcement experience with different approaches in EU merger control from our personal perspective. 8, 9 The remainder of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 focuses on price competition and discusses the calibration of unilateral effects using diversion-based tools such as upward pricing pressure. Section 3 goes on to assess innovation competition. Section 4 discusses the role of market shares and structural presumptions in differentiated product markets. Section 5 concludes with an outlook.",

When robust data are available, it is therefore more sensible to assess competitive overlaps directly via diversion ratios than to rely on market shares as an imperfect proxy. As noted by the Guidelines, \"Diversion ratios between products sold by one merging firm and products sold by the other merging firm can be very informative for assessing unilateral price effects, with higher diversion ratios indicating a greater likelihood of such effects\" ( \u00a76.1).",

Concretely, suppose diversion ratios D 12 and D 21 were proportional to market shares. In that case D 12 = S 2 \u2215 1 \u2212 S 1 and D 21 = S 1 \u2215 1 \u2212 S 2 . Solving this pair of equations for S 1 and S 2 then yields the hypothetical market shares that are consistent with the observed competitive interaction between the merging parties: 12 Implied market shares can be thought of as the merging firms' shares in the competitive space in which they actually compete. They are easier to compare than diversion ratios, since they refer to the same set of products. Moreover, they can be added to generate a one-dimensional measure of closeness of substitution between the merging firms relative to third parties. Since implied market shares are expressed in the same units as ordinary market shares, they are also more intuitive. Contrary to ordinary shares, however, they take account of the true degree of substitution between the merging products. 13 Using (1) reveals that already seemingly moderate levels of diversion can be an indication of a considerable competitive overlap. E.g., defendants sometimes argue that diversion ratios between the merging parties of (say) one third are \"low,\" because the vast majority of substitution involves third parties. Yet, Eq. (1) shows that the combined market share consistent with diversion ratios of one third is 50% . As stated in the Guidelines, \"A merger may produce significant unilateral effects for a given product even though many more sales are diverted to products sold by non-merging firms than to products previously sold by the merger partner\" ( \u00a76.1). Accordingly, the belief that only mergers between \"closest\" competitors is likely to cause competition concerns is a misconception. 14",

Indeed, attracting new customers inflicts competitive harm on the other firm through the cannibalization of business. Post-transaction, merging firms will take this \"cost of competing\" into account and thus act less aggressively. 15 The likelihood that a sale by firm 1 cannibalizes business of firm 2 is given by the diversion ratio D 12 . To determine the expected competitive harm of a stolen sale for firm 2, this likelihood must be multiplied by the financial damage of a lost unit of 13 Note that market delineation will typically exclude many products from the relevant market. If a direct comparison between implied and actual shares is desired-e.g., to assess whether firms offer closer substitutes than market shares suggest-it is therefore necessary to focus on diversion within the proposed market (however defined). More generally, it is sensible to exclude diversion to non-consumption, since abstinence would otherwise be attributed a \"market share.\" 14 See Buettner (2016) for a discussion of this argument in the context of recent EU cases. 15 Equivalently, raising price can be viewed as a positive externality vis-\u00e0-vis the merger partner, who will recapture some of the lost sales following a price increase. output, which is price P 2 minus incremental cost C 2 .

Even so, the information required remains limited to diversion ratios and margins. Note, in particular, that (4) is independent of cost pass-through. This reflects the fact that both merger efficiencies and upward pricing pressure can be viewed as a cost change (the former a decrease, the latter an increase). When efficiencies and price pressure exactly offset each other, as they do in (4), it is therefore not necessary to know at which rate costs are passed through into final prices. 18 As it turns out, CMCRs determine critical efficiencies not only for marginal cost savings but also for merger-induced improvements in product quality. Willig (2011) considers a model where mergers lead to an increase in product quality that is measured in terms of consumers' willingness to pay for it. 19 He uses a UPP framework to analyze post-merger incentives to raise quality-adjusted (hedonic) prices. In Annex 6.1, we show that the critical level of quality improvements that is required to avoid an increase in hedonic prices in the Willig model is simply given by (4). Hence, CMCRs measure critical efficiencies not only in terms of compensating marginal cost reductions, but also in terms of compensating (uniform) quality improvements.",

            "text": "The European Commission has used price pressure tools on a significant number of occasions. Most frequently, GUPPIs and CMCRs were used in the assessment of mobile telephony mergers: e.g., the mobile mergers in Austria (2012), Ireland (2014), Germany (2014), Denmark (2015), the UK (2016), Italy (2016), and the Netherlands (2018). 23 With the exception of the Dutch mobile decision, these cases ended either in remedies or in prohibition/abandonment (UK and Denmark). 24 GUPPIs and CMCRs were used in these cases both in phase I and II alongside other quantitative methods. 25 Conducting a second phase often allowed more precise estimates of the relevant inputs for calibration: E.g., the Commission typically used number portability and accounting data to determine diversion ratios and margins in phase I, whereas phase II often permitted conducting customer surveys and measuring incremental costs more specifically. These improved data were used not only for calibrating price pressure tools, however. Indeed, these decisions tended to focus 21 See Jaffe and Weyl (2013) for a formal analysis. 22 For this reason, Neurohr's (2019) description of CMCRs as \"full upward pricing pressure\" is somewhat of a misnomer, as CMCRs generically differ from the pre-merger tax that would generate postmerger prices. more prominently on calibrated merger simulations (and sometimes demand estimation) and used GUPPIs and CMCRs mostly as complementary evidence. 26 In other cases, such as H3G Austria/Orange Austria, BASF/Bayer, or FCA/PSA, the Commission used price pressure tools as the primary quantitative evidence, without complementing it with a fully-fledged merger simulation. 27 In yet other cases, the Commission used price pressure tools as an initial screen, while the final decision relied on merger simulation alone. For instance, this was the case in Unilever/Sara Lee (which employed demand estimation with a nested logit model) and Orange/Jazztel (which applied a calibrated merger simulation). 28 Finally, various Commission decisions also refer to high diversion ratios and margins as evidence of closeness of substitution and market power without explicitly calibrating competitive effects. This approach is consistent with the Commission's Guidelines, which list high diversion ratios and margins as significant factors that make anticompetitive effects more likely. 29 Note that a large proportion of mergers in Europe that concern national or local markets are handled by the 27 national competition authorities (NCAs) rather than the Commission. Hence, downstream mergers that involve final consumers-which tend to be particularly well-suited for price pressure analysis-are often not dealt with by the Commission. However, many NCAs have also readily embraced the use of price pressure tools. The UK agencies, in particular, had a pioneering role in applying diversion-based methods. Already from around 2005, UK authorities had used the closely related method of indicative price rises (of which more in the following section) to gauge the likely competitive effects of mergers. From 2010 onward, the UK agencies also started using GUPPIs in many cases-in particular in retail mergers (most recently in the widely discussed Sainsbury/Asda prohibition). 30 The CMA's 2017 retail mergers commentary notes that GUPPIs are now \"the most commonly used measure\" for quantifying competitive effects in such mergers in the UK. 31 14. Many other NCAs also started using price pressure tools following the publication of the Guidelines. For example, Baltzopoulos et al. (2015) survey merger cases of the Swedish NCA that involved price pressure analyses. 26 We explore merger simulation and its relation to price pressure tools in Sections 2.3 and 2.4 below. 27 (3), however, that these are cumulative (not alternative) factors as far as static effects are concerned.",

            "text": "As should be clear from the previous section, the price changes that are caused by a merger are determined by the extent to which price pressure is passed through into post-merger prices. To calibrate price effects in this spirit, Jaffe and Weyl (2013) have proposed the so-called first-order approach (FOA). It uses information that is local to the pre-merger equilibrium (on price pressure and pass-through rates) to conduct a linear approximation of the price effects of prospective mergers. Through Monte Carlo simulations, Miller et al. (2016) show that FOA calibrations tend to produce accurate predictions of price effects if the utilized local measures of passthrough are sufficiently precise. 32 But unfortunately, the informational requirements for obtaining reliable estimates of the required pre-merger pass-through matrix are typically insurmountable in merger control practice. 33 As is well known, pass-through is highly sensitive to demand curvature, with more convex demand exhibiting larger pass-through rates and hence more pronounced merger effects. 34 In the absence of more detailed information on demand, calibrated merger simulation therefore requires making non-trivial assumptions about demand form. In merger control practice, the European Commission has often assumed linear demand for the calibration of price effects-particular in mobile 32 This is not self-evident, since the transition between pre-and post-merger prices is not a marginal, but a discrete change. Hence, pass-through rates and diversion ratios may change along this transition. 33 Indeed, they tend to be challenging even in the most advantageous academic settings (e.g., see Miller et al. 2017a mergers. 35 This is a conservative approach, because linear demand tends to generate considerably smaller price effects than do most other standard demand forms. 36 Consequently, empirical economists have often viewed linear demand as a lower bound for convexity. 37 A particularly simple form of linear calibration is the so-called indicative price rise (IPR) methodology. IPRs assume that non-merging firms do not change prices post-merger (e.g., because they are part of a competitive fringe). Shapiro (1996) first derived a closed form solution for IPRs with linear demand for the special case of symmetric firms. Hausman et al. (2011) analyze the general asymmetric case. Assuming Slutsky symmetry, the predicted price effect \u0394P 1 \u2215P 1 of a merger is then given by A simple comparison of (4) and (5) immediately shows that \u0394P 1 \u2215P 1 = CMCR 1 \u22152 . This follows because the price effect of a merger equals the CMCR multiplied by the post-merger pass-through rate of the merged entity. Since third parties do not change prices in the IPR model, post-merger pass-through is simply given by the monopoly rate for linear demand, which equals one half. 38 The UK competition authorities were early adopters of IPRs between 2005 and 2010 (then based on Shapiro's results for symmetric firms). 39 Most of the earlier UK decisions employed isoelastic rather than linear demand, however, which is discussed further below.",

Similar to (5), (6) reflects the fact that price effects are determined by the pass-through of price pressure into final prices (here expressed as CMCRs passed through at the post-merger pass-through rate). Due to the inclusion of competitor reactions, the entries of \u0394P\u2215P are generally larger than the respective IPRs. 41 While linear demand constitutes a reasonable lower bound for convexity, economists have often regarded isoelastic demand as a sensible upper bound. E.g., Shapiro (1996) used linear and isoleastic demand as focal points that define a sensible range of calibrated price effects. Also Hausman (2010) proposes the use of linear and isoelastic demand as convexity bounds absent more specific information about demand curvature. 42 Shapiro (1996) first derived a closed-form solution for mergers with isoelastic demand for the special case of symmetric firms.

In this system of equations, the GUPPI terms represent the change in pricing incentives in the merging firms' FOCs compared to the pre-merger situation. 48 As discussed in Sect. 2.2, GUPPIs measure the negative externality that a firm exerts on its merger partner, which will be internalized post-transaction. CMCRs go one step further by also taking account of the feedback effects between the merging firms' FOCs. As a result, they are larger than GUPPIs. IPRs additionally account for the pass-through of price pressure into final prices (at the expense of having to assume a specific demand form).

This leads to an overor underestimation of price effects, depending on whether pass-through is below or above one. When demand convexity is low, pass-through is below one. In that case the two factors that are omitted by GUPPIs go in opposite directions and approximately offset each other. When demand convexity is high instead, pass-through will be above one.

Although most of the decisions that were discussed in Sect. 2.3 also reported GUP-PIs, CMCRs, and IPRs, the Commission's emphasis was often on calibrated simulation. While the assumption of a particular demand form can be restrictive, the Commission noted that the specific assumption of linear demand \"is conservative as other forms of demand, such as log-linear demand, would imply a higher predicted price increase.\" 52 Merging parties in those cases were hardly enthusiastic about simulations that predicted a potential for considerable price increases. Even so, the particular assumption of linear demand was typically not a central point of disagreement. 53 Instead, merging parties tended to argue that the Commission's estimates of diversion ratios and margins were excessive, or that static merger simulation fails to account for the dynamic benefits brought about by a transaction. 54 This notwithstanding, the General Court in CK Telecoms v. Commission recently overturned the Commission's prohibition decision in Hutchison 3G UK/Telef\u00f3nica UK despite a prediction of considerable price effects. 55 While the judgement does not reject the use of economic methods, it invokes a high standard of proof for the prohibition of mergers that do not lead to a dominant position. In particular, the Court held that the Commission must meet a higher standard of proof than the balance of probabilities in such cases. Moreover, it found that horizontal mergers should be judged against a presumption of standard efficiencies that are said to flow from such concentrations. 56 Recent trends at the CMA appear to have been somewhat different than at the Commission. As was noted in Sect. 2.3, the UK authorities were early adopters of IPRs and built a strong reputation for conducting customer surveys (e.g., to estimate diversion ratios). In terms of instruments used, however, the CMA has tended to move away from IPRs towards GUPPIs. 57 As we noted above, the CMA's 2017 retail mergers commentary even describes GUPPIs as \"the most commonly used measure\" for the quantification of competitive effects. 58 52 Hutchison 3G Italy/Wind/JV, supra note 23, Annex A at para. 10. 53 For an exception, see Telef\u00f3nica/E-plus, supra note 23, Annex A at para. 140 (defendants arguing that demand could in theory also be concave). As was noted in footnote 18, however, a low pass-through rate would have equally affected the merging parties' efficiency claims. As was shown in Eq. (4), the question whether marginal cost efficiencies outweigh anticompetitive effects is independent of the exact rate of pass-through. 54 E.g., see Hutchison 3G Italy/Wind/JV, supra note 23, at para. 774 and Annex A at para. 48. A frequently contested point is the degree of diversion to outside goods. See Moresi and Zenger (2018) for a formal treatment. 55 CK Telecoms v.

While this is a crucial element of unilateral effects analysis, there can also be other-often dynamic-aspects of competition that may make adverse effects more or less likely: e.g., entry or expansion, potential competition, product repositioning, investments or efficiencies. In particular, adverse merger effects can only materialize if there is some form of barriers to entry. 59 In some cases, the assumption of differentiated product markets with posted pricing that underlies the methods discussed in this article is not applicable. E.g., firms' competitive position may not be due to product differentiation, but to some other market imperfection: e.g., capacity constraints or switching costs. Quantitative tools should therefore not be used mechanically, but in the context of a coherent theory of harm that combines quantitative with qualitative evidence, including an analysis of potential mitigating factors that may act as constraints on merger effects. E.g., in the mobile telephony mergers that were discussed above, the Commission often complemented its quantitative analyses with evidence from internal documents that pointed to \"market repair\" and \"rational pricing\" (euphemisms for higher prices) as firms' primary goals in pursuing industry consolidation. 60",

An early contribution was Motta and Tarantino (2018) , who consider the effects of mergers on innovation with the use of different models of deterministic innovation. Concretely, they consider process innovation, so that higher expenditures lead to a certain reduction in the costs of production. In their main model, firms play a game where prices and investments are chosen simultaneously. In this setting results are clear. R&D investment follows quantities in the final product market; and since a merger typically increases prices and reduces output, R&D will fall as well. While outsiders react to this reduction in innovation by increasing their R&D and output, this is not enough to compensate for the merged entity's reduction in investment. Motta and Tarantino (2018) also show that in the event that substantial efficiencies are achieved by a merger, the R&D result can be reversed. 65 Federico et al. (2017 Federico et al. ( , 2018 reach similar conclusions in a model of stochastic product innovation. Federico et al. (2017) consider a model where innovation is ex novo, and firms can eventually produce the same product if they successfully innovate. 66 Federico et al. (2018) extend this framework to a setting where firms start with a baseline of existing differentiated products that can be improved by innovating. In both contributions, innovation is probabilistic in the sense that by spending more on R&D, a firm can improve its probability of achieving a successful innovation. Competing firms play a two-stage game, where price competition follows an initial stage of innovation competition. Therefore, the expected marginal gains from R&D in the first stage are driven by the difference between the expected profits with and without successful innovation in the second stage. 67 Federico et al. (2017 Federico et al. ( , 2018 show that, in the absence of efficiencies, the overall impact of a merger on innovation is determined by two effects: First, there is an \"innovation externality\" (or business stealing) effect, since increases in R&D expenditures by one firm reduce the expected profits of rivals (as discussed above). 68 This negative externality on the merging partner will be internalized following a merger 65 The paper is particularly specific to mobile telephony mergers. In this context, Motta and Tarantino show that when efficiencies can also be achieved by contractual solutions such as network sharing, a merger could nonetheless be challenged, since less restrictive contractual solutions would be available to reach the efficiency gains without reducing price competition. 66 See Gilbert (2019) for a related model. 67 This sequential setting where investment is chosen first, followed by price competition, arises from the long-term nature of investment decisions. 68 As noted by the Guidelines, \"The Agencies evaluate the extent to which successful innovation by one merging firm is likely to take sales from the other, and the extent to which post-merger incentives for future innovation will be lower than those that would prevail in the absence of the merger\" ( \u00a76.4). and thus lead to an unambiguous reduction in post-merger R&D efforts, all else equal.",

If the converse is true, the merger exerts an upward pressure. Thus, in theory, this effect could go either way as far as innovation is concerned. 69 Federico et al. (2018) use demand functions that imply that the price coordination effect is always positive, so that-in theory-it could be a proper countervailing force to the innovation externality. 70 Since the model has technical complexities, Federico et al.

            "text": "Similar to Motta and Tarantino (2018) , in Federico et al. (2018) the innovation result can be reversed if there are sufficiently high merger-related efficiency gains, such as improvements in the effectiveness of innovation or reductions in R&D costs. Since a merger also reduces product market competition, however, post-merger prices always increase absent efficiencies. Hence, potential efficiency gains have to be quite strong to produce gains for consumers. Denicol\u00f2 and Polo Denicol\u00f2 and Polo (2018) analyze one potential efficiency. Specifically, they show that in a variant of the model of Federico et al. (2017) a merger can lead to increased innovation if the convexity of firms' R&D cost functions is sufficiently moderate. In that case, R&D coordination between the merging parties will lead to the shut-down of one of the firms' R&D programs to avoid duplicative research. This concentration of R&D efforts can then lead to increased overall incentives to engage in R&D. 71 This is an interesting point. However, we note some words of caution about the practical implications of the approach of Denicol\u00f2 and Polo (2018) : First, they mute price competition by assuming that all firms in the industry are colluding, so by assumption consumers cannot benefit from competition through lower prices. Second, they analyze only mergers to monopoly, and it is not clear how their result would generalize beyond this limiting case. This is an important point, as with more 69 This notwithstanding, consumers are typically worse-off after a merger because, for a given level of innovation, prices will increase as a result of less product market competition. 70 A positive price coordination effect is assumed at the outset in Federico et al. (2017) . 71 The relevance of asymmetric outcomes on R&D effort has long been discussed in the literature on R&D joint ventures starting with D' Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) . There is a debate as to when interior versus corner equilibria apply in practice (see, e.g., Leahy and Neary 2005) . This discussion has sharpened our understanding but certainly not diminished the importance and policy impact of the seminal work of d'Aspremont and Jacquemin. than two firms the R&D coordination effect for the merged entity would be significantly diluted. Third, they consider the impact of mergers only on innovation, while competition law is instead interested in the overall effect on consumers (including competitive benefits from lower prices). Finally, also in this model mergers soften R&D competition when no efficiency arises (which is the case when firms' R&D cost functions are sufficiently convex). Bourreau et al. (2018) investigate the impact of horizontal mergers on firms' incentives to invest in demand-enhancing innovation in a more general framework. Their work is more directly related to Federico et al. (2018) , although they consider a simultaneous move rather than a sequential move setting. They show that the results of Federico et al. (2018) generalize to a wide class of models that are customarily employed in the literature in Industrial Organization: the hedonic price model, quality-adjusted models, and CES demand. Results instead change when they introduce a \"demand expansion effect\". This means that the R&D effort that is conducted by one firm would actually increase rather than decrease the demand for the products of its rivals. In this case, their setting is one with positive instead of negative R&D externalities among firms that, after the merger, get internalized. It is therefore not surprising that mergers can lead to more innovation in their model.",

Competition concerns are more likely to exist where innovation is a significant means of attracting customers from the merging partner (or, conversely, to protect existing business from it).

They find that mergers can be particularly harmful for innovation when an industry is already concentrated. Of course, these are the cases that matter in practice, as enforcers would not be likely to assess a merger in a fragmented industry with many competing players. Similarly, Cunningham et al. (2020) provide robust evidence of innovation concerns in the pharmaceutical industry. In their study of a large number of pharmaceutical acquisitions, incumbent firms often acquire innovative targets solely to discontinue the target's innovation projects and thus pre-empt future competition. These studies confirm that innovation competition is often a central aspect of market interaction, which may be seriously derailed through a merger when innovation markets are concentrated to begin with.",

However, the Commission found that such efficiencies were unlikely to play a significant role, since innovation in the crop-protection industry tends to be protected by effective IP rights. Appropriability was therefore already high prior to the merger. Concretely, most of the innovation in crop-protection takes place via the introduction of new products that are protected by effective patents. In successful instances, these products generate substantial sales with very high margins both during the patent period and after a patent expires. 78 Buehler et al.

This is why effects-based methods have considerably advanced the assessment of mergers with differentiated products. 82 Even so, we believe that market shares rightfully continue to play an appreciable role in the analysis of differentiated product mergers. This includes the use of safe harbors for low-market-share mergers and rebuttable presumptions for high-marketshare mergers that shift the burden of proof to the notifying parties. In our view, competition authorities ought to present particularly compelling effects-based evidence if they intend to raise competition concerns in markets with relatively lower market shares.

Such dynamic aspects of competition are particularly relevant in industries where, already prior to a proposed merger, firms exhibit substantial market power. In our previous work Zenger 2018, 2019) we discuss the structural increase in market power that many industries have experienced over the past 30 years according to the empirical literature. As we illustrate there, it is rational for competition authorities to apply comparatively stricter concentration benchmarks when pricing power is already substantial. This reduces the risk of type II errors, which are particularly costly for society when market power is high. 87 Of course, none of this implies that market shares are a more desirable diagnostic tool than effects-based methods. As noted in Sect. 2, concentration measures can be misleading when substitution is not proportional to market shares. This is 85 See Hovenkamp and Shapiro (2018) for a discussion. 86 E.g., see Nocke and Schutz (2018) , Nocke and Whinston (2020) or Spiegel (2020) . 87 At the time of writing of this article, the COVID-19 pandemic is still recent and ongoing. It remains unclear what structural impact the pandemic will have on different industries. We observe that the financial crisis of 2007-2008 did not halt or reverse the long-term trend towards increasing market power. 84 A similar point can be made with respect to margins, whose construction is often contested -in particular as regards which costs are truly incremental. why economic methods that measure competitive overlaps and market power more directly have greatly improved merger analysis. Our point here is instead that high (low) market shares establish a plausible prior for (against) competition concerns absent more specific information about the likely effects of a merger. In this way, concentration analysis can play an important role in shaping the standard of proof against which effects-based analysis can be judged. As Lord Hoffman noted in Rehman, \"it would require more convincing evidence to conclude that it was more likely than not that the sighting of an animal in a park was a lion than it would be to satisfy the same standard of probability that the animal was a dog.\" 88 In that sense, a continued role for market shares as a material piece of evidence is simply a matter of Bayesian inference.",

According to the empirical literature, market power in oligopolistic markets has risen over recent decades in both the U.S. and the EU. E.g., the widely cited studies by De Loecker et al. (2020) and De Loecker and Eeckhout (2020) show that we are in the midst of a sharp increase in pricing power across the economy. This secular shift is in large part driven by a reallocation of economic activity towards larger, more profitable oligopolists. At the same time, aggregate investment has been falling, empirical measures of barriers to entry have risen, and productivity growth is in decline. 89 In such an environment, vigilant merger control is particularly important to protect the functioning of the competitive process. As the empirical literature has shown, horizontal mergers can cause substantial competitive harm in oligopolistic markets. E.g., Ashenfelter et al.'s (2014, p . S78) survey of empirical merger retrospectives notes, \"The empirical evidence that mergers can cause significant increases in price is overwhelming. Of the 49 studies surveyed, 36 find evidence of merger-induced price increases.\" Thus, it is important to identify effective tools that can detect potentially anticompetitive mergers and distinguish them from benign transactions.",

In this article, we have provided a comparative treatment of different economic methods that assess competitive effects in the spirit of the Guidelines. These tools draw on the key factors that determine competitive outcomes-principally: who do merging firms compete with, and how much-to assess whether or not a transaction is likely to lead to material unilateral effects. Such methods can be particularly helpful in non-dominance cases, where inferences from market shares alone are often not sufficient to distinguish between harmful and harmless transactions. Being able to enforce competition law in such cases is critical, however, because according to the empirical literature, many of the most problematic transactions occur in oligopoly markets. 90 It is also important to recognize, however, that economic tools are not a panacea. In particular, quantitative predictions should not be interpreted as surgical point-estimates, but as directional measures that reflect the expected strength of underlying incentives. 91 In our view, the U.S. Guidelines strike the right tone here, by stating that higher diversion ratios indicate \"a greater likelihood\" of unilateral effects ( \u00a76.1) (much as higher market shares indicate a greater likelihood of unilateral effects when firms are similarly positioned). Appropriately applied, quantitative techniques should therefore be embedded in a broader case that is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative pieces of evidence to understand the likely competitive implications of a given transaction.",

In Sect. 2.3, we have already shown that for a given set of parameters linear IPRs are smaller than CMCRs, which in turn are smaller than the price effects with isoelastic demand. It remains to be shown how GUPPIs compare to IPRs. With the assumption of symmetry, GUPPIs are again given by DM, whereas IPRs are given by  DM\u22152(1 \u2212 D) . Hence, GUPPIs are larger than IPRs if and only if D \u2264 1\u22152 , which in a symmetric model holds for all mergers except mergers to monopoly. As long as there are at least two firms post-merger, we therefore have where IMS denotes isoelastic merger simulation.",
