Methods From January 19 to February 6, 2020, 88 confirmed COVID-19 patients presenting with pneumonia and 80 non-COVID-19 patients suffering from pneumonia of other origins were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory results were collected. CT features and scores were evaluated at the segmental level according to the lesions' position, attenuation, and form. Scores were calculated based on the size of the pneumonia lesion, which graded at the range of 1 to 4. Air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, crazy-paving pattern, subpleural curvilinear line, bronchiectasis, air space, pleural effusion, and mediastinal and/ or hilar lymphadenopathy were also evaluated. Results Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that history of exposure (\u03b2 = 3.095, odds ratio (OR) = 22.088), leukocyte count (\u03b2 = \u2212 1.495, OR = 0.224), number of segments with peripheral lesions (\u03b2 = 1.604, OR = 1.604), and crazy-paving pattern (\u03b2 = 2.836, OR = 2.836) were used for establishing the predictive model to identify COVID-19-positive patients (p < 0.05). In this model, values of area under curve (AUC) in the training and testing groups were 0.910 and 0.914, respectively (p < 0.001). A predicted score for COVID-19 (PSC-19) was calculated based on the predictive model by the following formula: PSC-19 = 2 \u00d7 history of exposure (0-1 point) \u2212 1 \u00d7 leukocyte count (0-2 points) + 1 \u00d7 peripheral lesions (0-1 point) + 2 \u00d7 crazypaving pattern (0-1 point), with an optimal cutoff point of 1 (sensitivity, 88.5%; specificity, 91.7%). Conclusions Our predictive model and PSC-19 can be applied for identification of COVID-19-positive cases, assisting physicians and radiologists until receiving the results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.",

The human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 can be realized through respiratory droplets, direct contact, and even a fecal-oral route [2, 3] . Although prevention and control measures have been applied, COVID-19 cases are no longer limited in Wuhan.

The comorbidities including respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal injury, and acute cardiac injury can also occur in severe cases, resulting in the poor prognosis of patients. Radiological examinations are highly significant for the early detection and management of COVID-19.

The COVID- 19 RT-PCR test aims to qualitatively detect nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens (e.g., nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, and nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate) collected from individuals suspected of having COVID- 19 . However, several studies demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with pulmonary involvement on CT could have negative results of RT-PCR, including 36 of 51 (71%) patients reported by Fang et al [6] , 5 of 167 (3%) patients presented by Xie et al [7] , and a case introduced by Huang et al [8] . RT-PCR tests were repeated for these patients and positive results achieved thereafter. The reasons for false-negative RT-PCR results may be related to limitation of nucleic acid detection technologies, inappropriate methods of sampling, low viral load in patients, or improper timing of sampling for RT-PCR. Furthermore, RT-PCR test is generally performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and it cannot be therefore carried out onsite. This workflow may be time-consuming and cause delay in the final diagnosis.",

The model was validated in a test group of 50 patients showing that distinction of COVID-19 was possible with high test quality parameters in an ROC analysis. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, history of exposure has been deemed as an important diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 [5] . However, the exact role of it in the diagnosis has still remained elusive. Our current research demonstrated that history of exposure was, but not the only strong predictor for the diagnosis of COVID-19. This result has great clinical values, especially for the current time when the number of cases is daily rising worldwide [12] [13] [14] . On one hand, with the increased number of cases and emergence of asymptomatic infectors, many suspected patients might have ambiguous history of exposure to COVID-19 [15] . On the other hand, in addition to direct human-to-human transmission, numerous patterns of transmission have been reported, including contact with contaminated fomites and inhalation of aerosols [16, 17] . It is noteworthy that in the present research, we included both COVID-19 patients without history of exposure and non-COVID-19 patients with history of exposure. Patients who were not confirmed or denied contact with infected cases were considered as without history of exposure. This is in accordance with the current trend that the infection source appears to be more obscure, as COVID-19 has become a pandemic worldwide. In addition, our study showed that compared with non-COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients had significantly lower leukocyte counts. That was reasonable because a proportion of non-COVID-19 patients were clinically diagnosed as bacterial infection with high leukocyte count [18] . Thus, normal or abnormally low leukocyte count was found to be a significant clue for diagnosing COVID-19 [19] .",

This is because CT can be rapidly and conveniently performed in the fever department, and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 [20] . In a study of 1014 patients, Ai et al has reported that positive chest CT manifestations had high sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and could also help indicate COVID-19-positive patients with initially negative but subsequently positive RT-PCR results [21] . Lin et al reported that in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, abnormal CT findings can proceed clinical symptoms which could be useful to provide additional diagnostic information in asymptomatic population with history of exposure [22] . Furthermore, CT is sensitive enough to detect GGO lesions in the early stage of COVID-19 which can be easily overlooked in the chest radiography [23] . Thus, it is an indispensable component for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 [9] . Typical CT manifestations of COVID-19 have been described including GGO, mixed GGO, crazy-paving pattern, and multifocal lesions in a peripheral distribution [19, 24] . Efforts have also been Fig. 2 ROC curve of the predictive model based on the clinical data. a AUC for the training group is 0.813 (95% CI, 0.735-0.891); b AUC for the testing group is 0.849 (95% CI, 0.737-0.961).

OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval made to distinguish COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia by chest CT. Our preliminary study on 33 patients demonstrated that multifocal, peripheral, and GGO lesions predominately located in the lower lung field were likely to indicate COVID-19 [25] . An analysis of SARS revealed that nodule, cavitation, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion were rare findings which could assist differentiation of coronavirus infection from other types of viral pneumonia [26] . Recently, Bai et al reported that compared with other types of viral pneumonia, COVID-19 tended to have more peripheral and GGO lesions with reticular opacity and vascular thickening [27] . These features may make the diagnosis from radiologists more specific. Consistent with previous studies, the results of the present study indicated that multiple segments with GGO and patchy lesions in peripheral distribution were significantly associated with COVID-19. The presence of other CT manifestations including air bronchogram, crazypaving pattern, and subpleural curvilinear line, and the lack of the tree-in-bud signs for advantageous for diagnosis and differentiation as well. These manifestations were evidenced by the pathological findings observed in COVID-19. GGO and mixed GGO changes were reflected by alveolar edema, proteinaceous exudates, and vascular congestion, while crazy-paving pattern was associated with interstitial infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells dominated by lymphocyte [28, 29] .",

Our results showed that the predictive model established based on both clinical and radiological features had higher diagnostic efficiency than the model that developed on the basis of clinical data alone. This model also reflected the two most critical signs for the diagnosis: crazy-paving pattern and increased number of involved lung segments with peripheral predominance. Although GGO and the number of affected segments strongly indicated COVID-19, they were not included in the scoring system due to their high correlation with peripheral lesions. Based on the established predictive model, we proposed a scoring system called PSC-19 and suggested its optimal cutoff point showing the best diagnostic accuracy. PSC-19 employed full advantages of signs and features provided by CT and the corresponding clinical parameters, making it useful for physicians to apply in the fever department. Furthermore, due to the highly contagious nature of COVID-19, PSC-19 might be a potentially helpful tool for the fast detection, isolation, and management of suspected patients to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",

To enroll more cross-infection in the hospital, a number of non-severe patients were discharged immediately after exclusion of COVID-19, and the complete pathogen examinations were not therefore undertaken. Finally, coagulation, biochemical, and other parameters associated with infection may be useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19, which should be included in the future study. However, in clinical practice, physicians are likely to have very limited laboratory data, and have to make a correct diagnosis shortly. Thus, our study might be helpful in the practice.",

Data with p < 0.1 were retained. Then, the continuous data were categorized. Due to the sample size of our training group, at most 10 variables were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed with stepwise forward likelihood ratio selection method. Cut-off values were identified by plotting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Area under curve (AUC) was calculated for both training and testing groups. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
