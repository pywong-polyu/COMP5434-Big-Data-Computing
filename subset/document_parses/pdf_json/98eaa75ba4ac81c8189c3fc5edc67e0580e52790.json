I could draw anything, from mother washing the dishes to father sleeping. Eventually I had so many drawings that there was no more room for them. I thought they would certainly be thrown away by mother. To my surprise, when I came home one day, I found mother had put up all my pictures on the walls. I really felt very happy. After that, whenever I fi nished a drawing, I would fi nd a space on one of the walls at home, so that it gradually became my art gallery. In retrospect, I am really very grateful to my parents for their encouragement and tolerance which gave me so much space in childhood. All the bits and pieces of my childhood are still vivid in my mind. Maybe this has to do with my having expressed myself and recorded my life through drawing! Although those drawings on the walls could not be taken with us when we moved house, every scene and object in them was already engraved on my mind.",

Through recognition and analysis of visual signs, mutual comprehension, communication, and care can be obtained. To teachers and parents who have received professional training, both children's drawings and adult graf fi ti are visual signs expressing life. Reading signs is like a Western doctor understanding his or her patient's condition through reading an X-ray photo, or a Chinese doctor feeling the patient's pulse. Children's drawings are the concrete manifestation of their feelings and perceptions, in other words, an external form of mental language, which contains many different languages, different moods, and different stories \u2026 all their mental input and output. So what can be understood from children's drawings is far richer and deeper than talking to them face to face. Drawings can re fl ect our thoughts, our internal emotional world, our lives.",

What kind of person a child will become largely depends on how this dye vat does its work! Everybody has their own family, and their views about family differ. To children, family is central. Parents are the centre of the family, the emotional fortress of children, the people with whom they have the most contact. They exert the greatest in fl uence on children's personality, learning, and psychology (Qiu Lianhuang 1984 ) . Many family problems are hidden behind the fa\u00e7ade of a seemingly prosperous society. Many children's psychological problems are the result of their family experiences. The family's in fl uence on the psychological development and health of a human being is much greater than people imagine (Wong 1988 ) . A properly functioning family is a safe haven, a place in which one can divulge what is on one's mind, a place which provides energy and a motive for action. In a malfunctioning family, members are not good at understanding and communicating with each other. When in dif fi culties, they will blame each other. The frustrations and anxieties of the parents may also be projected onto the children, rendering them the victims of family confl icts.",

This is because many adults (including sociologists), thinking that children are mentally immature, do not value their views. And there are also many people who are afraid of children's views and opinions, because they often lay bare truths that adults have been hiding, denying, and running away from. So they choose not to listen to children's views. But do we realize that children are also part of the family? Apart from being participants in the daily life of the family, they are also observers of the marital relationship, the key fi gures who turn husband and wife into parents (Laing 1971 ) . Children have their own views and feelings about their family, but lack the means, space, and power to fully express them. Whether these views and feelings are expressed or not, determine whether children will grow up healthily. No comprehensive study could have been done without children's voice. We should not and could not afford to neglect children's views and feelings about family.",

The sharp rise in the numbers of divorces and one-parent families in Hong Kong has meant more and more Hong Kong children grow up in incomplete families. Society often focuses on these children, deems that they have to face many family problems, and provides them with services and welfare to help them cope with problems arising from the incompleteness of their family. One of these services is Children's Home, the aim of which is to create a family environment for children to replace their incomplete family. However, while adults think that these services are able to help the children, do the children themselves think likewise? Is \"Children's Home\" a family? Does \"incompleteness\" necessarily mean \"problem\"? Does society not overemphasize the problems of these children of incomplete families?",

The 16 incomplete-family children who participated in my study in 2005 were all inhabitants of Children's Home, including six whose father was dead, two whose parents were both dead, and eight whose parents were divorced. Parsons ( 1955 ) points out that although the modern family has lost certain functions, it has specialized in some other functions, notably in child socialization. Children learn from their parents' different social norms, values, and skills such as how to interact with people, in order to develop their own personality. Parsons thinks that children in the family learn from their parents the key elements of their own future parenthood, through the process of socialization (Parsons 1955 ) . As Fig. 26.1 shows, the son learns to play the \"instrumental\", economic, or problem-solving role to become a father. The daughter learns the \"expressive\", emotional, caring role to become a mother.",

            "text": "From Fig. 26 .2 we can see that the son at home does not necessarily want to take over from the father the instrumental role. Instead, he may wish to play the expressive role of the mother, enjoying the time spent at home. The daughter does not necessarily want to take over from the mother the expressive role, either. Instead, she wishes to play the instrumental role of the father, relishing the time spent at work. In both instances, the son and the daughter thus socialized are considered as deviant. Parsons ( 1955 ) also thinks that the family is the source of psychological gold, a place which brings happiness. The workplace tires us out; only at home can we enjoy happiness. Family makes us happy. But Parsons neglects the fact that family can also be a place which produces problems and brings its members displeasure, disputes, con fl icts, troubles, and sadness. Family abuses, even kills. Laing ( 1971 ) thinks that family is about relations and interaction between parents and children. Starting from the birth of the child, the parents teach that only things in the family are good; that everything outside the family is bad and dangerous. The child also, unknowingly, becomes the key fi gure maintaining the marital relationship and communication. Family is like a tennis game (Fig. 26 .3 ); the child is a tennis ball passed to and fro, bounced back and forth, by the husband and the wife as father and mother-in that many messages between them are conveyed by the child, the go-between, the third party. Laing ( 1971 ) thinks that children are the most powerless group in the family, just like the tennis ball being bounced around by the parents in Fig. 26 .3 . When we look at family, we usually concentrate our attention on the parents playing the game but pay little attention to the ball (the child) being passed back and forth. This problem results from a failure to consider the child's point of view.",

Everybody needs understanding and care. Growing children particularly yearn for their parents' attention and patience. However, in reality, many parents cannot let go of their sense of \"dignity\" and they often rudely reject their children's demands for love. This is undesirable. Parent-child communication is often like talking with one's past. Laing ( 1971 ) thinks that the family is like a tennis game. Comparing the parents to the players and the child to the tennis ball, he points out that the roles played by the parents at home are active while the child's is passive.

(Question 1 : How come father and mother are still smiling so happily when they are fi ghting?) Because I am an angel. With my magical powers, I hope to make them stop fi ghting and smile a lot.

Siu Fung's father died of cancer when he was at a tender age, but Siu Fung still retains a vivid impression of his parents quarrelling and fi ghting at home. So, even though his father has been dead for a few years, he still makes this scene the major episode in \"My Family\", showing how deeply this scene is imprinted on his mind. Most remarkably, he wishes he could become an angel so that he will be able to mediate between his parents, and fl y to Heaven to visit his deceased father. The child also senses that he could be the important fi gure binding his parents' marriage together.

While pursuing pleasure, adults should take children's feelings into consideration and help them to create an environment conducive to the pursuit of happiness (Song Xiufen and Zhuang Huiqiu 1986 ) . Among the 16 children interviewed, Siu On puts into his drawing the family asset which makes him happy and of which he feels proud. In the drawing, \"My Family\" (Fig. 26 .6 ), Siu On, 11 years old, draws a very luxurious house. In explaining the drawing, he says, My home is very large and luxurious. It is the most gorgeous home in the whole world, because my family is the richest! So I can build the outer walls in different colours and use the most expensive materials. This is the most beautiful and gorgeous home in the whole world. (Question: Where are your family members?) I did not draw the members of my family, because they are never there. I live in the Children's Home. My mother and sister are often away. I no longer see my father at home. My sister and brother do not live at home, either. That's why I don't want to draw anybody in the house\u2026. Siu On's mother is a hotel manager. His \"home\" is really richer than those of the others in the Children's Home. But does belonging to a rich family mean happiness? When Siu On fi rst talks about how rich his family is, and how gorgeous his house is, he unconsciously looks proud and self-important. But when he is asked about the members of his family, his face grows dark and he lowers his voice. Apparently, he feels unhappy about the state of his family. He feels sad about his father's departure and the frequent absences of other family members-and he is reluctant to mention them of his own accord. In fact, even though it may be the most gorgeous house in the world, is it a home or just a hotel if most of the time nobody is there and nothing happens there, be it happy or unhappy, and if the family members just sleep and shower there?",

There is only one single person in the drawing and a small room. He has no friends, nor is he happy. In fact, the soulless life of the Home makes the children feel like robots. Their life has been organized for them and they cannot live like ordinary children cared for by their parents. They feel intensely lonely.",

As the man was eager to sell the product, he exaggerated and claimed that it was the most recent invention with the latest technology. Hearing that, the husband frowned a little bit. The son standing next to him understood what was going on and lost no time in saying to the salesman, \"Don't try to fool my dad, mister. He knows everything!\" (Li Hong and Fang Baochang 2005 ) . A telling phrase uttered by the son reveals a secret hidden in the mind of many a child: The father is their idol. In the mind of the child, the father is capable of doing anything in the world. The father is able to answer all the child's questions; the father is able to repair broken toys as if he were performing a miracle.

It is noticeable that when men get together to reaf fi rm their manhood, their conversation is limited to the following four topics-sport, money, work, and sex. They may think that children are a topic of conversation for women only. Particularly regrettably, they get no respect from their peers for having a caring relationship with their children.

It is because the father makes the daughter feel special. Actually, the daughter indeed recognizes the difference between herself and males (including her father). The relationship built up between every parent and their children is unique. When a father interacts with his daughter, he does not have to imitate the behaviour of his wife. He can provide the daughter with another kind of parental role model such as instrumental leadership. This will help her to interact with different people in her future life. When it is necessary to make important life decisions, she will be able to draw knowledge and inspiration from these two different styles and modes of life.",

And Siu Chiu has described how he and his brother are afraid of their parents' temper. Parents plant a seed in the emotional garden of children, which will grow in time. To certain families, this seed is \"love, respect and autonomy\". But there are also families like Siu Chiu's, which plant the seed of \"fear, obligation or guilt\" in the inner world of children. There is a comic book which describes how people vent their emotions, especially anger. The fi rst scene of one of the chapters is a boss yelling at one of his employees. Obviously, the employee now feels like yelling at someone in order to let off steam about his own grievances. So the second scene shows him going home and yelling at his wife. The third scene is the wife shouting at her children. Then the children kick their dog, which then bites a cat. This comic aptly describes Siu Chiu's family situation.

From that it can be seen, all children, no matter how old or young they are, want better communication with their mother and her support, encouragement, and approval. Now the greatest threat to society is the increasing challenge to the stability of family. The rate of divorce and the proportion of one-parent families are gradually rising. The de fi ciency of supportive forces such as marital and parent-child bonds is responsible for a major crisis of the modern family. Children nowadays are lonelier and lonelier, because they lack the power of love, the emotional support of parents who will pat them on the head, put an arm round their shoulders, and say with appreciation in their eyes, \"Well done! Good kid!\" Emotional support in the family is its solid foundation, the source of a happy life in the family, sunlight for the healthy emotional growth of the children. This kind of emotional support is twoway and interactive-parents should become the emotional support of children; and children are also the emotional support of parents (Engel 1998 ) . When there is reciprocal emotional support in the family, an indestructibly strong centripetal force will be generated, helping each and every member of the family to develop well as an individual.",

Along with the growth of children and family members, the family grows. A three-year-old child obediently holds its mother's hand while crossing the road, whereas a 6-year old tries to let go of its mother's grip. No matter how worried or reluctant the mother may be, she has to learn to let go of the hand, acknowledging the gradual maturation of her child. No one will deny the importance of family to children. Strangely, though we all live in our family, feel its atmosphere and rely on its pulse and breath, we seldom look at the family from the point of view of children.",

Parsons ( 1955 ) thinks that through socialization, children learn to be the future parent, inheriting the instrumental and expressive roles in the family. But in their drawings, children do not indicate that they want to be a father or a mother in the future. They only address the current situation and wish to have more power, more ability, and more freedom. Parsons also thinks that family is the source of psychological gold, a place that can bring happiness. But what is expressed by the children in their drawings is all sombre faces of family. So in the minds of children, family is not necessarily a happy place as maintained by Parsons, but a place that brings them problems and unhappiness. Laing ( 1971 ) thinks that the family is about relationship between parents and children. But the children think otherwise. The family in the mind of the children is unique. In the children's drawings, family is a clearly demarcated space. Everything inside the house is part of their family, while everything outside is not their family. Family is time. Some of the children think that their family in the past was happier and so they choose to draw their family in the past. Some of them think that their present family is happier, and so they choose to draw the present family. Some of the children yearn for the future family and draw the family they may have in the future. Children's family can have three different times and spaces. Family is family members. The children think that family members are their family but some do not think so. Family is yearning. Some of the children are dissatis fi ed with their past and present families and they yearn for their future family.",

The foster parents in Children's Home cannot replace the children's fathers and mothers. Neither does the Home enable these children from special families to regain the feeling of home. The ideal homes in the children's minds are not homes in the eyes of the adults. By drawing \"non-family homes\" as ideal homes the children are expressing dissatisfaction with their families in real life. These \"non-realistic\" ideas represent their criticism of, and discontents with, family members, the Home, family, reality, life, and living.",

In that kind of \"harmonious\" family atmosphere, all problems, resentment, and traumas cannot make their appearance. They are suppressed, repressed, shut out of consiousness and memory. As a result, what we see is a happy family photo, in which every member reveals a face that smiles, for the bene fi t of the outsiders and the insiders, while private bitterness is hidden away in the heart. Society has taught all of us through socialization to play the happy family game (Laing 1971 ) .",

But simultaneously they practise denial and repress unhappy thoughts. Just as the art therapist, Lu Yaqing ( 2000 ) , and the artist, Wang Jiacheng ( 1975 ) have pointed out, drawing provides an opportunity for nonverbal expression and communication. The characteristic of children's drawing is that their view of objects and events is pure and innocent and expressed very sincerely. They look at objects and events with \"an innocent eye\", and put their internal feelings on the drawing paper, by way of images untainted by reason and driven by subjective emotions and feelings. Take Fig. 26 .26 as an example. At fi rst sight, ordinary people may think that it is a drawing depicting a happy family on a day out. In reality, this is the 8-year-old Siu Si's depiction of how she and her younger sister have to separate their parents, who are always fi ghting, before they can enjoy a day out together. If we are prepared to put aside the adult perspective, and to open our eyes to see what children's drawings are really telling us, we will know that children have bad feelings about the down and dark side of their family. We will then learn of their grievances against family members, their dissatisfaction with the family home, their place in it, their reality: The drawings of children tell only one thing: the truth.",

When children draw, they do not follow the outer appearance of the object; instead they draw the image in their mind according to their own perspective. Children's drawings re fl ect their internal world. Knowing how to read children's drawings means fi nding the door or window to the inner secrets of children. So starting with children's drawings, and assisted by their own explanations, we can fi nd out what they think about their family, and about themselves. If children's drawings are viewed in chronological order, they can be read as an epic of the life process. This epic is beautiful, splendid, full of fancies and miracles, and reveals the happenings in each and every stage of the child's development. In this epic we encounter the physiological and psychological story, the con fl ict within the individual, con fl ict between individuals, con fl ict between self and society. When carefully reading these children's drawings, which re fl ect their life process, we will notice the spindrift resulting from different kinds of con fl ict. It not only covers a wide range, but also involves individual orientations and forces constantly shifting between concealment and conspicuousness, strength and weakness, joy and sorrow. New-born babies are like a blank piece of paper, but society, parent-child relationships, and the family write on it, constructing babies' biographies and trajectories. May all the parents in the world be able to make good use of children's drawing as key to the inner yearning, needs, and desires of children and understand their inner world.",
