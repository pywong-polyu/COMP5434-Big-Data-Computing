A concern for the development of new viral vaccines is the potential to induce vaccine-enhanced disease (VED). This was reported in several preclinical studies with both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS vaccines but has not been reported with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We have used ferrets and rhesus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 to assess the potential for VED in animals vaccinated with formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (FIV) formulated with Alhydrogel, compared to a negative control vaccine. We showed no evidence of enhanced disease in ferrets or rhesus macaques given FIV except for mild transient enhanced disease seen 7 days after infection in ferrets. This increased lung pathology was observed at day 7 but was resolved by day 15. We also demonstrate that formaldehyde treatment of SARS-CoV-2 reduces exposure of the spike receptor binding domain providing a mechanistic explanation for suboptimal immunity.",

Consequently, there is an urgent requirement to develop safe and effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19 (2) . Currently, 91 vaccine candidates are in clinical evaluation with 184 listed as in preclinical evaluation (World Health Organization draft landscape of COVID-19 vaccines-22 April 2021). Nine vaccines have been approved for emergency use in various countries including two nonreplicating viral vector vaccines, three inactivated virus vaccines, and two vaccines based on mRNA technology (3) . Efficacy l results from phase 3 studies are available for mRNA-based vaccines (4, 5) and viral vector vaccines (6, 7) , which expresses a codon-optimized full-length spike protein (S). Whole virus vaccines grown in Vero cells and inactivated with \uf062-propiolactone are also in use (8) (9) (10) . These vaccines have also been evaluated for protection in nonhuman primates following challenge with SARS-CoV-2. The virus induces only mild to moderate disease in macaques, but these vaccines reduce viral loads and pathology in the upper and lower respiratory tracts to varying degrees (8, 9, 11, 12) .",

The most studied mechanism of VED is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease, reviewed recently by Arvin et al. (14) and Lee et al. (15) . It has been suggested that ADE could be a consequence of low-affinity antibodies that bind to viral proteins but have limited neutralizing activity (16) . The vaccine enhancement of disease by ADE mechanisms was described in children given formaldehyde (FA)-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines in the 1960s (17) , measles vaccines (18) , and in dengue hemorrhagic fever due to secondary infection with a heterologous dengue serotype (19) .",

A further study demonstrated protection in mice following immunization with formalin or ultraviolet light-inactivated SARS-CoV-1, but animals developed eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates (21) .

To interrogate the potential for VED in ferrets and rhesus macaques to support future safety studies on novel COVID-19 vaccines, we prepared a FA-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (FIV), formulated in Alhydrogel. In this study design, we aim to induce a suboptimal immune response that may promote VED, immunized animals are challenged with SARS-CoV-2 14 days after vaccination. Clinical signs, viral shedding, and pathology are monitored following challenge, and immune responses are characterized before and after infection. No enhanced pathology is observed in either species except for transient enhanced pathology at 7 days after infection in ferrets, and we present a possible mechanism for suboptimal immunity induced by FA-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 spike.",

SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis (fig. S1A) shows that most of the protein bands seen in the medium only (lane 2) are also seen in the live wild-type virus (lane 3) and the FIV (lane 4), indicating that these proteins are likely to be components of the culture medium, including fetal bovine serum (FBS) and host cell proteins. The medium-only protein species are visibly reduced in intensity following washing using the centrifugal concentrator in the FIV although this was sixfold concentrated. Notably, protein species in the 62-to 100-kDa range were almost absent in FIV. The Western blot analysis ( fig. S1 , B and C) confirms that both wild-type live virus and FIV react with antibodies to both SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid. Western blot with the NIBSC (National Institute of Biological Standards and Control, UK), SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, MERS convalescent serum (S3) standard has limited reactivity with proteins found in the medium (fig. S1B). However, a virus-specific band corresponding to the spike-RBD band on the specific antisera blot is detected at approximately 160 kDa in unwashed virus preparation and at 180 kDa in FIV with the increased molecular weight likely to be a consequence of FA fixation crosslinking this protein.",

The sampling schedule is shown in Table 1 . The high-titer stock of challenge virus was prepared (passage 3), and quality control sequencing showed that it was identical to the original stock received from the Doherty Institute and did not contain a commonly reported 8-amino acid deletion in the furin cleavage site (29) . Both groups displayed similar viral genome copies in nasal wash samples, which continued to be detected until the end of the experiment at day 15 after challenge ( Fig. 2A ). Similar to a previous study (26) , the peak in viral RNA shedding was seen between days 2 and 4 after challenge for all ferrets in both groups. The majority of virus detected in nasal wash occurred between challenge and day 8 after challenge. Viral RNA detected in nasal wash and throat swab samples was also shown to be approximately threefold higher in the FIV group at day 2 after challenge. A similar trend was seen in both groups during the first week after challenge although the RNA genome copies measured were substantially lower in the throat swab than in the nasal wash samples (Fig. 2B) . Overall, there were no substantial differences between groups in virus shedding from either the nose or throat. Neither group of animals showed weight loss due to the infection ( fig. S2 ). The apparent difference in weight gain in the FIV-vaccinated group was due to the necropsy sampling of the two lightest animals from this group on day 7. No fever was seen at any time in either group of ferrets after infection ( fig. S2 ).",

One animal from the Ad-GFP group showed mild lesions compatible with acute bronchiolitis and perivascular/peribronchiolar cuffing (Fig. 3 , F and G). The other animal from this group showed only occasional minimal bronchiolar infiltrates. Both animals from the FIV group at 7 days pc showed more remarkable changes, with mild to moderate bronchiolitis (infiltrates within the bronchioles and occasionally bronchi) and inflammatory foci within the parenchyma (Fig. 3B ). Moreover, perivascular cuffing was observed frequently (Fig. 3C) , with the infiltrates being mostly mononuclear cells, including CD3 + T lymphocytes identified by immunohistochemistry staining (Fig. 3D ). Occasionally, neutrophils and eosinophils were also present ( Fig. 3C , inset). The cuffing also affected numerous airways (Fig. 3C) . Because of the small numbers of animals, the differences in scores observed between FIVand Ad-GFP-vaccinated groups did not reach significance. In contrast, at 13 to 15 days after challenge, the lesions observed were minimal to mild with no obvious differences between groups (Fig. 3A) . RNAScope in situ hybridization (ISH) technique was used to detect viral RNA in lung and nasal cavity tissue sections. Only very few occasional scattered cells were found positive to viral RNA in the lung at day 6/7, which were within the alveolar walls and not related to the presence of lesions. No differences were observed between groups. Viral RNA was also found only as small foci of positive cells (epithelial and or sustentacular) within the olfactory and respiratory mucosa in only one animal from the Ad-GFP group at day 6 pc (Fig. 3H) . No obvious lesions were observed in any other organ except for the liver, which showed a variable degree of multifocal hepatitis, mild to moderate in all animals (Fig. 3 , E and I).",

FIV-vaccinated animals produced significant increases in immunoglobulin G (IgG) after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 spike and spike RBD. The response to nucleoprotein (N) was not significant. Modest rises [geometric mean titer (GMT) = 89, P = 0.002] in neutralizing antibody titers were seen in sera from the FIV-vaccinated animals with a rapid rise in neutralizing antibody titers after challenge indicating immune priming by the FIV. At termination, the GMTs for FIV-vaccinated animals were 5356 and 453 for the two remaining Ad-GFP-vaccinated animals. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays applied to splenocytes isolated on day 6 pc (Ad-GFP-vaccinated) or day 7 pc (FIV-vaccinated) show that animals vaccinated with FIV made more pronounced responses to whole live virus, membrane, and nucleocapsid peptide pools with both groups showing similar low responses to virus spike peptides ( fig. S3A ). This early interferon-\uf067 (IFN\uf067) response after infection is consistent with an anamnestic response in the FIV-vaccinated animals following priming with viral antigens. The lack of cellular immune response to spike is interesting and might indicate that FIV promotes a skewed immune response. Responses measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were much lower than those seen in splenocytes.",

Samples were then tested for binding of RBD ligands, either soluble (s)ACE2-Fc or the RBD binding monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) CR3022 and EY6A that interact with RBD surfaces nonoverlapping the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding site. Binding curves revealed that ligands binding to FA-treated S protein gave substantially lower maximum binding than that to the untreated S counterpart (Fig. 8A) . Area under the curve (AUC) analysis revealed that binding was significantly reduced for sACE2-Fc and CR3022 and had a trend to reduction for EY6A (Fig. 8B ). The reduction for sACE2 and CR3022 was almost precisely twofold, suggesting either that the FA treatment had reduced the binding activity of a subset of RBD domains or that half of the FA-treated S trimers were in a non-RBD available conformation. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we tested binding directly to the isolated untreated or FA-treated RBD (Fig. 8C) . Notably, FA treatment had no effect on RBD ligand binding, with AUC analysis showing near identical values for FA-treated and untreated RBD (Fig. 8D ). It therefore seems most likely that FA treatment is stabilizing a population of S trimers in the \"RBD down\" conformation which would be unable to engage ACE2. Recent cryo-EM structures imply that the S trimer is 50% one RBD up and 50% all RBD down at equilibrium (30) . Therefore, cross-linking of a population of trimers would most likely fix this 1:1 equilibrium, allowing only half of the trimers to expose the one up RBD. By contrast, untreated S trimer would be free to sample both conformations, allowing progressive ACE2 occupancy to maximum of the one up RBD trimer conformation over time. This would explain the twofold decrease in occupancy of FA-treated S trimers shown above. To further interrogate this, we modeled the location of lysine and arginine residues, the side chains of which are targets for FA attack, in the S trimer and RBD structures. Figure 6E focuses on the location of lysines and arginines in the RBD-down S trimer, revealing a large number proximal to the RBD-trimer interface that might be cross-linked to prevent RBD movement. Figure 6F shows that, while there are lysine and arginine residues proximal to the RBD-ACE2 binding interface (green), there are none within the interface, implying that FA treatment would not directly affect RBD-ACE2 binding. This modeling is therefore consistent with the idea that FA cross-linking will lock 50% of trimers into the all RBD-down state, reducing access of the RBD to ligand binding and B cell recognition. Such modified antigenicity would probably translate into reduced RBD immunogenicity, reducing antibody production against this neutralizing antibody-eliciting surface.",

Thus, vaccines not only must be thoroughly assessed for reactogenicity and longer-term safety (31) but also to ensure that they do not cause any enhancement of disease (32) . VED, which can be mediated by ADE, have been described for respiratory virus vaccines. The potential risks from COVID-19 vaccines have been described by Graham (33) . Enhanced disease can potentially be mediated by antibodies that bind virus without neutralizing activity, which cause disease through increased viral replication or via formation of immune complexes that deposit in tissues and activate complement pathways associated with inflammation (13) . T helper 2 cell (T H 2)-biased immune responses have also been associated with ineffective vaccines that can lead to enhanced disease following infection (34) (35) . To understand the risks of VED caused by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, it will be of great benefit to produce a positive control vaccine that enhances disease in an animal model following challenge so this endpoint can be defined and the mechanisms can be understood and avoided in vaccines prepared for human use.",

FA-fixed SARS-CoV-1 vaccines have been shown to induce enhanced disease (20, 21, 23, 24) , although the mechanism for this is not understood. It has been suggested that nonviral components of FA-inactivated preparations, such as cellular components and debris or medium constituents, may also play a role in enhanced disease. In a cotton rat model of RSV VED, cell culture contaminants were a major driver of lung pathology, which was exacerbated by the FIV and RSV challenge (37) . The SARS-CoV-2 FIV prepared in this study also contained cell and medium components, although the content was significantly reduced by washing using a centrifugal concentrator. Another factor in the FIV vaccine design was to use Alhydrogel as an adjuvant that is known to induce T H 2-biased immune responses (38) . In addition, as a suboptimal immune response has been suggested to be associated with VED (16), we chose to challenge the ferrets and rhesus macaques 14 days after intramuscular delivery of a single dose of FIV.",

There were no differences in temperature, weight ( fig. S2 ), or any other clinical signs between the two groups. Consistent with the higher viral load at day 2, the lung histopathology from the two FIV-vaccinated ferrets necropsied at day 7 was more severe than the two Ad-GFP-vaccinated animals necropsied at day 6. The semiquantitative scoring system was used to discriminate the severity of lesions between animals and groups. Although the number of animals was small, and although lung pathology was not severe in any case, we observed some unique differences in the FIV-vaccinated ferrets. At 6 to 7 days after challenge, a higher severity was observed in animals from the FIV group (combined total score, 24) compared to the Ad-GFP control (combined total score, 10). This included eosinophilic infiltrate and perivascular cuffing that were not observed in the control-vaccinated ferrets. The lung pathology in the ferret model (26) was quite transient, and thus, at 13 to 15 days after challenge, while there was some individual variability present, both groups showed mild pathology. Eosinophilic infiltrates have previously been observed for SARS in mice and rabbits (40, 41) .",

Vaccinia containing the S, N, and other structural SARS-CoV-1 genes was used to immunize mice before SARS-CoV-1 challenge. Mice given vaccines that contained nucleocapsid exhibited severe pneumonia, and vaccinia-N-vaccinated mice showed up-regulation of both T H 1 [IFN-\uf062 and interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and T H 2 (IL-4 and IL-5) cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and transforming growth factor-\uf062), which resulted in infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes in to the lung. Thus, suggesting an excessive host response to the SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid was involved in the severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-1 infection. This parallels the observation by Atyeo et al. (50) who noted that functional antibody responses to nucleocapsid were elevated in deceased individuals, while elevated anti-S responses were measured in survivors. Thus, it may be that vaccines that produce an excessive nucleocapsid immune response may be useful for a model to explore the potential for enhanced disease.",

Conversely, spike peptide-specific IFN\uf067 spot-forming units (SFU) measured in macaques increased significantly following FIV vaccination and evaluation of the spike-specific IFN\uf067 response in splenocytes and PBMC collected from macaques at a similar time analysis was used to determine the binding index, where 1 is equivalent to binding between untreated and FA-treated S trimer, and 0 is equivalent to zero binding to FA-treated trimer.

This may reflect that improved priming of the T cell-mediated response contributed to the protection afforded by the FIV vaccine in this species if response magnitude is driven by antigenic load following infection. The expression of checkpoint inhibitory receptors is often considered a marker of T cell exhaustion, although more recently, PD-1 signaling has also been linked to improved effector T cell priming and enhanced clearance of acute viral infections (51) . Similarly, the induction of regulatory CD4 T cells, and the inhibitory influence they are likely to exert, may be considered counterproductive to vaccine induced immunity. However, the increased frequency of T regulatory T cells observed following FIV vaccination is likely to reflect the immune response typically induced by coronaviruses in this species, as similar increases were also seen in the unvaccinated animals early after SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus may help to explain the relatively mild disease that develops in this species and the improved outcome observed in FIV vaccine primed macaques (52) (53) .",

FA treatment of S trimer in this format was the same as that used to inactivate the vaccine, allowing extrapolation of ligand binding to the ELISA-captured FA-treated S trimer to that on the virus. FA cross-linking resulted in a twofold reduction in binding of ACE2-Fc and two RBD-specific mAbs (CR3022 and EY6A) to FA-treated compared to untreated S trimer. By contrast, FA treatment of recombinant RBD did not affect binding of ACE2-Fc or these mAbs, implying that FA treatment cross-linked a proportion of S trimer into a nonligand binding conformation. These results are consistent with the location of lysine and arginine residues and suggest that RBD exposure may be limited by cross-linking, reducing exposure of neutralizing antibody epitopes on the RBD. This result may be of more general interest, since other viral envelope glycoproteins, such as those of HIV-1, are metastable and sample different conformational states, some of which are more relevant to neutralization than others (55) . Cross-linking may trap these different conformational states, modifying exposure of neutralizing antibody epitopes to B cell recognition (56) .",

However, we did observe increased pathology scores early in the infection of FIV-vaccinated ferrets that resolved by the later necropsy time point. It is reassuring that, even with a vaccine deliberately designed to induce enhanced disease, no enhancement was seen apart from at 7 days after infection in ferrets. Future studies to investigate the potential of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to cause enhanced disease should examine lung pathology at multiple time points including soon after challenge. Formalin-inactivated virus can be used as a suboptimal comparator to determine the potential of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates to induce VED so that unsuitable vaccines are identified at an early stage of development before significant clinical studies commence.",

The COVID pattern score was calculated as sum of scores assigned for the number of nodules identified and the possession and extent of GGO and consolidation according to the following system: nodule(s): score 1 for 1, 2 for 2 or 3, 3 for 4, or more; GGO: each affected area was attributed with a score according to the following: score 1 if area measured <1 cm, 2 if 1 to 2 cm, 3 if 2 to 3 cm, and 4 if >3 cm, and scores for each area of GGO were summed to provide a total GGO score; consolidation: each affected area was attributed with a score according to the following: 1 if area measured <1 cm, 2 if 1 to 2 cm, 3 if 2 to 3 cm, and 4 if >3 cm. Scores for each area of consolidation are summed to provide a total consolidation score. To account for estimated additional disease impact on the host of consolidation compared to GGO, the score system was weighted by doubling the score assigned for consolidation. To determine the zone score, the lung was divided into 12 zones, and each side of the lung was divided (from top to bottom) into three zones: the upper zone (above the carina), the middle zone (from the carina to the inferior pulmonary vein), and the lower zone (below the inferior pulmonary vein). Each zone was further divided into two areas: the anterior area (the area before the vertical line of the midpoint of the diaphragm in the sagittal position) and the posterior area (the area after the vertical line of the midpoint of the diaphragm in the sagittal position). This results in 12 zones in total where a score of one is attributed to each zone containing structural changes. The COVID pattern score and the zone are summed to provide the total CT score.",
