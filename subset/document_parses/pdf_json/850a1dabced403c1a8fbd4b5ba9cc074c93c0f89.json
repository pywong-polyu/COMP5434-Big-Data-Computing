Polypharmacy patients have an increased risk of experiencing adverse drug reactions, geriatric syndromes, morbidity, and decreased medication adherence. Polypharmacy patients also receive inappropriate medications more frequently [1] . Although polypharmacy is often necessary, it is important to differentiate inappropriate polypharmacy, which occurs when the patient is receiving medication without an evidence-based indication, their medicines fail to achieve therapeutic goals, they experience or have a high risk of experiencing adverse drug reactions or they are not able to properly take their medications [2] .",

Pharmacist-led medication review (MR) is a structured evaluation of a patient's medicines for detecting drug-related problems and recommending interventions with the aim of optimizing medicine use and improving health outcomes [3] . MR services have been shown to improve medication awareness including improved medication adherence and decreased drug-related problems [4] [5] [6] . The latter is particularly important, as adverse drug events are the 14th leading cause of patient morbidity and mortality globally with a substantial proportion of such medicationrelated harm being avoidable [2] . Although the effect of MR on mortality, hospitalizations, length of stay in hospital, emergency department visits, readmissions, physician visits, and healthcare utilization needs more evidence [4, 7, 8] , the World Health Organization in their 2019 report has considered it to be one of the key steps for assuring medication safety in polypharmacy [2] .",

Eastern European countries have historically been more focused on traditional services as dispensing, compounding, and counselling regarding medication use. Existing extended services mainly include point-of-care tests (e.g., taking blood pressure) and are focused on complementing the traditional pharmacy service rather than expanding pharmacists' role in the broader healthcare system [14] .

The service was applied as a national approach to reduce health care costs, improve patients' management of their medicines and to introduced patient-centered services in community pharmacies [25, 26] . The SEM analysis indicates that one of the most important barriers to the MUR service in Eastern Europe and Iran is the lack of support from policy makers.
