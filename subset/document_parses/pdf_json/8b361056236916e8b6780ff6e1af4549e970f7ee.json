Nine-in-ten spine cases are in LMICs, and spine diseases make up 39.0% of operative cases in LMICs. 1 The pandemic will stretch the resources of the already fragile surgical systems in LMICs and thereby worsen the disparities in access to neurosurgical care. As priorities are readjusted and unprecedented resources are made available to battle the new coronavirus, we need to explore the shared interests between global surgery and pandemic response and preparedness.",

Furthermore, elective surgeries have been put on hold to decrease the infection risk for both patients and HCWs and to create additional treatment capacity for the COVID-19 patients. In fact, the entire surgical system with its staff, space, and stuff is being repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. In effect, surgical services become reduced to only care for the most urgent cases only thereby creating a massive backlog of elective cases and disrupting training of residents and even economic hardship.",

This, of course, came from the recognition that even the strongest health systems may be overrun by the surge of the COVID-19 patients. As mentioned in the previous section, surgical subsystems are proving to be highly valuable as a source of additional treatment capacity when needed. McKinsey estimates that as much as a 30% increase in treatment capacity could be rapidly achieved by repurposing surgical capacity. 6 There is now an effort within the global surgery community, whose main objective is to increase surgical capacity in the developing world, to advocate for surgical system strengthening as a component of pandemic preparedness strategy in the LMICs. Investment in surgical system building may be one of the \"bestbuys\" in pandemic preparedness and global health. Building surgical beds, intensive care units, and operating theaters along with a cadre of trained personnel serves the massive unmet surgical needs of the population and, at the same time, provides immediate treatment capacity in times of a pandemic.",
