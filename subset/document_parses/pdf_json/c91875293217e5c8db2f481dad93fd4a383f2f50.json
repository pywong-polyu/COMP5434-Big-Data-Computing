            "text": "A company's efficiency and competitiveness are the most challenging aspects in the fast-growing global market which have motivated the firms to plan manufacturing management strategies. The critical issue addressed by them are, delivery of the product at the earliest to the customer, and at low cost without compromising the quality of the product [14] . One of the wellestablished systems is lean manufacturing which involves transformation of existing process manufacturing system into a system with elimination of waste i.e, eliminating non-value-added time/ activities existing in the process [11] . One of the lean manufacturing techniques called value stream mapping helps to identify the places wherever improvements are possible with the help of other lean tools. Value Stream mapping is simple and visual processbased tool, enabling documentation, visualisation, comprises materials and flow of the process [2] . In order to find waste within the process and assist in elimination of the waste, in the last few years organisations around the globe have used the value stream mapping which enabled them to achieve higher efficiency within the system [6] . A case of automated piston manufacturing line has been taken into study and for further continuous improvement and better resource allocation by analysing current state of the process. The technology has been growing at a higher growth rate and new equipment coming into the manufacturing markets is growing exponentially. Thus, for the companies to stay in the competitive market, it is imperative for them to adapt to the latest technology and machinery which are currently trend [7] . In many industries, the resources within a system have been increasing and without any acquaintance, the excessive resources are either being idle or scraped. The available resources could be utilised, redesigned, retrofitted or used for different application [10] . This way the resources can be effectively utilized without wastages. Various researchers have proven that optimization with retrofitting has shown considerable increase in the efficiency of operation. Chen, Ting-Yu, et al. show that optimisation of the headstock with redesign or new parts would be great performance enhancers [4] . Alquraan. T, et.al, said that the chuck designs can be used for high speed cutting and it is apt for CNC lathes [1] . Dimitrov, Dimitar, et. al in their study suggested that retrofitting of tool holder with multiple tool holder with standard setup will be very helpful and reduce the non-value-added time [5] . The automated piston production line for the piston have been taken as a case study to reuse the existing vertical lathe machine in the existing automated production line which includes four cells comprising of horizontal lathe machine. The new redesigning of the existing process line with the available resource using a two-way holding pull back chuck in a vertical lathe machine replacing horizontal lathe machine could demonstrate that sustainability of process line also can be achieved by excellent resource management [3] Table 1 .",

In our case we are considering through resource management, vertical CNC lathe machines were available thus retrofitting them with the help of push back two-way holding chuck. In order to do so, the chuck holder of the existing vertical CNC lathe has to be considered for redesigning and produced in order to hold the new chuck.

These machine tools, usually called vertical boring mills, are designed to perform turning type operations on work pieces that are more convenient to be laid down and held on a horizontal face plate surface than on the vertical face plate surface of a conventional lathe [5] . Many medium and large sized parts are machined more conveniently in this manner. Often these machine tools are required to bore large deep holes, in which case the boring bars or long tool holding slides are attached in a vertical position. Held in a horizontal position, these bars or slides would bend or sag appreciably under their own weight, which would make it difficult to bore an accurate hole. Many of these machines are operated by numeric control, which enables them to machine complex contoured surfaces in addition to performing other more conventional operations [13] . The vertical turning lathe has specific advantage when it comes to tool holders as it can hold more number of tools as in this case it needs room for four different tools in a single vertical lathe [12] .",

The robotic arm moving horizontally by holding the work piece needs certain precision as there is stress developed during the movement and holding of the work piece. Hence, this movement has to be optimised and was fixed as fifty-one seconds. The workpiece is initially held at the body of the piston and after implementing the new design, the piston is held at the top. In this perspective, the position of holding the piston reduces the stress implicated while fitting precisely in the vertical CNC lathe, as the robotic arm moves and holds the work piece vertical. Thus the optimum transfer time was calculated to be nine seconds lesser than the previous process design. The new proposed process line operation is given below in Tables 2-4 .",

The calculation of overall equipment effectiveness gives the perspective of advantage over the new process line as the drop to drop time between the cells has been reduced from 51 s in the current state to 42 s in future state. Elimination of wastages by using value stream mapping is a thorough well sort within the manufacturing sector, and as for this case, it shows that retrofitting of a vertical CNC lathe with a two way holding chuck has increased the effectiveness. The number of cells required for total operation has been decreased from four to three, which gives the current system an edge to adapt or increase the production with the help of available resources. This not only helps the machines, but also assists in effective usage of available man power. It has been predicted that, with the current setup of three cells, the company can expect its production capacity to have a higher production rate ",

Certain study also comes up with a solution that when the conventional lathe machine has been retrofitted with numerical stepperbased method, the machine works as a CNC trainer kit, which can aid the company to improve its overall productivity [8] .
