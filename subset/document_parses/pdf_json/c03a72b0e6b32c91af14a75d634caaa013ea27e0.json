At the same time, occupational safety and health measures have been widely applied. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work considers that information and communication technologies are the main methods to achieve the goals proposed to improve working life and the dissemination of good practices. The principal objective was to determine the trends of publications focused on these technologies and occupational safety in the healthcare sector during the last 30 years. A bibliometric study was carried out. The 1021 documents showed an increased trend per country, especially for the United States (p < 0.001) and year (p < 0.001). The citations per year showed significant differences between citations of articles published before 2007 (p < 0.001). The year was also linked to the increase or decrease of articles (72.2%) and reviews (14.9%) (p < 0.001). The analysis of journal co-citations also showed that the main journals (such as Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology) were linked to other important journals and had a major part in the clusters formed. All these findings were discussed in the manuscript and conclusions were drawn.",

These results displayed a similar number of documents for Web of Sciences and PubMed, higher number of documents for Scopus, and the Health and Medical Collection and Psychology Database had the highest quantity. However, the Health and Medical Collection and Psychology Database also included greater number of grey data than the other three databases (Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed). The significant difference between these databases was the theme and topic of the research, therefore, the main two databases were Web of Sciences and Scopus. The documents obtained using Scopus included the largest abstracts and citations in the field of study. This database has over 16,000 peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, trade publications, book series and patents, offering the widest coverage available for scientific, technical, medical and social sciences [41] . Only one database was selected based on the coverage of the topic and the objective, and the fact that previous research indicated how Web of Science and Scopus have high similarities [42] . Based on previous research and the results obtained, it was decided to choose Scopus (Elsevier's database) since it was the major database focused on the topic [43, 44] , providing necessary information for the quantitative analysis. Additionally, to avoid Scopus' problems with the differentiation between authors of the same name, the data have been manually revised and later checked with the authors' information.",

The chi-square one test was used to determine if there were differences among the sample for the year of publication, journal, keywords used, language, type of journal and country. Based on the results obtained, the sample was divided and compared by language (English and non-English), country (US and other countries), the type of document (articles compared to reviews; and articles compared to the other documents) and the period of publication (before 2017 and after 2017). The chi-square was used for comparing countries (US and other countries) and language (English and non-English) to having or not having citations.

The frequency of production per year increased from 1989 (0.29%) to 2019 (13.22%), although depending on the years the number and frequency of publication changes. However, the increase has not been linear and there have been some fluctuations, decreasing the number of publications in a time frame (from in 2005, in which 23 documents were published, to 2009, with 22 documents). The exponential trendline ( Figure 2 ) showed that the trend of publications followed a growth at a progressively higher rate, based on R-squared value close to 1. This result showed that the line almost fit the data perfectly. In this sense, the number of documents showed a significant increase from 1989 (two documents published by Kenya and US) to 2019 (135 documents, published mostly by US with 30 documents) (p < 0.001). This growth continued to be significant during the timeframe, although there were some modifications in the p-value and the grade of the significance (from 2000 to 2019 = p < 0.01; and from 2010 to 2019 = p < 0.05). Additionally, the trend of publications was analyzed according to the number of citations per year of publication, showing significant differences between documents published before 2017 (mean of documents with citations = 14.35; SD = 24.71) and after 2017 (mean of documents with citations = 0.15.15; SD = 7.02) (p < 0.001). The main language of these documents published was English (92.4%), followed by Spanish (1.3%), German (1.0%), French (1.0%) and Italian (0.8%). Table 2 indicated that most documents were published by the US (with 369 documents), followed by the UK (55 documents), Australia (51 documents), Canada (50 documents), and Germany (55 documents). The mean of publications of the top five countries showed difference between US (mean = 11.9), UK (mean= 1.8), Australia (mean= 1.7), Canada (mean = 1.6) and Germany (mean = 1.2). Furthermore, the Chi-square test for a sample indicated significant differences between countries for the production of documents (p < 0.001), with a significant difference between US and other countries. Additionally, Cramer's V test was used to determine the size of the effect for country and publications according to the years, showing significant differences between countries (p < 0.001). However, the value of the test (Cramer's V= 0.32) was lower than expected, proving less association between the variables of country and production of documents per year. Table 2 indicated that most documents were published by the US (with 369 documents), followed by the UK (55 documents), Australia (51 documents), Canada (50 documents), and Germany (55 documents).

Most of the journals with the greatest number of documents published and the highest impact factors are from the US and UK, followed by Canada. Among the top ten journals, Journal of Hospital Infection, which is placed in fifth place, had 612 citations, representing 5.8% of the total (total citations = 10,561), followed by Safety Science The analysis of the co-citations of journals also showed that these main journals (i.e., Safety Science or Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology) were linked to other important journals (i.e., The Lancet) and had a major part in the clusters formed, with three (Safety Science, Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology and BMC Public Health) of the seven leading journals of the cluster among the top ten ( Table 5 ). The mapping (Figure 4 ) created indicated seven clusters, formed of 160 journals and 4758 links between the different journals. The first cluster (red) was formed by 51 journals, led by Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (J. Occup. Environ. Med.), with 196 citations (Q3 and JCR of 1.64). The second cluster (green) was formed by 35 journals, led by BMC Public Health with 186 citations ( Table 5 ). The third cluster (blue) was formed by 26 journals, led by The Lancet (Lancet) with 508 citations (Q1 and JCR of 60.39), connected to Plos One, which had 253 citations from other journals ( Table 5 ). The fourth cluster (yellow) was formed by 23 journals, led by Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (Infect. Control. Hosp. Epidemiol.) with 404 citations ( Table 5 ). The fifth cluster (purple) was formed by 179 journals, led by Safety Science (Saf. Sci.) with 275 citations ( Table 5) The frequency of articles among the documents published by the top ten journals (Table 5 ) was between 80-90%, which matched the most frequent type of document from the data. In this sense, the most common documents published were articles (72.2%), reviews (14.9%), conference papers (8.1%) and book chapters (1.4%). The year of publication was negatively linked to the type of document, reducing the number of articles, which were the main type of documents, and increasing the number of reviews (p = 0.002). Furthermore, the citations per year showed significant differences between citations of articles published before 2007 (p < 0.001). The correlation test proved how documents published more recently had a negative association with citations (Spearman's test = \u22120.385; p < 0.001).",

Although the trend of publications increased with the growth of ICTs in the healthcare sector, this trend seemed to highly increase from the beginning of the 2000s, correlating with the popularity and increased development of ICTs in the working environment. The data showed a significant difference between ICTs in OSH in 1989 compared to 2019, which could be related to the revolution of technology [48, 49] . Based on previous work and the current trend linked with the fourth technological revolution, the impact of ICTs in the OSH of the healthcare sector, such as nanotechnology, sensors or virtual reality [50] [51] [52] , might likely have a major impact over the next ten years [53] .",

Moreover, it is interesting to note that the network of countries of this study showed how the countries with a higher frequency of publications were the leaders of each cluster. Though it is somewhat surprising that no main country was linked with other more relevant countries, they were linked to minor countries following a more aleatory structure. Nevertheless, these connections could be based on political, historical, and economic links [58] [59] [60] [61] .",

This interesting finding highlighted the existence of associations in the scientific community.

These results seemed to match previous papers that indicated that a connection between authors was linked to the relevance and citations of the author [62, 63] The current study also found that the most common types of publication were articles, followed by reviews. Although the type of document changed with the passing of the years, these results were contradictory to previous studies that highlighted how in medicine or public health, reviews were usually more common [64] [65] [66] .

Another main topic was related to mental health, for prevention and early detection. This topic seems to reflect one of OSH's main issues for healthcare workers that has increased after the pandemic with Covid\u221219 increasing sleeping issues and burnout syndrome [29, 73, 74] . The relevance of the different topics and supremacy of prevention might be related to its evolution and significance [75] [76] [77] . Nevertheless, it seems that inclusion of ICTs is more delimited to prevention and promotion of health among workers, screening systems, such as cancer [78] , and new devices to prevent infections, which could be a representation of the reduced inclusion of ICTs in OSH in the healthcare sector when compared with other sectors [49, [79] [80] [81] .

Additionally, it is important to bear in mind the possible bias in these results, based on the selection of a unique database, instead of combining two or more databases. This research focused on including close terms related to technology, OSH and healthcare workers, and excluding other terms for technology, such as \"robotics\" or \"virtual reality\", which could have limited the results. This was primarily to avoid the possible inclusion of publications not focused on the healthcare sector in which these technologies are less present [85] . Moreover, the study of index keywords and, therefore, the topics might not represent the totality of the research carried out in the healthcare sector, as not all the keywords used were MeSH terms. Finally, the Boolean operators used, which were \"OR\" and \"AND\", may have incorporated documents in which the main objective may differ from the objective of this paper. However, based on the sample size and the screening process, the possible error could be considered insignificant and could provoke little change in the result obtained in this research.",

In conclusion, this paper presented the global research patterns and current interests and identified the areas in which the ICTs are still missing or are less included. This research presents the main interest in the OSH related to the healthcare sector. Additionally, the results have highlighted the need for more studies focused on ICTs' negative effect on healthcare workers. Nevertheless, more work will need to be done to determine the grade of inclusion or usage of ICTs for occupational health and safety among healthcare workers and organizations, as well as specific protocols or technological tools developed as technical safety measures.
