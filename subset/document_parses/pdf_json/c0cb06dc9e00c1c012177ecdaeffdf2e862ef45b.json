The etiology of these pneumonia cases was soon identified as a new type of coronavirus. 1 This virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease it causes is known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 2 Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive and specific assay and therefore has become the current standard diagnostic method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. 4, 5 According to Zhang et al, 6 specimens such as nasal or throat swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, peripheral blood, and feces from patients with COVID-19 can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. A positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid result from respiratory tract or blood samples is the basis of clinical diagnosis, and two consecutive negative nucleic acid test results are one of the standards for being discharged from the hospital. 7 Thus far, many COVID-19 RT-PCR kits have become commercially available, and the majority of them use the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and the nucleocapsid protein as the major testing targets. 8 As of May 23, 2020, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics had listed 317 molecular assays on their website as being on the market (www.",

Samples were placed in the magnetic bead separator to remove the supernatant before extraction buffer III (600 \u03bcL) was added. Afterward, the supernatant was removed again in the magnetic bead separator, and 40 \u03bcL eluent was added to separate the extracted nucleic acid from the magnetic beads. Finally, the samples were placed in the magnetic bead separator for 3 minutes to remove the magnetic beads.",

Quality control and assurance, including three internal positive controls and a negative control, were included in each run to identify the false-negative and falsepositive results. Furthermore, three parallel tests were performed with three weakly positive samples, the test for each sample was conducted simultaneously, using two different PCR kits but the same amplification machine.",

The pandemic has created an enormous burden on health systems, as well as society and the global economy. Successful management of the spread of COVID-19 depends on the timely and accurate diagnosis of patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and accurate detection of asymptomatic carriers. However, the common clinical symptoms and laboratory examination findings of COVID-19 are not unique. 3",
