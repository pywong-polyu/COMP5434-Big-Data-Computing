Photodetectors operating in the UV region are important devices that can be used in various commercial and military applications. For example, visible-blind UV photodetectors can be used in space communications, ozone layer monitoring and flame detection. Currently, light detection in the UV spectral range still uses Si-based optical photodiodes. Although Si-based photodiodes are sensitive to visible and infrared radiation, the responsivity in the UV region is low since the room temperature bandgap energy of Si is only 1.2 eV. With the advent of optoelectronic devices fabricated on wide direct bandgap materials, it becomes possible to produce high performance solid-state photodetectors that are sensitive in the UV region. For example, GaN-based UV photodetectors are already commercially available [2, 3] . ZnSe-based UV photodetectors have also been demonstrated [4] .",

            "text": "ZnO is another wide direct bandgap material that is sensitive in the UV region [5, 6] . The large exciton binding energy of 60 meV and wide bandgap energy of 3.37 eV at room temperature make ZnO a promising photonic material for applications such as light emitting diodes, laser diodes and UV photodiodes. Indeed, ZnO has attracted much attention in recent years [7] [8] [9] . High quality ZnO epitaxial layers can be grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition [5] , molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [10] and pulsed laser deposition [11] on top of ZnO substrates [6] , sapphire substrates [12] and epitaxial GaN layers [13] . ZnO Schottky diodes and metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors detecting in the UV region have also been demonstrated [8] . MSM photodetectors consist of two interdigitated Schottky contacts deposited on top of an active layer. The reduced parasitic capacitance of this structure, as well as the low dark current and noise values, and its linearity with optical power, make MSM detectors the most promising candidates for high-speed photodetection [14] [15] [16] . To achieve high performance MSM UV photodetectors, it is important to improve crystal quality and to achieve large Schottky barrier height at metal-semiconductor interface. A large barrier height leads to small leakage current and high breakdown voltage which could result in improved responsivity and photocurrent to dark current contrast ratio. To achieve a large Schottky barrier height on ZnO, one can choose metals with high work functions [17] . However, many of the high work function metals are not stable. In other words, severe inter-diffusion might occur at metal-ZnO interface. To solve this problem, one can insert an insulating layer between metal and the underneath ZnO [18] . With the insulating layer, we can also effectively suppress leakage current of the photodetectors. In this paper, we report the fabrication of ZnO-based metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) UV photodetectors. Optical and electrical properties of the fabricated photodetectors will also be discussed.",

            "text": "ZnO samples used in this study were all grown by radio frequency (rf) plasma-assisted MBE (Omni Vac) on sapphire (0 0 0 1) substrates. The base pressure in the growth chamber was \u223c3.0 \u00d7 10 \u221210 mbar. The elemental source materials of Zn (6N) and Mg (5N) were evaporated from commercial Knudsen cells (Crea Tech). Active oxygen radicals were produced by rf-plasma system (SVTA). The flow rate of oxygen gas was controlled by a mass flow controller (ROD-4, Aera). Prior to the growth, we first degreased sapphire substrates in trichloroethylene and acetone. These substrates were then etched in H 2 SO 4 :H 3 PO 4 = 3:1 at 130 \u2022 C for 20 min followed by rinsing in de-ionized water. After loading into the growth chamber, they were thermally cleaned at 700 \u2022 C for 30 min, and then exposed to oxygen radicals for 30 min at 100 \u2022 C with 400 W rf power and 2 sccm oxygen flux so as to form oxygen-terminated sapphire surface. After this treatment, a thin Mg layer was predeposited on the substrates at 80 \u2022 C and then re-evaporated while the temperature ramped up. It should be noted here that after the processing, the substrates were covered with a uniform Mg wetting layer, which can be verified from the absence of rotation domains and the achievements of unipolar ZnO growth. We subsequently grew a 1000 nm thick unintentionally doped ZnO epitaxial layer with conventional two-step growth method, i.e., a low temperature buffer layer grown at 260 \u2022 C and a high temperature layer grown at 670 \u2022 C. After the growth, we in situ annealed the ZnO epitaxial layer at 750 \u2022 C. It is well-known that interface engineering is essential for hetero-epitaxy of high quality ZnO films on sapphire substrates in terms of rotation domain elimination and polarity control [19] [20] [21] [22] . It was revealed that the interface control by using oxygen radicals pretreatment and Mg predeposition is very effective on property improvement and defect density reduction of ZnO film, which was confirmed with Hall, photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The carrier concentration of the as-grown ZnO films was 2.8 \u00d7 10 16 cm \u22123 at room temperature.",

            "text": "ZnO MSM and MIS photodetectors were then fabricated. Prior to metal deposition, we cleaned the ZnO samples by ace- Fig. 1(a) and (b) , respectively. Room temperature current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the devices were then measured by an HP 4145 semiconductor parameter analyzer under both dark and illumination. The top-illuminated spectral responsivity of these devices was also quantified using a 250 W Xe arc lamp with a calibrated monochromator as the light source. The monochromatic light, calibrated with UV-enhanced Si photodetectors and an optical power meter, was collimated onto each photodetector via an optical fiber. Fig. 2 shows room temperature PL spectrum of our ZnO epitaxial films. It was found that we observed a strong excitonic related PL peak at 379 nm (3.27 eV). It was also found that full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the excitonic related PL peak was only 74 meV. It should be noted that no oxygen vacancy related defect peaks could be found in the spectrum [12] . These results all indicate good crystal quality of our ZnO epitaxial layers. The inset of Fig. 2 shows measured XRD spectrum of the 1000 nm thick ZnO epitaxial film prepared on sapphire substrate. The peak located at 2\u03b8 = 41.9 \u2022 in the spectrum was originated from the (0 0 6) plane of sapphire substrate. We also observed a ZnO (0 0 2) XRD peak at 2\u03b8 = 34.3 \u2022 with a FWHM of 0.11 \u2022 . Such a result indicates that the ZnO film was preferen- tially grown in c-axis direction. The small FWHM of the ZnO (0 0 2) XRD peak again indicates good crystal quality of our samples. Fig. 3 shows I-V characteristics of the two fabricated ZnO photodetectors measured in dark (dark current) and under 370 nm illumination (photocurrent). The dark current is originated from thermionic emission of carriers. It can be seen clearly that dark currents measured from MIS photodetector were much smaller than that measured from MSM photodetector. With 5 V applied bias, it was found that measured dark currents were 4.11 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 2.22 \u00d7 10 \u221210 A for the fabricated MSM and MIS photodetectors, respectively. In other words, we can reduce dark current by more than three orders of magnitude by inserting the 5 nm thick SiO 2 . Such a significant reduction could be attributed partially to the insulating nature of SiO 2 and partially to the effective passivation of ZnO surface states by the SiO 2 layer. Compared with the photocurrent of ZnO MSM photodetector, it was found that photocurrent measured from ZnO MIS photodetector was small. With 5 V applied bias, it was also found that measured photocurrents were 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and 7.12 \u00d7 10 \u22126 A for the ZnO MSM and MIS photodetectors, respectively. Furthermore, photocurrent to dark current contrast ratios for these two photodetectors can be determined from the measured dark currents and photocurrents which were shown in Fig. 4 . With 5 V applied bias, it was found that photocurrent to dark current contrast ratios of the ZnO MSM and MIS photodetectors were 2.9 \u00d7 10 2 and 3.2 \u00d7 10 4 , respectively. In other words, we can achieve much larger photocurrent to dark current contrast ratio from the ZnO MIS photodetector. Fig. 5 (a) and (b) shows measured optical responsivities of the ZnO MSM and MIS photodetectors, respectively. It was found that sharp cutoff occurred at around 370 nm for both detectors. With incident light wavelength of 370 nm and 5 V applied bias, the measured responsivities were 0.089 and 0.0083 A/W for the ZnO MSM and MIS photodetectors, respectively. The smaller responsivity observed from ZnO MIS photodetector can again be attributed to the insertion of highly resistive SiO 2 layer. It was found that responsivity in the long wavelength stop band was also smaller for ZnO MIS photodetector, as compared to that measured from ZnO MSM photodetector. This agrees well with the smaller dark current for ZnO MIS photodetector. Here, we define UV to visible rejection ratio as the responsivity mea- sured at 370 nm divided by the responsivity measured at 450 nm. With such definition and 5 V applied bias, it was found that UV to visible rejection ratios for the fabricated ZnO MSM and MIS photodetectors were 2.4 \u00d7 10 2 and 3.8 \u00d7 10 3 , respectively. These values indicate that we can also significantly enhance UV to visible rejection ratio by inserting a SiO 2 into our ZnO photodetectors. The large 3.8 \u00d7 10 3 UV to visible rejection ratio also suggests ZnO MIS photodetectors are potentially useful for practical applications.",
