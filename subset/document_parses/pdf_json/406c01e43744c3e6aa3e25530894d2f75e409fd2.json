Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. Both drugs prolong the QT interval by blocking the KCNH2-encoded hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium channel, thereby increasing the risk of torsades de pointes. [5] [6] [7] In general, hydroxychloroquine is reasonably well tolerated and used chronically in arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus patients without heart rhythm monitoring. 8 In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning for azithromycin following multiple reported cases of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation followed by torsades de pointes. 9 Because the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients is so recent and based largely on in vitro studies 10 and anecdotal observations, 11 randomized clinical trial data are lacking, and community prescribing practices are as yet unclear. More important, there is no information available about the extent of QTc prolongation with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. From first principles, simultaneous block of the hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium channel with both agents may cause critical QTc prolongation and an elevated risk of torsades de pointes.
