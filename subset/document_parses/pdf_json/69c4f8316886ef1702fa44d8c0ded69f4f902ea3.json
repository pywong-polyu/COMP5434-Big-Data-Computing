For sensing performed in electrolytes in particular, abundant information about the translocating analytes is hidden in the fluctuating monitoring ionic current contributed from interactions between the analytes and the nanopore. Such ionic currents are inevitably affected by noise; hence, signal processing is an inseparable component of sensing in order to identify the hidden features in the signals and to analyze them. This Guide starts from untangling the signal processing flow and categorizing the various algorithms developed to extracting the useful information. By sorting the algorithms under Machine Learning (ML)-based versus non-ML-based, their underlying architectures and properties are systematically evaluated. For each category, the development tactics and features of the algorithms with implementation examples are discussed by referring to their common signal processing flow graphically summarized in a chart and by highlighting their key issues tabulated for clear comparison. How to get started with building up an ML-based algorithm is subsequently presented. The specific properties of the ML-based algorithms are then discussed in terms of learning strategy, performance evaluation, experimental repeatability and reliability, data preparation, and data utilization strategy. This Guide is concluded by outlining strategies and considerations for prospect algorithms.",

Thus, it possesses an extremely succinct structure, a nanoscale pore in an ultrathin membrane. Its sensing function is based on a simple working principle: the passage of an analyte temporarily blocks a size-proportional volume of the pore and induces a spike signal on the monitoring ionic current at a given bias voltage. Information about passing analytes is hidden in the corresponding current spikes, i.e., translocation spikes distributed on the ionic current traces. By processing the signal and analyzing the features of the spikes such as amplitude, width (duration), occurrence frequency, and waveform, the properties of the analytes can be inferred, including size, shape, charge, dipole moment, and concentration. Therefore, signal processing is the crucial link to interpreting the signal by assigning the associated features to relevant physical properties. In general, signal processing comprises denoising, spike recognition, feature extraction, and analysis. A powerful signal processing algorithm should be able to isolate signals from a noisy background, extract useful information, and utilize the multidimensional information synthetically to accurately derive the properties of the analytes.",

However, this function risks filtering out the important high-frequency components naturally present in signals representing rapid changes of ionic current associated with translocation spikes that carry informative waveform details related to the target analytes. Thus, self-adaptive filters and advanced current level tracing algorithms have been developed. 8, 9 Traditional algorithms are mainly based on a user-defined amplitude threshold as a criterion for detection of translocation spikes. Apparently, the choice of this threshold determines how successful a spike is singled out and how good the quality of the subsequent feature extraction is. However, the threshold is usually chosen based on the experience of individuals dealing with the data. It is, hence, a subjective process. Moreover, using the extracted features to infer the properties of the analytes relies mainly on physical models that build upon a comprehensive understanding of the physiochemical process involved in the translocation. Unfortunately, generalized models and algorithms for this purpose are yet to be developed.",

The membrane embedding a nanopore separates the electrolyte into two compartments. The only electrical connection between them is the nanopore. By applying a bias voltage across the membrane, a steady ionic current, named open-pore current, is generated, which constitutes the baseline of the signal. The electric field also drives charged analytes dispersed in the electrolyte to pass through the nanopore. During the translocation, the analytes temporarily block a certain volume of the pore, proportional to their size. Such blockages usually cause spike-like current variations, as seen in the right panel of Figure 1 , that are of central interest for signal processing. The ionic current is anticipated to resume the open-pore level once the translocations complete. Other designs can also be adopted to generate signals for nanopore sensing. For example, functionalizing the nanopore surface with a probe molecule can generate a specific interaction with target analytes resulting in characteristic signals on the monitoring ionic current trace. 16 Such signals arising from specific interactions, 17 adsorption\u2212 desorption processes, 18 clogging, 19 nanopore morphology changes, 20 and open\u2212close activities of channels 21 can also be dealt with in the same framework designed for processing the translocation-caused spike signals.",

Nevertheless, the learning can also be implicit, as in some unsupervised clustering algorithms with a learning-by-doing manner.

It should be emphasized that low-pass filtering is a must for signal amplification and data acquisition in a hardware system to define the bandwidth, mitigate out-ofband noise, and achieve anti-aliasing before digitalization. In this guide, the discussed low-pass filter refers, instead, to the software realization as a category of algorithm for already acquired digital data during the signal processing. In a nanopore system, the current noise power spectrum density, S I , consists of several different components in distinct frequency ranges. 26, 27 A white thermal noise exists at all frequencies in the spectrum with its power density being inversely proportional to the electrical resistance of the nanopore. The low-frequency noise at frequencies below 1 kHz is usually contributed by flicker noise originating from the charge fluctuation on the pore wall and/or number fluctuation of ions in the pore and 1/f-shape noise from electrodes. 26 In the high-frequency range beyond 1 kHz, the noise power is dominated by the dielectric noise and capacitance noise. The former comes from the dielectric loss of the nanopore membrane, while the latter is a result of current fluctuation generated by the voltage noise of the amplifier input port on the impedance of the nanopore. Considering the frequency distribution of noise power, S I \u0394f, the high-frequency range dominates. Therefore, low-pass filters can efficiently restrict the bandwidth of the signal and filter out background noise. 28 However, the limited bandwidth degrades the capability of capturing fast translocation events and mars important details for analyzing the translocation waveform.",

During noise filtration, it may also filter out the high-frequency components of the signal that may contain abundant details about the analytes. Therefore, different approaches have been sought to bypass this dilemma. Backed by the estimation theory, a Kalman filter has been developed to denoise the nanopore sensing signal. 8 Key parameters of the Kalman filter are adjusted dynamically according to the historical inputs. The stochastic properties of the signal are acquired and represented by these dynamic parameters. Thus, the Kalman filter is capable of extracting a signal whose frequency spectrum overlaps with that of the background noise. In addition, a filtering technology based on wavelet transform has been involved for nanopore signal denoising. 29, 30 First, a group of proper bases that trades between the resolution of time and frequency is selected. Second, the wavelet transform of the input signal is implemented on these bases. Signal and background noise become separable in the wavelet domain even if they overlap in the frequency domain. Finally, a few large-magnitude wavelet components are kept, while the rest of the small-magnitude components are regarded as noise and meant to be removed, because with the specific bases chosen, those large magnitude components are the outcome of the wavelet transform of the main features (information) of the signal. The boundary between large and small magnitude is carefully selected by implementing different threshold functions that work similarly as the cutoff frequency of a traditional low-pass filter. The separability can be further enhanced by adopting multiple levels of wavelet transform, and a simple achievement for discrete signals is a bank of low-and high-pass filters. 30 By confirming the consistency of signals from multiple readout channels of the same nanopore, a consensus filter is adopted to remove the uncorrelated events as noise from each channel. 31 In addition, a weighted network among the single nodes gradually builds up and converges to stable values of the weights. This network can deliver consentient events, i.e., the highly correlated signals from each node, and abandon the uncorrelated events, i.e., noise.",

            "text": "Step 2. Spike Recognition. Spike recognition usually begins with defining an amplitude threshold as a criterion to separate spikes from noise. Apparently, this threshold plays a decisive role in further processing. 32\u221234 If the amplitude of a spike surpasses this threshold with reference to the baseline, it is recognized as a translocation event. Otherwise, it is regarded as noise. The identified spike segments are singled out from the current trace, and the associated features are extracted in the next step. Setting a large threshold increases the risk of omitting translocation spikes, misleadingly rendering a low translocation frequency. On the other hand, having a small threshold can mistakenly lead to assignment of noise fluctuations as translocation spikes, thereby incorrectly increasing the translocation counts. 35 To reduce the subjectivity due to involvement of the user in the threshold selection, the background noise level can be used as a reference. 5\u221210 As an example, a certain multiple of the rootmean-square (RMS) value of the background noise can be taken as the threshold. 34, 36 Nonetheless, two potential subjectivity risks persist. The determination of the multiple of the noise level is usually based on the user's empirical experience. An accurate measurement of the background noise level, e.g., RMS value or peak-to-peak value, is related to the baseline detection. It is common for an algorithm for dynamic baseline detection to be designed to track the baseline position as an effort to mitigate the influence of shift, drift, and slow swing of the baseline on spike recognition. A dynamic average with a proper window size is a simple and straightforward method to obtain the baseline. 32 How to optimize the window size is crucial for the final performance. A large window can function as a low cutoff frequency filter and shows a stable baseline, but it can be insensitive to rapidly changing signals, including sudden jumps from the baseline. With a small window, changes from the baseline can be followed better, but the penalty is that the attained baseline can be easily influenced by translocation spikes. A simple fixation to overcome this dilemma is to keep the baseline level not updated during the blockage state, i.e., within a spike. 33 An iterative detection method is further proposed 34 wherein the baseline is first traced using a simple dynamic average method. Then, the translocation spikes are identified with respect to the baseline. They are then removed from the signal. By repeating the described operations several times, more spikes are recognized and subsequently removed. The dynamic average baseline eventually approaches the real level.",

            "text": "An alternative to the window size selection is to closely follow the current changes without differentiating them in the open-pore state (baseline) from those in the blockage state (spike). A dedicated algorithm named Cumulative Sums (CUSUM) has been developed along this line. 9 By adopting an adaptive threshold, which is dynamically adjustable according to the slow fluctuations of the signal level, it can detect abrupt changes possibly associated with state switching, e.g., from open-pore to blockage, from a shallow blockage level to a deep level, etc. First, an initial value of the signal level is set by referencing to the average of a small section of the signal at its start. Second, the deviation between the predicted signal level and the real value is calculated and accumulated. If the predicted level is close to the real one, the noise fluctuations above and below this level cancel each other. If the current jumps to a different level, a net deviation accumulates. Third, once this deviation surpasses a user-defined threshold, an abrupt change is identified, and the predicted level is shifted to the new level. Otherwise, the predicted level is updated by averaging the present data points. This algorithm can not only recognize the translocation spikes, i.e., the blockage stage, but also separate multiple levels in one blockage event. 37 Furthermore, information about these spikes can be extracted naturally, including the amplitude, duration (dwell time in blockage state), interval between adjacent spikes (dwell time in open-pore state), and ionic current levels and dwell time at the corresponding levels for multilevel signals.",

            "text": "Step 3. Feature Extraction. Once the spikes are singled out from the baseline, feature extraction constitutes the third step in Figure 2 . The main features of a spike-like signal commonly include amplitude and duration (width of the spike). An additional parameter to quantify the translocation is the apparent frequency of translocation events (FTE). In general, larger analytes translocating smaller pores induce more severe blockades in the form of deeper spikes; longer analytes with lower translocation speed, caused by weaker driving forces and/or stronger analyte\u2212nanopore interactions, yield longer durations; higher analyte concentrations and/or larger bias voltages give rise to higher FTEs. These are intrinsic factors relevant to the properties of analytes and nanopores. Extrinsically, the bandwidth constraint of an electrical readout system may distort narrow spikes, rendering an attenuation of amplitude and a prolongation of duration. Signal distortion by limited bandwidth has received quantitative analysis. 28, 38 In order to recover the true spike waveform from the distorted one, a physical model-based algorithm named ADEPT 39,40 and a Second-Order-Differential-Based Calibration (DBC) method with an integration method 41\u221243 have been developed. The ADEPT algorithm is based on an equivalent circuit model of the nanopore system. From the system transfer function of the circuit, the true signal is recovered from the distorted one by inversely applying the system function. Thus, the affected spikes corresponding to short-lived events are compensated for to restore the unaffected features. In the DBC method, a Fourier series is first applied to fit the translocation spikes for smooth waveforms. Second, the second-order derivative of the smoothed waveform is calculated. Third, the minima of the derivative are located at positions corresponding to the start and end time points of the translocation, thereby leading to an accurate determination of the duration of a spike. Finally, the attenuation of amplitude by the limited bandwidth is compensated for by considering the area beneath the spikes referred to as the baseline. The DBC algorithm has been integrated in software packages for signal processing of nanopore sensing data. 33, 44 ADEPT is effective for short-duration spikes, while CUSUM is suitable for long-duration spikes with multiple blockage levels. A software platform, MOSAIC, has emerged by combining the two algorithms to benefit from their respective strengths. 32 An advanced version of CUSUM has recently been adopted in MOSAIC for a robust statistical analysis of translocation spikes. In addition, an algorithm named AutoStepfinder is devoted to stepwise signals. 45 First, the initial number of step levels representing different blockage states is assigned. Fitting is then implemented to achieve the minimum error. Second, the fitting outcome is evaluated and compared with the halt condition for the required accuracy. Third, if it does not reach the halt condition, the number of step levels is gradually increased for the new iterative round of data fitting. In an iterative manner, this process is repeated until finding the best number of step-levels. This algorithm is developed for signals arising from the growth dynamics of protein polymer microtubules with optical tweezers. 46 Translocation spikes from nanopore sensors, including the typical single-step signals and blockages with multiple levels, are all targets of this algorithm. Other multiple-step signals from electrical, optical, and mechanical measurements can also be processed using this algorithm. 10, 45 For stepwise signals, the Rissanen principle of Minimum Description Length (MDL) is adopted to identify the steps, e.g., the close\u2212open dynamics of ion channels. 47 Here, an anticipated location of step is confirmed by achieving an MDL, which trades off between fineness and fitting accuracy.",

A large number of different features, i.e., multiple dimensions of feature space, advances the especially powerful ML-based classifiers for processing data in high-dimensional space. In contrast, simple non-ML-based classifiers, such as statistical distribution-based distances and hypothetical tests, provide limited functionalities. The ML-based classifiers will be discussed later, and the focus is placed on feature extraction here. Several details of the translocation spikes are selected as features, such as increasing and decreasing slopes of a spike, spike area, area of increase and decrease period and their ratio, symmetry of spikes, bluntness of spikes, and \"inertia\" with respect to the current axis and time axis with and without normalization by the amplitude. 48\u221250 The frequency spectrum and cepstrum of spikes based on the Fourier transform can also be used as features for the classification. 51 Usually, peaks may appear in the frequency spectrum representing the major frequency components of a signal. The features of these peaks, e.g., the position, amplitude, and phase angle of the peaks, are collected as features of the signal in the frequency domain. Furthermore, if no clear peak-wise pattern appears, the amplitude and phase angle of a series of frequency points obtained by resampling on the spectrum can be used as features for classification as well. 51 If the number of features is too large and some of them are highly correlated, the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) method can be employed to compress the redundant information and decrease the dimensionality of the feature space. This treatment can lead to refined features in an efficient manner for the classification algorithms.",

For example, the Mahalanobis distance metrics are adopted to assess the similarity of certain spikes with labeled clusters in the feature space so that five different amino acids can be identified. 57 Moreover, a probabilistic fuzzy algorithm is adopted to quantify the concentration range of analytes through a comparison between the Gaussian distribution of the blockage amplitude and the calibration values. 58 The fuzzy property endows the algorithm with flexibility, which can tolerate the data variation from the experimental conditions to some extent.

This operation converts current traces into vectors in a highdimensional feature-enhanced space by keeping the features and dropping the time resolution. Next, the vectors undergo deconvolution to reconstruct the current trace in the original size. During the training process, the weights and biases for each node in the NN are tuned by means of gradient descent optimization to evaluate the deviation between the output and the denoised (control) current traces obtained by Fourier analysis and wavelet transform. In this way, the algorithm can automatically identify features and discard noise in the highdimensional feature space, thereby overcoming the limitation of traditional filtering with overlapping frequency components of signal and noise.

Regarding Step 2, most efforts are based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) strategy. 63, 64 The HMM is naturally suitable for the description of stochastic hops between the open-pore state and the blockage state, as a Markov chain. The key to train an HMM is to determine the probability of state transition from one to the other, i.e., state transition probability, and the probability of ascertaining the value of an observed variable with certain values of hidden stochastic variables, i.e., output probability. In order to train the HMM, labeled data sets are necessary. For nanopore translocation signals, the current of each sampling point need be assigned to a given state, e.g., open-pore, shallow blockage, deep blockage, etc. First, a Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) algorithm and a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) have been adopted to cluster the sampled data. Next, the Viterbi approach, which is used to obtain the maximum a posteriori probability and estimate the most likely sequence of hidden states in an HMM, has been utilized to achieve an intelligent retrieval of multilevel current signatures. This approach has enabled detection of nanopore translocation events and extraction of useful information about single molecules under analysis. 65, 66 Lately, some feature vectors from HMMs have also been used to provide the characteristics of translocation spikes. 64, 67 Finally, the feature vectors are used for further analyte classification.

Based on the Residual Neural Network (ResNet), a bipath NN, named Bi-path Network (B-Net), has recently been established to extract spike features. 35 Since the task of counting the number of spikes is essentially different from that of measuring the amplitude and duration, the bipath design, composed of two ResNets, each one trained for one task, has been shown to be robust with compelling performance. During the training process, segments of time sequence traces are first sent to the NN. The predicted values of spike number, average amplitude, and duration of the appearing spikes are then compared with the respective ground truths. Next, the deviations of the predicted values and the ground truths are back-propagated through the NN using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm and the weights of each node are adjusted. Finally, the training performance in each epoch is evaluated on a validation data set so that the best trained NN is selected. The training data sets are artificially generated by a simulator on the foundation of a set of physical models, describing open-pore current, blockage spikes, background noise, and baseline variations. The trained B-Net can directly extract the three features of spikes, i.e., amplitude, duration, and number (or FTE), from raw translocation data of \u03bb-DNA and protein streptavidin. The features show clear trends with the variation of certain conditions, which is in agreement with the corresponding physical mechanisms of analyte translocation.

            "text": "A new concept of shapelet has been involved in the feature extraction of translocation spikes. 69 Shapelets are short timeseries segments with special patterns that contain discriminative features. For translocation spikes from nanopore sensors, the tiny fluctuations of the ionic current in the blockage state, i.e., the bottom of the blockage spike, do not always result from noise. They can be characterized by certain regular patterns representing the characteristics of the translocating analytes as well as their interactions with the nanopore. In the learning time-series shapelets (LTS) algorithm, these regular patterns are learned as shapelets automatically from the training data set to maximize the discriminative features among the spikes from different analytes. Then, the similarities of test spikes and these shapelets are measured by the Euclidean distance, as the features of these spikes. Consequently, a multidimensional feature space is established. On the platform of aerolysin nanopore, the LTS algorithm is proven to have the ability to discriminate the translocation spikes generated by 4-nucleotide DNA oligomers with single-nucleotide difference. 69 Step 4. Analyte Identification. Finally, when it comes to Step 4, main trends have been directed toward three approaches, (i) Support Vector Machines (SVMs), (ii) Decision Trees (DTs) and Random Forests (RFs), and (iii) NN-based classifiers. For shallow ML algorithms such as (i) and (ii), the inputs are the features of a signal, i.e., vectors in high-dimensional feature space. The extraction of features, i.e., construction of feature space, are adequately discussed in Step 3 of non-ML-based signal processing algorithms as well as in the previous section. The commonly used features include those from the time-domain of signal, e.g., amplitude, duration, and frequency of spikes, and those from frequency-domain, e.g., peaks in the spectrum. Regarding deep-learning (DL) algorithms such as (iii), the inputs are usually the time sequence of current traces or spike segments. Therefore, the DL algorithms, compared to their shallow ML counterparts, may avoid the tedious feature extraction process that usually needs rich experience and can be subjective. An expanded discussion of this issue is found in the section Strategies of ML-Based Algorithms. However, although rare, it is also found that extracted features have been used as inputs for DL algorithms. 70 An SVM is a linear classifier whose goal is to find a hyperplane in an n-dimensional space that segregates data points belonging to different classes. Consequently, data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes. Multiple possible hyperplanes can be chosen to separate two classes of data points. The main aim of an SVM is to find the plane with the maximum margin, i.e., the maximum distance between the data points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides robustness such that future data points can be classified with high confidence. Support vectors are the data points closer to the hyperplane, which are taken as references and determine the position and orientation of the hyperplane, thereby maximizing the margin of the classifier. Since an SVM is a linear classifier, it works better when there is a clear margin of separation between classes, and it is more effective in higher dimensional spaces, i.e., when the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. This algorithm does not incorporate nonlinearities to the input points by itself. However, complementary kernels can be involved to realize the nonlinearity. The cost is that they come with the incorporation of more dimensions to the inputs and carry more processing loads. Accordingly, the SVM does not perform well when the data points at different target classes severely overlap. As a result, this algorithm needs a preprocessed data set in its input to build up the high-dimensional feature space. Such a preprocessing step is not linked to the automatic optimization process of the algorithm and has to be conducted using human-engineered tools, which makes this procedure less automatic and adds limitations derived from human subjectivity. 71 In regard to how to utilize SVMs to attain classification, a strategy has been introduced to classify and interpret nanopore and ion-channel signals. 72 The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for denoising nanopore signals and features. Spike duration, amplitude, and mean baseline current are extracted and subsequently used to detect the passage of analytes through the nanopore. First, a two-stage feature extraction scheme adopts the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) to provide feature vectors and PCA to compress the dimensionality of the feature space. Afterward, classification is carried out using SVMs with 96% accuracy to discriminate two highly similar analytes. Along the same lines, 73 each current blockade event can be characterized by the relative intensity, duration, surface area, and both the right and left slope of the pulses. The different parameters characterizing the events are defined as features and the type of DNA sample as the target. By applying SVMs to discriminate each sample, an accuracy between 50% and 72% is shown by using two features that distinctly classify the data points. Finally, an increased accuracy up to 82% can be achieved when five features are implemented. Likewise, the SVM has also been used to identify two different kinds of glycosaminoglycans with an accuracy higher than 90%. 74 Similarly to nanopore techniques, nanogap sensors generate characteristic tunneling current spikes when individual analytes are trapped in a gap between two electrodes. As is the case for nanopores, this technique has also been used to identify individual nucleotides, amino acids, and peptides at a singlemolecule level. Following this line of research using nanogaps, an SVM has been shown to classify a variety of anomers and epimers via the current fluctuations they produce when being captured in a tunnel junction functionalized by recognition probe molecules. 24 Likewise, a tunneling nanogap technique to identify individual RNA nucleotides has been demonstrated. 51 To call the individual RNA nucleotides from the nanogap signals, an SVM is adopted for data analysis. The individual RNA nucleotides are distinguished from their DNA counterparts with reasonably high accuracy. In addition, it is found through using an SVM for data analysis how probe molecules in a nanogap sensor distinguish among naturally occurring DNA nucleotides with great accuracy. 75 It is further shown that single amino acids could be identified by trapping the molecules in a nanogap being coated with a layer of recognition molecule probes and then by measuring the tunneling current across the junction. 23 Since a given molecule can bind in different manners in the junction, an SVM algorithm is useful in distinguishing among the sets of electronic \"fingerprints\" associated with each binding motif.",

By assembling the results from multiple simple learners, the ensemble learner can achieve a better generalization than by the individual simple learners. 76 A simple learner is usually based on learning algorithms with low complexity, such as DT and NN. An ensemble learner combines multiple simple learners based on the same algorithm, i.e., homogeneous ensemble, or different algorithms, i.e., heterogeneous ensemble. To highlight the advantage of assembling, the individual learners should behave differently, yet with sufficient accuracy. Therefore, an important issue in this scheme is to find a smart way to divide the training data sets for the individual learners, especially for homogeneous ensembles, since the behavior of each learner is based on the training data. According to the strategies adopted to generate these base/component learners, ensemble learning algorithms can be divided into two major categories: (i) the individual learners are generated sequentially with strong correlations in between, and (ii) they are generated in parallel with weak correlation.",

AdaBoost, assembled by multiple DT classifiers, is used to classify the spikes generated by the mixture of two kinds of 4-nucleotide DNA oligomers with single-nucleotide difference. 67 Bagging, on the other hand, is a typical algorithm of the second category, in which the training data for each learner is selected simultaneously in the training data set. Thus, the learners can be trained individually at the same time. An RF algorithm constructs the bagging ensemble architecture by involving a random selection mechanism in the training data selection for each DT. Thus, the RF shows better robustness and generalization ability than achievable with the simple DT. Moreover, the performances of RF and SVM are contrasted. 77 On one hand, an SVM-based regressor is used to establish the correspondence between specific peptide features inside the pore and the generated signal. On the other hand, an alternative approach for supervised learning can be explored by implementing the RF regression for translocation waveform prediction. The resulting RF becomes more robust to outliers also exhibiting less overfitting.",

The combinatorial nature of possible correlations among different features cannot be completely contemplated by human expertise. Therefore, essential correlations can be accidentally discarded with the consequential compromises in classification accuracy. Likewise, some feature correlations can be essential in the perspective of human reasoning. Yet, those could also be completely useless statistical features at the time of attaining better classification performance. The DNNs, instead, promote the extraction of features using optimization mechanisms guided by ultimate classification objectives in an end-to-end fashion. By backpropagating errors and applying optimization steps, such as SGD, these architectures modify internal parameters in the networks in order to accomplish better classification performance. Every stage in such multilayer pipelines abstracts more and more relevant information regarding the final objectives of the complete system. The automation of the feature extraction stages in the ML pipeline bypasses an explicit operation in step 3 in Figure 2 . Hence, the DNNs can directly process the traces/segments of translocation spikes from step 1 or 2 and achieve outstanding results in a variety of important applications, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) among many other newer and essential fields. 82 Following the research line of CNNs, a CNN is developed for a fully automated extraction of information from the timeseries signals obtained by nanopore sensors. 83 It is trained to classify translocation events with greater accuracy than previously possible, which increases the number of analyzable events by a factor of 5. 83 An illustration of the step-by-step guide in how a CNN can be used for base classification in DNA sequencing applications is available in the literature. 10 Moreover, a CNN has been adopted to classify different kinds of proteins according to the fluorescently labeled signals from optical measurement of the translocation through solid-state nanopores, which also show spike-like features as electrical current signals. 84 A comparison with the SVM as a more conventional ML method is provided for discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. It is claimed that a \"deep\" NN has many facets of a black box, which has important implications in how they look at and interpret data. Moreover, each translocation event is described by various features in order to enhance classification efficiency of nucleotide identities. 70 By training on lower dimensional data and comparing different strategies, such as fully connected DNN, CNN, and LSTM, a high accuracy up to 94% on average is reached. In addition, a ResNet is trained and acquired the ability to classify the spikes generated by the translocation of two kinds of DNA oligomers, 5\u2032\u2212(dA)7(dC)-7\u22123\u2032 and 5\u2032\u2212(dC)7(dA)7\u22123\u2032 that only differ in the sequence direction. 85 Prior to classification, an ensemble of empirical mode decomposition, variational mode decomposition, inherent time scale decomposition, and Hilbert transform has been designed to extract multispectral features of nanopore electrical signals. By combining ResNet with SVM, adenoassociated viruses carrying different genetic cargos are discriminated according to their respective translocation spike signal through a SiN x nanopore. 86 The ResNet extracts abstract \"features\" of the signal traces, although these features are not describable and cannot be directly correlated to ACS Sensors pubs.acs.org/acssensors Review In ML, Logit is a vector of raw (non-normalized) predictions that a classification algorithm generates, which is usually then passed to a normalization function. Such a normalization function maps the real number line (-inf, inf) to probabilities [0, 1]. If the classifier solves a multiclass classification problem, logits typically become an input to a softmax function (normalization function). The softmax function then generates a vector of (normalized) probabilities with one value for each possible class.",

            "text": "An NN-based technique called Positive Unlabeled Classification (PUC) has been introduced to learn the interference of background noise fluctuation with the spikes generated by the four different nucleotides in a nanogap sensor. It uses groups of training current signals recorded with the target molecules. By combining with a common NN classifier, it can identify the four nucleotides with a high degree of precision in a mixture sample. 87 Other ML optimization algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM) have also been used for classification. An EM is a widely used iterative algorithm to estimate the latent variables from the observations of the statistical estimation theory. The unobserved latent variables can be induced from the incomplete/damaged data set or variables that cannot be measured/observed directly. In an EM algorithm, the two steps, E and M, are repeated alternatively. In the E step, the values of the latent variables are estimated from the parameters of the stochastic schemes. In the following M step, the stochastic parameters are updated according to the observed variables from the data set and latent variables from the previous E step. By iterating these two steps, the stochastic parameters may converge to their real values. The EM algorithm is adopted in several clustering methods, such as the k-mean clustering and the Gaussian mixture model. The EM algorithm has been implemented to cluster the translocation spikes from wild-type E. coli cells and f liC deletion mutants. 88 Seven features related to the shape of the translocation spikes are selected, and the statistical distribution parameters of the spikes in a seven-dimensional feature space are estimated by applying the EM iteration. In addition, the same algorithm has been used to classify two viruses, influenza A and B, through the translocation signals from peptide functionalized SiN x nanopore sensors. 49 Other classification and clustering algorithms have also been implemented to identify various analytes via the translocation features obtained from nanopore sensors, such as the k-nearest neighbor (k), 89, 90 the logistic regression, 69, 89, 90 and the naive Bayes. 89 An important facet of the ML related algorithms is that they devote significant effort to comparisons among as many methods as possible. For instance, by utilizing ML, it is possible to determine two different compositions of four synthetic biopolymers using as few as 500 events. 89 Seven ML algorithms are compared: (i) AdaBoost; (ii) k-NN; (iii) naive Bayes; (iv) NN; (v) RF; (vi) logistic regression; and (vii) SVM. A minimal representation of the nanopore data, using only signal amplitude and duration, can reveal, by eye and image recognition algorithms, clear differences among the signals generated by the four glycosaminoglycans. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations and ML techniques are used to featurize and cluster the ionic current and residence time of the 20 amino acids and identify the fingerprints of the signals. 90 Prediction is compared among three classifiers: k-NN with k = 3, Logistic regression, and RF with the number of estimators of 9. 90 The ML-based algorithms for processing the nanopore signals are summarized in Table 2 , while the commonly used algorithms in each step are depicted in Figure 4 .",

Such specialization is bound by human subjectivity, which does not always align with the best decisions at time of providing relevant features to the classifiers for the task at hand.

This approach limits their capability of selfdiscovering relevant features in order to attain a higher performance for the task. Deep Learning, on the other hand, is based on representation learning, which is a set of strategies by which representations of data can be learned automatically to extract useful information when building, for instance, a classifier. 91 To extract the features, clear criteria in traditional algorithms for preprocessing data need consequently be defined and described by unambiguous logic judgments. These criteria are usually based on users' empirical experience, thereby rendering them subjective and case dependence. For example, a user needs to summarize related key features of the spikes by observation and experience in order to single out the spikes from a noisy background in step 2, e.g., the threshold for spike recognition. The prevalent algorithms used in these application scenarios follow this path, and all the links in the path should be expressed explicitly. The limitation for each step is obvious; feature extraction needs experts, but some key features may only bear limited information. The criteria are rigid and stiff, which can be incompatible with highly nonlinear cases turning to an even more complicated and sophisticated structure. Such limitations can be attributed to the weakness of the concept itself, since the traditional algorithms request an explicit representation of everything, including features, variables, and logical relationships. This process inexorably invites subjectivity. With DL algorithms, in contrast, the features of spikes are acquired by the algorithm during the training process and thus include as much of the original information as possible. This approach inherently bears the commonality for wide application scenarios. Its assessment process is flexible and probabilistic, thus implying a more complex and nonlinear logic and indicating a powerful method with robust performance. The whole process minimizes the participation and intervention of users, which warrants a maximum level of objectivity. 91 The automatic feature extraction in DL algorithms is specially beneficial for atypical signals induced by nanopore\u2212analyte interaction, morphology change dynamics, adsorption\u2212desorption, and clogging. Such atypical signals usually do not display the spike-like features of the typical translocation signals. Therefore, it is challenging and requires rich experience to define and extract features for those signals.",

            "text": "The DL strategy builds its own features by highlighting the most explanatory ones, while diminishing the ones with the least explanatory value for the task that the network is commissioned to solve. Such an efficacy is achieved because the feature extraction part of the network uses optimization mechanisms connected to the final optimization algorithms in the pipeline, which are regarded to address the final task. Such connections are provided by back-propagating errors throughout the architecture in a scheme that utilizes derivatives, the chain rule, and SGD. These mechanisms work together on moving the optimal point of the network progressively in order to find some local minimum in a loss function that the system seeks to minimize. Consequently, the feature extractor mechanism harmoniously follows more robust paths of optimization that permit the whole network to achieve the optimum performance. 91 Historically, the main differences in the data to be processed are forwarded to the corresponding DL architectures. Thus, Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Networks (FFANNs) process data in a way that information flows from input to output without a loop in the processing pipeline. In other words, the input to any module in the network is not influenced by the outputs of such modules directly or indirectly. Examples of FFANN include CNN implementations, such as LeNet-5 introduced in 1998 and known as CNNs today. 92 Later, AlexNet was introduced in 2012 93 with a considerably larger but structurally similar architecture (60,000 parameters for LeNet-5 vs 60 million for AlexNet). Then, VGG-16, developed in 2014, introduced a deeper (with 138 million parameters) yet simpler variant of the previous architectures. 94 Inception network (or GoogleNet) was also introduced in 2014, 95 with its 5 million parameters in version V1 and its 23 million in version V3. As networks started to become deeper and deeper, it was noticed that adding more layers would compromise the quality of gradients. The advantage of the network concept could eventually vanish or explode exponentially with the number of layers. Nowadays, this limitation can be mitigated by employing a new architecture called ResNet, which incorporates skip connections to residual layers. There are several ResNet variants, for instance, ResNet 50 with 25 million parameters. Another architecture called ResNeXt is an extension of ResNet by replacing the standard residual block with one having a different strategy. 96 Finally in the DenseNet architecture, the feature map of each layer is concatenated to the input of every successive layer within a dense block. This strategy encourages feature reuse thus allowing later layers within the network to directly leverage the features from earlier layers. Compared with ResNet, DenseNets are reported to possess better performance with less complexity. 97 For instance, DenseNet has architectures with the number of parameters ranging from 0.8 million to 40 million.",

An important property of RNNs is that they share weights along the sequence and apply Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) throughout the sequence in order to learn. 98 The main principle of BPTT is the same as the traditional back-propagation, where errors are back-propagated from its output layer to its input layer. However, the BPTT differs from the traditional approach in that it sums up errors at each time step, whereas FFANNs do not need to do so, as they do not share parameters across each layer (CNNs do share weights too, but such sharing occurs through the feature space and not through time).",

It is not necessary to show a human infant a giraffe more than twice in order to get her to identify it in different positions and light conditions. Such a scenario is a far-reaching one for ML. Instead, the success of any ML application is at best uncertain without massive amounts of data. For today's ML standards, data, in considerable amounts, is available for only a subset of powerful companies, and academia is usually left out. Generally, data is considered a scarce resource, let alone accurately labeled data that is far from abundant. 111 Data has to be annotated manually according to human judgment, which is an extremely costly and time-consuming process. Crowdsourcing, on the other hand, is an alternative approach, which exploits the crowd to annotate data and thus significantly reduces human labor and therefore cost. Yet, results from crowdsourcing are far from perfect and bear numerous low-quality annotations. 112 Appealing to the example of recognizing images, some tasks in this area are simple, such as categorizing dogs, and can be done by nonspecialized staff. Conversely, labeling medical images, such as the ones found in cancerous tissues, needs deep medical expertise, which is extremely hard to access. 113 Supervised learning is the leading cause for this problematic situation, whereas alternative solutions to this problem can be referred to nonsupervised paradigms. For instance, semisupervised learning is an extension of supervised learning that uses unlabeled data in conjunction with labeled data to improve learning. Classically, the aim is to obtain enlarged labeled data by assigning labels to unlabeled data using their own predictions. 114 Another example is unsupervised representation learning methods that make use of unlabeled data to learn a representation function f such that replacing data point x by feature vector f(x) in new classification tasks reduces the requirement for labeled data. Typical examples of such methods are self-supervised methods and generative algorithms. Finally, reinforcement learning is an optimized-data alternative to supervised learning, since the sample complexity does not depend on preexisting data, but rather on the actions that an agent takes in the dynamics of an environment. 115 Another general solution can be data augmentation. It involves a set of methods that apply systematic modifications to the original training data in a way that it creates new samples. It is regularly utilized in classification problems with the aim of reducing the overf itting caused by limitations imposed by the size of the training data. Augmentations can be basic or generative, depending on if they are handcrafted by humans or artificially learned by machines via utilizing generative algorithms. They can be applied to data-space or feature-space. They can be supervised or unsupervised depending on if they rely on labels or not.",

This pitfall is far from how humans solve problems on a daily basis. Additionally, DL works best when there are thousands, millions, or even billions of training examples. 101 In problems with limited data sources, DL is not an ideal solution. In the specific area of nanopore sensing, real traces collected from nanopore translocation experiments could be abundant, but they are not labeled. Recruiting staff for labeling such data is not viable, given the extension of the data sets needed to train any conceivable DL architecture. Palliative strategies as the ones discussed above could solve the problem at least partially. For instance, data can be augmented in several ways, knowledge of the system can be transferred to new tasks, and alternative unsupervised tasks can serve as pretraining examples to improve the performance obtained from scarcely labeled data sets. Moreover, it is paramount to develop good strategies to augment the available data or to pretrain the architectures on, for instance, unsupervised tasks before training (fine-tuning) them on labeled data for the final downstream tasks.

From the perspective of the architecture, DL offers a rich repertoire of alternatives with different characteristics. A reasonable strategy seems to be following the trends utilized in current state-of-the-art computer vision and language models. For example, it is a reasonable path that employs CNNs as preprocessing backbones pretrained on unsupervised tasks. Afterward, it finetunes such backbones using attentional architectures, such as transformers. Finally, it trains them on supervised downstream tasks with reduced labeled data sets. Therefore, it demands new ways of augmenting nanopore translocation data or alternatively generating unsupervised tasks in order to pretrain the architectures.",

The realization of nanopore sensors has critically benefitted from today's mature biotechnology and semiconductor fabrication technology. Signal processing is an inseparable component of sensing in order to identify the hidden features in the signals and to analyze them. In general, the signal processing flow can be divided into four steps: denoising, spike recognition, feature extraction, and analyte identification. Following this processing flow, the developmental tactics and features of the algorithms at each step are discussed with implementation examples, by categorizing them into ML-based and non-ML-based classes.",

Lately, an increasing number of novel algorithms are developed periodically. Thus, in this work, a comprehensive guide is provided with further discussion on the special properties of ML-based algorithms that are shaping up a new paradigm in the field. A successful nanopore technology builds on two hand-inhand pillars, i.e., the \"hardware\" comprising, apart from essential biochemistry, device fabrication, integration, upscaling, electronics, surface management, and the \"software\" named signal processing. Nanopore sensing signals are generally different from those of other sensing approaches and require special treatments. Three sets of major challenges need to be resolved in order to take full advantage of the great potentials of nanopore technology. (i) The complicated physics in the intertwined processes of ion transport and analyte translocation makes the mechanisms behind signal generation intriguing, since they depend on a large range of different factors. (ii) The nanoconfined space, surfacedominant processes, multiorigin noise, high environmental susceptibility, and weak long-term stability invite serious concerns about the quality of signals. Achieving a quantitative and precise description of the signals can render a challenging proposition. (iii) The great variability found in the configuration of sensor structures and experimental measurements demands the handling of the nanopore signals to seek interpretation of the widely varying data and to standardize procedures, tools, and protocols. In order to respond to these three challenges, two aspects are considered. On one hand, sophisticated physical models based on the established translocation mechanisms are required to assist the evolution of corresponding algorithms. On the other hand, strategies for performance enhancement regarding accuracy, objectivity, robustness, and adaptiveness need be outlined.",

Standardization of the inputs and outputs is required for each step. (2) Tailorability is another important feature that users should be provided with. Some system parameters for each algorithm, such as format of data, option of data pretreatment, interested feature of the signal, etc., may need reconfiguration in order to adapt to the specified application. (3) A synthetical platform as a package solution is welcome. It integrates several algorithms in all steps and assembles a pipeline of the signal processing by the users' preference.

It usually works in electrolytes to count or analyze analytes, such as biomolecules, upon their passage through the pore that generates signals of electrical, optical, or mechanical nature; Pulse-like signal, A time-sequence signal that consists of rapidly increasing-decreasing changes, i.e., pulses, on a generally stable baseline. The appearance of these pulses can be either random, such as neuron spike signals and nanopore translocation signals, or regular, such as electrocardiographic signals; Machine learning, A family of algorithms whose current output is associated with its history input or the distribution of the history input. Hence, such algorithms are built on recurrently \"learning\" from the history/distribution of the input. Such learning can be either explicit, as in a supervised training process, or implicit, as in some unsupervised clustering algorithms; Signal features, Abstract parameters that characterize the information of a signal. Feature extraction is a process of information compression that uses several parameters to represent the information of interest for the signal; Labeled data, Data with correct answers. They are marked and subsequently used for training an algorithm in accordance to a supervised learning process. These correct answers are the information of interest that are anticipated from the algorithm upon inputting corresponding data. They can be the right class of the data and/or the right values of certain quantities of the data; Deep vs. shallow learning, Two different categories of machine learning algorithms. Deep learning is based on a huge number of tunable parameters that can be even larger than the amount of training data, such as those in a neural network, while shallow leaning uses a relatively smaller scale of tunable parameters, such as those in a support vector machine; Classification vs regression, Two distinct categories of machine learning tasks. A classification task requires that an algorithm identify the input data and divide them into several preset classes, while a regression task anticipates that an algorithm predict the values of continuous variables, usually the characteristic quantities of the data",
