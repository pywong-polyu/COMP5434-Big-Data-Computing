Furthermore, there were some significant differences in terms of characteristics of blood donors between the two groups, such as level of education, donor status and age. Among 5253 donors, most were older than 36 years of age (70\u00c15%), had a university degree (53\u00c18%) and were regular donors (87\u00c17%). All blood donors chose to make an appointment to donate blood.

Only 2607 blood donors (16\u00c1\u00c17%) chose to make an appointment to donate blood. To address the shortage of blood due to a dramatic drop in overall blood donation, blood donation initiatives were launched by the blood centers. For example, we had the plan to organize medical staff and family members, friends and colleagues of patients who have ever received transfusions to donate blood, which resulted in about 44\u00c16% of the total donated blood. In view of the fact that the backbone of voluntary blood donation (80\u00c12%) was regular donors over 36 years old and chose to make an appointment to donate blood, we established the targeted blood donor registration system.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 328, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "To survey and mobilize potential blood donors, 163 791 texts were sent by the blood centers.

As shown in Table 2 , most respondents (81\u00c12%) were worried about the 'possibility of acquiring COVID-19 during blood donation'. To reduce the 'possibility of acquiring COVID-19 during blood donation', we not only sterilized the environment with ultraviolet light before and after blood collection but also used the dynamic air disinfectant machine (air purifiers equipped with in-duct ultraviolet germicidal irradiation systems) to sterilize the air during the donation process. At the same time, we required that blood donors should keep at least 1\u00c15 m apart. Notably, to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission through human-to-human contact and save time for donors, we provided an online appointment and questionnaire fill-in service through popular social media such as WeChat, Weibo and Alipay. As a result, a total of 23 respondents were deferred because of their travel history associated with Hubei. All donors who attended were healthy without symptoms nor contact history of COVID-19. Besides, there was no report of post-donation illness among the donors in the reporting period. In consideration of the absence of confirmed transfusion-transmission risk and the shortage of blood, the quarantine system of donated blood was not implemented [11, 12] .

For example, during the Spring Festival, college students enjoy the holiday, migrant workers return home and fewer people are outdoors. All these factors caused the unavailability of blood donors. During the Spring Festival of 2019, the daily mean number of donation was only 1487 u, which was significantly lower than the whole-year daily average. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the daily mean number of donations (531 u) was about two thirds lower than that for the last Spring Festival (1487 u) (see Fig. 1 ). However, the total amount of issued RBC units (25 276\u00c15u) is more than two times higher than the collected units (9028 u). Particularly in the first week of the outbreak, which we called 'black week', the daily mean number of donations was only 192\u00c15 u, which dropped to one-fifteenth or lower of typical regular collections. The daily mean number of supply (RBCs) was 1453 u, which was almost seven times higher than daily collections. The weekly amount of issued RBC units (10 171\u00c15 u) was nearly six times higher than the collected units(1347\u00c15 u). During black week, the gap between blood collection and supply was the most serious. As time went on, the gap narrowed. Fortunately, we had a high blood inventory level (38 425.5 u) to absorb this acute blood shortage because of the early alert and anticipation of the COVID-19 before the Spring Festival. No patients died from this acute blood shortage. To improve the availability of blood, some administrative measures to restrict clinical demand for blood were taken, such as autologous transfusions, postponing elective surgical procedures and restrictive transfusion strategies (6-7 g/dl) in Zhejiang during the height of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Emergency situations such as SARS epidemic and other similar events even worsen this discrepancy between blood supply and demand due to the drop of blood donation. In this study, we found that the amount of RBCs supply has been twice as much as RBCs collected during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. In the first week of the outbreak, the units of RBCs supply were seven times as many as the units collected. The COVID-19 epidemic itself may not cause the increase in blood demand, but the dramatic drop of donors (67%) significantly reduced the amount of blood collected.

These findings suggest that we need to reassure the public about the safety of donating blood. We should not only mobilize potential donors through broadcast, telephone calls and social media with Wechat and Alipay but also provide them with facemasks, shuttle transfer, mobile collection vehicles to reach donors, online appointment and questionnaire fill-in service.

There are two possible reasons for the decrease in younger donors. First, parental opposition for this age group of people who are the only one child in the family to donate blood and to travel out during the lockdown period was stronger than that of any other time points. Secondly, young people usually participated in blood donation to response to the call of the workplace and lack of true commitment for repeat blood donations. These findings suggest that well-designed education activities to raise up social responsibilities and accountability among young people should be developed and implemented. The proportion of regular donors has increased by over 57%, which suggests that repeat donations are essential in maintaining an adequate blood supply for emergency demand. Moreover, most donors (53\u00c18%) had a university degree, which suggests that educated donors are more likely to overcome their fears and feel comfortable to donate blood.
