The definition of individual ESG factors is first introduced to highlight sustainability considerations in businesses and how these can be considered and support circularity in business operations. The chapter further develops the concept that ESG reporting serves as an enabling tool with which the business operations can drive circularity and remedy the existing limitations of the linear economy in practice. The rise in ESG reporting from companies, and the ESG considerations of companies based on their disclosures are discussed. Incorporation of ESG factors into business operations is also evidenced through real-world case studies. The impact of ESG performance and the growing awareness of sustainability among businesses, consumers, and investors on the current investing trends and its contribution to embracing circularity is presented as the conclusion of the chapter.",

The rising concerns about the impacts of the linear economy on the environment and society have spurred the companies to firmly rethink the sustainability implications of their operations [1, 5] . During the previous decade, this sustainability consciousness has established a direct correlation with the circular economy (CE) principles. Many companies across the world, therefore, are moving towards circular business approaches 1 and it is evidenced that the CE know-how is concentrated in large companies and less diffused across small medium businesses [6] . This transition to CE, however, needs a comprehensive assessment of the extent of circularity achieved and the potential economic benefits.",

Various organizations such as the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute, 3 the alchemia-nova, 4 and the ecopreneur 5 provide assistance in assessing the materials circularity of the products, services and/or entire supply chains with their proprietary approaches and tools.

In practice, such a business is dependant on labor, within a broader societal setup involving stakeholders such as investors and consumers. For the smooth functioning of the business, a set of practices, rules, and regulations, and operational procedures are followed, that decide how decisions are made in the company, mostly regarding governance and general operational management. Thus, the businesses we see around are fundamentally interweaved with various ESG factors in some capacity. Its imperative to first briefly understand the individual factors of ESG ( Fig. 1) and their interdependencies. 1 . The E in ESG, environmental aspect, encompasses the energy consumption of the company, the resources/raw materials consumed, the waste discharged, and the impact of these on the ecosystems. Carbon emissions and the contribution to climate change are the two most important and common criteria which represent the ecological footprint of the company. 2. The S in ESG, social criteria, includes the reputation and relationships that the company has earned with the employees, consumers, and institutions in the community where the business has been established and is being run. It mainly represents the inclusive culture and diversity in human capital 6 of a company to suit the societal requirements. 3. The G in ESG, governance, is the in-house system of controls and protocols a company follows to govern itself, in order to make effective decisions, abide by the laws of the land, and meet the needs of the stakeholders.

All these collectively gave rise to the concept of ESG Later in the 1980s, a series of industrial disasters such as the Bhopal gas tragedy, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and the Exxon Valdez oil spill led to serious environmental concerns and an increasing consciousness regarding the need for a common evaluatory metric on the environmental integrity of business operations (Fig. 2) .

Currently, many countries are transiting from a traditional linear economy to a CE, one that is regenerative and waste-free by design. To facilitate such a transition and steer towards circularity, governments are enframing relevant legislation and policies for circular manufacturing and business operations [12, 13] . The objective of the transition is to absorb as much value as possible from resources, products, and services to create a system that promotes materials circularity and renewable energy. There is also a temporal dimension to this objective. In that, the goal of product design and manufacturing is keeping products, components, and materials at their highest utility for the longest possible times [1] .

As a result of fast trends in this industry, nearly three-quarters of the used textiles have been landfilled or incinerated in the past decade. There is also a considerable loss of virgin materials during both the production and recycling of fashion products. The study conducted by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that $500 billion worth of raw material is lost every year due to clothing being barely used and rarely recycled [15] . In addition to environmental pollution caused by these processes, the loss of materials and the resources used in the production add up to the total carbon footprint of the industry, thereby contributing to climate change. If this trend continues, a study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates [15] that by 2050, the fashion industry will be responsible for using a quarter of the world's carbon budget! This has become a major concern for popular fashion brands as they are being associated with a growing negative environmental impact leading to social and governance concerns. Therefore, some brands are revisiting their designs to make them circular. One such approach involves using recycled feedstock and fibers from renewable resources such as natural fibers and recycled plastic. A few start-up fashion brands such as Rapanui have even come up with business models to collect back their products that have reached their end-of-life and upcycle them into new products. These initiatives make the business sustainable by reducing the negative impact on the environment locally and on a global scale [16] . Moreover, such circular business approaches also address governance issues such as adhering to a cap on carbon emission, landfill closures, and mandatory use of recycled feedstock. Though this transformation seems difficult initially, it is profitable in the long run.",

Incorporating the environmental, social, and governance factors into investing and lending is moving into the mainstream, transforming the operations and management dynamics of companies. According to the KPMG Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting (2017) [17] , around 93% of the world's largest 250 corporations (G250) report on their sustainability performance. 10 Many companies are integrating non-financial aspects of business performance represented by ESG in their annual reports. In the context of global sustainability, such reporting by the companies is crucial as it demonstrates their strategic contributions and communicates their values and governance ethics to the stakeholders. This reduces the asymmetric information between the company and its stakeholders and provides the opportunity for stakeholders in choosing companies based on their ESG performance. In doing so, the stakeholders (such as investors, consumers, and suppliers) contribute indirectly to improve global sustainability. From a company's perspective, non-financial reporting provides them an opportunity to reflect on their ESG performance, and recognize and seize new opportunities and manage changes towards sustainability [18, 19] . When viewed through a CE lens, the ESG reporting, provided it's transparent, assists in selecting the better companies that are implementing the CE framework and the 6R framework 11 : reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, redesign, and remanufacturing. However, adoption of ESG practices in operations and management of a company is still voluntary (and there is general consensus that it should be made mandatory).",

Depending on the relevance to the industry group considered, data points used for calculation varies from 70 to 170. These data points are grouped into 10 categories (or parameters) that belong to the three pillars (or factors) E, S, and G as shown in Table 2 . The categories are further divided into themes and based on the various indicators' values, the themes are evaluated to calculate the category scores. Then, the E, S, and G pillar scores which are a relative sum of category scores are calculated. Finally, the overall ESG score is calculated as a sum of the pillar values. Furthermore, the ESGC score is evaluated considering 23 categories of ESG controversies and combining it with the ESG score. For a detailed explanation of the calculation process and representative illustrations, please refer to the Refinitiv publication [22] .

Therefore, the company is taking responsibility to reduce its carbon footprint and achieve the climate change goals of the Paris Agreement. 19 This is being achieved by reducing emissions from manufacturing processes by improving energy efficiency and moving to renewable energy sources, and evaluating and making changes in operations throughout the Coca-Cola system value chain (manufacturing processes, packaging formats, delivery fleet, refrigeration equipment, and ingredient sourcing). The company's target is to reduce carbon emissions by 25% by 2030 considering 2015 as the baseline [24] . 3. Circular Approach for Zero-waste: Post-consumer packaging waste is a major global issue. Besides the pollution issues related to the oceans and coastal regions, plastic packaging has also become a major constituent of the landfills. Such packaging waste not only pollutes the environment but also increases the carbon footprint of the product. To address the waste issue resulting from plastic packaging, many governments are introducing EPR policies. Consumers are becoming aware of the cost of material inefficiencies in linear production models. Therefore, the Coca-Cola Company has made zero packaging waste as one of its core strategies. The company plans to achieve this by setting three major goals: 100% recyclable packaging by 2025, 100% recycling rate by 2030, and using 50% of recycled materials for packaging by 2030 [24] . They are trying to eliminate lowvalue multi-layered packaging and other non-recyclable materials, increase the collection rates of clear PET bottles and introduce innovative methods to recycle colored bottles and dirtier waste streams.",

Adopting CE also helps companies in reducing operational costs and therefore, ESG practice has evolved gradually as a costanchored approach for the companies. The main value of the CE from an operational perspective for businesses is that it aids to reduce the costs of the supply chain or generate value from byproducts, consequently making the business more competitive in addition to decreasing the negative environmental impact of companies. Implementing circularity could improve companies' environmental performance while creating value and increasing revenue. Most companies incorporate CE-based ESG practices to enhance their overall \"green\" image to attract sustainability investors. Therefore, ESG scoring is far from being an absolute truth in determining how sustainable companies are. It is when ESG concepts get embedded into the core business of a company, ESG practice will become more engaged with the idea of a CE. Besides, for systemic change towards a CE, ESG should not be limited to publicly traded companies. Government institutions and NGOs must also embrace, measure, and perform well under ESG.",

Consequently, embracing ESG as a part of the mainstream business has lately gained traction and ESG-oriented investing has experienced a meteoric rise. According to McKinsey 2014 estimates, globally, more than $13 trillion were invested in the businesses that incorporated ESG criteria in their operations [10] . In 2019 alone, the global sustainable investment topped $30 trillion-a 68% increase since 2014 and tenfold since 2004 [27] . This increase in the investments on sustainable businesses is a consequence of heightened social and governmental attention on the broader impact of companies on the environment and society, as well as the foresight of investors and financial advisors who are realizing that a strong ESG proposition can safeguard and promote a company's long-term success. There is empirical evidence of better returns resulting from investments based on ESG scores [11] . In particular, portfolios with high ratings for ESG criteria such as eco-efficiency, employee relations, and transparency in corporate governance have set new milestones in the stock markets and investing in general, with comparatively lesser downside risks. A good ESG performance by companies can also result in institutional investors such as banks investing in such companies through green bonds. 27 Also, companies with better ESG scores have benefited with higher credit ratings and lower costs of debts, translating to better profits.",
