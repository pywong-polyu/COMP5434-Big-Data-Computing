Successful health policy implementation relies on early identification of infected individuals and extensive contact tracing. However, rural communities, where resources for testing are sparse or simply absent, face distinctive challenges to achieving this success. Accordingly, we report the development of an academic, public land grant University laboratory-based detection assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from various clinical specimens that can be readily deployed in areas where access to testing is limited. The test, which is a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based procedure, was validated on samples provided by the state laboratory and submitted for FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our test exhibits comparable sensitivity and exceeds specificity and inclusivity values compared to other molecular assays. Additionally, this test can be re-configured to meet supply chain shortages, modified for scale up demands, and is amenable to several clinical specimens. Test development also involved 3D engineering critical supplies and formulating a stable collection media that allowed samples to be transported for hours over a dispersed rural region without the need for a cold-chain. These two elements that were critical when shortages impacted testing and when personnel needed to reach areas that were geographically isolated from the testing center. Overall, using a robust, easy-to-adapt methodology, we show that an academic laboratory can supplement COVID-19 testing needs and help local health departments assess and manage outbreaks. This additional testing capacity is particularly germane for smaller cities and rural regions that would otherwise be unable to meet the testing demand.",

Communities in rural areas continue to face unique challenges that stem from social inequities, literacy levels below national standards 4 , and limited access to quality health care. Consequently, rural Americans are facing the COVID-19 pandemic from a precarious vantage point, which is aggravated by the lack of healthcare infrastructure and the presence of an adult population with disproportionate comorbidities and disabilities compared to their non-rural counterpart [5] [6] [7] . A case in point is southwest Virginia (SWVA), the state's westernmost region including all of Virginia's seven coal-producing counties. According to the latest US census data, SWVA is poorer, older, less diverse, and has a slower population growth than most regions in the Commonwealth of Virginia 8 and yet, it was in this region, where testing capabilities for COVID-19 were scarce or absent when COVID-19 was declared a national emergency.",

However, chemical shortages for reagents placed pressure on laboratories wanting to run COVID-19 tests. Testing laboratories ultimately faced the same roadblock in the reagent supply chain, which affected their diagnostic capabilities. These limitations also increased the wait time for test results, posing stressful uncertainty and constraints on patients and their families.

Particularly appealing aspects of this molecular test include its flexibility for implementation in various experimental settings, easy incorporation into high-throughput platforms to scale up capacity, and the versatility to maneuver around supply chain deficiencies. As of June 2021, 135,000+ individuals from seven health districts in SWVA, including more than 650 businesses, nursing homes, physician and dentistry offices, construction sites, and all public schools in the New River Valley (NRV) have been tested with this newly developed assay, where specimens were processed and reported within 24 h of sample arrival.",

As testing availability was initially unable to meet demands for quick turnaround times and throughput ability were limited, there was considerable need for enhanced testing availability throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia and the country.

Our assay is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based test designed to amplify three distinct SARS-CoV-2 genes, i.e., N, E, and S, in the context of the expression of a housekeeping control gene named RPP30. A flow chart of the general procedure is presented in Fig. 1a . Briefly, clinical specimens (e.g., mid-turbinate) were collected using a commercial sterile synthetic rayon/ Dacron\u00ae/polyester/nylon tipped applicator and transported in a specially formulated transport media. As swabs became a limiting factor during the pandemic, in-house manufacturing of 3Dprinted swabs became a stopgap alternative to replace traditional flocked swabs (Fig. 1b, c) . Accordingly, nasopharyngeal swabs were fabricated by inverse stereolithography following a design process developed by University of South Florida Health (patent is pending) with materials commonly used for clinical printing that were FDA-approved for biocompatibility 11 . This design, already evaluated in a clinical trial 11 , was duplicated in our laboratory as described in the \"Methods\" section. The mechanical properties of the two printed swabs, an adult and pediatric version, exhibit comparable tensile and torsional strength within the variances observed (Fig. 1d) . These results were further compared to the testing values of commercially available swabs previously reported by Formlabs (Copan and Puritan, Swab Verification Summary Report #SR-0010 rev#00). In general, the performance, toughness, and torsional testing results of our 3D-printed swabs fell within those approved to be the standard of care [Copan (highest) and Purtan (lowest)].",

Accordingly, inactive SARS-CoV-2 virus was spiked into various formulations of TM consisting of a suspension of a negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. Viral particles were released from the swab into the MDL media using mechanical stirring. An aliquot of the eluate was then subjected to a TRIzol/EtOH-based nucleic acid extraction protocol in a 96-well column format system following various washing/elution procedures as described in the \"Methods\" section. The integrity of purified RNA was evaluated by microcapillary electrophoretic RNA separation and assigned an RNA integrity number (RIN) ranging from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) (Fig. 1e , left panel). The RIN results validated our transport media as an effective diluent as it was the one formulation that best preserved the quality of the RNA even 10 days after collection (Fig. 1e , left panel). Next, we evaluated whether components of the TM might inhibit the amplification reaction. Consequently, total RNA was purified from each transport media sample and used for reverse transcription and amplification in a formulation that contains RNase inhibitor, and additives to reduce formation of the primer's secondary structure. Primers for the amplification of SARS-CoV-2 (N, E, and S) and human housekeeping (RPP30) genes were included in four independent reaction mixtures. Under these conditions, maximum sensitivity and reliability was ensured as false positives resulting from primer dimers were less likely to occur. Reactions were, then, assembled in a 384-well plate format and amplified as described in the \"Methods\" section. Results show that the composition of the MDL-TM did not inhibit gene amplification and preserves the quality of the sample, seen by the comparable Ct values obtained for the viral genes, even 10 days after collection (Fig. 1e , right panel). Clinical specimens were expected to exhibit fluorescence amplification curves when using the Hs_RPP30 primers with Ct values that cross the threshold line below a cutoff determined by a standard curve, thus, confirming the presence of human material via the RPP30 gene. Samples from presumptive positive COVID-19 patients were expected to amplify at least two out of the three genes from SARS-CoV-2, (i.e., N, E, and S), a criterion that allows for higher specificity and reduces the likelihood of false negative results (see Supplementary Table 2 for complete criteria). Standard curves for RPP30 were included in each run and for each plate. Failure to detect RPP30 in any clinical specimen may indicate: (i) improper extraction of RNA from the clinical sample, (ii) absence of sufficient human cellular material due to poor collection or loss of specimen integrity, (iii) improper set-up and execution, or (iv) equipment malfunction. Interpretation of results when a negative RPP30 was reported was as follows: (i) if at least two of the viral genes (N, E, S) were positive even in the absence of a positive RPP30, the result was considered valid. A negative RPP30 signal did not preclude the detection of viral RNA in a clinical specimen, and (ii) if viral genes and RPP30 were negative for the specimen, the result was considered invalid. In this last scenario, if a residual clinical sample was available, it was recommended to repeat the extraction procedure as well as the test. However, if all markers remained negative after a re-test, the result was reported as \"invalid\" and a new specimen needed to be collected (Supplementary Table 2 ).",

Initial experiments were devoted to determining the sensitivity of the pooling method and in defining the optimal number of samples per pool. Accordingly, we used our protocol to pool test archived individual samples with n-sample pools each consisting of one positive sample and n\u22121 negative samples. In all cases, samples were from NP swabs taken from patients and tested in accordance with the protocol described in the \"Methods\" section. A sample's status (i.e., positive or negative) was determined based on cut-off values and the 95% CI for the N and RPP30 genes as explained earlier. Once tested, samples were separated into two groups: positives and negatives. To generate the negative pools for testing, four samples from the negative group were used in each of the pooled samples. No negative sample was used in more than one negative pooled sample. Some, but not all, of the negative samples had enough volume to be included in the positive pool. With that value, we identified how many samples had N/E/S within a 4Ct range. Three samples had all three genes within the 4Ct value and one sample had two genes within the 4Ct value. Therefore, four samples were in the \"weak\" category and were likely missed when pooling. Based on the validation test (20 negative and 21 positive pooled samples), we observed 100% positive percent agreement (PPA) and 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). Per FDA recommendation, results were reported in a two-by-two table (Supplementary  Table 8a ). There was no difference in processing for pooled and single samples.",

To determine whether pooling versus individual testing was a better choice for COVID-19 screening, we needed to evaluate the prevalence of positive cases within a certain time frame in the area. As a proofof-concept, we chose to monitor the positivity rate among 3807 individuals tested between July 10th to July 30th, 2020 as follows: (i) July 10th to 16th, 1288 individuals, (ii) July 17th to 23rd, 1136 individuals, and (iii) July 24th to 30th, 1383 individuals living in the New River Valley (Table 3 ). The highest positivity rate within that time-frame was 4.4%; thus, using this positivity rate, pooling (n = 4) would reduce the number of expected tests by 59% compared to individual sample testing. This was calculated using the Shiny application for pooled testing as described by Abdalhamid et al. 12 [https://www.chrisbilder.com/shiny]. Here, we used estimates of 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity for our calculations. These estimates also showed that when the positivity rate in the sample reaches above 25%, individual sample testing would be a more efficient approach than pooling. If the positivity rate exceeds 25%, then we will return to testing samples individually. As positivity rate is an important variable for consideration when deciding to use pooled versus individual sample testing, it became important to monitor its value and the number of weak positives in the region by individual sample testing using a 7-day moving average (i.e., the average positive testing rate of the prior 7 days). Comparison among weekly positivity rates and the 25% positivity threshold were used to adjust our testing strategy.",

Participants provided written informed consent and had COVID-19 symptoms. To minimize the occurrence of discordant results, both clinical specimens were simultaneously collected, transported into MDL-TM, and processed using the protocol for extraction and amplification described in the \"Methods\" section. Of the 122 participants, 92 were negative and 30 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 as determined by our RT-qPCR test. Per FDA criteria, a minimum of 95% positive and negative agreement with similar Ct values for paired specimen types was considered an acceptable clinical performance. As shown in Supplementary Data 8, Ct values for the N gene in positive swab samples ranged from~15 to 35 and, thus, covered a range of clinically relevant values for comparison. Our findings showed that matching saliva samples were 100% in agreement with swab reports resulting in 100% PPA and 100% NPA.

Thus, a molecular diagnostics test developed to detect multiple genetic targets of SARS-CoV-2 is less susceptible to genetic variation. The FDA provides regular alerts to health care providers of potential false negative results that might result as a consequence of using commercial kits, where detection could be compromised by a prevalent new variant of the virus. False positive results are equally concerning and arise from different sources, some of which are related to the format of the test and others to the sensitive nature of its amplification. The most notorious, and certainly unfortunate, case of false positive results appeared early in the pandemic and resulted from both contamination of the US. CDC test kits during the production phase 18 and cross-reactivity of a primer-probe set 19 . As such, we developed a multilevel approach to address these issues starting with an efficient laboratory design, where processing stations are physically segregated, included an array of controls in each plate that flags sources of cross-contaminations and carryovercontaminations, monitored for human error using cross-analysis, and developed a criterion for which at least two SARS-CoV-2 genes needed to amplify below a threshold cut-off for a sample to be reported positive.",

            "text": "The evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2 brings an additional consideration for test development and implementation that is of particular concern to commercial enterprises, as they struggle to add alternative laboratory tests into routine use for the detection of new variants of the virus. Unlike large clinical laboratories, the operational flow for testing in laboratories within academic institutions facilitates just-in-time adaptations to the evolving nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A case-in-point is the variant B.1.1.7 (VUI202012/01) of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom in September 2020, and has spread to over 30 countries by the end of January 2021 20 (https://assets.publishing. service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_ data/file/948152/Technical_Briefing_VOC202012-2_Briefing_2_ FINAL.pdf). Implementation of procedures for the detection of new genomic variants of SARS-CoV-2 would need to rely on de novo production of specific supply kits and scale up operations. Thus, high-throughput academic laboratories with customized procedures can easily substitute individual components and be rapidly operational. A resilient test system like ours would prompt rapid public health responses and assess SARS-CoV-2 variant transmissibility and severity in the population. For instance, the D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in late January 2020, replaced the original SARS-CoV-2 variant identified in Wuhan, China in a period of several months to become the dominant variant globally 21 , could not be specifically identified by any single commercially available kit 22 . Under this circumstance, the only tool for public health officials to rely on for decision-making in response to an outbreak from a new variant virus was real-time whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Although a cutting-edge technology, WGS presents some logistical and technical challenges that make it difficult to broadly implement. This includes the need for streamlined sample preparation and a bioinformatics pipeline that ensures access to highly accurate and complete sequence platforms, access to metadata for interpretation, and automated tools for data analysis. A customized in-house screening test for a new variant can easily be developed by generating mutations of interest within an oligonucleotide sequence; thus, an alternative screening test can be developed and implemented in a matter of hours.",

Both swab designs have an overall length of 155 mm and a breakpoint approximately 70 mm from the swab tip. The cylindrical swab tip of the adult type is 20 mm in length and 3.8 mm in diameter. In comparison, the pediatric type swab tip is slightly longer (21.5 mm) and narrower (2.6 mm). Both designs are textured for sample collection and have a rounded end for comfort. 3D printable swab files can be obtained from USF Health (https:// health.usf.edu/medicine/radiology/3d/3dprinting). Swabs were printed in batches of 324 per build using a Formlabs Form 2 printer with Surgical Guide (v1) resin. The build platform with swabs still attached were washed for 20 min in molecular biology grade isopropanol (Fisher Bioreagents) using a Form Wash (Formlabs). The swabs were allowed to dry in air for 30 min and then removed using a scraper. An initial inspection was performed to look for uncured resin and remove defective parts. The swabs were then mounted in groups of 80 onto a custom fixture design (Formlabs). The fixture with swabs was loaded in a Form Cure (Formlabs) and cured for 30 min at 60\u00b0C. After cooling in air to room temperature, the swabs were removed from the rack and again inspected for defects, ragging (loosely attached bits of cured resin, especially around the handle tab), and excessive bending (>10\u00b0). Several swabs from each batch were randomly selected for destructive mechanical testing. The remaining swabs were inserted tip-first and in groups of 20 or 25 along with an additional sterilization indicator into 5\u00bc\u2033 \u00d7 10\u2033 strip self-sealing autoclavable pouches (Fisherbrand TM ).

            "text": "To generate the positive pools for testing, three negative samples were used in combination with one positive sample. All positive pooled samples contained a different set of negative samples; no two positive pooled samples contained the same three negative samples.First, we validated pooling studies using positive samples with at least 25% of them being within 2-3 Cts of the cut-off, and no more than within 2-4 Cts overall. Validation was performed in pools of 2, 3, and 4 samples (Supplementary Data 4, 5, and 6). For pools containing n = 2 samples [one positive and one negative (P1 + N1) or two negative samples (N1 + N2)], we analyzed 20 negative and positive pools containing two samples in each pool. Supplementary Data 4 summarizes the results of the Cts for the N, E, S, and RPP30 genes and cut-offs for N and RPP30 for each of the two samples in the pool (columns F-L and P-V) and for the pool itself (columns Z-AF). Note that the assay cut-off for each sample varied since thresholds were determined on a plate-byplate basis. When Ct values for each gene of the positive sample were compared with the corresponding n = 2 pool, we found that Ct differences were less than two in22 samples analyzed (Supplementary Data 4). Regression analysis of individual versus pooled Cts showed an R 2 of 0.94, 0.92, and 0.91 for the N, E, S, genes, respectively [LOD individual N: 38.54, 95% CI (38.12, 38.97); LOD pool N: 37.29, 95% CI (36.91, 37.67)] (Supplementary Data 4). These results indicated that, following this pooling procedure, samples with Cts for the N gene between 38.12 and 36.91 would have been detected using individual testing but not when pooling. We next evaluated the result of 20 negative and 22 positive pooled samples containing three individual specimens (P2 + N3 + N4 and N3 + N4 + N5, Supplementary Data 5). As was the case when pooling two samples, deviation of Ct values was within two units when comparing individual versus three pooled samples. Regression analysis for individual versus pooled Cts showed that the R 2 values for the N, E, and S genes were 0.96, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively [LOD individual N: 36.17, 95% CI (35.79, 36.56); LOD pool N: 37.29, 95% CI (36.91, 37.67)] (Supplementary Data 5). Thus, samples with Cts between 35.79 and 36.91 would have been detected when testing individual samples but would have been missed when pooled. In a set of 20 negative (N6 + N7 + N8 + N9) and 21 positive pooled samples of n = 4 (P3 + N6 + N7 + N8), 4 (19%) patient samples were within 4 Ct values of the threshold.

In addition, all SARS-CoV-2 sequences that were identified as being complete and having high coverage were downloaded from GISAID (gisaid.org) to include sequences available up to January 7th, 2021. GISAID sequences were downloaded from https://www.gisaid.org/ in batches of less than 10,000 sequences. The two sets of SARS-CoV-2 sequences were aligned separately using the DECIPHER software toolset 26 in R studio (rstudio.com). To mitigate limitations due to computing power, sequence alignments were performed using subsets of 1,000 sequences at a time. Each of these aligned subsets were merged to include up to 10,000 sequences. These merged alignments were merged with three other alignment sets of up to 10,000 sequences to generate alignments of up to 40,000 sequences total. This resulted in seven alignment groups for the downloaded GISAID sequences and one for the downloaded NCBI sequences. These sequence alignment groups were used to analyze each of the primer binding regions.Aligned SARS-CoV-2 sequences were included for further analysis if sequence information was available for all six primer binding regions, and if the sequences contained less than four mixed bases in any one primer binding region. For the remaining sequences, the alignments for each primer binding region were analyzed for mismatches that could affect amplification. The criteria for mismatches that could affect amplification included having any mismatch within three nucleotides of the 3\u2032 end of a primer binding region or having three or more mismatches over the length of the primer binding region. The criteria for potentially affecting inclusivity of the assay included having mismatches that could affect amplification for at least two different primer sets.Reporting summary.
