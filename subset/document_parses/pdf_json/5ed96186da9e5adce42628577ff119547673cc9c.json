This means that ordinary people are asked to adopt enhanced protective health behaviors, such as physical distancing and frequent handwashing. However, along with these official recommendations, people are exposed to pseudoscientific information and unverified content pertaining to  which have proliferated rapidly through social media (Depoux et al., 2020; Kouzy et al., 2020; Mian & Khan, 2020; Zarocostas, 2020) . In fact, we are \"not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous\" (WHO, 2020) . Pseudoscientific recommendations such as consuming garlic, drinking ginger tea or rinsing nose with saline to prevent contracting the virus, became so pervasive that the WHO (n.d.) had to officially debunk the claims about their effectiveness. Certain pseudoscientific practices (PSPs) are extremely dangerous-for example, more than 700 Iranians were reported dead of methanol poisoning falsely believing it was a miracle cure for COVID-19 (Associated Press, 2020) . Another \"victim\" of the infodemic is the COVID-19 vaccine, which is still in development.",

In addition to cognitive intuition and cognitive biases that are more general, knowledge overestimation (i.e., a calibration error relating to the discrepancy between actual, objectively measured and subjective, self-estimated knowledge), and belief in conspiracy theories (potential source of false knowledge about a particular subject) are measures that are contentladen and refer to a specific context, event or a class of events.

            "text": "However, recent studies examining the relation between belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and self-reported adherence to recommended behaviors have produced inconsistent results. While some found a relation with adherence to health guidelines (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020 ; see also Swami & Barron, 2020) , others did not (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020 ; see also Plohl & Musil, 2020) . Furthermore, conspiracy theories might be predictive of some, but not other types of recommended protective behaviors-for example, believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was related to less social-distancing but unrelated to personal-hygiene behaviors (Pummerer & Sassenberg, 2020) . As for pseudoscientific practices, it was shown that people more prone to conspiratorial thinking were more likely to endorse claims related to the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medical treatments in general (Lamberty & Imhoff, 2018; Lobato et al., 2014; Pennycook, Cheyne, et al., 2015) and that they reported greater use of PSPs to prevent contracting coronavirus (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; Pummerer & Sassenberg, 2020 ; see also Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020) . A possible mechanism through which conspiracy theories may influence health behaviors is by amplifying distrust toward institutions, which makes people less willing to follow official COVID-19 recommendations (Pavela Banai et al., 2020) . In order to stay healthy, some people may then turn to PSPs, which are not recommended by authorities due to absence of evidence for their effectiveness. Thus, although there is converging evidence suggesting that conspiracy theories are predictive of PSPs, more studies are needed to explore their influence on adherence to COVID-19 guidelines. We expected that stronger beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories would predict lesser adherence to COVID-19 guidelines (H1a), greater use of PSPs (H1b), and a weaker intention to get vaccinated (H1c).",

Pennycook et al. (2017) showed that intuitive individuals tended to be more overconfident on the cognitive reflection test, rating themselves as relatively reflective, despite their test scores showing otherwise. Thus, it is possible that some people would overestimate their COVID-19 related knowledge because their nonreflexivity prevents them from recognizing their ignorance (see also Dunning, 2011; Kruger & Dunning, 1999) , which would in turn make them less likely to engage in preventive behaviors during the pandemic. In fact, knowledge overestimation has been widely documented in the health domain (see Dunning et al., 2004) . The inability to recognize one's lack of skill or knowledge (Kruger & Dunning, 1999) can, in this context, prevent people from familiarizing themselves enough with the official guidelines. In this study, we expected that higher levels of COVID-19 related knowledge overestimation would predict lesser adherence to COVID-19 guidelines (H2a), greater use of PSPs (H2b), and weaker intention to get vaccinated (H2c).",

            "text": "Cognitive biases, as systematic departures from what is normatively defined rational behavior, can be viewed as a relatively broad category of irrational beliefs. Taking into account that the cognitive biases space is considerably heterogeneous (see, for example, Kahneman & Frederick, 2005; Pohl, 2004; Stanovich, 2009; Teovanovi c et al., 2015) , we focused on a subset which concerns a general tendency to make a type I error. Such a choice was motivated by Haselton and Buss' (2000) notion on cost asymmetry between two types of errors (type I and type II) that can occur when judgments are made under uncertainty. More precisely, as the probability of making either type of error cannot be simultaneously minimized, people tend to decrease the likelihood of making the costlier one (Haselton et al., 2009) . Since the consequences of type II errors (i.e., false-negatives) refer to failures to notice actual relations between phenomena, they are usually considered as costlier. Thus, people are typically biased toward type I errors (i.e., false-positives) which refers to making incorrect conclusions about the existence of relations between unrelated phenomena. In our study, biases that are based on making a type I error were represented by the illusory correlation detection (Smedslund, 1963) , base-rate neglect (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974 ), gambler's fallacy (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) , and hot-hand fallacy (Gilovich et al., 1985) bias. Although cognitive biases have shown to be predictive of some paranormal (Bressan, 2002; Pennycook et al., 2012; \u0160rol, 2020; and pseudoscientific beliefs (Pennycook, Cheyne, et al., 2015; Redelmeier & Tversky, 1996; \u0160rol, 2020) , they remain underexplored in the domain of both PSPs and adherence to public health guidelines. Starting from the general hypothesis about relation between irrational beliefs and health behaviors, we expected that a higher susceptibility to such cognitive biases would predict lesser adherence to COVID-19 guidelines (H3a), greater use of PSPs (H3b), and weaker intention to get vaccinated (H3c).",

While cognitive biases are related to specific types of predictable errors on heuristics-andbiases tasks, cognitive intuition refers to an inability to \"resist reporting the response that first comes to mind\" (Frederick, 2005, p. 27) . Previous research has shown that misleading intuitions predict paranormal beliefs (Pennycook et al., 2012; St\u00e5hl & van Prooijen, 2018) as well as religious beliefs Shenhav et al., 2012) . In the health domain, cognitive intuition was related to beliefs about the effectiveness and selfreported use of complementary and alternative treatments both before (Browne et al., 2015; McPhetres & Pennycook, 2019 ; see also Lindeman, 2011) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; Erceg et al., 2020; Pennycook et al., 2020) . However, recent findings on the relation between CRT performance and adherence to official COVID-19 guidelines are mixedwhile some found a negative relation (Stanley et al., 2020) , others failed to establish any link (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; Erceg et al., 2020; Pennycook et al., 2020;  cf.

Belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was the most consistent predictor of each type of health behavior. This is in line with previous findings showing positive relations between conspiratorial thinking and use of PSPs (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; Oliver & Wood, 2014) , nonadherence to medical or public health recommendations (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020; Oliver & Wood, 2014) , and unwillingness to get vaccinated (e.g., Setbon & Raude, 2010) . It further strengthens the view of conspiratorial beliefs as a part of contaminated mindware (Rizeq et al., 2020; Stanovich et al., 2016) or unwarranted beliefs detrimental to one's rational thought process, which may influence decisions that lead to unfavorable health outcomes. In our study, the relation between conspiratorial beliefs and unwillingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was particularly strong. Importantly, this result Other irrational beliefs were also somewhat predictive of COVID-19 health behaviors. Those who overestimated their COVID-19 knowledge reported lesser adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, but were also somewhat less prone to using PSPs. We have initially assumed that knowledge overestimation may be predictive of greater use of PSPs, however it seems plausible that it operates in a similar fashion for both types of health behaviors. For example, overconfidence in one's knowledge may decrease interest in learning about preventive behaviors, regardless of whether these are evidence-based or not. We also found that those that rely on cognitive intuition and follow their \"gut feelings\" may be l more relaxed when it comes to adhering to behaviors recommended by COVID-19",

This has left people with fewer behavioral choices, particularly with regards to physical distancing. On the other hand, engaging in PSPs was optional and, at the time of data collection, there was no vaccine developed against (no vaccination policies were in place).

As a direct consequence of this, their relations with other measures are attenuated (see, for TEOVANOVI C ET AL. example, John & Benet-Mart\u00ednez, 2000) . In that sense, the reported coefficients of correlation can be seen as conservative estimates of strength of the association between type I cognitive biases, cognitive intuition, and health-related behaviors. Another possible limitation is that the current study did not control for cognitive ability when exploring the effects of cognitive intuition. We did not include measures of cognitive ability in the design since the current study focuses on irrationality, which is conceptually and theoretically distinct from measures of intelligence (e.g., Frederick, 2005; Stanovich, 2009 Future research should explore factors contributing to conspiracy beliefs. We believe that distrust in official institutions and related constructs such as political cynicism are the most promising candidates (see e.g., Brotherton et al., 2013; Swami et al., 2010 Swami et al., , 2011 ; there is already evidence that such constructs could be important for COVID-19 related conspiracy theories (Pavela Banai et al., 2020) . Importantly, the rapid proliferation of pandemic misinformation through social media (Depoux et al., 2020; Kouzy et al., 2020; Mian & Khan, 2020; Zarocostas, 2020) may also have the potential to substantially impact health outcomes.",

Our data, however, suggest that even beliefs relating to the origin of the virus are related to a weaker vaccination intention. This could be due to a more general assumption common to both phenomena: that key information, such as the truth about the harmfulness of vaccines or about the source of pandemic, is hidden from the general public and not included in the official narrative about it(Luki c et al., 2019;Wood et al., 2012).",

Therefore, it is unclear whether the relations observed between CRT and health-related behaviors reflect solely the inability to resist intuitive responses or more general limitations in cognitive capacity. Future studies should address this question.Finally, as we pointed out in the results, scores on the COVID-19 knowledge test were negatively skewed, indicating that the test was easy for the participants. This was likely due to heavy media coverage of COVID-19 at the time of the study and that people were continuously learning about the virus. In addition, although we tried to reach as a diverse sample of participants as possible by seeding the links to different social media groups, a probability sample representative of the population would certainly provide a greater variance in the objective knowledge measure; further, results obtained via snowballing recruitment are typically less generalizable than those obtained via probability recruitment(King et al., 2014). Nonetheless, despite these limitations, knowledge overestimation and other assessments included in our study revealed meaningful relations between irrational beliefs, namely conspiratorial thinking, and relevant health behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
