Here, for the first time, the association between Korean meteorological factors and air pollutants and the COVID-19 infection was investigated. Data of air pollutants, meteorological factors, and daily COVID-19 confirmed cases of seven metropolitan cities and nine provinces were obtained from 3 February 2020 to 5 May 2020 during the first wave of pandemic across Korea. We applied the generalized additive model to investigate the temporal relationship. There was a significantly nonlinear association between daily temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. Each 1\u00b0C increase in temperature was associated with 9% (lag 0-14; OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03-1.15) increase of COVID-19 confirmed cases when the temperature was below 8\u00b0C. A 0.01 ppm increase in NO 2 (lag 0-7, lag 0.14, and lag 0-21) was significantly associated with increases of COVID-19 confirmed cases, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.13 (1.02-1.25), 1.19 (1.09-1.30), and 1.30 (1.19-1.41), respectively. A 0.1 ppm increase in CO (lag 0-21) was associated with the increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.04-1.16). There was a positive association between per 0.001 ppm of SO 2 concentration (lag 0, lag 0-7, and lag 0-14) and COVID-19 confirmed cases, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.13 (1.04-1.22), 1.20 (1.11-1.31), and 1.15 (1.07-1.25), respectively. There were significantly temporal associations between temperature, NO 2 , CO, and SO 2 concentrations and daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea.",

From the epidemiological triad perspective, the capacity of virus infection depends on whether the environment is an advantage for its survival and transmission, and it also depends on the host susceptibility. 4, 5 Air pollution with respect to meteorological factors may have effects on the trends of the respiratory viral outbreak by altering the immunity of the host and the survival time of the virus. 6 Consequently, ambient air pollution may play some roles in the propensity to infection. Recent emerging evidence has shown that long term exposure to ambient air pollution might increase COVID-19 mortality. 7 In this study, we investigated the relationship between air pollutants, meteorological factors, and COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea.
