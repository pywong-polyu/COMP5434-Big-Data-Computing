In order to analyze infected patients directly, the clinical features of COVID-19 are only taken from confirmed symptomatic infected patients without considering the asymptomatic and suspected patients. The confirmed cases can be divided into mild cases, common cases, and severe cases because of their different clinical manifestations. Patients with mild symptoms are characterized by low-grade fever and mild fatigue. The most common features of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, cough, and bilateral distribution of ground-glass shadows under chest CT scan imaging (Ning et al., 2020) . In addition, some patients also exhibited runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea (Huang et al., 2020) . Symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxemia appeared in severe cases after a week onset, rapidly deteriorating into ARDS, septic shock, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ failure (Huang et al., 2020) .",

COVID-19 could be classified into colddampness epidemic (a disease caused by internal abundance of the cold-damp pestilential pathogen) (Zhao et al., 2021) . It is proposed that the direct cause of this disease is the invasion of evil Qi, and basic cause is the insufficiency of vital Qi, as well as the abnormal external environment at the end of 2019 (Zeng, 2020) . Referring from the epidemic, COVID-19 can be divided into four stages: the early stage with symptoms of cold-dampness evils attacking the lung and spleen, the middle stage with symptoms of cold-dampness evils obstructing the lung and spleen, the late stage with symptoms of cold-dampness evils closing the lung and injuring spleen, and the recovery stage with symptoms of Qideficiency of the lung and spleen (Zeng, 2020) . Ren et al. (2021) compared the corresponding pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the perspective of small-molecule drugs, which is also shown in Figure 1 . In the mild stage, SARS-CoV-2 replication occurred in the trachea, which may be incubated for 5-6 days (W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020) . After that, there is a mild symptom for 80% of infected patients, mainly including fever and dry cough, which disappeared spontaneously within 6-10 days (Li et al., 2020b; Chan et al., 2020) , whereas around 20% of patients developed viral infection from the trachea to the lungs (Li et al., 2020b) . SARS-CoV-2 binds with targets in alveolar epithelial cells such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and induces apoptosis response associated with vascular leakage (Dong et al., 2020) . This leakage causes the first wave of local inflammation and recruits immune cells from the blood into the lungs, thereby eliminating extracellular viruses and destroying infected cells . In this stage, the disease may rapidly develop into severe illness manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, multiple organ dysfunction, and septic shock (Perico et al., 2021) . During the recovery stage, it is reported that some patients still have clinical manifestations such as cough, fatigue, poor appetite, and abnormal mood, which need more time to be recovered completely. In terms of the comprehensive contrastive analysis, herbal medicines have a similar treating process with small-molecule drugs.",

In such a case, we borrowed the idea from drug repurposing to mining potential therapeutic herbal formulas by developing a collaborative filtering approach. Drug repurposing is the strategy that given drugs with a known mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics can be considered the priori knowledge of a specific domain. When the potential effects of the known drug are discovered, it makes the drug more effective and safer to be used, without having to start from scratch.",

Geometric complementarity is the match in shape between molecules, and energy complementarity is the analysis of the interaction forces between molecules. Molecular docking can be used to predict the binding conformation of small molecules of compounds in biological macromolecules and their binding ability, and plays an important role in the study of protein-ligand interaction mechanisms and structure-based computer-aided herbal medicine design (Khodair et al., 2021) . To date, this method is still used for rapid screening of compounds from a compound library containing thousands of compounds, saving significant time and cost for herbal medicine discovery and development (Ewing and Kuntz, 2015) . Therefore, in this study, the molecular docking technique is chosen to synthesize the binding conformation between molecules.",

Therefore, the most important problem faced is how to evaluate the binding strength between docked molecules. In this study, we combine certain advantages of knowledge potential and empirical scoring functions for derivation, extracting empirical information from conformational preferences and experimental affinity measurements of receptors and ligands, and thus deriving a scoring function for the binding affinity of herbal medicine compounds and SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
