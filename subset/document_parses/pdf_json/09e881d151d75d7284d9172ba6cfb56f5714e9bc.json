            "text": "Background Repair of a ventral hernia is increasingly being performed by a laparoscopic approach despite lack of good long term follow up data on outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the long term performance of a polyester mesh and to assess its elastic properties in patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Methods All patients being assessed for a ventral hernia repair between August 2011 and November 2013 were placed on a prospective database. Those undergoing laparoscopic repair with a polyester mesh were seen at clinic at one month and one year, while their electronic records were assessed at 34 months (range 24-48 months) and 104 months (range 92-116 months). In addition, CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis performed for any reason on these patients during the follow up period were reviewed by a consultant gastrointestinal radiologist. Mechanical failure testing of the mesh was also performed. Results Thirty-two of the 100 patients assessed for ventral hernia repair had a laparoscopic repair with a polyester mesh. Nineteen (59%) had CT scans performed during the follow-up period. No recurrence was recorded at 34 months, while three (9.4%) had a recurrence at 104 months. Two had central breakdown of the mesh at 81 and 90 months, while 1 presented acutely at 116 months after operation. Mesh had stretched across the defect by an average of 21% (range 5.7-40%) in nine patients. Mechanical testing showed that this mesh lost its elasticity at low forces ranging between 1.8 and 3.2 N/cm. Conclusion This study shows that late recurrence is a problem following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with polyester mesh. The mesh loses it elasticity at a low force. This combined with degradation of mesh seems the most likely cause of failure. This is unlikely to be a unique problem of polyester mesh and further long-term studies are required to better assess this operative approach to ventral hernia repair.",

Degradation of the mesh over time, combined with stretching, seems a more logical explanation of the late recurrence seen in our study. A study by Riepe et al. examining the in vivo hydrolysis of polyester vascular grafts demonstrated that hydrolytic degradation of polyester reduced their bursting pressure by 31.4% at 10 years [7] . Degradation is obviously observed for all mesh products and is likely to weaken the mesh over time so that rupture force is considerably less than it was de novo [8] [9] [10] . Differential outcome for different meshes have been observed following both open and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair [2, 4, 11] . Generally lightweight meshes break and give rise to early recurrence. There is some evidence that suturing a defect rather than just bridging it reduces early recurrence [1] . However, closing the defect was not performed in this study and yet all recurrences were seen after 5 years.",

            "text": "This study shows that late recurrence is a problem following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with polyester mesh. The mesh loses it elasticity at a low force. This combined with degradation of polyester mesh seems the most likely cause of failure. This is unlikely to be a unique problem of polyester mesh and further long-term studies are required to better assess this operative approach to ventral hernia repair.",
