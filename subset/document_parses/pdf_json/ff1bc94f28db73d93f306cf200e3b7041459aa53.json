            "text": "The low crude oil prices in 2019 add momentum to Nigeria's need for economic diversification as its foreign earnings come primarily from crude oil sales. As a result, Nigeria is seeking to explore other economic potentials, such as developing a Mining Resource Corridor (MRC) to reduce poverty and assist the country's sustained growth and development. MRCs catalyse mineral extraction, transportation, processing, and infrastructural development and integrate other sectors of the economy, thus, creating jobs and promoting economic diversification and inclusive growth. However, achieving this requires drawing up an articulated delivery mechanism through a framework strategic implementation plan to attain a strategic diversification away from hydrocarbons to minerals. This article takes an applied research approach to examine the critical considerations and actions that Nigeria should take in developing an MRC to ensure a diverse and sustainable economic future. Additionally, it discusses the lessons Nigeria can learn from two corridors in Mozambique. This study notes that the success of a MRC is a function of, among other things, a skilled and adequately strengthened institution, enabling infrastructure and the participation of communities in the decision-making process of the corridor development. It also includes the support of all levels of government and possible assistance from development partners and donor agencies such as the World Bank.",

One way of achieving it in a mono-economy like Nigeria is by developing a MRC and upscaling access to its mineral resources. A MRC has the potential to assist Nigeria in diversifying the economy through mineral extraction, processing and transportation, infrastructural development, and possible sectoral integration and connection with other regional corridors. This could, in turn, create jobs and promote inclusive growth and development. For instance, since the mining sector is important to the country's development objectives (MMSD, 2016) , a MRC will aid the sector's resurgence. Nigeria is endowed with various mineral resources, like gold, iron ore, coal, bitumen, baryte, lead-zinc, limestone, copper, lithium, and many other minerals and metals (Olade, 2019) . These minerals provide options for economic diversification and sustainable development through a MRC. Previously, mining contributed a higher percentage of economic output before the sectorial dominance of the hydrocarbon sector in Nigeria in the 1950s and 1960s (Chete et al., 2017) .",

They also can result in spatial exclusions, thus making it necessary to use a new mobility paradigm to avoid spatial exclusion, immobility, and uneven and conflicting mobilities in new corridor routes (Enns, 2018) . Furthermore, as was the case with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, security challenges can halt the development process due to armed militia and terrorist groups (Ahmad et al., 2020) .

They optimise the use of hard infrastructure built by or with the support of an anchor project to support other sectors through further investments, such as building feeder roads to help develop agricultural projects. Cameron (2016) notes that a RC's objective should be to respond to a country's needs from an extractive perspective. Thus, it should enable the use of significant commercial extractive investments and their need for infrastructure, goods, and services as an anchor for more wide-ranging economic growth and diversification. RC thrives on transport investments such as port, rail, and road, stimulating additional economic activity, thereby creating corridors alongside extractive-related infrastructure.

However, the extraction of gold would require the creation of roads and access to vast amounts of water. Other key factors for consideration when selecting the RC location include the existing routes and corridors, anchor projects and their locations, potential policy and regulatory constraints, and the capacity to promote, integrate, and encourage trade. Further, a country should evaluate the RC's impact on the communities along the route to alleviate their plight. They should also look into the potential for small, medium, and micro-enterprise development via existing agricultural supply chains (Mtegha et al., 2012) .",

The MDC also provides another example. It had a deficiency in community engagement at the planning stage and a lack of political will in creating the local capacity to manage the MDC process or involve the broader community and local levels of governance (Roodt, 2008) .

The first record of a mined mineral was tin ore by the Royal Niger Company in 1905 (Hodder, 1959) . Through the years, several minerals, like coal, gold, bitumen, baryte, lead-zinc, and limestone, have been extracted by both artisanal and industrial miners (Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, 2015). The period has also experienced the enactment of an indigenisation decree causing large-scale withdrawal of foreign investment in the industry and a downturn in production (Ministry of Mines and Steel Development (MMSD), 2016). Thus, the bulk of mining operations by the private sector rested on small-scale indigenous miners' shoulders, leading to production decline, particularly in the metallic minerals starting in the late 1970s.",

These corridors will facilitate the transportation of minerals from extraction to processing points, primarily as transport and other infrastructures exist in these states. Ramdoo (2015) pointed out the lack of proper transportation infrastructure in the regional competitiveness of the cement industry, even though the government adopted a \"backward integration policy\" to facilitate its growth. However, where the odds favour a central corridor, Ajaokuta in Kogi State should serve as the country's central corridor due to its steel rolling mill. It also connects the Lagos-Abuja-Kano rail line that can link the Lagos-Dakar transport route. The planned revival of the steel plant also gives Ajaokuta an advantage (CSL Stockbrokers, 2020).",

Therefore, it is essential to ensure an enabling regulatory environment exists, which requires thorough environmental impact assessments to construct corridor infrastructure (Mitchell, 1998) . Furthermore, environmental considerations must be appraised holistically and not merely on a project basis.

It also evidences the trade-off many governments may need to make when a third party heavily invests in a corridor project, namely, an integrated user concession. This occurs when one company is responsible for extraction and transport to market and requires separate ownership of the mines and the transport infrastructure. Vale purchased a majority share in the NC concession in Mozambique, despite the then government of Mozambique's general position that railway concessions should be independent of mines (Maennling et al., 2014) . Possible reasons for this relaxation and trade-off could be the complexity of the project crossing Malawi and the difficulty of finding an investor with the necessary financial backing willing to make the significant investment.",

For example, the Zambezi Valley Corridor (ZVDC) had security issues directly affecting the usage of the railway line, causing many mining companies to stop using the Sena railway line. The ZVDC also contains lessons for countries when entering into regional agreements. The Mozambiquan government largely governs and coordinates the ZVDC. However, the governments of Zambia and Malawi could have been partners in both the ZVDC and NC, as opposed to signing a tripartite agreement for the Nacala line, and indeed this would have been more beneficial for them. The partnership would have unlocked the export capacity within the countries, especially Malawi.

Again, the country's size and the need to eliminate possible risks emanating from regional corridors favours a domestic corridor at this stage in Nigeria. A domestic corridor will assist Nigeria to build on its internal strengths, sustain the economy, prepare its institutions and governance structures, establish the relevant laws, and stabilise its infrastructural capacity before considering regional corridors. Finally, Nigeria's current security challenges do not support a regional corridor. Insurgents, Boko Haram, bandits, and kidnappers along the corridor route will discourage other countries from active participation in the corridor activities, thus undermining the potential of the corridor. At the right time, Nigeria should take advantage of existing regional synergies across the Gulf of Guinea through the ECOWAS network to connect with other countries, if desirable. Regional corridors are open to international crises, different regulatory regimes, external shocks, and other countries' internal security risks. Due to Nigeria's geographic position, there is no need for regional corridors to create the shortest route to a port, a likely option for many extractive operations. Suppose Nigeria wishes to create a regional corridor; it should ensure clarity where there is a gap or a difference in regulation in different countries. Parties should also enter into a written agreement to guide corridor activities. These agreements must cover the development of the corridor and the allocation of institutional and regulatory responsibilities. Issues such as border management, third party access to the corridor infrastructure, tariff, and pricing mechanisms and controls over the regulatory environment must be decided and reduced to writing.

This can be seen from the regions connected by the Maputo Development Corridor (MDC), Mtwara Development Corridor Tanzania, the Lamu Port South Sudan Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor, the Nacala Corridor in Mozambique, for instance. However, the development of a MRC requires careful planning to be successful and achieve the desired outcomes. Nigeria can draw lessons from the successes and challenges of corridors within Mozambique in planning and implementing its MRC, as discussed in the \"Lessons from Resource Corridors in Mozambique\" section. This research has identified some key lessons Nigeria can learn from Mozambique in the \"Applying the lessons to the Nigerian context\" section, including social, environmental, and governance lessons in designing and planning the project. As such, there is a need for multi-stakeholder engagement. The success of any corridor depends on the political will and support of all levels of government. More so, developing a suitable national plan, in conjunction with civil society and communities, will enable Nigeria to leverage MRC to tap into its abundant mineral resources for economic diversification.",
