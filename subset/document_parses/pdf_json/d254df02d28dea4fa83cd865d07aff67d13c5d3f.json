Serum samples, as well as the initial inoculum, were deep-sequenced and a viral quasi-species was constructed per sample. For the first experiment, the results consistently reported a reduction in the quasi-species diversity after a transmission event, pointing to the existence of bottlenecks during PRRSV1 transmission. However, despite the identified preferred and un-preferred transmitted variants not being randomly distributed along the virus genome, it was not possible to identify any variant producing a structural change in any viral protein. In contrast, the mutations identified in GP2, nsp9 and M of the second experiment pointed to changes in the amino acid charges and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase structure.

Most often, the source of excretion, the route of transmission, the portal of entry and the minimum infective dose, when known, are common features to characterize transmission. However, it is increasingly evident that transmission is an extremely complex phenomenon; for example, the existence of bottlenecks during hostto-host transmission [1] . A bottleneck can be defined as a sharp reduction in size (population bottleneck) or diversity (genetic bottleneck) in a population. Focusing on pathogen transmission, the existence of such bottlenecks must be examined with consideration to the portal of entry in the recipient host and the pathogen source (blood, nasal secretion, faeces, etc.). Since a pathogen may be present in different tissues, organs, or fluids, each one might be considered a compartment with its own particularities. The pathogen population contained in the compartments where the transmission to the next host occurs is termed transmissible population; whereas the successful infectors in the recipient host are called founder variants or transmission founders. The location, size, and genetic diversity of the transmissible population can influence the founder population after a transmission event [2] [3] [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 456, "end": 459, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1341, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1345, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1349, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Successful transmission founders can be thought of as either the result of a non-selective bottleneck-the particles that crossed by chance the portal of entry-, Open Access *Correspondence: marti.cortey@uab.cat 1 Departament de Sanitat i d' Anatomia Animals, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, 08193 Cerdanyola del Vall\u00e8s, Spain Full list of author information is available at the end of the article or viewed as a selective bottleneck, where only the variants fit enough to cross the portal of entry are transmitted. In the case of RNA viruses, which exist as quasi-species, these different scenarios could imply very different outcomes. On the one hand, a nondirectional unspecific bottleneck would produce a new quasi-species cloud from randomly selected variants.

Due to its massively parallel approach, NGS generates millions of reads that cover every nucleotide position. Hence, low-frequency variants within viral quasi-species can be adequately detected and characterized [29] and it is possible to see variations that, although significant, would remain unnoticed using Sanger sequencing. However, the usefulness of NGS for viral diversity estimations depends crucially on the quality of the sample and on the procedure to prepare it [30] . In the present work we applied a tailor-made NGS method to characterize the diversity of PRRSV quasi-species without the need of primers. The method omitted the PCR amplification step and used instead a single passage in PAM when needed because of the low amount of virus present in many of the samples. By using PAM, the same cells that support viral replication in the host, a low bias was generated in a single passage, and the error rate produced was also very low. This approach could be useful for other viruses that cannot be analysed directly by NGS from biological samples because of the low titres present. As stated, virus populations may face bottlenecks during the infection cycle [1] . When transmission takes place through a mucosal portal of entry, infection is usually initiated by a limited number of viral particles compared to the total number of particles reaching that portal [4] . Besides population bottlenecks, there are many examples of extreme genetic bottlenecks in RNA viruses such as HIV (see reviews by [4, 31] , HCV [32] [33] [34] and Simian immunodeficiency virus [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 334, "end": 338, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 597, "end": 601, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1301, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1502, "end": 1505, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1641, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1645, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1652, "end": 1656, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1661, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1666, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1701, "end": 1705, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In most of the experimentally inoculated pigs and the animals infected in a quasi-natural way by contact with infected seeder pigs, viral diversity was reduced during transmission, supporting the existence of a bottleneck during PRRSV infection. The nature of such a bottleneck is more difficult to determine. The changes in the nucleotide diversity were not scattered randomly across the viral genome but focused in a few targets. Beforehand, one could think that the structural proteins interacting with the target cells would be the most affected ones, since they are the first interacting with the mucosa surface. Interestingly, this was the case with GP5, the viral glycoprotein establishing the first interaction with porcine sialoadhesin, one of the viral receptors on the macrophage surface [36] . The preferentially transmitted variant introduced a change in position 36 favouring an Asp, a more acidic amino acid. It is difficult to interpret this result, but it is located close to a potential glycosylation site and adjacent to the neutralization epitope in GP5 [37] . It is tempting to hypothesize a potential increased interaction between GP5 and sialoadhesin favoured by the higher polarity of the 36-Asp variant. It is also worth noting that all but one of the other favoured changes affected non-structural proteins, pointing towards the selection of variants with different replication characteristics, although the result of the precise amino acid changes could not be ascertained from the literature.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1078, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "After the initial diversity reduction during the transmission event, the viral diversity of the circulating quasispecies increased in most cases, as expected in an initial expansion of a viral population in a na\u00efve animal.

In the present work, the duration of the viraemia was correlated with the titres of neutralizing antibodies against the virus; LV pig titres ranged between 2 and 3 log2, while the observed values for SV pigs moved between 4 and 6 log2 [10] . Therefore, beforehand, main changes were expected to be located in potential targets for the neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies for PRRSV have been reported to be induced by GP2, GP3, GP4, GP5 and M proteins [16, 38] . In the present case most of the changes in SV occurred in nsp9, followed by ORF2 that encodes GP2 (Figure 3 ). The 3D modelling of nsp9 (RdRp, Figure 4 ) showed that the introduction of a 387-Gly-His after mutations in the three nucleotides of the codon, produced a change in the folding of the protein, from linear to \u03b1-helix. This change resulted in the absence of a positively charged group opposite to the site of union of Mg 2+ , and would probably cause a modification in the electrostatic forces involved in the interaction with the NTP channel. It can be hypothesized that such a change would affect the efficiency of RNA synthesis; thus resulting in lower expression of the viral epitopes as a mechanism of escape.

In the present study, for SV pigs, the mutation 10-Asp introduced a negative charge close to the residue 8-Cys that establishes a disulphide bond with the residue 50-Cys of GP5 [42] . GP5 and M form a heterodimer that interacts with heparan sulphate during PRRSV attachment; and later on, with sialoadhesin during the internalization of the virus [36, 43, 44] . The disruption of this bond correlated with the loss of viral infectivity in other members of the Arteriviridae family, such as Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus [45] and Equine arteritis virus [46] . The negative charge present in 10-Asp (SV) may interfere in the disulphide bond between GP5 and M. Therefore, potential weaker interactions with heparan-sulphate and sialoadhesin may be induced in the variants present in SV pigs.

The lower antibody titres in the LV group probably prevented those changes from being positively selected, and the major variants present in the initial inoculum remained the commonest. In contrast, changes in 106 of GP5 seem to be common to all analysed animals. It was proposed that T-cell responses contributed to partial levels of cross-protection in PRRSV, and therefore, the changes observed in nsp9 could be seen as escape variants [49] , or as a means of escaping by producing very low levels of antigen. Potential T-cell epitopes for PRRSV have been proposed for nsp9 [50] , as well as for the RdRp of other Nidovirales [51, 52] . It could be conjectured that those changes in nsp9, GP2 and M may result in less efficient viral variants for, either interaction with the cell receptor, or replication. This scenario would imply that in animals with higher levels of immunity, the variants escaping the immune system would not be fit enough to maintain a viable quasi-species cloud, and consequently, the viral population would collapse. Accordingly, nsp9, GP2 and M would be clear targets for new vaccine development. These results highlight the importance of the immune system of the host, and specifically the neutralizing antibodies, to efficiently combat and clear PRRSV infection.
