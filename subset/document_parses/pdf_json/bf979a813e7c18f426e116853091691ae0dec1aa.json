This increases the volume and dimension of data being maintained. However, they store their data in their data servers or in cloud environment. Such data have been used to generate various intelligence to support various problems. To support such analysis process, different data have been used and the big data comes to play in this part. Optimizing techniques to help improve the process of ETL could greatly help in real-time analysis of data. ETL optimization could be achieved through several factors simplest being increasing the frequency of the process. Other ways to achieve optimization are through the use of various architectures, programming models, intelligence in transformation and security. To improve the performance of ETL, an efficient dynamic multi-variant relational intelligent ETL framework has been presented in this article. The distributed approach maintains various ontology's and data dictionaries which have been dynamically updated by different threads of ETL process. Initially, the process is start by applying the extraction process which extracts the data from different sources and finds set of dimensions and their characteristics. Such data extracted have been verified over the data dictionary. Further, the relational score has been measured for each data source with the existing one. Similarly, the method computes the value of multi-variant relational similarity (MVRS) for the data obtained from a single source. This will be performed by different threads of ETL process. According to the value of MVRS, the method performs map reduce and merging of data. According to the value of MVRS the method selects the data node and merges the data to store in the data warehouse. The threads of ETL are capable of reading the changes in data dictionaries and ontology's to iterate the process of transformation and loading. The method improves the performance of ETL with least time complexity and higher performance.",

The ultimate aim of maintaining such big data is to generate different intelligence from the data. For example, when the data are related to the purchase histories (Nagarajan et al. 2015) of any E-commerce system, then it can be used to generate intelligence towards the business growth or the sale of different products.

However, the volume of data being increased at each fraction which would challenge the data analyst in generating different intelligence from the big data available. The extract transform loading (ETL) has been identified as a key concept in modern big data environment where the data are heterogeneous. It helps to move the source data from transactional database to analytical database for analysis. The ETL process involves in extraction process which extracts data from various sources and converts them to the meaningful form. Similarly, transforming is the processes of changing the data to specific form and performs map reduce process. Loading is the process of moving the data to the warehouse. Extraction is responsible to access various sources in order to extract the selected data intended to analysis purpose. To be standardized, data are then processed by a huge number of transforming (T) tasks (cleansing, filtering, converting, merging, splitting, conforming, aggregation, etc.) . Finally, the loading (L) tasks are in charge of loading the prepared data in the data warehouse (DW).",

Different medical organizations would maintain the same in different form and each would maintain additional data. Also, the organizations would keep and maintain the data in various structures. This increases the complexity of ETL process and challenges the entire problem of knowledge transformation to support various decisive support systems.
