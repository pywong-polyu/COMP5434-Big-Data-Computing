SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were negative in the CSF on day 1 and in her blood on day 2 after admission. SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G was present in the blood on day 5 after admission. Oligoclonal bands in blood and CSF were negative, and CSF antibodies, including anti-aquaporin-4, anti-myelin basic protein, anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein, autoimmune encephalitis, and paraneoplastic syndrome, were negative. Six nasal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification performed at different times during hospitalization were negative. HIV, autoimmune vasculitis, anticardiolipin, and anti-nuclear antibody tests of blood were all negative. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal signals in the bilateral temporal cortex ( Fig. 1a-h) . Repeat brain MRI on day 10 showed an increased number of lesions, which were more striking in appearance ( Fig. 1i-l) ; the lesions were improved by day 15 (Fig. 1m-p) . The patient was administered intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone 2 g/days for 12 days and acyclovir 1.5 g/days for 16 days. Her headache, low-grade fever, and muscle aches were relieved while undergoing during treatment, although her poor memory persisted. She had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure 1 week after admission. An electroencephalogram showed epileptiform waves. She was immediately administered IV diazepam 10 mg and oral levetiracetam 1 g/ days, with no seizure recurrence. She was administered IV immunoglobulin 20 g/days for 5 days starting on day 11, and her MMSE scores improved to 29/30 on day 15. On a visit 1 month after discharge, she felt no discomfort, and a repeat MRI showed complete resolution of brain lesions.",

ADEM following vaccination is a well-known entity and is, hence, not surprising following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In this case, a protective antibody was produced after vaccination. MRI typically shows reversible, large (> 1-2 cm), bilateral, white matter lesions, and deep gray matter lesions of the brain. CSF analysis may reveal a mild pleocytosis and elevated protein levels, but it is generally negative for intrathecal oligoclonal immunoglobulin G synthesis [2] . Systemic corticosteroids are firstline therapy [5] , and patients have an excellent response to gamma-globulin [6] .",

            "text": "MRI studies during hospitalization. Day 2 after hospitalization: T2-weighted imaging (WI; a arrow), diffusion-WI (b arrow), contrast-enhanced MRI (c), and MR angiography (d) show no obvious abnormality. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR, e-h, arrows) imaging shows hyperintense signals, while T1-WI (e) shows low signals in the bilateral temporal cortices. Day 10 after hospitalization: repeat FLAIR imaging (i-l, arrows) reveals an increase in the number of lesions and their more striking appearance. Day 15 after hospitalization: repeat FLAIR imaging (m-p, arrows) shows an improvement in the lesions vaccination, although it is a possibility. Patients with CNS findings should be enquired about recent vaccinations for a quick and accurate diagnosis to initiate treatment and prevent serious sequelae.
