Of these users, 29 million (54% of the population) actively used Facebook [1] . Facebook is the most popular social network across the world and allows users to be connected to each other to receive global information on different topics and to generate a comparison between different ideologies. According to the Facebook Report for the second quarter of 2020, there were, on average, 1.79 billion active users daily as of June 30 [2] . The Ottawa Paper, published in 1986 by the WHO, encouraged health institutions to play an active role in health promotion and scientific advances, as well as in the provision of diagnostic-therapeutic activities. The purpose of this universal declaration was to favor the process that allows people to increase their control of and improve their health status [3] . Social networks allow one to reach a wide range of the population, with whom it is also possible to establish a bidirectional interaction, therefore representing a valid tool for health promotion [4, 5] .",

Hospitals are certainly authoritative sources of health information, especially because they can communicate through the field the experience of their doctors and nurses [10] , as apparent during the lockdown period (9 March to 18 May 2020) and the beginning of the second epidemiological wave, in which in Italy generated an extraordinary demand for health information through the use of web search engines and social media. Hospital Facebook pages could also contribute to the dissemination of communication campaigns promoted by the Ministry of Health, and by monitoring interactions with the public, it will be possible to expand the knowledge of the health needs of the population and to subsequently adapt the healthcare that is on offer [11] .",

A Microsoft Excel dataset was constructed using the data extracted for all the official hospital Facebook pages (Supplementary Materials). The extraction of data was performed manually by two people (the first and fourth authors), and no computer tools have been used. This data was cross-sectional in nature. Considering the possibility of a dependent operator error, the acquired data were subsequently revised through a comparison of the data reported in the dataset with the screenshots taken at the time of collection. In creating the dataset, the hospitals were divided into two groups: Public hospitals (n = 709) and private hospitals (n = 643). In Italy, healthcare is public and refers to the inspiring principles of the Beveridge model, provided by public and private playersthe latter represented by corporations. The public group is made up of four subcategories: Hospitals, A.O.U. (university hospitals), I.R.C.C.S. (scientific hospitalization and treatment institutes), and hospital presidiums. In the private group, on the contrary, there are six subcategories: accredited nursing homes, authorized nursing homes, I.R.C.C.S., classified hospitals (generally religious hospitals), university hospitals, and hospitals.",

The pages of individual operating units belonging to a hospital organization were also excluded from the sampling. The data obtained from the observation of all the pages found on the social network were gradually archived in a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel).

Page activity is described as the average, in days, of time intervals between the most recent and the penultimate posts, and that which is between the penultimate and the third-to-last post (time interval between the survey date and the most recent published post and the time interval between the first and third most recent posts). The number of likes differs slightly from the number of followers of the hospital pages, given that there is a difference in meaning, where the first indicates the satisfaction with the page of users and is a subset of the second value, which, instead, indicates the total number of users who follow the social page.",

The analysis continued with contingency tables and chi-square tests to analyze the association between the qualitative variables, such as the type of facility and the type of hospital management with respect to the presence of an official Facebook page. Three-dimensional bar graphs and scatterplots are also shown to visualize the activity of the hospitals during the months of May and October 2020. The analysis ended with a Kruskal-Wallis test to detect differences in the number of followers by type of management and geographic area. Figure 1 shows the percentage of hospitals that have a Facebook profile compared to the total number of hospitals for each region, and it is clear that there are some regions far behind, such as Valle d'Aosta, Molise, and Calabria (0-0.11%), while regions such as Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, and Campania have the highest rates (0.45-0.35%). In all geographic areas, the number of private hospitals that have an official page is approximately equal to those that do not have a Facebook profile; on the contrary, there is a big difference between public hospitals that have a Facebook page compared to those that do not, and this difference is very evident in hospitals in the north of Italy ( Figure 2 ).

Considering the total list of hospitals in Italy (n = 1351), 708 in the public sector, and 643 in the private sector, it was found that 28% (n = 379) have an official Facebook page. The distribution of the official hospital pages is as follows: 20.6% (n = 78) public hospitals and 79.4% (n = 301) private hospitals (Table 1) . ",

As aforementioned, there was no substantial difference in the frequency of publications between May and October 2020. This is also confirmed by Figure 5 , in which the gray dots represent the hospitals that did not publish any posts in either May or in October (30%); meanwhile, the yellow dots (53%) indicate the hospitals that did not change their publication frequency during the two months, the red dots show the hospitals that published less in October than in May (11%), and the green dots highlight the hospitals that posted more frequently in October than in May (6%).

In fact, the hospital clinicians will be the main providers of correct, precise, and validated scientific data. Patients, also aware of the close collaboration between patient associations and hospital clinicians, will be reassured and will not be easy prey to fake news or information of poor quality and reliability [14] , often contradictory and lacking in scientific evidence and they can be exposed to various risks [21] . In fact, hospitals represent a source of reliable information, validated and shared by the scientific community, and based on Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) [25, 26] . Therefore, by optimizing the Health Messages on Facebook pages about diseases, treatments, and doctors, many users will be able to find the correct information before planning a visit [27] , as well as being able to more easily follow the doctor's recommendations and stick to the proposed treatment plan, especially if patients become part of a social media support group [28, 29] . Several research studies related to health have evaluated the effectiveness of this communication strategy by using social networks [30, 31] . There are good examples of social care providers. A noteworthy case is that of Mayo Clinic, engaged in the management of dozens of hospitals in the US and which through various social accounts on various platforms is constantly engaged in disease awareness and prevention. Also, on an international level, the National Cancer Institute [32] and the WHO [33] are also excellent examples of how you can communicate with social networks. Among the Italian institutions, AIFA is actively engaged in the use of social networks for communication to the public [34] . Finally, among the Italian hospitals, it has managed to build a strong presence on social media and in the Emilia Romagna region. The University hospital-Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi has distinguished itself as a virtuous example for its health care social media marketing strategy, achieved in just 4 years (from 2016 to 2020) from the opening of its Facebook page, to involve over 105,000 followers, organically, through an emotional communication based on storytelling, which has given life to a loyal community, promoting the \"connection\" as a \"point of relationship\" between clinicians and patients [35] .",

According to the results based on the total number of hospitals in Italy (n = 1352; 709 in the public sector and 643 of the private sector), only 28% (n = 379) had official Facebook fan pages. Of these, 20.6% were public hospitals (n = 78) and 79.4% were private hospitals (n = 301). Of those hospitals with a Facebook page, 59% (n = 224) of them were accredited to nursing homes. Nearly half of the hospitals with a Facebook page (49.1%, n = 171) use social media every week, with public hospitals posting the most. Emilia-Romagna was the region identified as having the highest percentage of hospitals with an official Facebook page. However, there were differences relating to the frequency of publication among the hospitals. These differences were evident not so much for the type of structure or the geographical area, but for the type of management (public or private). In fact, more public (34.5%) than private hospitals (5.2%) tended to publish several posts on their official Facebook page, typically daily or weekly. The frequency of the publication of posts relating to COVID-19 was also higher in the public than in the private sector, dedicating more than 50% of the posts to information relating to COVID-19. However, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no substantial differences in terms of creating new Facebook pages for those hospitals that did not have them or between the increase in the number of posts published in the periods of May and October 2020. The non-parametric statistical analysis of the number of followers did not show any significant differences between the types of structure or types of management. There was a significant difference only in the central-south comparison (p < 0.01) in terms of followers. More followers visited the pages of those structures that update their Facebook pages more frequently through the publication of informative posts, and these structures receive more \"likes\" than those of other structures that update their pages less. All of the Facebook fan pages are freely available via the Internet with a Facebook account.",

            "text": "Our study shows some limitations. First, social media is dynamic, as the number of \"likes\" registered, the number of followers, the interactions between users, the views, and the number of posts published in the last month, and social media accounts are subject to continuous change over time. Collecting data over a longer period could allow us to perform a more in-depth analysis and examine trends in Facebook-based hospitalgenerated content. In fact, another limitation of our research is that we did not assess the issues addressed in the posts published by the hospitals, the differences between hospitals in terms of the types of content they publish on their Facebook pages, and the relationship between the topic covered in the publication and the patient satisfaction rate in response to the different information provided on the hospital pages. Understanding user involvement is important because it can transform one-way information dissemination activities into two-way communication processes. In this way, platforms such as Facebook could add value to the activities of health organizations and to the dissemination of information essential for promoting the well-being of the community. Second, we observed that several hospitals did not present an official Facebook page, but departments within those hospitals had created their own fan page as a tool to disseminate information related to health and progress in specific fields. These specialized pages, with their content, frequently being updated, their involving users in research activities, and their providing information regarding the services offered and the goals achieved, have increased the number of \"likes\" and shares among users. However, these pages were not considered in this work due to their representation of the entire hospital, which resulted in the loss of important data. Third, we were unable to examine the factors that could affect the content generation process in terms of who is responsible for publishing content on Facebook pages, managing resources, and overseeing the administration duties. In particular, it would be interesting to observe how the content provider affects the type of content shared, the way it is shared, and the resulting level of user engagement. Ultimately, this can affect the overall effectiveness of healthcare organizations' activities on Facebook and other social media platforms. Fourth, in our research, it was not possible to examine users' Facebook profiles by collecting information on their gender, race, age, interests, content, and favorite topics, as they were not publicly available. Furthermore, it was not possible to evaluate some statistical data, as they were not publicly available, such as the number of accounts reached, the number of views, user interactions with content, the weekly increase in followers, and, above all, the relationship between the frequency of publications and the percentage of users interested in the information provided on the hospital Facebook pages. Without these data, we cannot know if the number of \"likes\" was related to the quality of the information produced and/or shared by the hospital, and the users' satisfaction rate. The frequency with which a page publishes content, allows them to reach an increasingly vast and heterogeneous audience, influencing the levels of engagement of users on social networks. Furthermore, the number of \"likes\" a page receives is not necessarily related to the level of use of the information provided by hospitals, and patients do not often choose a hospital based on the information on Facebook pages. In fact, patients tend to choose hospitals for their care based on the previous experiences of family or friends. Furthermore, the period in which a page was created could affect the number of followers and total \"likes,\" as older pages would have had more time to increase their numbers. Therefore, further studies should be conducted and other possible benefits of social media for healthcare professionals and users should be evaluated.",

Despite the popularity of Facebook, Italian hospitals are still lagging behind in their use of Facebook, not only as a simple and useful tool for promoting public health but also as a tool with which to counter or limit fake news in medicine [42] . In fact, during the COVID-19 health emergency, much fake news and real disinformation campaigns on coronavirus were spread, highlighting the primary role of hospitals in publishing accurate, useful, and scientifically accredited information. Consider that, between April and June 2020, 7 million posts spreading disinformation on coronavirus were removed, while another 98 million posts were labeled as unreliable on the same topic, even if it was not possible to remove them because the violations of the guidelines were not such as to justify this measure [43] .",

Many hospitals, still, do not seem to be making good use of social media [44] . The associations of health professionals, in concert with public health bodies, should coordinate so that guidelines [30, 31] and recommendations are adopted for the correct use of social media in the health sector.

Likewise, public hospitals have always published more posts related to the COVID-19. Finally, it should be noted that there are no significant differences between public and private management structures in terms of the number of \"likes\" and followers. These results suggest that it would be advisable, especially for private hospitals, to have a communications office coordinated by a Social Media Manager, whose dedicated multidisciplinary staff are able to frequently disseminate useful, updated, and scientifically accredited information in the health sector. This approach would make it possible to reduce disinformation, especially in times of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 emergency, and to generate greater trust in patients. The reasons for the use and nonuse of Facebook by both hospitals and patients require further investigation. In order to achieve and maintain a high-quality level of health, it is necessary to aim for the correct provision of health information, the implementation of public health interventions, and greater patient engagement by the involvement of the community and the activity of the page with numerous initiatives and events for the general public [46] . Additionally, the hospitals should also dedicate sections to research and development activities on their social profiles, including the sharing of scientific publications, in order to allow patients to get informed on the innovative approaches they could have access to at that hospital [47] . Finally, a constant updating of social networks would lead to greater user involvement by reducing disinformation that often places the health and scientific environment in a bad light [48, 49] . In fact, considering, in recent years, the average age of those who use Facebook, the use of social networks for precise and timely health information could bring the older generations of the population closer and closer [50] .",
