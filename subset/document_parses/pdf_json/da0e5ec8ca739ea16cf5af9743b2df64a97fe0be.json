The risk of being infected with micro-organisms increases among the frail and the vulnerable elderly population as their immunity system begins to deteriorate. Furthermore, the residents in RCHs are at high risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) due to the confined living environments and individual comorbidities. In relation to this, infection control practice (ICP) is considered a crucial and effective approach in preventing HAIs. This study aimed to observe the daily ICP of healthcare workers in RCH settings.",

ICP aims to prevent the risk of disease transmission by contact with blood, bodily fluid, mucous membranes, and nonintact skin. This implies that compliance with ICP is closely related to the risk of HAIs, yet empirical studies have shown that ICP compliance is suboptimal among healthcare practitioners in different countries [1, 12, 13] . However, most of the ICP compliance studies have focused on the hospital setting. To date, studies on ICP compliance among healthcare workers in RCHs in Hong Kong are limited, and the ICP has yet to be fully documented in this setting.",

According to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, the population over 65 is estimated to increase from 17% in 2016 to 37% in 2066. Meanwhile, epidemiologic studies mentioned that the elderly tend to have worse complications if they sustain infections. The frail and vulnerable elderly populations in RCHs are easily infected with micro-organisms. Moreover, the residents in RCHs are at high risk of HAIs because of the confined living environments and individual comorbidities [7] . In the RCHs, the residents are living collectively, which means they share many facilities and common areas with others [15] . Such a living situation within a confined environment poses a risk of cross infection, particularly those transmissions through airborne particles, water droplets, and personal contact. In addition, because of the demand for basic care, many frail residents must always be in close contact with healthcare workers. This increases a risk of HAI transmission between the staff and residents [16] . Finally, most of the residents in RCHs are suffering from multiple diseases, e.g., Diabetes Mellitus, stroke, heart disease, etc. [17, 18] , which are likely to cause HAIs among the elderly. These are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among the elderly and are known to increase burden on the healthcare system. Therefore, compliance with ICP among healthcare workers is important and has drawn researchers' attention in the past 20 years. As such, the current study aimed to observe the ICP compliance of healthcare workers in private and government-subsidized RCHs.",

In this study, the researcher (as a nonparticipant observer) was a qualified registered nurse who had been trained and had accumulated experience in patient care. This ensured that the researcher was familiar with ICP. The researcher recorded observations at any time in different shifts (morning or afternoon shifts) every day (from Monday to Sunday) in different units of both the private and subsidized RCHs. This allowed for the collection of comprehensive data on staff behavioral changes in different shifts during the weekdays and weekends [19] . For such consecutive observations done for 2-3 weeks in each RCH, the Hawthorne effect was reduced by desensitizing the healthcare workers to the frequent presence of the observer. Such a method has been suggested elsewhere [20] and is considered more reliable for continuous sampling. The observed healthcare workers were chosen randomly to minimize the selection bias. Once the observed staff was chosen, the researcher did not interrupt the care procedure. As the opportunities occurred, the performances were recorded by using an electronic tool, called the \"eRub.\" According to the guideline, hand hygiene involved ABHR and the use of soap and water for at least 20 s under the condition of the \"five moments for hand hygiene\" [21] .",

However, toilets and bathrooms are shared with all residents in the same floor. The common areas include the combined sitting and dining room, the recreation room, and the consultation and treatment rooms. In terms of staffing, these homes employ about 50-70 staff members (approximate ratio of staff to residents is 1:4-5) to provide a diverse range of care and services, including basic care, nursing care, social and support services, food preparation, and housekeeping. The core staff includes professional staff (i.e., registered nurses and enrolled nurses), personal care workers and workmen. Social workers, physiotherapists and occupational therapists work on part-time basis or are shared within and among the organizations. Although the duties and work patterns are similar to those of subsidized RCHs, the ratios of different staff grades vary. For example, such homes have scarce nursing staff but more personal care workers. According to the regional authority body and statute [14] , annual infection control training for all healthcare workers working in RCH is mandatory.",

Furthermore, this study reported the changes of hand hygiene compliance over a period of 2-3 weeks.

            "text": "Many researchers stated that hand hygiene is the most effective element in preventing infections. A systemic review of the impact of hand hygiene on risk infections in nursing homes revealed that the infection rate decreased when at least one hand hygiene-related intervention (e.g., availability of ABHR) was applied in the study [24] . However, the overall hand hygiene performance was still poor (15%) in the current study even though there was sufficient provision of ABHR. This result is similar with that of Smith et al. [25] and Ho et al. [26] , who reported that the hand hygiene performance rate is 14.7% in two long-term care facilities and ranged from 19.5-27% in subsidized RCHs. Moreover, the availability of ABHR in common areas was better than in the bedroom areas among subsidized and private RCHs. Yet, there was no difference found in the hand hygiene performance between common areas and bedroom areas. This indicated that healthcare workers had no intention to perform hand hygiene even with the presence of ABHR, at least in this study. This contradicts past studies, which reported an increase in hand hygiene compliance with increased availability of ABHR [27, 28] . In fact, some studies showed that increase hand hygiene compliance not only increased ABHR but also staff education on the use of such material [25] . PCWs seldom used ABHR compared with other healthcare workers in the current study. Indeed, it was predicted that professionals would have higher hand hygiene compliance than PCWs and HWs due to differences in educational background. Studies on hand hygiene behavior always focused on professional staff in hospital settings. However, this may not reflect the same situation in the RCH setting in the current study, as many healthcare workers completed lower educational levels in RCHs (most staff were PCWs and HWs with secondary school education). Therefore, further assessment of hand hygiene behaviors among PCWs and HWs in the RCH setting is necessary.",

This result is consistent with previous research, which indicated a significantly higher hand hygiene performance after body fluid exposure, aseptic procedure, and after patient contact compared to before patient contact and after patient surrounding contact [29] . Furthermore, another study showed that the assistant healthcare workers had the worst hand hygiene compliance in each moment compared with nurses and doctors in Turkey [30] . The current study revealed a similar result in which PCWs (with similar job duties to assistant healthcare workers) had the worst performance in each moment compared with the professional staff. It is likely that healthcare workers think that the residents' surroundings colonize with less microorganisms and lower risk of infection [29] . Moreover, in this study, the best performance in the use of gloves was the moment before coming into contact with the patients (38%) and before performing the aseptic technique (68%). It seemed that healthcare workers tend to protect themselves rather than protect others [31] .

The current study also found that hand hygiene performance decreased with the increased use of gloves. PCWs had the most frequent contact with residents. Yet, they had the worst performance in hand hygiene and frequently improper use of gloves among the healthcare workers observed in the study.
