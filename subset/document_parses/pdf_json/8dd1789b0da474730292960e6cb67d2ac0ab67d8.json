The development of selectively acting formulations requires the creation of smart delivery systems based on carriers that would first find the target cells and enter them and then release the active substance locally. Nanoparticles of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers can be effectively used as such carriers. Flexible regulation of the molecular structure and architecture of polymers, as well as the modification of nanoparticles with vector molecules, allows one to construct carrier particles for the development of nanoformulations for active agents of various nature. This review presents the main approaches to the design of nanoformulations for targeted delivery, describes the methods for the preparation and study of nanoparticles based on hydrophobic and amphiphilic biodegradable lactide polymers, and discusses the effect of the molecular structure and preparation conditions on the characteristics of nanoparticles in detail. Some results of research in this area of the Kurchatov complex of NBI\u0421S nature-like technologies are also presented.",

Besides reducing side effects, increasing the solubility, stability and bioavailability of pharmaceutical compounds, nanomedicine technologies can provide selective (targeted) delivery of an active compound to a diseased organ or tissue, its prolonged release, and overcoming various biological barriers, such as blood-brain barrier [3] . Approaches for programmed \"on demand\" drug release from a nanoparticle (NP) under the influence of an external stimulus were developed [4] . The field of nanoteranostics, the development of nanoforms that combine both diagnostic and therapeutic functions, is actively developing [5] .

To date, a wide range of carrier nanoparticles of various nature and structure has been developed: dendrimers [6] , liposomes [7, 8] , polymeric NPs [9] [10] [11] , inorganic compounds [12] , etc. Biodegradable polymers are of particular interest for the development of drug delivery systems: carriers based on these polymers degrade after performing their function and do not harm the body. There are various natural and synthetic biodegradable polymers, among which lactide based polymers are widely used. The properties and degradation rates of these materials can be controlled by changing the molecular weight, enantiomeric composition (content of L-and D-lactide in the polymer chain), by the copolymerization with other cyclic ethers (glycolide, \u03b5-caprolactone, etc.), modification of end groups, and various types of post-processing. Polylactide and its copolymers are most often used for the manufacture of implants, scaffolds, and drug delivery systems due to their excellent biocompatibility and synthetic flexibility, which provides synthesis of the materials with predetermined properties and degradation times from several weeks to several years. Copolymers of D,L-lactide with glycolide (PLGA) with a relative composition of 50 : 50 and 75 : 25 are most often used to obtain polymer micro-and nanoparticles due to their good solubility and rather rapid degradation. Many drugs based on them were developed and entered the market. These hydrophobic polymers are a good reservoir for loading hydrophobic active agents into them, whose release occurs through diffusion and is further accelerated at later stages due to polymer degradation. Various amphiphilic compounds (copolymers of propylene oxide with ethylene oxide: pluronics, polyvinyl alcohol, etc.) are used to stabilize hydrophobic PLGA-based NPs.",

            "text": "Delivery of anticancer drugs to the target tissue is one of the main tasks to be solved. NPs loaded with the drug are transported in the body by two mechanisms: passive and active targeting. Passive targeting to solid tumors can be achieved through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), as first described in the 1980s [13, 14] . Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15] . The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15] . Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16] . It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location. For passive targeting, NPs must circulate in the blood for a sufficiently long time, and their size determines their biological fate. Polymeric micelles less than 10 nm are easily excreted through the glomerular filtration [17] , while larger NPs of 50-100 nm circulate for a longer time and are excreted by the liver and spleen.",

Active targeting uses tumor cell characteristics such as overexpression of cell surface tumor antigens and tumor-specific antigens, as well as a relatively lower pH of the tumor environment (pH 7.0) compared with normal tissue (pH 7.4). Specific interactions between vector components of the carrier with antigens localized in the target tissues cause selective drug accumulation in these tissues. Active targeting reduces adverse side effects, since the drug accumulates only in tumor sites and allows drugs to absorb cells through endocytosis [21] .",

When administered intravenously, hydrophobic particles very quickly adsorb plasma proteins and are recognized by the system of mononuclear phagocytes, which eliminate them from the bloodstream. This process depends on the physical and chemical properties of NPs and is significantly accelerated with an increase in their size. To increase the circulation time, steric surface stabilization technologies, which provide the so-called stealth effect, are used. The hydrophilic shell of polymeric NPs can be formed by various types of polymers. The most commonly used lyophilizing polymer is polyethylene glycol (PEG); it is biocompatible and FDA approved. When hydrated, PEG forms a dense polymer brush stretched in the direction from the micelle core. Due to its good solubility in water, high mobility, and large excluded volume [22] , PEG imparts steric stability, minimizing the interfacial free energy of the micellar core and preventing hydrophobic intermicellar interactions [23] . A hydrophilic corona is required to prevent adsorption of opsonin and subsequent recognition by the mononuclear phagocytic system in the liver and spleen [24] . The neutral nature of the PEG corona can effectively protect cationic polyethyleneimide and prevent its nonspecific interactions with negatively charged plasma proteins in the biological environment, thereby providing a long circulation time [25] . Moreover, although PEG chains usually have a molecular weight of 1 to 15 kDa [26] , some data indicate that the longer the chains and the denser the hydrophilic brush, the stronger the masking effect and the longer the circulation time in the blood [22] . It was shown in [27] that the conformation of PEG bound to the polymer core can affect protein adsorption and complement-dependent phagocytosis. Indeed, PEG attached by both ends to NPs formed a more compact conformation and more effectively prevented adsorption of blood proteins. In addition, the end groups of PEG can be functionalized to bind ligands that allow altering the properties of the corona. In [28] , acetaldehyde-functionalized micelles were obtained based on a block copolymer of PEG and poly-D,L-lactide, to which an anionic peptidyl ligand (tyrosyl-glutamic acid) was attached to impart a negative surface charge and improve the masking properties. Up to 25% of the administered polymeric micelles were still circulating 24 h after intravenous injection, indicating that the half-life of the carrier was approximately the same as that of the well-established pegylated liposomes.",

ASTM standards allow a content of unreacted monomer at the level no more than 3 mol %, a maximum tin concentration of 200 ppm, a water content no more than 0.5%, and a solvent content of no more than 0.001%. It is important that the actual relative composition of the copolymer (lactide:glycolide) should differ from the declared one by no more than 3%. Such polymers can only be synthesized using controlled polymerization technologies that allow one to obtain a product with a given composition, high conversion, and narrow molecular weight distribution. In [38, 39] , an original method for studying the polymerization kinetics of lactide and other cyclic esters using differential scanning calorimetry was proposed. It was used to establish the optimal regimes for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers with different relative composition. Tin impurities in these materials arise because of the use of a tin containing catalyst; therefore, the development of new catalysts based on lighter metals, such as zinc [40] or zirconium [41] , is a relevant direction. PLGA copolymers must undergo comprehensive quality control before being used to develop nanoformulations. It is especially important for materials after storage, since their hydrolytic degradation slowly proceeds in air even at room temperature.",

The choice of the method is mainly determined by the type of the used copolymer and the nature of the drug substance, as well as the ease of implementation. An approach, in which NPs are synthesized through the polymerization of lactide in solution in the presence of a drug, is known [43] . Microfluidic technologies are effective for producing NPs with a narrow size distribution in a continuous mode [44] . In [45] , a method for preparation of PLGA nanoparticles using a template, PRINT, is described. The approach is interesting in that it provides NPs with an extremely narrow size distribution and controlled morphology. In this case, a very high content of docetaxel (up to 40 wt %) is achieved in NPs. The most widespread methods are emulsification and solvent displacement (nanoprecipitation), which are based on mixing an organic phase (polymer solution) and an aqueous phase (stabilizer solution) [46] . Depending on their nature, the loaded drug can be dissolved in both organic and aqueous phases. The classical method of obtaining a simple emulsion of the oil-in-water type involves preparing a solution of the polymer and the drug in an organic solvent and further dispersing in a larger volume of an aqueous solution of the stabilizer under active stirring or exposure to ultrasound. The organic solvent diffuses from the droplets and is removed by evaporation or extraction, resulting in the formation of solid particles [47] . For the encapsulation of water soluble drugs, the method of double emulsion of the waterin-oil-in-water type is used [48] .",

            "text": "An efficient one-step approach for the incorporation of lipophilic drug compounds is the nanoprecipitation method first proposed in 1989 [49] . The organic phase is a solution of the polymer and the drug compound in a polar solvent that is well miscible with water (usually acetone, tetrahydrofuran, or their mixtures with water or ethanol). This solution is poured into the aqueous phase (stabilizer solution in water) under stirring. The organic solvent is removed under weak heating and reduced pressure [46] . The resulting aqueous suspension is centrifuged and washed several times to remove residual organic solvent, after which it is frozen with the addition of a cryoprotectant and lyophilized [50] . The mechanism of NP formation is explained by the so-called ouzo effect [51] . When the Greek alcoholic drink Ouzo is mixed with water, the clear liquid instantly turns into a milky suspension. The drink consists of 55% water, 45% ethyl alcohol, and approximately 0.2% anethole essential oil extracted from anise. When an excess of water is added, the oil loses its solubility, resulting in the formation of an intensively light scattering suspension. The formation of NPs is explained in a similar way when water-insoluble polymers or lipids are used instead of oil. Figure 3 shows a triple phase diagram of the organic solvent/solute/water system. The binodal curve corresponds to the limit of miscibility depending on the composition and separates the one-phase region from the two-phase one, while the spinodal curve determines the limit of the thermodynamic stability. The spinodal separates the region in which the system develops due to nucleation from the region where spontaneous phase separation occurs (region with yellow stripes). Between the binodal and spinodal, there is the region of the ouzo effect at low polymer concentrations and ratios of organic solvent/water. In this region, the mixture is separated into a monomodal dispersion of nanosized droplets dispersed in an aqueous solution. Particles can be also formed outside the ouzo effect between the spinodal and binodal, but in this region NP aggregates with an uncontrolled size appear in addition to NPs [52] . The formation of NPs from the dispersion of droplets in the ouzo effect region is most often explained by the classical theory of nucleation. The nucleus is formed as a result of statistical density fluctuations, whose probability increases with an increase in the supersaturation of the polymer solution. The energy of the potential barrier for the formation of a nucleus of the radius r for the case of homogeneous nucleation is expressed by the equation where \u03b3 is the surface tension at the solid-solution interface; \u0394 is the difference in free energy per unit volume between the thermodynamic phase in which nucleation occurs and the phase that nucleates. Since the second term is negative, the \u0394G value passes through a maximum that determines the value of the critical radius r c = -2\u03b3/\u0394 . Nuclei smaller than the critical size disappear, while nuclei with a larger radius",

It is assumed that all particles are formed from one homogeneously supersaturated solution. The growth of particles due to condensation (attachment of polymer molecules from the surrounding solution to the nucleus) proceeds until the concentration of the dissolved polymer corresponding to the saturation level is reached. At the next stage, the growth of particles can occur through coagulation with other particles and Ostwald ripening.

According to Fig. 4b , the pair correlation function has a bell-like shape, which is typical for spherical particles. It is easy to determine the diameter of NPs from it, which was 120 nm.

We note that the physicochemical properties of the carriers allow them to overcome another important barrier, multidrug resistance [61] . Its mechanism is determined by expression of membrane proteins in resistant tumor cells: P-glycoprotein and MRP protein, which effectively release various chemical compounds from the cell. It was shown that block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (Pluronic trade mark) inhibit P-glycoprotein and other adenosine triphosphate-dependent systems of reverse transport of drugs from the cell [62] . At the same time, Pluronic polymers act as stabilizers for PLGA nanoparticles, thus performing the dual function.",

However, the loading of the active substance into such NPs is low, since the linear PLGA polymer can have a maximum of two functional end groups for the binding to two molecules of the active compound. To a certain extent, the problem can be solved by using polymers with a low molecular weight, but a more effective approach is to use branched polymers characterized by a high concentration of functional groups.

This approach allowed one to camouflage PEG is a nontoxic polymer that is readily soluble in water; it is removed from the human body through glomerular filtration in the kidneys. In 1990, the FDA approved the first pegylated protein product, the adenosine deaminase enzyme, aimed at treating severe forms of the immunodeficiency virus. Launched in 1995, Doxil, a drug based on pegylated liposomes, demonstrated an increase in the bioavailability of doxorubicin within 1 week after the injection up to 90-fold compared with the free drug, while its half-life increased to 3 days. PEG is incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the liposome, forming a hydrated membrane that protects liposomes from aggregation and phagocytosis, and also facilitates a reduction in adsorption of opsonins, increasing the circulation time in the bloodstream. Since then, this approach was actively used by researchers and developers to design drug delivery systems [66, 67] . Biodegradable block copolymers of polylactide and polyethylene glycol (PEG-b-PLA) are promising materials for the development of nanoformulations and vaccines. Polyethylene glycol covalently bound to the hydrophobic PLA block assigns the polymer an amphiphilic nature, which provides block copolymers with the ability to self-assembly.",

A change in the molar ratio of the components of the reaction mixture allows one to obtain block copolymers of various compositions, while the use of monoor bifunctional macroinitiators leads to various structures. Monofunctional PEG methyl ether is used for the synthesis of diblock copolymers of the A-B type, where A is the hydrophilic block, B is the hydrophobic block, and bifunctional PEG is used for the synthesis of triblock copolymers of the B-A-B type. Schemes for the synthesis of diblock PEG-b-PLA and triblock PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA copolymers by ring-opening polymerization are shown in Figs. 5a and 5b, respectively. Conversion, residual monomer content, composition and number-average molecular weight M n of the block copolymers are determined by means of 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance. The same stringent requirements as for PLA and PLGA polymers are imposed to block copolymers. In aqueous solutions, the self-assembly of amphiphilic amorphous block copolymers into various supramolecular structures occurs due to hydrophobic interactions between the chains of the insoluble block, which lead to their aggregation and the formation of a hydrophobic core of the nanostructure. The shell of hydrated chains of the water-soluble PEG block acts as a stabilizer and prevents the unlimited growth of the formed structures and their isolation into a separate macroscopic phase. Amphiphilic block copolymers with a relatively long hydrophilic block in aqueous solutions, as a rule, associate into spherical starshaped micelles of the core-corona type [9, 12] (Fig. 6) . Block copolymers with a long hydrophobic block can form not only spherical crew-cut micelles [70, 71] , but also cylindrical micelles, bilayer vesicles, and lamellae [12, 72] .",

            "text": "In [84] , nanoparticles with amorphous P(CL-co-(D,L)LA) and semi-crystalline P(CL-co-(L)LA) core based on PEG-b-poly-\u03b5-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide (PEG-b-P(CL-(D,L)LA) and PEG-b-poly-\u03b5caprolactone-co-L-lactide (PEG-b-P(CL-(L)LA) copolymers, respectively, were prepared by dialysis and their solubilizing ability was investigated. Pyrene was used as a model hydrophobic agent, for which the K v equilibrium inclusion coefficient in the NP core was determined. The K v value was 5.72 \u00d7 10 4 and 2.12 \u00d7 10 5 for the particles based on PEG 50 -b-P(CLco-(L)LA) and PEG 50 -b-P(CL-co-(D,L)LA) copolymers, respectively. The lower K v value in the case of PEG 50 -b-P(CL-co-(L)LA) particles are explained by the peculiarities of the semi-crystalline core structure, namely, the close packing of P(CL-co-(L)LA) chains, which prevents the solubilization of pyrene molecules [84] . However, when studying the solubilizing ability of PEG-b-PLA particles obtained by nanoprecipitation of the relatively poorly water soluble anticancer drug doxorubicin, it was found that PEG-b-P(L)LA and PEG-b-P(D)LA particles with a semi-crystalline core encapsulate the drug more efficiently than PEGb-P(D,L)LA particles with a amorphous core [75] . Thus, the content of the loaded drug in PEG 113 -b-P(L)LA 64 and PEG 113 -b-P(D)LA 71 was 1.66 \u00b1 0.15 and 1.61 \u00b1 0.13 wt %, respectively, while in PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA 58 it was only 0.81 \u00b1 0.11 wt % (with the initial drug loading of 10 wt %). It is assumed that low loading values in the case of PEG-b-P(D,L)LA particles may be associated with a weak interaction between doxorubicin and P(D,L)LA chains of the hydrophobic block in the core [75] . In the laboratory of polymeric materials of Kurchatov Complex of NBICS nature-like technologies NPs based on PEG 113 -b-P(L)LA and PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA copolymers were prepared by the nanoprecipitation method and the effect of the stereochemical structure of the PLA block on their solubilizing ability in relation to the anticancer drug oxaliplatin, which is poorly soluble in water, was studied [85] . Under similar polymerization degrees of the hydrophobic PLA block, the content of oxaliplatin in PEG 113 -b-P(L)LA and PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA particles was 0.9 and 3.8 wt %, respectively (with the initial load of 5 wt %). Apparently, the close packing of P(L)LA chains in the semicrystalline core prevents the efficient encapsulation of oxaliplatin. The release rate of an encapsulated substance from PEG-b-PLA nanoparticles also depends on the stereochemical nature of the PLA block. In [86] , the effect of the stereoregularity of the PLA block on the release rate of hydrophobic drugs, sulindac and tetracaine, incorporated into PLA-b-PEG 202 -b-PLA nanoparticles was investigated. Loaded NPs based on triblock copolymers were obtained by heating polymer solutions to 80\u00b0C followed by their cooling. In the case of P(L)LA-b-PEG-b-P(L)LA nanoparticles, the release of loaded sulindac was observed within 4-8 days, for tetracaine within 2-4 days. For P(D,L)LAb-PEG-b-P(D,L)LA nanoparticles, it was found that the release of sulindac lasts up to 18 days, tetracaine up to 8-9 days. Apparently, the significant difference in the release rates of the loaded drugs is associated with the different core structure of PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA nanoparticles. It is assumed that the close packing of P(L)LA chains in the semi-crystalline core can prevent the drug from being evenly distributed over the entire volume of the core, leading to its localization at the periphery and, as a result, more rapid release [86] . In [75] , in contrast, the highest rate of the encapsulated drug release was observed for PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA 58 particles with amorphous core. In the case of PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA 58 particles, almost 100% of the loaded doxorubicin was released within 5 h, while in the case of mPEG 113 -b-P(L)LA 64 and mPEG 113 -b-P(D)LA 71 particles, approximately 50% was released within the same time. The high rate of the release from mPEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA 58 particles is possibly associated with a weak interaction of doxorubicin and P(D,L)LA chains, which facilitates diffusion of drug molecules from the particle core [75] .",

The driving force of self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into supramolecular structures in aqueous solutions is hydrophobic interactions of polymer chains of an insoluble block, while repulsive forces of chains of a soluble block provide steric stabilization of particles and limit their growth [7] . Thus, the size of block copolymer NPs is determined by the length of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks; however, the polymerization degree of the insoluble block largely affects the particle size. Thus, it was found in [77] that the hydrodynamic diameter D h of PEG-b-P(D,L)LA particles prepared by the nanoprecipitation method is 26 nm and does not change with an increase in the length of the hydrophilic PEG block from 45 to 113 monomer units. An increase in the polymerization degree of the hydrophobic P(D,L)LA block from 28 to 347 monomer units led to a significant increase in the D h value of PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA nanoparticles from 25 to 71 nm.",

            "text": "Commonly, an increase in the fraction of the hydrophobic block in the copolymer leads to an increase in the aggregation number of the particle and, as a result, to an increase in its size [73, 80] . However, the published data on the effect of the crystallization of P(L)LA block length on the size of PEG-b-P(L)LA block copolymer NPs are contradictory. As an example, it was found in [87] that the hydrodynamic diameter D h of P(L)LA x -b-PEG 91 -b-P(L)LA x particles prepared by dialysis increases from 64 \u00b1 3 to 211 \u00b1 1 nm with an increase in the length of P(L)LA block x from 61 to 90 units. In [84] , no patterns were found in the change of the D h value of PEG-b-P(CL-co-(L)LA) nanoparticles with an increase in the length of the crystallizing P(CL-co-(L)LA) block. In [88] , using the method of small angle neutron scattering, it was found that an increase in the length of the P(L)LA block from 58 to 88 units in the series of triblock P(L)LA y -b-PEG 202 -b-P(L)LA y copolymers leads to a slight increase in the diameter of the semi-crystalline core of the particles from 22 to 30 nm. In [89] , when studying aqueous suspensions of PEG 113 -b-P(L)LA x and P(L)LA y -b-PEG 91 -b-P(L)LA y nanoparticles, it was found that a significant increase in the length of the P(L)LA block x from 64 to 418 and y from 30 to 120 monomer units in the series of diblock and triblock copolymers, respectively, practically does not affect the size of the formed particles. The hydrodynamic radius R h of PEG 113 -b-P(L)LA x and P(L)LA yb-PEG 91 -b-P(L)LA y nanoparticles, regardless the length of the P(L)LA block, was ~20 and 30 nm, respectively. It was found by SAXS that the radius R of the semi-crystalline P(L)LA core for all samples, except for PEG 113 -b-P(L)LA 418 , was 11 nm. At the given polymerization degrees of the P(L)LA block and under the given conditions of their preparation (con- centration, temperature, and rate of solvent displacement), the size of PEG-b-P(L)LA particles is determined not only by the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance in the copolymer, but also by the conditions of P(L)LA block crystallization [89] . We note that in [88] , particles were formulated by the method of heating block copolymer solutions in D 2 O to 80\u00b0C and their subsequent cooling, while in [89] , dialysis was used to prepare the particles. Thus, various patterns in the change in the PEG-b-P(L)LA particle size with increasing length of the P(L)LA block may be associated with the parameters of the particle preparation process, which are usually far from thermodynamically equilibrium conditions. The morphology of block copolymer nanoparticles. An increase in the length of the hydrophobic block within the block copolymer can lead to a change in the morphology of particles from spherical to cylindrical and further to vesicular one [90, 91] . However, the wide range variation of the polymerization degree of the P(D,L)LA block in the series of PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA copolymers (from 28 to 1528 monomer units) did not affect the morphology of the formed particles; all the particles were spherical [73, 77] . When studying NPs based on synthesized PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA n copolymers, it was also found that a significant increase in the length of the P(D,L)LA block n from 70 to 1390 monomer units does not lead to a change in the particle shape. According to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data, all PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA n particles are characterized by the spherical morphology (Fig. 3b) .",

In [78] , when block copolymer particles PEG 45 -b-P(L)LA and PEG 114 -b-P(L)LA were prepared by nanoprecipitation, it was found that an increase in the proportion of the P(L)LA block in PEG-b-P(L)LA copolymers leads to a change in the morphology of the formed particles from spherical to rod-shaped one. According to TEM data, the PEG 45b-P(L)LA 18 copolymer with the shortest P(L)LA block forms spherical particles, while PEG 45 -b-P(L)LA 73 with the longest P(L)LA block forms rodshaped particles. In the case of PEG 45 -b-P(L)LA 41 and PEG 45 -b-P(L)LA 28 copolymers with an average length of the P(L)LA block, the coexistence of particles of both morphologies was observed, but with an increase in the proportion of the P(L)LA block in the copolymer, the proportion of rod-shaped particles increased. For the series of PEG 114 -b-P(L)LA copolymers, the formation of rod-shaped particles was found in the case of PEG 114 -b-P(L)LA 85 with the longest P(L)LA block.

In addition, with an increase in the length of the P(D,L)LA block, its hydrophobicity increases, which can also prevent the effective encapsulation of a hydrophilic drug into the particles. In [85] , the effect of the P(D,L)LA block length in PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA n copolymers on the content of the anticancer drug, oxaliplatin, in PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA n nanoparticles was studied. With an increase in the polymerization degree of the P(D,L)LA block n from 62 to 173 monomer units, the content of oxaliplatin in the particles decreased from 3.8 to 1.5 wt % (with the initial loading of the drug of 5 wt %). Apparently, oxaliplatin is adsorbed at the core-shell interface; the observed loading decrease can be explained by a decrease in the density of PEG chains in the stabilizing corona. In [82] , a decrease in the solubilization of another hydrophilic agent (procaine hydrochloride) with an increase in the molecular weight of the P(D,L)LA block was associated with a decrease in the mobility of P(D,L)LA chains in the core of the particles [82] and the formation of so-called frozen particles in the case of PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA n block copolymers with a sufficiently long P(D,L)LA block. The glassy core of such particles makes it difficult for the drug to penetrate and leads to a decrease in its loading.",

The release of methotrexate was prolonged.

Thus, in the case of nanoparticles based on PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA 56 with the shortest P(D,L)LA block, ~50% of the loaded metatrexate was released within 5 days, while in the case of nanoparticles based on PEG 113 -b-P(D,L)LA 1330 with the longest P(D,L)LA block, ~10% of the drug was released within the same time [95] . In [86] , when studying kinetics of the release of hydrophobic drugs, tetracaine and sulindac, from P(D,L)LA x -b-PEG 202 -b-P(D,L)LA x nanoparticles, it was found that even a slight change in the P(D,L)LA block length affects the rate of drug release.

As well, in [86] , the release kinetics of tetracaine and sulindac from NPs based on P(L)LA y -b-PEG 202 -b-P(L)LA y copolymers with the crystallizing hydrophobic P(L)LA block was studied, and it was found that an increase in the polymerization degree of the P(L)LA block y from 77 to 88 monomer units leads to an increase in the release rate of both drugs.

Macromolecules of hyperbranched polymers have a nest-like structure with a large number of branching points; each of the linear chains can lead to the formation of at least two other arms [98] [99] [100] . To obtain amphiphilic branched s-PLA-b-PEG polymers, end groups of branched polylactides are modified with PEG blocks (Fig. 8) . The hydrophilichydrophobic balance of branched amphiphilic compounds can be controlled not only by the molecular weight of blocks, but also by changing the number of hydrophilic blocks per molecule. The described structures with a certain hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance are capable of forming monomolecular NPs that are resistant to sharp dilution in the human bloodstream. There are two principal approaches to the synthesis of branched polymers: the so-called arm first and core first methods. Branched polylactides are most often synthesized using the core first approach, which implies building the polymeric arms on the core molecule. A compound containing three or more OH groups (core) acts as a coinitiator of lactide polymerization in the presence of the catalyst, tin 2-ethylhexanoate (tin octoate) [101] . This method has an important advantage, namely, it consists in one step, in contrast to the arm first approach, in which linear or branched arms are primarily synthesized with their subsequent attachment to the core molecule. The number of arms in the resulting polymer is equal to the number of hydroxyl functional groups of the coinitiator. As an example, polyols such as trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, and dipentaerythritol are the most common multifunctional coinitiators for the synthesis of three-, four-, and six-arm star-shaped polylactides, respectively. For the synthesis of hyperbranched polymers, core molecules with a large number of OH groups are used. Such a core can be presented by Boltorn\u2122 polyesters based on 2,2bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid, whose structure contains from 16 to 64 hydroxyl groups, depending on its pseudo generation.",

However, with an increase in the number of arms from three to six at a similar molecular weight of hydrophobic PLA blocks, no significant difference in the hydrodynamic diameter of NPs formed is observed. In this case, the values of the average diameter vary from 14 to 16 nm depending on the number of arms.",

From the data presented (Fig. 9b) , it can be seen that with an increase in the length of the hydrophobic PLLA block of four-arm samples, the hydrodynamic diameter of NPs increases from 15 to 44 nm. As in the previous case, the intensity distribution shows bimodality for all samples. When analyzing distributions, it should be considered that the intensity of light scattering strongly depends on the size of the scattering object. When constructing distributions by the number of particles, it becomes clear that individual NPs are the predominant fraction.",

These results demonstrate that the hydrophilicity of branched block copolymers can depend not only on their chemical composition, but also on the macromolecular architecture [102] . In [103] , when studying 29 block copolymer using DLS, it was found that aqueous suspensions (as for star-shaped samples) consist of two fractions: individual NPs of 11-17 nm and their aggregates.

In addition, in polymers in which the hydrophilic block is PEG 45 , an increase in the suspension concentration led to a significant increase in the NP diameter due to secondary aggregation.

The loading of the hydrophobic drug doxorubicin also increased in the range from 6.98 to 7.82% with an increase in the number of arms and the rate of its release from NPs regardless of pH of the medium had an inverse relationship probably due to the formation of a more compact core with an increase in the number of arms. In [105] , in vitro tests showed that NPs based on the four-arm block copolymer had the high-est cellular uptake and cytotoxicity, were also carried out. A three-fold increase in the cellular uptake in comparison with three-and six-arm samples is greatly associated with the average size of the NPs themselves, which facilitates penetration into HeLa cells.",

The relative composition and molecular weight of the polymer, its molecular architecture (linear or branched), hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance, and the ability to crystallize are important characteristics affecting the size of nanoparticles and their ability to solubilize active compounds. Only a combination of research methods, including dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering, can provide complete information on the morphology and structure of a nanoformulation.
