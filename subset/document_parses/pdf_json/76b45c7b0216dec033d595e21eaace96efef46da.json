While both can be licensed to practice in all medical specialties, their training has historically remained separate. There were two organizations that accredited graduate medical education (GME) training programs before 2020: the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) [3] . Although DO candidates could apply to ACGME-accredited programs, MD candidates could not apply to AOA-accredited ones. In 2014, the ACGME, AOA, and American Association of Osteopathic Medical Colleges (AACOM) announced a partnership that would bring all residency programs under a new single-accreditation GME system starting in 2016 and becoming fully integrated in 2020 [4] . The system aims to homogenize GME, promote collaboration, and improve training nationwide [5] .",

NRMP specialties were initially analyzed individually, but there were several specialties with too few DO candidates to accommodate statistically significant analysis. To increase the sample power, specialties were stratified into three competitiveness cohorts: low-competitiveness (LC), moderate-competitiveness (MC), and highcompetitiveness (HC). These stratifications were created by using the ratio of US senior applications who matched successfully into their preferred specialty to the number of positions available in said specialty based on the calculated Match Quality Score which has been published previously [7, 11] (Table 1) . Data were then collected on match rates, number of candidates' contiguous programs ranked, USMLE Step 1 and 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge) scores, and research output. The NRMP determines match rate by the simple proportions of candidates who placed into their first-choice specialty against all applicants in that specialty. Research output is defined in two ways: number of projects (i.e., \"research experiences\") and number of abstracts, presentations, and publications (i.e., \"research items\"). A two-level contingency was then created (those with <5 or \u22655 research items or experiences) for comparison. NLE performance was determined by USMLE Step 1 and 2 CK score. Very few MD candidates take COMLEX and a significant portion of DO candidates take USMLE as a component of their application. USMLE scores are reported as means and as categorical groups of 10.

The US MD Seniors observed better match performance than US DO Seniors across all competitiveness strata, which may be due to several factors. One of the primary differences between US MD and DO applicant profiles relates to research involvement and output. The US MD Seniors had more research products and experiences compared to US DO Seniors in most specialties. Interestingly, there was no observed difference in the MC cohort between the groups, which may represent varying degrees of importance for research involvement between surgical and non-surgical specialties [14] . Nevertheless, research is theoretically important for all candidates to demonstrate creative and scientific thinking, a willingness to engage with changing aspects of the field, and the ability to accommodate paraclinical duties in the face of clinical requirements [18] .",

A recent survey found that nearly half of osteopathic graduates perceived inadequate resources dedicated to research technique development, literature analysis, and biostatistics [21] . Additionally, osteopathic physicians and medical schools produce less research and obtain less NIH funding than their allopathic counterparts [13, 20, [22] [23] . Due to these differences, osteopathic medical students must work harder to identify research mentors and develop projects in their desired field. This could potentially disrupt osteopathic medical students' ability to adequately focus on academic and clinical work or delay their graduation to complete research fellowships, contributing to an increased financial burden.",

            "text": "Second, matched US MD Seniors were more likely to score higher on the USMLE compared to US DO Seniors across all cohorts. Four things must first be considered: (1) the NLE landscape for future US physicians is rapidly changing, (2) many, but not all, US DO Seniors take USMLE Step 1 and/or 2 CK, (3) many confounders can explain score discrepancies such as preferred specialty, qualitative factors like resilience, and demographics, and (4) NLEs are not written for the purpose of residency candidate selection. Since some US DO Seniors do not take USMLE Step 1 and elect to only take the COMLEX examinations, this data should not be generalized to all students who applied but rather be used as an indication of the competitiveness of those students who sat for USMLE Step 1. Conversions do exist for COMLEX to USMLE score interpretations; however, these have been proven to be inconclusive and not representative [24] . Despite these priors, USMLE scores may indicate dedication, academic prowess, and available resources to achieve one's goals [25] . In any case, this may be explained by several factors. First, osteopathic medical schools may not emphasize taking or preparing for the USMLE and thus provide USMLE-specific study resources for their students, which could lead to an increased financial burden placed on the student. This likely discourages many from taking USMLE or could make preparation for it more cumbersome. Second, exam fatigue may hinder a DO student's ability to optimize their performance on either USMLE or COMLEX. If US DO Seniors take both exams in the same week, this could potentially negatively impact test performance. Finally, US MD Seniors on average may emphasize NLE preparation to a greater degree given that proportionately more apply to HC specialties than US DO Seniors, resulting in better performance on standardized examinations. Nevertheless, given that USMLE Step 1 and COMLEX Level 1 will move to pass/fail grading in 2022, the impetus to improve other application areas may grow, and students from less prestigious schools may face disproportionate challenges [10, 26] . It is discussed that NLEs may not capture the qualities necessary to assess residency training candidacy so more holistic means to evaluate applicants have been conceptualized [10, 27] . Until changes to the ERAS and NRMP are made, residency programs will likely continue to rely on NLEs in candidate selection.",

            "text": "Finally, while not a direct representation, the number of programs an applicant ranks in ERAS serves as an adequate proxy for the number of interviews offered and subsequently completed. Matched US MD Seniors ranked significantly more programs than their US DO Senior counterparts. This is especially true in the HC cohort, where US MD Seniors were about nine-fold more likely to rank greater than 15 programs in ERAS than US DO Seniors. This may be related to the aforementioned factors such as NLE performance and scholarly output, but in this new environment of single GME training, it is concerning that osteopathic candidates rank fewer programs, and thus be extended fewer interview offers, than allopathic candidates. While certainly not ubiquitous, bias against osteopathic candidates may remain, as suggested by the NRMP's Program Director Survey (PDS). In 2020, for all specialties, 36% of program directors reported that they will \"seldom\" or \"never\" interview US DO Seniors compared to 6% for US MD Seniors [28] . Again, the discrepancy is greater in highly competitive specialties. For example, in dermatology, 92% of program directors reported \"seldom\" or \"never\" interviewing US DO Seniors while 100% stated they interview US MD Seniors [28] . Indeed, for most specialties, the PDS response rate is low, and these specialties also do not receive many osteopathic applications consistently every year. Additionally, the average US DO Senior applicant may have fewer professional connections within their preferred specialty, secondary to not having a home residency program. It may also be that competitive programs and specialties fear how accepting otherwise qualified DO candidates from lesser-known institutions are perceived with regard to prestige. Whatever the reason, given that osteopathic students now represent about a quarter of all medical students in the US, competitive specialties may see a greater number of osteopathic applicants [22] . Time will elucidate the true level of bias among specialties more broadly in the single accreditation GME system.",

In 2018, the GME partnership had not yet been completed, so we could not account for the applicants who may have been accepted into AOA programs, particularly in HC specialties. This could thus alter the data for osteopathic applicant profiles and acceptance rates, subjecting the study to sampling bias. This data combination (2018 and 2020 data) was performed after considering the risk for bias so as to provide greater numbers of applicants for more conclusive statistical significance due to the low DO application rates in some specialties. Finally, we pooled candidates into competitiveness groups and used programs ranked as a proxy for interview offers, subjecting the study to design bias.
