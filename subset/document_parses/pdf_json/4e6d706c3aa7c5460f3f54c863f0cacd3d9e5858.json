We sought to investigate the short-term effect of mRNA vaccine administration on endothelial function and arterial stiffness. Thirty-two participants (mean age 37 \u00b1 8 years, 20 men) who received the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were studied in three sessions in a sequence-randomized, sham-controlled, assessor-blinded, crossover design. The primary outcome was endothelial function (assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)), and the secondary outcomes were aortic stiffness (evaluated with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV)) and inflammation (measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in blood samples). The outcomes were assessed prior to and at 8 h and 24 h after the 1st dose of vaccine and at 8 h, 24 h, and 48 h after the 2nd dose. There was an increase in hsCRP that was apparent at 24 h after both the 1st dose (\u22120.60 [95% confidence intervals [CI]: \u22121.60 to \u22120.20], p = 0.013) and the 2nd dose (maximum median difference at 48 h \u22126.60 [95% CI: \u22129.80 to \u22123.40], p < 0.001) compared to placebo. The vaccine did not change PWV. FMD remained unchanged during the 1st dose but decreased significantly by 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1% to 2.9%, p = 0.037) at 24 h after the 2nd dose. FMD values returned to baseline at 48 h. Our study shows that the mRNA vaccine causes a prominent increase in inflammatory markers, especially after the 2nd dose, and a transient deterioration of endothelial function at 24 h that returns to baseline at 48 h. These results confirm the short-term cardiovascular safety of the vaccine.",

            "text": "The identification of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and deaths in China in late 2019 rapidly evolved into an unprecedented worldwide pandemic, with more than 380 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and almost 6,000,000 deaths [1] . An enormous effort was undertaken throughout the world to develop medications and vaccines to tackle the increase in deaths and the pressure on health care systems by the pandemic. Currently, at least 140 leading vaccine candidates have been investigated or are under investigation, while more than 190 are in preclinical development [2] . The first vaccine to be approved was Comirnaty (BNT162b2), a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccine that produces a membraneanchored full-length spike protein of the virus and is the first of its type to be used for widespread immunization [3] . mRNA vaccines represent a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches because of their capacity for rapid development, the potential for low-cost manufacture, safe administration, and high potency [4] . Currently, more than 10 billion vaccinations in total have been performed worldwide without the report of any substantial complications [5, 6] . SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that is expressed in the lungs, endothelium, heart, and other tissues, as a receptor for its entrance into cells [7] . Accordingly, the hypothesis emerged that SARS-CoV-2 infection, by affecting the endothelium, could increase cardiovascular risk, especially in susceptible patients, either directly or through the activation of the inflammatory cascade [7] . Concerns were also augmented by indirect evidence that the detection of the spike protein in brain endothelial cells was associated with the formation of microthrombi, while pseudovirions (spike, envelope, and membrane proteins) without viral RNA are present in the endothelia of cerebral microvessels [8] . Therefore, it was hypothesized that the viral spike protein that is the target of the principal COVID-19 vaccines could also be one of the basic agents causing damage to distant organs, including the brain, heart, lung, and kidney [8] . Arterial function biomarkers are validated predictors of cardiovascular risk and, as we and others have shown, are able to detect even subtle short-term treatmentrelated cardiovascular effects, including the effects of vaccines [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "A large number of infectious agents have been linked with an increased cardiovascular risk. Pathogens can exert proatherogenic and proarteriosclerotic effects either directly, by infecting the vascular wall, or indirectly, through systemic inflammatory mechanisms [17] . It has been shown that there is a 5-fold increase in acute myocardial infarction risk and a 3-fold increase in stroke risk following an acute respiratory infection [18] . This risk might be even higher when the infectious agent causes direct endothelial and myocardial injury [19, 20] . The overactivation of the inflammatory cascade is one of the main mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection harms the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 is able to directly infect endothelial cells, inducing endothelial injury and endotheliitis (with infiltration of inflammatory cells into vessel walls) [21] . SARS-CoV-2, which enters endothelial cells through ACE2, downregulates ACE2 expression and reduces its activity; both have been shown to be associated with vascular dysfunction [7] . Subjects recovering from a recent (in the last month) SARS-CoV-2 infection have pronounced endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness compared to controls, supporting [22] . The S protein alone can damage the endothelium, as manifested by endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and impaired mitochondrial function. It seems that the S protein increases redox stress in endothelial cells and ultimately leads to ACE2 destabilization. A dysregulated renin-angiotensin system due to ACE2 reduction may exacerbate endothelial dysfunction, possibly leading to endotheliitis. Unlike an infection, the spike protein resulting from COVID-19 vaccination does not assemble into new viral particles. Instead, it attaches to the cell surface as it would to the viral surface. Finally, the spike protein is genetically modified to enhance the immune response and prevent its binding to ACE2 receptors. For these reasons, exogenous antibodies against the S protein and/or vaccination-generated antibodies not only protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the host but also prevent S protein-imposed endothelial injury during infection. One could argue that the short transient endothelial dysfunction noted after vaccination is a very small, transient price to pay compared to the abovementioned beneficial effects. The ongoing, large, international, multicenter COVID-19 Effects on Arterial Stiffness and Vascular Aging (CAR-TESIAN) study is expected to provide more robust data on the exact effect of the infection and COVID-19 vaccination on vascular health and aging in the long term [23] .",

            "text": "However, even from early reports, there is convincing evidence that vascular parameters are predictive of cardiovascular events in COVID-19 patients [24, 25] . Although mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are considered safe, and the benefits from vaccination outweigh any known risk, data on the possible effects of these vaccines on the cardiovascular system are scarce. Some concern has been raised by the possible side effects of the produced spike on macro-and microcirculation. The detection of the spike protein in brain endothelial cells has been associated with the formation of microthrombi, while the detection of pseudovirions (spike, envelope, and membrane proteins) without viral RNA in the endothelia of cerebral microvessels may theoretically cause microvascular injury irrespective of the immune response [26, 27] . Furthermore, experimental data show the entrance of the spike protein in cardiac pericytes and pulmonary vascular cells, which promotes cell signaling leading to vascular cell dysfunction and cell growth/hypertrophy [28, 29] . It seems extremely interesting to be able to detect spike protein levels in plasma [30, 31] , but to the best of our knowledge, no practical, clinical use has been implemented thus far while these techniques are not widely available for use to investigate whether there is an association between the observed changes in endothelial function and the spike levels in plasma [32] . On the other hand, the triggering of the inflammatory cascade itself might adversely affect vascular function. We and others have shown the acute harmful effect of inflammation on endothelial function and arterial stiffness [9, 10, 33, 34] , which are reliable, validated predictors of cardiovascular risk [15, 16] . Furthermore, we and others have shown the effect of various vaccines on these parameters [35] . CRP levels are considered a pharmacodynamic marker for the mode of action of RNA vaccines that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses [36] . Innate immunity sensors are triggered by the intrinsic adjuvant activity of vaccines [37] . The lipid nanoparticle (LNP) carrier protects the mRNA to be delivered to lymphatics and promotes protein translation in lymph nodes. In lymph nodes, the LNP is engulfed by dendritic cells, which produce and present the antigen to T cells for the activation of the adaptive immune response [37] .",

            "text": "Overall, the present study aimed to investigate both direct (by impacting host vascular cells) and indirect (by secretion of proinflammatory molecules and production of proapoptotic factors) effects of COVID-19 vaccination. For this purpose, we employed a wide array of validated vascular indices that target both macrovascular and microvascular function. While there were no changes after the 1st dose, there was a transient deterioration of endothelial function after the 2nd dose that was reversed at 48 h. This reversal attests to nonsignificant harm by the vaccine. The theoretical effect of spike proteins on microvascular function is not supported based on the fact that there was not a statistically significant reduction in HMBFV up to 48 hours after the 2nd dose when the spike proteins were at their highest levels. Furthermore, PWV did not change with time in our study. It is well established that PWV has pressure-dependent and pressureindependent determinants. The pressure-dependent component is not affected since there is no increase in BP, as we have shown. The endothelium affects the BPindependent component, but it is not the sole factor that does so. It appears that the magnitude of the endothelial effect after COVID-19 vaccination is not large enough to affect PWV by itself, providing further confirmation about vaccine safety. Therefore, the notion of the safety of the COVID-19 vaccination is further corroborated by the absence of any effect on arterial stiffness and wave reflections.",

While we confirmed the prominent activation of the inflammation pathway with vaccination, a novelty of our study is the assessment of a 2-dose vaccine on inflammation and vascular function. The type/technology of the vaccine seems to play a role. Indeed, as we have shown [10, 33] , the Salmonella typhi vaccine (that contains purified Vi capsular polysaccharide of S. typhi that is a T cell-independent antigen of the bacterium and thus mediates protection through antibody-dependent mechanisms) had a potent deleterious effect both on FMD and arterial stiffness, whereas the single-dose H1N1 influenza vaccine that contains a monovalent, split inactivated form of the virus with a water-in-oil adjuvant (MF59, which leads to faster responses and dose sparing to achieve greater coverage) caused solely endothelial dysfunction up to 48 h [9] . In contrast, the current mRNA vaccine did not have any significant time effect on vascular biomarkers after the first dose, when the effect on inflammation was weaker; only after the 2nd dose was there a transient effect on FMD (peaking at 24 h) when the inflammation was more potent.",

In contrast, the course of other inflammatory markers/ mediators, such as IL-6, coincides temporally with arterial function changes.

Within the adaptive immune system, females have increased B cell production of immunoglobulin, more robust CD8 + T cell cytotoxic activity and higher numbers of CD4 + T cells than males. Women produce higher antibody titers in response to the trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination (TIV), as well as to most other pathogen vaccines, and report more severe local and systemic side effects. More specifically, females achieve equivalent protective antibody titers to males at half the dose of TIV, with serum testosterone levels inversely correlating with TIV antibody titers. These findings imply that females have an increased capacity to mount humoral immune responses compared to males. This could explain the larger effect on endothelial dysfunction in females than males.",
