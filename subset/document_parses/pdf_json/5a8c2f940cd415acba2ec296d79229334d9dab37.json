In this work, we experimentally interrogate thousands of ACE2 mutants to identify over one hundred human single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are likely to have altered recognition by the virus, and make the complementary discovery that ACE2 residues distant from the spike interface can have a strong influence upon the ACE2-spike interaction. These findings illuminate new links between ACE2 sequence and spike recognition, and will find wide-ranging utility in SARS-CoV-2 fundamental research, epidemiological analyses, and clinical trial design.",

The high-affinity interaction between the virus and ACE2 is a major determinant of SARS-CoV-2's high infectivity [1, 2] . Characterizing how this interaction varies across the human population is of great importance for biomedical research, clinical trial design, and retrospective analysis of epidemiological data to facilitate development of vaccines, therapeutics, and treatment regimens that mitigate or prevent the acute and prolonged effects of COVID-19.",

Residues within the ACE2 peptidase active site have little influence on spike protein binding, which is expected since ACE2's natural peptidase function is distinct from viral recognition. Surprisingly, we found residues near ACE2's chloride-binding site, which is important in regulating ACE2 peptidase activity [6] , play an important role in spike binding. This site is over 40 \u00c5 from the spike interface and thus mutations contained therein may influence spike binding by changing ACE2's conformation. Our analysis also identified a tightly packed cluster of residues that strongly influence spike binding (Fig 1d) . Residues L236, F588, L591, and L595 are ranked above the 98 th percentile for site importance despite being over 30 \u00c5 from the spike interface.

A vast majority of the SNVs that alter spike binding are distant from the spike interface that has been the focus of prior ACE2 mutagenesis studies [1, 2, 7] . Our large-scale mutagenesis data encompasses 165 missense SNVs found in the human population. We assign putative spike protein binding annotations to these variants. Roughly two-thirds display decreased spike binding, one-third display binding similar to wild-type ACE2, and a small fraction display increased binding. (b) We estimate 320-365 individuals per 100,000 humans may harbor SNVs that decrease spike binding, while 4-12 individuals may have SNVs that increase binding. Specific human subpopulations possess higher and lower frequencies of SNVs that alter spike binding. Error bars represent one standard deviation and were generated by applying bootstrap statistical analysis to the SNV allele count data. (c) Data for YSD-based binding characterization of eight missense SNVs. The binding signal is defined as mean fluorescence for yeast-displayed ACE2 spike binding divided by mean fluorescence corresponding to ACE2 display level on the yeast surface (Supplementary Figures 4 & 5) . This normalization is applied to prevent potential differences in ACE2 display from biasing assessment of spike binding. SNVs with negative mutation effect values appear as blue dots, while SNVs with positive mutation effects are shown in red. Each dot represents an experimental replicate at varying spike protein concentrations. The grey bars show wildtype ACE2's binding signal to serve as a reference.",

Our work has identified ACE2 SNVs that are markedly distinct from the wild-type protein with respect to the above properties, and thus present new opportunities to interleave ACE2 biochemical studies, ACE2 variant animal experiments, and observations of the human population. This work has also revealed that mutations in ACE2 residues distal to the SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding interface may alter ACE2 properties relevant to SARS-CoV-2 recognition; this finding will motivate future empirical and in silico research efforts to expand their scope beyond the spike binding interface. Collectively our results provide key insights that can be readily actioned toward fundamental research, clinical studies, and epidemiological analyses for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The resulting SAM files were filtered to remove sites with a Phred quality score (Q score) of less than 30 and translated to amino acid sequences. The entire data set was filtered to remove amino acid substitutions with less than 10 observations. The unsorted and sorted ACE2 amino acid sequences were then analyzed using a positiveunlabeled (PU) learning method that estimates how amino acid substitutions affect a protein's function [15] . The PU learning method returns an estimated coefficient, also referred to as the mutation effect, and a p-value corresponding to each amino acid substitution. Coefficients with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered to have a significant effect on spike protein binding. The importance of each site in ACE2 was evaluated by aggregating all mutation effects at a given position. We calculated the mean absolute value of all coefficients at each site to generate a \"site importance\" profile across the extracellular domain of ACE2. A site with a large mean absolute mutation effect is likely to be important for spike protein binding.",

The ACE2 gene contained His to Asn mutations at positions 376 and 380 to abolish zinc binding and ACE2 proteolytic activity. The GeneMorph II Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was employed to generate a human ACE2 random mutant library using the wild type ACE2 display plasmid as template and respective forward and reverse primers CDspLt (5'-GTCTTGTTGGCTATCTTCGCTG-3') and CDspRt (5'-were digested NheI to MluI and ligated into the VLRB.2D-aga2 vector digested with these same enzymes. Ligation products were concentrated and desalted using the Zymoclean Clean & Concentrator 5 kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) and electroporated into 10G Supreme E. coli (Lucigen, Middleton, WI). Transformants were pooled and cultured in LB media containing 100ug/mL carbenecillin overnight at 30\u00b0C and plasmids subsequently harvested using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) Spin Miniprep kit.Yeast display Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EBY100 was made competent using the Sigma-Aldrich yeast transformation kit.

For induction of ACE2 mutant library display a 5 mL Sabouraud Galactose Casamino Acid (SGCAA, Per liter -Phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) -8.6 g NaH 2 PO*H 2 O / 5.4 g Na 2 HPO 4 , 20 g galactose, 6.7 g yeast nitrogen base, 5 g Casamino Acids) culture was started at an optical density, as measured at 600 nm, of 0.5 and shaken overnight at 250 rpm and 20\u00b0C. After overnight induction approximately 3*10 6 yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in pH 7.4 Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated overnight in 500 \u00b5L of PBS/0.2% BSA containing 150 nM His 6tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (Sino Biological, Chesterbrook, PA) and 5 \u00b5g/mL anti-myc IgY (Aves Labs, Tigard, OR) at 4\u00b0C on a tube rotator at 18 rpm. Incubation with a concentration of spike, i.e., 150 nM, well above the ACE2-spike RBD equilibrium binding dissociation constant (K D ) value was employed to maximize depletion of ACE2 mutants with very low or no binding to the spike RBD during FACS. Following overnight incubation yeast were washed once in PBS/0.2% BSA and rotated at 18 rpm in same buffer containing 5 \u00b5g/mL mouse anti-His 6 IgG (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) that had been conjugated with Alexa647 using the Nhydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) of this fluorophore and 2 \u00b5g/mL Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for one hour at 4\u00b0C.

Rescued plasmids were amplified via electroporation into 10G Supreme E. coli with subsequent culturing and harvesting as described above. For NGS analysis, amplified plasmid DNA from the post-FACS yeast population and unsorted ACE2 random mutant library yeast display plasmid DNA were digested in separate reactions using PstI and XhoI restriction enzymes. Digested plasmids were run in a 1.2% agarose gel and the ACE2 band was excised and purified using the Zymo Gel Extraction kit (Zymo Research). Purified DNA was submitted to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center DNA Sequencing Facility for analysis.To assess the effects of the respective ACE2 missense mutations noted inFigure 2on CoV-2 spike binding affinity, these mutations were introduced into the wild type ACE2 gene via overlap extension PCR and resultant mutant genes were ligated into the VLRB.2D-aga2 yeast display vector using NheI and MluI sites as described above. Ligations were subsequently transformed into NEB-5\u03b1 chemically competent E. coli (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and single colonies picked for culturing, plasmid harvest, and sequencing to verify correct introduction of SNV mutations. Plasmid DNA for each respective member of the collection of SNV ACE2 genes was transformed into EBY100 yeast made competent using the Zymo Research Frozen EZ Yeast Transformation II kit with transformants grown on synthetic dropout (SD) -Trp (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) agar plates for two days at 30\u00b0C.After two days of growth on SD -Trp agar plates respective yeast colonies for SNV and wild type ACE2 yeast were picked into 4 mL of low pH SDCAA and grown overnight at 30\u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm. These cultures were subsequently induced in 5 mL of SGCAA overnight at 20\u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm; induction culture starting OD was 0.5.
