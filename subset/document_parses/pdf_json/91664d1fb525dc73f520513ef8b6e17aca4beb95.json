In this study, we tested serological and cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in 16 patients treated with Ibrutinib, 16 treated with maintenance Rituximab, 18 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with watch and wait status and 21 healthy volunteers. In comparison with the healthy volunteers, where serological response was achieved by 100% subjects, patients on B-cell-targeting therapy (Ibrutinib and Rituximab) had their response dramatically impaired. The serological response was achieved in 0% of Rituximab treated, 18% of Ibrutinib treated and 50% of untreated CLL patients. Cell-mediated immunity analysed by the whole blood Interferon-\u03b3 Release immune Assay developed in 80% of healthy controls, 62% of Rituximab treated, 75% of Ibrutinib treated and 55% of untreated CLL patients. The probability of cell-mediated immune response development negatively correlates with disease burden mainly in CLL patients. Our study shows that even though the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is severely impaired in patients treated with B-cell-targeting therapy, the majority of these patients develop sufficient cell-mediated immunity. The vaccination of these patients therefore might be meaningful in terms of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Haematological malignancies induce immune disturbances. [1] The immune defects are commonly worsened by treatment with Fludarabine, Rituximab and other agents that induce longterm paralysis of the immune system. [2, 3] Those patients not only have decreased immune response against infections, but also their ability to develop sufficient serological response to vaccination is decreased. This immune deficiency has been well documented in patients treated with B-cell-targeting therapies (either Rituximab or Ibrutinib). The mechanism of action of both drugs is considerably different. [4] Rituximab depletes CD20 expressing B cells by inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis by down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. [5] As the CD20 is expressed only on B cells, but not on stem cells or mature plasma cells, the treatment preserves established humoral immunity, whereas the capacity to generate humoral immune response to recall antigens is impaired [4] . Ibrutinib inhibits B-cell proliferation and survival by irreversibly binding the protein Bruton's tyrosine kinase. The treatment promotes apoptosis, inhibits proliferation and prevents CLL cells from responding to survival stimuli [6, 7] . The treatment allows for partial reconstitution of normal B cells and humoral immunity in patients with CLL; nevertheless, the humoral response to vaccines is compromised. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Even though the mechanisms of action of Ibrutinib and Rituximab differ, both groups of patients show insufficient serological response to both bacterial (pneumococcal) and viral (hepatitis B, influenza) vaccines. [8] [9] [10] [11] [13] [14] [15] In this study, both serological and cell-mediated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines [16, 17] in patients treated with B-cell-targeting therapy was investigated. Based on previous research, we anticipated the impairment of serological response to vaccinations. [18, 19] In addition to antibodies, the vaccine generates virusspecific T cells that are required for protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and that might play crucial role in patients with B-cell-targeting therapies. [20] [21] [22] [23] Even if both Rituximab and Ibrutinib target primarily B cells, they might have a minor impact on T cells, as well. Ibrutinib restores both T-cell number and function in CLL patients by binding on interleukin-2-inducible kinase (ITK) and by reducing the expression of exhaustion and inhibitory markers such as PD-1 (programmed death 1) and CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4) [24] . The ITK binding subverts Th2 immunity thereby potentiating Th1-based immune responses. [25] The capacity of the vaccine to generate cell-mediated immunity in the patients treated with either Ibrutinib or Rituximab was yet to be systematically investigated.",

            "text": "The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 killed nearly 5 million of people worldwide and has significant impact on the lives of the whole planet. The most powerful weapon against the pandemic is the vaccination that significantly reduces the mortality and morbidity caused by the virus. [28] The effect of the vaccination is routinely monitored by the examination of the antibodies (anti-Spike protein). Immunocompromised and haematologic patients (mainly those receiving B celldepleting therapies) are unable to produce antibodies, thus making the assessment of vaccination efficacy complicated. This was confirmed by our work that showed that none of anti-CD20-treated patients and only 18% of Ibrutinib-treated patients (3 from 16) produced anti-S antibodies. This data is identical with what has been observed by Herishanu and colleagues (none of the patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies < 12 months before vaccination and 16% patients treated with BTKi serologically responded) [19] and similar to data of Roeker and colleagues (32% of the patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies < 12 months before vaccination and 32% patients treated with BTKi serologically responded). [18] Experimental data, however, show that an important role in the defence against viruses including SARS-CoV-2 is played by T cells that are also abundantly generated by the vaccines. [20] [21] [22] [23] To analyse the cellular immune response, we have chosen commercially available whole blood Interferon-\u03b3 Release immune Assay that uses mixes of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins selected to activate both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. This test showed certain concordance with anti-S antibody response in healthy subjects. [27, 29] Our analysis showed that significant fraction of both Ibrutinib-and Rituximab-treated patients develop cellular response to the vaccination (75% and 62%, respectively). This is not completely surprising, as similar data were reported either by case reports or by small patient series. For example, Hueso and colleagues [30] analysed T-cell response by ELISPOT in 3 anti-CD20-treated patients and reported reactivity in all of them. Malard and colleagues [31] used ELISPOT to show that the haematological patients develop a T-cell response to the BNT162b2 vaccine. The anti-B-cell treatment did not affect the probability of developing the response. One should emphasize that the studies vary by methods used to analyse T-cell response and peptide pool selection. Their comparison is complicated, but the similarities are striking. The probability of developing the cellular response increased with higher percentage of T cells. It seems intuitive, as larger T-cell pool would have higher probability of containing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and generating IFN-\u03b3 upon specific stimulation. However, the cellular response to vaccination does not correlate with absolute amount of T cells. Instead, it inversely correlates with the amount of B cells in Ibrutinib-treated and CLL groups suggesting that the generation of the cellular immune response to vaccine is hampered by the disease burden. It is not surprising as malignant B cells (typically CLL) inhibit cellular immunity. [32] Moreover, the analysis of CLL patients (WaW + Ibrutinib) showed that the cellular immune response inversely correlates with the fraction and total amount of CD69 positive B cells (not shown). CD69 overexpression significantly correlates with disease burden and prognosis (advanced Rai stages, larger lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, shorter progression-free survival and overall survival). [33] Finally, common markers of disease activity, such as LDH and beta-2-microglobulin, were both increased (not statistically significantly) in non-responding CLL patients.",

The proportion of responding patients is slightly higher in the Ibrutinib group suggesting that Ibrutinib can overcome the negative impact of CLL on the cellular immunity. It has indeed been shown that Ibrutinib restores T-cell number and function in CLL patients by various mechanisms including targeting of ITK, PD-1 or CTLA-4. [24, 34] Our analysis across practically all groups showed that responding patients have shorter time from vaccination to analysis than non-responding patients. It suggested that the cellular response weakens through the time as it was raised by epidemiologic and immunological studies. [35] [36] [37] [38] In conclusion, our work shows that humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is severely impaired in patients treated with Rituximab and Ibrutinib. Significant fraction of these patients mount cellular immune response to the vaccine. The capacity to develop cellular response is compromised by disease burden in CLL patients.",
