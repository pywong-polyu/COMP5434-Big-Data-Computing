All TB-HIV+ patients were on treatment with lamivudine, tenofovir (or zidovudine), and raltegravir (or efavirenz). Serial blood sampling was collected over 24 h and FLATDs pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using noncompartmental methods. In the TB-HIV+ patients, dose-normalized plasma exposure area under the curve from zero to 24 h (nAUC 0-24 ; geometric mean and 95% confidence interval [CI]) values at steady-state to rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were 18.38 ) \u00b5g\u2022h/ml, respectively. Similar plasma exposure was found in the TB-HIV\u2212 patients. The geometric mean and 90% CI of the ratios between TB-HIV\u2212 and TB-HIV+ groups suggest no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between the selected antivirals and FLATDs. Likewise, HIV coinfection itself does not appear to have any effect on the plasma exposure to FLATDs.",

In 2019, 10 million people were diagnosed with TB, a number that has been relatively stable in recent years; 1.41 million people died of TB. Moreover, TB is a leading cause of death in patients coinfected with HIV (0.208 million deaths in 2019). 1 In 2015, there were 2.1 million new HIV infections worldwide resulting in a total of 36.7 million people living with HIV globally. The risk of developing TB is 17-to 22fold higher for people living with HIV, making HIV the most important predisposing factor for TB. 2, 3 TB and HIV act synergistically on the decline of the host immune response, which is fatal if left untreated. 4, 5 Current TB treatment consists of a 2-month period with four first-line anti-tubercular drugs (FLATDs): rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (ETB) followed by 4 months of RIF and INH. 6, 7 This treatment was developed over 40 years ago based on empirical evidence without taking into account the relevance to fluctuations in plasma exposure to FLATDs. 8 In fact, high variability in pharmacokinetics has been reported for FLATDs, with patients who are exposed to lower drug levels being at a potentially higher risk of treatment failure. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In addition, given the broad spectrum of antiretroviral therapy (ARVT), there is no consensus regarding the need for dose adjustment for FLATDs regimens in HIV coinfected patients. 8, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] It is important to highlight that the chronic or persistent inflammatory status observed in patients with TB and HIV receiving ARVT may result in changes in alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and albumin levels in plasma, as well as increased expression of ABCB1/P-gp or decreased expression of MRP2; ABCC2 and BCRP/ABCG2. 22, 23 Such changes can potentially affect the tissue distribution as well as the systemic exposure to FLATDs.",

Raltegravir plasma concentrations are significantly decreased when co-administered with RIF 25 requiring dose adjustment to 800 mg twice daily. However, conflicting data have been observed in the magnitude of changes in efavirenz plasma concentrations when associated to RIF. 26, 27 Although the treatment of HIV infection has evolved with the approval of novel drugs over the last decade, the consequence of potential pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interaction of these new therapies with FLATDs has not been fully characterized or embedded into current guidelines for the treatment of TB. In addition, there has been no specific evaluation of the effect of HIV coinfection on the disposition of FLATDs in patients with TB. 8, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Instead of attempting to further characterize the implications of such interactions, clinical trials exclude patients with HIV who are TB coinfected. Similarly, HIV positive patients with TB are excluded from TB drug trials. These exclusion criteria overlook the prevalence of TB and HIV coinfection.",

            "text": "PZA is a prodrug that undergoes activation by M tuberculosis nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase, as well as, by liver amidases to generate the active metabolite pyrazinoic acid, which is primarily eliminated by the liver xanthine oxidase to 5-hydroxypyrazinoate. 37 ETB diffuses into actively growing Mycobacterium cells and reaches the highest concentrations in erythrocytes, kidneys, lungs, and saliva. Approximately 20% of ETB is metabolized by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases to the dialdehyde and dicarboxylic acid metabolites, whereas unchanged ETB is excreted in urine (nearly 50%) by glomerular filtration and in feces (nearly 20%). 38 RIF is a strong potent inducer of CYP isoforms (2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4), aldehyde dehydrogenases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfonyl transferases, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), P-gp, and MRP2. 39,40 RIF increases intestinal P-gp abundances three to fourfold with minimal impact on renal P-gp and reduces the exposure of the P-gp substrates when administered orally. 40 RIF is metabolized by carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) and is an organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP) substrate. 41, 42 Raltegravir and zidovudine are predominantly metabolized by UGTs. 43 Raltegravir is not a substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of CYP isoforms, P-gp and OATP1B1, whereas zidovudine is a substrate and a possible inhibitor of MRP4, MRP5, and BCRP. 44, 45 Tenofovir is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP and possibly an inhibitor of MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3. 43, 45 Efavirenz, a CYP3A and BCRP inducer, 39,45 is metabolized mainly by CYP2B6 and to a lesser extent by CYP2A6 and UGT2B7. 43 Lamivudine, a P-gp and an organic cation transport protein (OCT) substrate, is mainly eliminated unchanged by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion dependent on P-gp, and OCT. 43, 45, 46 Therefore, it can be noticed that RIF, PZA, and ETB are not mainly metabolized by CYP isoforms and are not known to be important P-gp, MRP, or BCRP substrates. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Accordingly, the antiretroviral drugs have minimal potential to influence the plasma exposure to FLATDs. 26 L\u00f3pez-Cort\u00e9s et al. 26 and Sundell et al. 47 reported, respectively, that the plasma exposure to RIF and PZA did not change when co-administered with efavirenz in TB-HIV+patients, suggesting that rifampicin and PZA could be used with efavirenz without dosage adjustment. T\u00f6r\u00f6k et al. 33 also showed that the pharmacokinetics of RIF, isoniazid, PZA, and ETB were not changed by the ARVT constituted by zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz in TB-HIV+ patients with tuberculous meningitis. Given that standard of care drugs for the treatment of HIV are known to have limited potential of influence the plasma exposure to FLATDs 26, 32, 33, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] and no patients had a history of diarrhea or vomiting episodes during and in the days preceding the clinical trial, the main difference between the TB-HIV+ and TB-HIV\u2212 patients in our study was HIV coinfection. Besides that, there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics parameters of RIF, desRIF, PZA, and ETB in the TB-HIV+ group between the patients treated with efavirenz or raltegravir (see multivariate analysis of variance [ANOVA] in Supplementary S1).",
