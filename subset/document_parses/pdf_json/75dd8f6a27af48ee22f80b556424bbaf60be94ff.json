            "text": "The clinical features are quite variable and a common pathophysiology of this disease to explain the variation in the clinical features has yet to be described. The virus can directly invade cells of the upper and lower respiratory tree via its receptor binding domain by attaching to the ACE2 receptor on those cells. This is facilitated by TMPRSS2, to initiate the viral infection (2) . Fortunately, most cases, 81%, are mild and self-resolve (3) . In one series approximately 14% were classified as severe (dyspnea, respiratory frequency >30/min, blood arterial oxygenation <93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300, and/or infiltrates >50% within 24-48 h), and 5% are critical (i.e., respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure) (3) . The most common presenting symptoms to the hospital were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia (4) , symptoms suggestive of viral pneumonia (5) . Of the patients with severe disease, they were noted to be older, male, and had other comorbidities (3, 4) . In the more severely ill patients there was elevation of inflammatory cytokines suggestive of immune dysregulation (2, 4, 5) and possible autoimmunity. A review of other viral induced autoimmune disorders with particular attention to viral induced secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), and the related syndromes of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) which is also called Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome -Toxic Shock (PIMS-TS), Kawasaki Disease, and myocarditis will hopefully lead to greater understanding. Type IV and Type II hypersensitivity autoimmune responses secondary to COVID-19 are compared with the Type IV and Type II responses seen in other viral induced autoimmune diseases. Studies in the immunology literature point to a different pathophysiology than that accepted by some clinicians but explain the partial efficacy of the immunosuppressive regimens used to date. The potential use of other therapies based on immunology and clinical research may prove to be more efficacious in COVID-19.",

There were also increased concentrations of CCR6 + and Th17 in the CD4 + T cells. CD8 + T cells had high concentrations of cytotoxic granules in which 31.6% of cells were perforin positive, 64.2% were granulysin positive and 30.5% were granulysin and perforin double positive.

It is differentiated from primary HLH which has a similar clinical presentation but is caused by genetic defects in natural killer cells (NK), and T cells and usually appears in children. The difference between the two can be confusing because the phenotypic presentation is the same, but the inciting pathophysiology is vastly different. Secondary HLH associated with viral syndromes was first reported by Risdall et al. (20) . The dysregulated inflammatory response causes fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting one or more of three lineages in the peripheral blood), neutropenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated ferritin, hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes, low or absent natural killer (NK)-cell activity, and elevated soluble CD 25 (interleukin [IL]-2 receptor) (21) . Excessive cytokine production (cytokine storm), by macrophages, NK cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is thought to be the primary mediator of tissue damage (21, 22) . A number of viruses have been linked to secondary HLH including avian influenza A subtype H1N1, SARS-CoV, Ebstein Barr, and rotavirus (23) .",

            "text": "The pathologic manifestation of secondary HLH is the result of the excessive and persistent activation of macrophages and T cells (22) but there is also impaired cytotoxic function by NK cells and CD8 + T cells (24) . Secondary HLH tends to have less severe clinical manifestations than primary HLH, but mortality is still considerable. A murine model of HLH has clarified the pathophysiological steps that result in the persistent activation (24) . In a normal immune system, antigen presenting cells process the infecting virus and present viral peptides to CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. The T cells proliferate and differentiate and produce cytokines that activate APCs, including macrophages, to further augment antigen presentation in a positive feed forward system. CD8 + T cells produce INF\u03b3, which is a potent stimulator of macrophages, and CD8 + T cells can also lyse viral infected APCs via a perforin dependent mechanism. Perforin dependent mechanisms are also a negative regulator in this positive feed forward activating system. The murine model was deficient in perforin (pfp \u2212/\u2212 ), and was infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitic virus (LCMV), a non-cytopathic virus that is common in wild mice. In the wild type mice, the virus causes a transient fever, and all survive. After infection, the pfp \u2212/\u2212 mice developed prolonged fever, splenomegaly, pancytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and all mice die within 2 weeks. Histologic features included periportal infiltrates in the liver, disorganized infiltrates of macrophages and activated lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes. In the bone marrow, the CD68 + macrophages display MHC class II molecules, a sign of activation, and this correlated with a significant increase in IFN\u03b3 secreting CD8 + T cells compared to wild type mice. The pfp \u2212/\u2212 mice produce significantly elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and M-CSF and INF\u03b1, like humans with sHLH. To determine which cell lines were responsible for the cytokine secretion, 6 days after infection, the pfp \u2212/\u2212 mice were injected with monoclonal antibodies to deplete CD4 + , CD8 +, or NK 1.1 cells. Most of the mice injected with the anti-CD8 + antibody survived while those injected with the anti-CD4 + or anti-NK1.1 antibodies did not. Additionally, when double knockout mice deficient for T and B cells and pfp \u2212/\u2212 were inoculated with LCMV, all survived. These experiments indicated that CD8 + T cells were essential to develop sHLH. A series of neutralizing experiments were done to determine which cytokines were key in the pathophysiology. When INF\u03b3 was neutralized, most of the mice survived, while neutralization of the other cytokines mentioned above did not provide a survival benefit. IFN\u03b3 secretion was found to be more prolonged and elevated in the pfp \u2212/\u2212 mice than the wild type mice. When immune cells were studied ex vivo almost all the IFN\u03b3 + cells were CD8 + T cells. When the pfp \u2212/\u2212 mice were depleted of CD8 + T cells, they had significantly lower levels of IFN\u03b3. If INF\u03b3 was blocked in pfp \u2212/\u2212 mice 6 days after infection, the histiocytic infiltrates and the cytopenias did not develop. To study what was causing the excessive production of IFN\u03b3, CD8 + T cells were assayed in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow of the pfp \u2212/\u2212 and wild type mice after infection. The number of CD8 + T cells were similar in both groups but a LCMV antigen specific assay revealed that the number of antigen specific CD8 + T cells were elevated by two to fivefold in the pfp \u2212/\u2212 mice over the wild type mice. Antigen specific staining also revealed that the CD4 + T cells had similar elevations. While the population of antigen specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were elevated two to fivefold, the elevation of INF\u03b3 was elevated between 10 and 1,000-fold compared to the wild type mice. It was determined that the number of CD8 + T cells spontaneously producing IFN\u03b3 were elevated without stimulation. Further studies indicated that after 6 days from infection both the wild type and the pfp \u2212/\u2212 mice had significant levels of virus in their spleens, but the pfp \u2212/\u2212 mice had 10-fold higher levels of infectious virus. These data indicate that persistent viral presentation led to elevated INF\u03b3 production. Failure to clear the virus secondary to impaired cytotoxic function led to the overproduction of INF\u03b3 by CD8 + T cells. The study reveals that sHLH is a T cell driven process wherein failure to clear the virus leads to prolonged and excessive T cell stimulation which in turn drives other immunological processes. The study revealed two possible therapies for sHLH: CD8 + T cell depletion and blocking IFN\u03b3 function.",

Studies in a primate model show that during inflammatory states, the IL-17 producing CD8 + cells may be fourfold higher in the lung and the CD8 + cells in the lung can produce more IL-17 than the cells in the blood (25) .

Immune cells and cytokines in peripheral blood were evaluated to determine factors related to the pathophysiology. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are markedly reduced but there is no difference in the numbers of B cells, NK cells, or leukocytes between patients and controls. CD4 + T cells have indicators of activation and a subset of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have indicators of exhaustion. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed for INF\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, GM-CSF, and IL-6 and a high expression of GM-CSF + and IL-6 + expressions were found in the CD4 + T cells. Pathogenic Th1 CD4 + T cells co-expressing IFN\u03b3 and GM-CSF were found only in the ICU patients indicating that these cells play an important role in the hyperinflammatory response of COVID-19. CD8 + T cells from ICU patients also showed a higher expression of GM-CSF compared to non-ICU or control patients. GM-CSF stimulates monocytes and the percentage of CD14 + and CD16 + monocytes was much higher in the severely ill patients in the ICU. These monocytes also can secrete GM-CSF and IL-6 to further enhance the inflammatory storm. The excessively activated immune response initiated by Th1 T cells and enhanced by CD 14 + and CD16 + monocytes may cause the pulmonary pathology of COVID-19. The authors suggest that IL-6 blockade may be helpful in COVID- 19. These studies all point to a prolonged and excessive activation of T cells that then leads to the T cell mediated damage in the sHLH presentation in COVID-19. While this is evidence that the pathophysiology of sHLH meets the definition of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, the etiology of that prolonged and excessive stimulation is an active area of study.",

            "text": "When viruses invade the host APCs and start to replicate, this initiates a cascade on antiviral defenses. The viral replication products, called viral pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), are recognized by host cell pattern recognition receptors (PRR), that activate transcription factors i.e., interferon regulator factors (IRFs), and nuclear factor B (NF-B). NF B leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while IRFs lead to the production of Type I and Type III interferons that are capable of inhibiting viral replication. The Type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-, and IFN-), bind to the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) at the plasma membrane in an autocrine and paracrine manner (27) (28) (29) . A robust antiviral defense program initiates and hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), are produced which have the capability to interfere with every step of viral replication. Type III INFs (INF-\u03bb), bind to the IFNLR receptor that is preferentially expressed on epithelial and some myeloid cells. Viruses have unfortunately developed mechanisms to avoid detection and to suppress the functions of IFNs and ISGs. Transcriptome profiling of certain cell types reveals that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits exceptionally low INF-I and IFN-III and reduced ISG while inducing pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine genes (30) . The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a nonstructural protein (NSP16), that is over 92% identical to a protein in SARS-CoV-1 and it is able to hide the SARS-CoV viruses from the double stranded RNA pattern recognition receptors of the host cell. This protein system and others of the SARS-CoV-2 virus antagonize the production of the interferons that would otherwise inhibit viral replication. Studies have also shown that monocytes from older humans have defective IFN-I and IFN-III production while maintaining intact production of inflammatory cytokines (27) . These factors may partially explain the poorer prognosis in older patients. The potential therapeutic uses of IFNs are discussed later but these studies infer that ineffective clearance of the virus results in prolonged replication and subsequent overstimulation of T cells.",

Patients with an infection other than EBV had a 5 year survival rate of 78.7% demonstrating dramatically improved response over patients with primary HLH. There is an anecdotal report of a critically ill 31-year old man with secondary HLH due to influenza A/H1N1 who improved with etoposide and steroids in addition to antiviral therapy (38) . This study emphasized that patients with viral induced secondary HLH should be considered for therapy only after they have met the diagnostic guidelines in HLH-2004 and that therapy was part of the HLH-94 protocol. The unique approach of these two papers to treat a critically ill patients with ongoing infections with powerful cytotoxic regimens aimed at modulating the immune system cannot be understated. The infectious agents initiated a severe autoimmune attack that was successfully treated with immunotherapy directed at a broad range of immunologically active cells. Treating an infection with powerful immunosuppression is a paradox with medical tradition and understanding. The role of antiviral agents in these scenarios is not yet proven, but it seems prudent to consider their use when using powerful immune suppression.",

            "text": "Macrophage activation syndrome, MAS, is a type of secondary HLH that occurs in the presence of an autoimmune disease, frequently in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), and the death rate is as high as 20-30% (39, 40) . Unlike viral induced sHLH, there is an underlying autoimmune disease already present that predisposes the patient to the syndrome. Many rheumatologists feel that MAS should be classified as sHLH as the clinical presentation and pathophysiology appears to be similar if not identical. Soluble IL-2 receptor alpha chain (sCD25), and sCD163 may be elevated and a defect in lymphocyte cytolytic activity is proposed as the major pathophysiology (41) . The first line therapy for sJIA is NSAIDs but many patients require therapy with biologic agents such as anakinra, canakinumab or tocilizumab or disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients with sJIA who develop MAS are frequently on immunosuppression at the time that they develop MAS, sometimes with the very agents that are being studied as a therapy for COVID-19, i.e., anakinra, canakinumab and tocilizumab. These biologic agents do not prevent MAS in sJIA patients, but the incidence of MAS does not seem to be increased in the sJIA patients who are already on them. MAS is a life-threatening condition with a significant mortality rate and the first line therapy is steroids followed by steroids plus cyclosporine. A report of two critically ill patients of MAS, unresponsive to steroid and cyclosporine, were treated with RATG with prompt improvement (42) . T cell depletion therapy might be considered for other sHLH patients unresponsive to conventional treatment.",

            "text": "An outbreak in London of a Kawasaki-like disease in children was reported in early May of 2020 (43) and second report soon followed from northern Italy (44) . The London report detailed an \"unprecedented cluster\" of eight children, six of whom were of Afro-Caribbean descent, who presented with hyperinflammatory shock with features of atypical Kawasaki disease. All initially tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on bronchoalveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal aspirates. A common finding was bright coronary arteries on echocardiogram and elevation of CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, triglycerides, and D-dimers. One child developed refractory shock, required extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation (ECMO), and then died from a large cerebrovascular infarct. The clinical picture suggested a hyperinflammatory syndrome with multiorgan involvement similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS). Before the report could be published, 20 more patients with similar symptoms presented to the hospital. The northern Italy report was from Bergamo province at the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic (44) . There was a 30-fold increase in the incidence of Kawasaki Disease (KD), per the American Heart Association 2017 criteria, compared to the previous 5 years. The AHA criteria include fever, conjunctivitis, changes in lips or oral cavity, laterocervical lymphadenopathy, polymorphic rash, erythema of the palms and soles, and induration of the hands or feet. Additional criteria included the elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP or both in the presence of anemia, thrombocytosis after 7 days of fever, hypoalbuminemia, hypertransaminasemia, leukocytosis, sterile pyuria or an echocardiogram showing coronary aneurysms. KD is usually a self-limiting, acute vasculitis of medium caliber vessels which nearly always affects children. In the acute phase, children may present with the hemodynamic instability of KDSS. Some patients may also have MAS. In the Italian experience, 50% of the patients had MAS with elevated ferritin, platelets leq181 \u00d7 10 9 /L, AST > 48 IU/L, Triglycerides geq156 mg/dl, and fibrinogen \u2264360 mg/dl. Fifty percent of patients had KDSS, 60% had abnormal echocardiograms, 55% had elevated troponin and all patients had elevated proBNP. The average age on onset was 3.5 years. All patients were treated with IVIG, but 70% of patients had a Kobayashi score (45) of 5 or more and so were treated with steroids in addition to IVIG. All patients recovered but the clinical and laboratory findings were different from previous patients with KD seen at that center in the previous 5 years. The COVID-19 associated patients were older, had respiratory and gastrointestinal involvement, cardiovascular involvement, and meningeal signs. Laboratory signs in the COVID-19 patients showed leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, increased ferritin, and markers of myocarditis, similar to the adult patients with COVID-19. The patients were noted to have a more severe disease course with resistance to IVIG, biochemical evidence of MAS, and clinical signs of KDSS. Other reports soon followed which added increasing knowledge to the syndrome (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) . The surge in cases seemed to follow 2-3 weeks after the peak in COVID-19 infection in the local area. Only about 25% required supplemental oxygen in contrast to the experience in adults. Most patients were treated with IVIG and if inflammatory markers persisted, steroids were added. Some patients were given anakinra (anti-IL-1), or tocilizumab (anti-IL-6). Patients with cardiogenic shock and/or myocardial compromise are at higher risk of death although the mortality rate seems quite low compared to the experience in adults. The disease has been labeled, \"Pediatric Multisystem Inflammation Syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in the United Kingdom and \"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in the United States. MIS-C has unique features of both a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction and a Type II hypersensitivity reaction. The sHLH and MAS signs and symptoms speak of a dysregulated T cellinitiated pathology consistent with Type IV hypersensitivity. Kawasaki disease has oligoclonal IgA plasma cells within the arteries of affected children (53, 54) consistent with a Type II hypersensitivity reaction. In comparison to adults, the Type IV hypersensitivity reactions i.e., sHLH and MAS, of MIS-C appear to be less severe, but the Type II hypersensitivity reaction of COVID-19 associated KD appears to be more severe than classical KD. Fortunately, the therapy for MIS-C, based on the therapy for KD, produces excellent results except for those with severe KDSS and myocarditis. In this subset of MIS-C patients perhaps a more aggressive therapy would be appropriate.",

Coxsackie B 3 virus (CBV3), which can cause myocarditis in humans, was injected into two mouse strains, CD-1 mice and Balb/c mice. In the CD-1 mice, the infection causes a systemic non-lethal reaction and viral replication is suppressed by day eight. Histologically, patchy infiltrates appear in the heart with macrophages and mononuclear cells on day 6, which resolves and fibroses by day 12. In the CD-1 mouse, pretreatment with rabbit anti-thymocyte serum greatly suppressed the inflammation and tissue injury after CVB3 infection. In the Balb/c mouse, the infection is invariably lethal but viral replication stops by day 8. Histologically, cardiac myofiber necrosis and infiltration of mononuclear cells are prominent by day 6 and worsens over the next 2 days and the animal eventually dies. Infected Balb/C mice deprived of T cells by lethal irradiation and thymectomy had a decrease in inflammation, necrosis, and mortality. Viral growth curves in both strains were not different than normal immunologically intact animals, this led the investigators to conclude that the virus initiates the immune response and, despite high titers of virus in the heart, the T cells were the important mediators in the severity of inflammation and tissue injury.",

When T cells induce cardiac injury of uninfected cells, myocarditis becomes an autoimmune disease (63) . Additionally, when control DBA/2 and Balb/c mice were infected with CVB3, they developed myocarditis, but if anti-thymocyte serum was administered immediately prior to and after inoculation, then myocarditis was prevented (64) .

No T cell depleting therapies have ever been part of a randomized prospective trial in myocarditis. While most reviews consider, \"immunosuppression, \" and mention the prospective randomized trials of steroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and IVIG, none of medications have generated convincing results. While these immunosuppressive medications have an effect on T cell dynamics, none of them profoundly deplete T cell populations, so it is not surprising that they have been inconclusive or even contraindicated in viral induced autoimmune disease. These reviews also stress that immunosuppression should not be given unless the patient has been determined to be virus free, a view that appears to represent a consensus statement and contrary to Woodruff 's classic study (61) . This is also a contradiction to the numerous animal studies that found that myocarditis was related to the manifestations of T cell mediated injury and not active infection or the presence of viral genome in the heart. The virus infection may initiate the autoimmune process but might otherwise be irrelevant to the outcome. The caveat might be that the murine studies focus on the acute pathophysiology of the disease which, in the human, presents as fulminant myocarditis while the non-T cell depleting therapies might be more appropriate for a chronic disease state.",

The B cell lineage produce these antibodies and myocarditis animal models point to the considerable impact that B cells and their resultant antibodies have in the pathophysiology (77) (78) (79) (80) (81) (82) (83) . Autoantibodies may be produced by an immune response to viral antigens that then cross-react with self-antigens in a process called molecular mimicry. Viruses may also injure myocardial cells and cause them to release self-antigens to which new autoantibodies may form (83) . Antibodies may be made against cell surface antigens as well as intracellular and even intra-mitochondrial antigens (79, 82) . Making the diagnosis of antibody mediated myocarditis can be challenging in that immunohistochemical studies may be difficult to obtain in community hospitals and the endomyocardial biopsy may be normal. While autoantibodies are well documented in some patients with lymphocytic myocarditis, it is probable, that autoantibodies play a role in the pathophysiology of Kawasaki disease associated with COVID-19. Autoantibodies are a product of the adaptive immune system wherein T cells and B cells interact to form antibody. A brief review of antigen recognition and antibody production and immunologic memory may reveal new strategies to remove harmful antibodies in COVID-19.",

They also present co-stimulatory molecules on their surface that work to activate na\u00efve T cells. The dendritic cells travel to lymph nodes where they will meet na\u00efve T cells, a few of which are specific for the MHC-peptide complex. In response to the MHC-peptide recognition, the na\u00efve T cells then become activated, secrete cytokines, undergo clonal expansion, and differentiate into effector and memory subsets. The effector T cells work to eliminate the virus while memory T cells are long lived, move out of the lymph nodes to sites where they may encounter viral antigens and rapidly respond to subsequent encounters with the virus. There are two major types of effector T cells, CD4 + T cells, or helper T cells, that help B cells to make antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and CD8 + T cells that are able to kill virus infected cells.",

The population of pre-sensitized memory T cells, that are capable of re-stimulating B cells to differentiate into plasmablasts and autoantibody producing plasma cells, also need to be eliminated. A successful plan to eliminate production of autoantibody must address two of the three systems for immunologic memory: memory T cells and memory B cells. The third system of immunologic memory, the long-lived plasma cells that are held within protective niches within the bone marrow, probably doesn't need to be addressed since COVID-19 is an acute disease and there is not enough time for long-lived plasma cells to compete for a survival niche.",

            "text": "IVIG is a successful therapy alone or in combination with steroids as mentioned above in the discussion of KD. IVIG is thought to work by a number of pathways including antiidiotypic antibodies, inhibition of cytokine gene activation, anti-T cell receptor activity, anti CD4 + activity, stimulation of cytokine receptor antagonists, inhibition of complement activity, and Fc mediated interactions with antigen presenting cells to block T cell activation (89) . Recent work reveals that these mechanisms are possibly erroneous. Studies in children with ITP in 1993 revealed that infusion of Fc fragments provided the anti-inflammatory properties of IVIG (90) . The anti-inflammatory properties of IVIG can now be attributed to Fc sialylation of IgG (91) (92) (93) . Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins and a single N-linked glycan is found at Asn297 in the Fc fragment. This covalently linked complex glycan is composed of a biantennary heptapolysaccharide containing N-acetylglucosamine and mannose and two terminal sialic acid residues (93) . Further modifications of this carbohydrate structure are common and over 30 different glycans have been identified at this one site and glycosylation of IgG is mandatory for Fc\u03b3R binding. The total anti-inflammatory activity of IVIG depends on the sialylation of the IgG Fc fragments and this represents only 5% of the IgG pool. The small amount of sialylated IgG in IVIG explains why large doses are required for its anti-inflammatory effects while much lower doses are required to treat hypogammaglobulinemia. The anti-inflammatory activity of sialylated IgG is also dependent of Fc\u03b3RIIB expression on immune cells in that when this receptor is deleted, IVIG loses its anti-inflammatory activity. The receptor for the sialylated IgG is not yet identified, but there is a mandatory interaction through the Fc\u03b3RIIB receptors ITIM motif that leads to a suppression of cellular activation. A decrease in sialylated IgG, acting through an unidentified receptor, may be the mechanism by which the \"rebound phenomenon\" occurs after plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis, by decreasing sialylated IgG, leads to the up-regulation of antibody synthesis in plasma cells and the rapid return of antibodies. Fortunately for children with KD, IVIG is enough of an immunosuppressant to decrease the harmful autoantibodies for many patients.",

When exogenous INFs are added to these SARS-CoV-2 infected cell systems, viral replication is inhibited, signifying that while the production of IFNs are inhibited, its protective functions within the cell are not (94) (95) (96) (97) . The use of exogenous IFNs is especially attractive since some are already available and have been used clinically in other diseases and therefore have an established risk profile. PEGylated IFN-\u03b1 was the standard of care for Hepatitis C virus until introduction of more effective drugs and IFN-\u03bb has undergone phase II clinical trials for Hepatis C virus.

While there are probably several initiating pathways to induce a cytokine storm, T cell mediated stimulation is well documented. T cell depleting medications have shown efficacy in sHLH, MAS and myocarditis and should be explored for COVID-19. The marked lymphopenia should not be a contraindication for T cell depletion since the population of T cells has most likely moved to the periphery and are no longer residing in the blood. T cells in the blood are only on their way to work. Given the efficacy of other medications like steroids, IVIG, and some of the numerous monoclonal agents, T cell depletion would be used for those patients displaying a rapid decline secondary to sHLH or MAS but before they are moribund. Patients with acute cardiac injury patterns, impending intubation, early shock, and patients who have failed other forms of therapy are potential candidates. To date, case reports using T cell depleting therapies for COVID- 19 have not been reported and should be considered an area of investigation. The combination of T cell depletion and anti-CD20 antibody for severe Type II hypersensitivity reactions not amenable to IVIG and steroids seems reasonable. None of the immunosuppressive medications have any efficacy in removing the offending virus and antiviral therapies should be employed to decrease the time of viral shedding. Remdesivir or other antivirals should probably be considered as part of a treatment regimen in COVID-19.",
