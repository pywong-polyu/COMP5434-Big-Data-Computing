In addition, due to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, other risk factors for antimicrobial resistance [7, 8] , such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation,, and other invasive devices are frequently reported in patients with COVID-19.",

In Spain, the number of reports on carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) has increased in recent years, and many hospitals have reported outbreaks of CPE. The impact of CPE in Spain is primarily due to OXA-48-producing and VIM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, although other species such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae are also increasing [10, 11] . An endemic situation of both, CPE infection and colonization, has been established in our hospital, mainly related with the isolation of OXA-48, as well as KPC and VIM-producing Enterobacterales [12, 13] . To our knowledge, although secondary infections due to MDR Enterobacterales have been occasionally reported among COVID-19 patients [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , no large series on infections due to CPE have been published.",

Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was done by qualitative real-time RT-PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum or lower respiratory tract aspirates. Patients were prospectively identified from microbiology laboratory records. All cases were reviewed by a senior Infectious Diseases specialist to determine the presence of true clinical infection and source. Patients were classified as having a CPE infection if they had a positive culture from a significant clinical sample and clinical signs of infection. Patients were excluded from the analysis if the positive culture was not associated with clinical signs of infection. Patients with incomplete data were also excluded from the analysis.",

Conventional microbiological testing (tracheal aspirate, blood and urine cultures) was requested by the treating physician when infection was suspected, and was not protocolized. All infections were defined according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention criteria [20] . Early-onset and late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were defined as pneumonia diagnosed before and after 5 d of mechanical ventilation, respectively [21] . The definitions of hospital-acquired, healthcare-associated or community-acquired infection are described elsewhere [22] : hospital acquisition was considered when symptoms of infection started >48 h after hospital admission or within 48 h of hospital discharge. Healthcare acquisition was considered if patients had attended haemodialysis or received intravenous chemotherapy in the past 30 d, had been admitted to an acute-care hospital for at least 2 d or had surgery in the past 90 d, or resided in a nursing home or long-term care facility. Other infections were considered community-acquired. Other variables collected were hospital ward of acquisition, Charlson comorbidity index score [23] and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score [24] , severity of systemic inflammatory response [25] , Enterobacterales species, carbapenemase type and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.",

CPE infections in COVID-19 patients were a late complication of the disease (median time to onset, 26 d), were acquired almost exclusively in the hospital, and diagnosed in patients admitted to the ICU. These findings are a consequence of the specific care of COVID-19 patients, many of whom have severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation [1] [2] [3] [4] . In contrast, due to changes in the health system resources caused by the pandemic, many CPE infections in controls were diagnosed in the ED and managed in an outpatient basis. It is important to note that during the epidemic peak (April 2020), practically all hospital and ICU beds of the hospital were dedicated to the care of COVID-19 patients.",

We have observed a higher prevalence of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in COVID-19 patients and controls, as a manifestation of the current epidemiological situation of the hospital in 2020 [12, 13] . Although unfortunately, a molecular investigation of the strains was not carried out, there was no epidemiological evidence of any outbreak of CPE during the study period. Other species of CPE, such as E. coli and E. cloacae, as well as different types of carbapenemase (NDM and OXA-48) have been described in series from Italy, Spain, France and USA [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Due to the variable prevalence of resistance among CPE isolates, therapy needs to be tailored according to the antimicrobial susceptibility test result. Different regimens of antimicrobials including CZA, carbapenems, aztreonam, tetracyclines, polymyxins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and fosfomycin have been used for therapy of these highly resistant isolates, with variable results [14] [15] [16] . CZA, amikacin, and tigecycline were the most active antimicrobials against KPC-and OXA-48-producing bacteria isolated in our patients, while aztreonam and ciprofloxacin were alternatives for some VIM-producing isolates [36] . We have found a high rate of resistance to colistin (27.4%) that can be explained in part by the significant proportion of S. marcenscens isolates (11%).",

An increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia has been reported in these patients when more sensitive diagnostic methods are used. Nonfermenting gramnegative bacilli and Enterobacterales have been frequently isolated in patients with late-onset VAP [21] . In agreement with this finding, we found CPE as the cause of late-onset VAP and tracheobronchitis in 11 and 4 of the patients with COVID-19, respectively. Another outstanding finding of the cohort was the more severe clinical presentation of CPE infections in COVID-19 patients, with an increased frequency of severe sepsis or septic shock, and a higher SOFA score. This finding could be explained by the underlying severity of the clinical status of these patients, secondary to the presence of severe viral pneumonia and respiratory failure [33] [34] [35] .",

UTI and pneumonia were the most common infections and were associated with a severe clinical presentation and a high mortality. KPC-producing K. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated bacteria, reflecting the current institutional ecology of the hospital. Given the progressive expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, institutions and regions with a high prevalence of CPE should be prepared for a significant increase in the prevalence of these infections. Implementation of increased surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship programmes focussed on CPE infections should be an essential component of management strategies for COVID-19 patients.",
