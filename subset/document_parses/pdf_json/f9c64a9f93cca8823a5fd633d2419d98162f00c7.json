These factors are strongly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB). The effects of feelings of detachment on mental health and on STB have been scarcely studied, together with the relation that it may have with available social support. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess potential pathways connecting these conditions. A nationally representative sample of Spanish adults (N = 3305) was interviewed during the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020). STB, social support, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured with the C-SSRS (modified version), OSSS-3, PHQ-8, and GAD-7 scales, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models and mediation analyses were performed. Social support and some of its components (i.e., social network size and relations of reciprocity) were associated with lower odds of STB. Detachment significantly mediated (22% to 25%) these associations. Symptoms of emotional disorders significantly mediated the association between social support components (29% to 38%)but not neighbourhood supportwith STB, as well as the association between detachment and higher odds of STB (47% to 57%). In both cases, depressive symptoms were slightly stronger mediating factors when compared to anxiety symptoms. Our findings suggest that interventions aimed at lowering depressive and anxiety symptoms, and STB should provide social support and help tackle the feeling of detachment in a complementary way.",

SARS-CoV-2 causes the Coronavirus disease , which has caused about 142.6 M confirmed cases and 3.0 M deaths worldwide in approximately 1 year, and from which 77,220 deaths have occurred in Spain (WHO, 2020) . Due to the lack of specific medical treatment, the main measures to contain COVID-19's spread and flatten its infection curve have been based on physical distancing, contact clustering in social bubbles, and stay-at-home orders. Specifically, in Spain, lockdown restrictions started on 14 March with 1811 confirmed cases and 59 deaths that day, and peaked on 29 March with 13,749 confirmed cases and 909 deaths (WHO, 2020) . By the end of the lockdown period (21 June), when the number of cases had already stabilized, Spain had the eighth highest number of cases worldwide (i.e. 249,659) , and the fifth highest COVID-19 death rate (i.e. 60.7/ 100,000) in the world (Ritchie et al., 2020) .The quarantine measures of self-isolation may have affected the social relationships of those whose only social contact was out of the home. These restriction measures have also broadened a range of mental health problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), loneliness, stress, and psychological distress in the general population (Chen et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020; Vindegaard & Benros, 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) .",

Moreover, objective and subjective components of social relationships may also affect the likelihood of suffering STB in a complementary way (Calati et al., 2019; Van Orden et al., 2010) . Objective factors include having quantifiable contact with, or support from, other people, while subjective factors include positive or negative feelings that could be associated with those objective factors. For the present study, we have used social support (a parameter comprising social network size, relations of reciprocity based on the sense of concern from other people, and neighbourhood support) and partner status as objective factors; and feelings of detachment from others as a subjective factor, which have been described as a key construct predicting suicide (Durkheim, 1951) .",

On the other hand, social support is a protective factor for both emotional disorders and suicide, and we wondered what role detachment plays in these relationships. Therefore, we hypothesized that detachment could partially explain the relationship between having a lower social support and living without a partner, with higher odds of having STB; and concurrently, we hypothesized that the relationship amidst these variables with STB could be mediated by symptoms of emotional disorders.",

The most recent data indicate that in 2019 in Spain 98.5% of households had a mobile phone and 74.9% had a landline telephone (INE, 2020) , which is why the DFRDD included more mobile than landline telephone numbers. First, a sample of Spanish mobile telephone numbers was generated through an automated system. Subsequently, landline numbers were selected from an internal database developed and maintained by the survey company to ensure that all Spanish geographical areas were adequately represented. Up to seven calls at different times of the day were attempted to each number.

This highlights the urgent necessity to better understand the effects of detachment on mental health in the general population, and the importance of also studying its relationship with protective factors, such as social support.

Future longitudinal studies should be designed to overcome this limitation. Secondly, the use of questionnaires and self-reported data can be tied to response bias which may affect the validity of the research. In this study, the most probable bias was social desirability, which was overcome by using clinically validated screening instruments to asses all the possible variables. Thirdly, some covariates related with the participants such as their lifestyle, traumatic events related with the pandemic, time spent on COVID-19 response activities, or other factors related to health behaviours that may be potential confounders could not be considered in this study. However, we have used several control variables about the participants' physical and mental health, as well as regarding their sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, in order to minimize the bias. Finally, detachment has been relatively understudied, so the scarce literature on the topic hinders contrasting of our findings with others.
