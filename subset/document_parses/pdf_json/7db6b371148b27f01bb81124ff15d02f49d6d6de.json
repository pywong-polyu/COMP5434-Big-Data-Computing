So, to identify the pathogen responsible, metagenomic RNA sequencing of this patient's sample was done. The complete viral genome data suggested, this is a new RNA virus related to the family Coronaviridae which was later on designated as '2019-nCoV' or Novel CoV-19. This analysis revealed that this virus has more than 89% genomic similarity with a SARS-like bat coronaviruses which belongs to Sarbecovirus subgenus and Betacoronavirusgenus. On 11 February 2020, International Virus Classification Commission renamed this Novel CoV-19 as ''severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)'' on the basis of its genetic composition and similarity with other coronaviruses and the disease caused by the virus was renamed as COVID-19 [18] .",

Coronavirus has been classified into four genera (a-alpha, b-beta, c-gamma and d-Delta), out of which only two genera-alpha which contains CoV-NL63 & CoV-229E, and -beta contains CoV-OC43, CoV-HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV, found to be infectious for human [27, 44] . The genome of COVID-19 virus constitutes 29,903 nucleotides which upon fresh reannotation and mapping of the RNA-sequences obtained, presented the 123,613 reads assembly, and was very similar to SL-CoVZC45-an already known bat strain and SARS-CoV [17, 18, 42, 46] . This group of viruses can easily undergo mutation and recombination to adapt any environment and thus survive by altering wide host range [40] causing constant and long-term health threats, therefore it is necessary to understand its virology to prevent its rapid spreading and safety of mankind.",

The potential of a pathogen is estimated by its reproduction number (R 0 ) which is the average secondary cases can be infected by an individual. R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 has been told much higher (i.e. [ 2.5) than that earlier human coronaviruses, SARS (\\ 2) and MERS (\\ 1), hence potential of COVID-19 have more potential to causing pandemic, which has been turned true within short time span [10, 28, 49] . Even in some reported studies, the R 0 for SARS-CoV2 was estimated to be around 4, thus indicating even bigger pandemic situation than the present status [7, 30] . Asymptomatic carriers can increase the disease transmission to an uncontrollable manner if they will not be identified and quarantine in early stage. In such situation, mass screening for the disease becomes necessary and hence the fast testing devices are strongly advised to prevent the spread of the virus. Therefore, rapid, on-the-spot and accurate screening of potential virus carriers along with critical observation of patients without any indicative symptoms is very much essential for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the present review paper summarized the various detection methods available for the detection of COVID-19, their advantages, disadvantages and urgent need for a rapid POC detection method, on the spot biosensor their feasibly and importance in presence ever increasing countdown of COVID-19 infected patients.",

These methods use the pathological changes in the patient's organ by imaging like CT, or viral nucleic acid like RT PCR using one or more gene, or Next Generation Sequencing whole genome, immunological molecules produced by the patient or by the virus in the patient's body-Antigen-antibody reaction based tests like ELISA and utilizing each of these diagnosis approach has its their own advantages and shortcoming in present scenario ( Table 1) .

The NGS technology along with bioinformatics tools have largely influenced the modern viral parthenogenesis studies and viral diagnostics. This technology also played great application in the present COVID-19 outbreak. At initiation of current outbreak of SARS-CoV2, the samples from the patients admitted acute respiratory distress syndrome were negative for the all suspected already known pathogens, the etiological pathogen was identified by only NGS by doing metagenomic RNA sequencing and the phylogenetic analysis of its complete genome generated could conclude that it is a new strain of an RNA virus which belonged to the Coronaviridae family and was designated as SARS-CoV2 after nucleotide similarity and genome matching with the existing pathogen's genome [33] .Therefore, this technology has great importance for identifying unknown pathogens, and mutation or recombination in the genome of the pathogen in a short span of time, but the huge cost of ",

Testing is carried out at specific centers which further delays the diagnosis and make condition of patient severe. These PCR assays provide good results but on the other hand they are laborious and expensive as well. Some studies using RT-PCR SYBER green dye based assay found to be less specificity than TaqMan probe based assays. Similar results were reported recently in China by patients who self-collected saliva and showed 91.7% (11/ 12) positive SARS-CoV-2 while diagnosing by SYBR based RT-qPCR [43] . RT-qPCR assays have been reported highly sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV detection and also same for COVID-19, but this technology is prone to its false negative rates which could result in severe consequences due to missed diagnosis of COVID-19 [48] . The real example is present from the current outbreak of SARS-CoV2 where five patients were reported as negative by RT-qPCR, but found positive when CT scan examination of their chest was done and recollected samples repeated RT-qPCR, all patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 [50] . The sensitivity of RT-qPCR for detection of SARS-CoV was reported between 50% and 79%, that too depends on their adopted protocol, quality of sample (time of collection, amount, maintenance of cold chain) and total number of samples [9, 51] , and needs further improvement using synergistic approaches.",

The body's way of remembering the prior infection, and how it responded to infection in previous encounter is very crucial, so that the body is able to attack the same pathogen again is through antibodies. IgM appears within few days and act as first line of active defense, followed by production of IgG to start clearing the infection. All kind of infections are fought through IgM and IgG. The body's immune response mechanism can be utilized to detect the particular pathogen. The blood test for COVID-19 detect the protein (signature antigen/biomarkers) or antibodies particular to the virus so as for SARS-CoV2 with the confirmed SARS-CoV2 specific antibodies in case of antigen detection or confirmed SARS-CoV2 antigen in case of antibodies detection, and not produced for the seasonal flu or other virus. Currently, two types of COVID-19 tests have been reported one direct utilizing antigen based on detection of viral component present during the time of infection and the second indirect using antibodies that appears in patient's serum later due to development of immune response against the virus (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/overviewrapid-test-situation-covid-19-diagnosis-eueea).",

Also, antibodies-based diagnostic assays are not useful for early or active diagnosis of COVID-19, due to their longer time requirement (7 days or more) to be developed by the host to provides positive results, and so, the detectable antibodies are produced late after appearance of symptoms [3, 37] and once developed can persist long after the infection has been cleared.

These molecules can be any membrane protein, amino acids, toxins, immunoglobulins, cytokines, growth factors, coupling agents, ionic metals, intact cells or other small molecules. Apta-sensors can be easily converted to any specific design through surface activation or modification by chemical treatment to induce linkers and coupling sites. Due to their high reproducibility and purity, stability and reversibility under harsh environmental conditions with vast availability of target specific linkers, aptamers are being used as novel diagnostics tools [25, 26, 36] .",

Other than RT-PCR, SARS-CoV2 specific other diagnostic tests like rapid antibodies-based kits being used or under development seems not worthy for mass screening. It is essential to diagnose suspected cases at the clinic or hospital, but results take time anywhere from few hours to some days which is too slow for front-line screening. Thus, the requirement of rapid diagnostic tool like nano-biosensor based technology which can provide the diagnosis result within few seconds is quite high for mass screening and need to be developed at commercial scale as soon as possible.
