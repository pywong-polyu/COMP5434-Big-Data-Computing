Governing boards, administrators, and governments made decisions including eliminating faculty and staff, and programs yet these decisions were rarely inclusive of university stakeholders or innovative. This study's purpose is to examine and compare viewpoints of stakeholders in relation to addressing the financial impact of the pandemic in hopes of capturing innovative and effective pathways for universities. Because the purpose involved describing and comparing these viewpoints, the researcher selected a unique mixed method, Q methodology [Q] for this study. In Q, participants sort statements related to the topic into a grid such that their Q-sort provides a snapshot of their subjectivity. Participants' sorts are grouped empirically into factors, each representing unique viewpoints. Three distinct viewpoints emerged: 1) Focus on teaching mission and students, 2) University as a business, and 3) University as community. Views 1 and 3 were dominated by university faculty while View 2 was dominated by non-faculty including administrators and staff. Q's determination of distinguishing statements within each view provides the ability to compare these views' uniqueness. The three views and consensus among the views represent rejection of decisions to lay off faculty or close programs, among others, in order to balance university finances. The importance of tenured faculty in relationship to shared governance and academic freedom is especially stressed by two of the viewpoints. Implications for higher education policy, innovation, democratic problem-solving, and governance are discussed.",

Residential students were forced to leave their dormitories and return home. These actions were necessary to promote social distancing and deter the spread of the virus. Thus, administrators, trustees, and/or governments, in order to help flatten the curve regarding the spread of the virus, made decisions that created immediate change within their university communities (Shapiro, March 11, 2020) . Major (2020) called these unprecedented times for higher education with other pressing crises also impacting higher education including climate change and racial unrest.

University trustees and administrators tend to embrace neoliberalism and may be viewed as disassociated with the traditional education mission of universities (Taylor, 2017) . Yet other stakeholders are very possibly in the best position to offer balanced solutions to financial crises while preserving education-focused missions. Croucher et al. (2020) stressed that finding ways to make university governance and leadership more effective is especially important during the transformations present within the twenty-first century.",

Gigliotti (2021) found that there is a need for administrators to possess crisis leadership competencies especially in within the need for innovation and reinvention within higher education. Similarly, Trakman (2008) called into question using a twentieth century model for university governance in the twenty-first century. Expanding on this idea, Spillane (2006) and Vuori (2019) stressed the need to extend the concept of leadership from an individual or set of individuals to concepts such as distributed leadership. The concept of distributed leadership is one where people (leaders in title and those in follower roles) work together to meet needs and goals of the organization (Gronn, 2008; Vuori, 2019) . Without using the term distributed leadership, Rowlands (2017) and Trakman (2008) suggested that it is necessary for universities to find decision-making balance amongst faculty who best understand the institution and education mission and trustees who come from corporations and may better understand finances.",

However, it needs to be stressed that shared governance does not mean that faculty are simply consulted for input on various decisions to be made by the administration and board of trustees (DeCesare, 2017) . As changes to leadership in higher education are considered, shared governance consistently emerges as a means for institutions to better adapt, innovate, perform, and address challenges (Kezar & Holcombe, 2017) such as the pandemic.",

Within this model, leaders are only those with specific administrator titles (Rodela & Bertrand, 2018) . DeCesare (2017) explains that administrators and trustees do not understand the basic attributes and core principles of shared governance. Rhoades (2005) argues that for sustainability of institutions of higher education, institutions' administrators and trustees must move their approaches toward democratic accountability and true shared governance. Current research demonstrates that a top-down model is counterproductive to today's higher education landscape (Kezar & Holcombe, 2017) . Nevertheless, top-down decision making has been the norm regarding dealing with the impact of the pandemic at universities (e.g. Ma et al., 2021) . Referring to higher education in the US, Buff (2020) calls the current situation a protracted financial crisis that has its basis in decades of public disinvestment in higher education and administratively imposed austerity measures. Similarly, in relation to China, Ma et al. (2021) discuss a situation where hierarchical authority and crisis rhetoric also led to a loss of shared governance and academic voices. This description also fits into what Buff (2020) calls the managed campus, rather than the governed campus. In other words, the voices of faculty, staff, community members, and students have not been included in the decisions related to the pandemic including decisions that had a direct impact on academics.",

Nevertheless, Seltzer (September 2, 2020) clarified that it is auxiliary services that lost money as instruction moved to online and students moved back home. Remote instruction generated the same revenue as F2F while auxiliary revenue like student housing and dining halls lost millions. In the US, auxiliary services range from 5 to 30% of operating revenue for the higher education sector with a median of 13%.",

            "text": "In sum, universities and colleges sought various solutions to address budget shortfalls and decreases in revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trustees and upper administrators made these decisions, yet it remains unclear what others, including faculty and staff, see as the best solutions to the financial issues related to the pandemic especially when focusing on the education mission of universities. Taylor (2017) described administrators and trustees as seeing shared governance and unionized faculty as hindrances to their top-down management style. This study seeks to examine and compare the divergent viewpoints about how to handle financial problems due to the pandemic at universities, primarily those in the US, by stakeholders such as faculty and staff. Specifically, Q methodology was developed to offer a unique yet scientific means of exploring and comparing viewpoints on any topic (Brown, 1980; Stephenson, 1953) . William Stephenson (1935 , 1953 ) created Q methodology [Q] to scientifically and systematically study subjectivity. Q consists of a specific set of procedures, theory, and philosophy of science related to the study of subjectivity, meaning people's viewpoints (Brown, 1980; Stephenson, 1953) . Although Q has existed for over 85 years, its methodology resides within the qualitative-quantitative continuum of mixed methods research resulting in at least a somewhat idiosyncratic status within social and behavioral research communities (Ramlo, 2016) . Yet Q has been applied to research in diverse disciplines including education, political science, environmental studies, psychology, and marketing in order to investigate, describe, and compare subjective viewpoints amongst a set of participants (McKeown & Thomas, 2013) . It is worth noting that Q offers the kind of generalizability that centers upon phenomena (Brown, 1980; Thomas & Baas, 1993) rather than statistical generalizability associated with quantitative studies that use large numbers of randomly selected participants. The generalizability in Q is a qualitative type, rather than quantitative type, of generalizability (Thomas & Baas, 1993) .",

Thus, the power of Q is that it provides more detail about what multiple views exist along with the ability to describe, in more qualitative ways, those views. As McKeown (2001) asserted, alternatives to Q result in a loss of meaning. Additionally, the Q-sorting process provides a measurement tool such that participants provide their internal viewpoints for examination (Brown, 1980) . The processes of Q include development of the concourse (a universe of items, usually statements), the selection of the Q-sample from the concourse, the selection of participants, the collection of Q-sorts, analysis of the Q-sorts, and interpretation of the resulting analyses (Newman & Ramlo, 2010) .

Posts on these sites included an invitation to participate and a link to the website hosting the Q-sort. Eighty-three individuals completed a Q-sort. This is relatively large for a Q study; however, the researcher wanted to ensure the study included a diverse P-set in order best investigate divergent viewpoints.

Q-sorts were collected online using HtmlQ, which uses freeware database hosting coordinated with a cloud computing company that offers hosting for web applications. The pandemic alone did not create the need for online Q-sorting. The researcher wanted to reach a broad, geographic constituency and offering participation online helped ensure that diversity of the P-set. Most typically, Q-sorts are done face-to-face. Like the process done face-to-face, each online participant distributed the Q-sample into a sorting grid. Participants could move the individual statements into the various columns of the grid until they were satisfied that their arrangement reflects their viewpoint on the topic. The Q-sort allowed each participant to provide their internal viewpoint via their sort (Brown, 1980; Newman & Ramlo, 2010; Stephenson, 1953) . The sorting process is reflective and self-referent (Brown, 1980; Stephenson, 1953 ). Yet it is important to stress that there is no dependence upon constructed effects or operational definitions in Q. Certainly, validity is not at issue because there is no outside criterion for a person's own point of view (Brown, 1980) .",

I don't think there are no limits to tenure, but it is a central feature of higher education and should be preserved--not only for a sense of permanence, or even because some small number of faculty do controversial research, but also because it is the tenured faculty to who do much of the work of shared governance, and who have the permanence to be able to speak truth to power when need be.",

With agreement about retaining students, it is not surprising that there is also agreement about retaining faculty, academic programs, and current class sizes. This agreement is contributed to both financial considerations as well as student success during the pandemic, something that could also suffer. Thus, retaining students is seen as an important financial as well as institutional mission-based goal. Additionally, there is agreement that defunding public higher education is problematic and that universities should push the federal and state governments to provide special, additional funding to public higher education during crises such as the pandemic.",

In contrast to the consensus as well as the divergent viewpoints from this study, administrators and trustees at a growing number of US universities made the choice to eliminate full-time faculty, sometimes including tenured faculty, to address the expense of the pandemic. Additionally, many administrators and trustees have cut academic programs, furloughed faculty, and increased class sizes (Whitford, September 2, 2020) . Perhaps with greater communication across constituencies, different and innovative decisions would have been selected. Bornstein (2012) called on trustees, administrators, and faculty to respect each other's divergent viewpoints. Kezar and Holcombe (2017) and Bornstein (2012) agree that leadership from institutions of higher education must embrace new forms of leadership to address today's leadership challenges. More collaborative forms of leadership could provide improved adaptation, innovation, and performance for institutions of higher education, as suggested by Kezar and Holcombe (2017) , and this could be especially important during a crisis such as the pandemic. Similarly, Trakman (2008) called on higher education leaders to move to twenty-first century thinking to address twentyfirst century issues.",

Finding balance amongst faculty who best understand the institution and education mission and trustees who come from corporations and may better understand finances is necessary according to both Rowlands (2017) and Trakman (2008) . This study's findings are especially important because of the implications for democratizing decision-making in higher education in all countries, not just the US, as well as the ability to describe and compare divergent viewpoints. Although this study focused on institution finances due to the pandemic, Q could be used for other complex issues including social movements on campuses including Black Lives Matter and speech on campus -current issues that require innovative crisis leadership according to Gigliotti (2021) . Within such social, political, and financial issues, the ability to find innovative ideas and viewpoints could lead to innovation in higher education.",
