On April 7, 2021, the EMA admitted a possible link with very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low platelets after the administration of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) [6] . For this reason, the scientific community is working to support the concept of safer COVID-19 vaccinations. Moreover, researchers worldwide are focusing their attention on the so-called \"thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination\", producing several studies and publications [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, after a precautionary stop, on April 20, 2021, the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen received the authorization for its use by EMA that provided updated guidance, confirming that the overall benefit-risk profile remains positive. However, it has been confirmed that a small number of vascular adverse events involving blood clots in combination with low platelet counts may occur within approximately one to three weeks following vaccination [10] .",

It is also crucial to have a valid diagnosis for the referred AEFI, which could be an adverse or unwanted sign, an outlier laboratory result, a symptom or disease. Thus autopsy should be considered mandatory as the gold standard method in medicine to identify the exact cause of death. At the end of this step, the causality question is usually formulated.

Autopsy of the two exemplificative cases were performed according to the Letulle technique recommended for clinical and forensic assessment in case of suspected death related to vaccine administration [26] . Before tissue fixation, we collected fresh tissues from all organs, inserting each sample in cassettes containing RNAstabilizing solution, and storing them at \u221220 \u2022 C. For the first time, we adopted the protocol established by Sicily's Regional taskforce for the implementation of diagnostic findings and autopsy examinations in COVID-19 positive corpses or in the event of post-vaccination deaths [27] Biological fluids were also collected, such as blood (usually from the iliac vein or right atrium), urine, and bile. We harvested 2 samples of cadaveric blood, and 1 sample of fresh tissue (preferably spleen, to store at \u221220 \u2022 C) to perform the genetic tests for hereditary thrombophilia [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] ). To confirm the absence of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, a bone marrow biopsy at the left iliac crest was performed before the autopsy examination. Moreover, it is likely to be excluded by the negative history thereof and normal blood counts in repeated tests routinely done before the event in both subjects.",

The first step is the definition of a temporary relationship between COVID-19 vaccine administration and the onset of adverse effects. The second step is to analyze the temporal proximity to confirm that the symptoms occurred within a plausible time window after vaccine administration. According to the literature, three weeks after administration represent an ideal period that should be monitored to evaluate the AEFI after COVID-19 vaccination [8, 9] . The third step is the evidence examination to exclude the presence of other causes. This step may be subdivided into six subsections: (a) history; (b) patient's condition before symptoms; (c) patient examination; (d) immunization anxiety; (e) vaccine quality; and (f) immunization errors.

The first hypothesis is based on previous studies conducted on subjects who had suffered from similar thrombotic events. Indeed, the clinical features of the subjects involved in vaccine adverse effects resemble a well-described disease, the so-called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The pathogenesis of this disease is related to the occurrence of antibodies versus platelet factor 4 (PF4, a factor involved in blood clot formation). The anti-PF4 antibodies that belong to the IgG class may also be produced by patients not receiving heparin therapy, probably caused by exposure to substances of polyanionic nature (such as molecules involved in the vaccine composition). It is important to note that our cases confirmed this theory: indeed, the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies was always detected.",

In these cases, the cause could be a crossreaction with platelets of the new antibody. Indeed, following the aforementioned natural infection or vaccine administration, the antigens expressed on the surface of platelets or their precursors could be similar to the antigens of the pathogens (this phenomenon is known as molecular mimicry). As a result of this 'cross-reaction, platelets undergo lysis mediated by T lymphocytes or are phagocytosed by the 'scavenger' cells of the spleen [7] [8] [9] . Moreover, it is also not excluded that platelets are directly involved in the synthesis of the spike protein after vaccine administration, inducing a mechanism of the autoimmune response against the same cells [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .

This clinical picture is similar to the exemplificative cases, considering that we have excluded preexisting coagulation alterations. Intriguingly, the dramatic inflammatory hypercoagulability mechanism is similar to that of patients with a poor prognosis for COVID-19 [50] . This is not completely surprising because the observed picture belongs to the general mechanism of antibody directed enhancement, where paradoxically, the severe form of the disease shares aspects with vaccine adverse events [51, 52] .
