Notably, a deviation occurs between the distribution and certain demand of the labor force in the limited working face, which affects the realization of an extremely short construction period. To address this problem, we first introduced the stochastic coefficient of labor force equilibrium to measure the degree of labor balance. Second, a labor force equilibrium model with the realization goal of an extremely short construction period was established. Then, the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was improved from two perspectives to solve the proposed model. The update equation was rounded to solve practical project problems, and a dynamic variable inertia weight was adopted to ensure the PSO algorithm accuracy and convergence speed. Finally, through case analysis, we determined the extremely short construction period and best labor force distribution scheme. Moreover, the case results revealed that the established model is simple, operable and practical and that the proposed algorithm achieves a high search accuracy and efficiency in the model solution process. Overall, under the condition of resource tolerance, this study provides scientific and effective references for managers to realize an extremely short construction period.

            "text": "The construction period of engineering projects has always been considered an important research topic in the construction industry in China and abroad. In domestic engineering projects, the problem of the construction period has remained of great concern. In recent years, major emergencies have frequently occurred in China. Temporary rescue sites, road and bridge restoration, emergency hospitals and other projects have required each builder to rapidly respond to achieve loss and damage minimization [1] [2] [3] [4] . Due to the incident urgency, taking Huoshenshan and Leishenshan Hospitals under COVID-19-related constraints as an example [5] [6] [7] , China raised the efforts of the whole society to provide a large number of resources to ensure rapid high-quality construction within an extremely short period. The world was amazed by the construction speed of these two emergency hospitals. However, under the condition of a large quantity of aggregated human, financial and material resources, i.e., resource tolerance, compression of the project duration to the limit and realization of an extremely short construction period have become notable research issues. At present, scholars have mainly focused on resource constraints and the shortest construction period in engineering project management [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In particular, under resource constraints, scholars have investigated methods to reasonably arrange the start time of each activity based on satisfying the logical relationship among project activities, thereby minimizing the project duration. Additionally, the above has been demonstrated to be a nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard problem [13, 14] , and the research in this field largely includes the following two aspects:",

[15] established an optimization model aimed at project construction period minimization and effectively solved the problem via particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on priority and permutation. Peng et al. [16] further proposed the particle representation method based on priority permutation. Compared to the former method, the latter approach was verified to solve the problem more effectively. Vahid et al. [17] formulated a construction sequence plan with the realization goal of the shortest construction period based on building information modeling (BIM), developed computer programs with a genetic algorithm, and generated a stable construction schedule. Liu et al. [18] considered the factors of the material supply, cost constraints and various labor modes, established a model with the minimum construction project duration as the primary goal, and effectively solved the abovementioned problem. Xie et al. [19] focused on the constraints of the prefabricated component supply for prefabricated buildings, conducted in-depth research on the corresponding scheduling problem, effectively and reasonably distributed resources and reduced the completion time.",

Mohamed et al.

Wang et al. [24] evaluated multiple projects based on priority, proposed a schedule model with the shortest weighted construction period of multiple projects as the goal, and solved the proposed model with an adaptive PSO algorithm. Hauder et al. [25] , based on the minimum multiproject construction period, proposed two goals: activity balance and resource balance.

In addition, many resources (human, financial and material resources) can be wasted. When the distribution of the labor force in each working face is higher than a certain demand, the increase in labor force is not directly proportional to the construction speed. In other words, workers can decrease their work efficiency through working face reduction, thereby affecting the realization of an extremely short construction period. Therefore, under the condition of resource tolerance, it is necessary to perform in-depth research on the realization of an extremely short construction period of a project considering the important influencing factor of labor force balance in the limited working face.

Consequently, particles gradually reach the optimal position and obtain the best fitness value [36] . As an intelligent algorithm for global optimization of complex problems based on populations, the PSO algorithm has been widely applied to solve complex optimization problems in many fields. It has been verified that this algorithm provides the advantages of simplicity, easy implementation and good robustness [37] [38] [39] [40] .

As such, a comparison of the evolution curves of these two algorithms is shown in Fig 8. According to Table 4 and Fig 8, we found that the results and efficiency of the improved PSO algorithm are better than those of the standard algorithm. In terms of the target function value, the minimum time limit of the improved PSO algorithm is 253.26 days, which is shorter than the time limit of 256.19 days obtained with the standard PSO algorithm. In terms of the convergence speed, the proposed algorithm with a dynamic variable inertia weight converged onto the optimal solution in 25 generations, which is 5.2 times faster than the convergence realization of the standard PSO algorithm.

This study demonstrates that the stochastic coefficient of labor force equilibrium introduced can effectively optimize and adjust the labor force by measuring the labor force equilibrium degree in the limited working face, reduce the deviation between the labor force distribution and demand, and ensure a labor force balance. In the actual project simulation process, the established labor force equilibrium model aimed at the realization of an extremely short construction period and the model solution algorithm designed based on the PSO algorithm can facilitate the achievement of a labor force balance in each working face, determine the optimal labor force distribution scheme, and finally generate an extremely short construction period of the project of 253.26 days, 27.64% shorter than the contract construction period. In addition, compared to the standard PSO algorithm, the determined extremely short construction period is 256.49 days shorter than that determined with the standard PSO algorithm, and the solution speed is 5.2 times higher. Therefore, the simulation results not only verify the simple operability and practicability of the model but also verify that the designed algorithm (the improved PSO algorithm) achieves a high search accuracy and efficiency in the model solution process. The results of this study provide a certain theoretical support for managers to realize an extremely short construction period under the condition of resource tolerance. Moreover, against the background of a resource-saving society, it is very important to reduce resource waste and improve resource utilization. However, the model proposed in this study only considers the influencing factor of labor force equilibrium in the determination of an extremely short construction period, and the above examination of the solution method is insufficient. In future research, other factors influencing the realization of an extremely short construction period of engineering projects under the condition of resource tolerance should be comprehensively considered, and other problem solution methods should be further investigated to determine the extremely short construction period of engineering projects under comprehensive effects.
