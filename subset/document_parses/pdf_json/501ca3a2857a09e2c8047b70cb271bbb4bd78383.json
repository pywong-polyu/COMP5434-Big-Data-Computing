The rapid development of therapies is of major importance. However, our lack of understanding of the molecular processes and host cell signaling events underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection hinder therapy 20 development. We employed a SARS-CoV-2 infection system in permissible human cells to study signaling changes by phospho-proteomics. We identified viral protein phosphorylation and defined phosphorylation-driven host cell signaling changes upon infection. Growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling and downstream pathways were activated. Drug-protein network analyses revealed GFR signaling as key pathway 25 targetable by approved drugs. Inhibition of GFR downstream signaling by five compounds prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells, assessed by cytopathic effect, viral dsRNA production, and viral RNA release into the supernatant. This study describes host cell signaling events upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals GFR signaling as central pathway essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication. It provides with novel strategies for 30 COVID-19 treatment. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Supplementary",

In people, it causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often accompanied by severe respiratory syndrome (Chen et al., 35 2020) . To conquer the global health crisis triggered by COVID-19, rapidly establishing drugs is required to dampen the disease course and relieve healthcare institutions. Thus, repurposing of already available and (ideally) approved drugs might be essential to rapidly treat COVID-19. Many studies for proposing repurposing of specific drugs have been conducted in the last months, but mostly remain computational without tests in infection models (Smith and Smith, 40 2020; Wang, 2020) . In addition, they are hindered by the lack of knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the resulting host-cell responses required to allow 2 viral replication. To rationally repurpose drugs, a molecular understanding of the infection and the changes within the host cell pathways is essential. Experimentally identifying viral targets in the cell allows candidate drugs to be selected with high confidence for further testing in the 45 clinics to reduce the risks for patients resulting from tests with drugs lacking in vitro validation.",

            "text": "protein M was phosphorylated at three serines in close proximity, at the C-terminal, cytoplasmic region of the protein ( Figure 1F ), suggesting a high-activity modification surface. SARS-CoV-1 protein 6 was described to accelerates infections in murine systems (Tangudu et al., 2007) . We found a single phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 protein homologue non-structural protein 6 in host cells ( Figure 1G ) Protein 9b was modified at two sites ( Figure 1H ). However, its function in 100 SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Polyprotein 1b is a large 7,096 amino acid protein heavily processed to generate distinct proteins in SARS-CoV-1 (Tangudu et al., 2007) . We found polyprotein 1b to be modified at three residues, two in a region of unknown function and one in the non-structural protein 11 (NSP11) part of the protein ( Figure 1I ). Our data cannot distinguish whether phosphorylation occurred before or after cleavage and whether 105 phosphorylation may affect processing. SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was heavily phosphorylated ( Figure 1J ). Mapping phosphosites to the structure (residues 47 to 173, PDB: 6vyo) revealed a small surface region, suggesting specific regulation and interaction changes ( Figure 1K ). To reveal host kinases potentially phosphorylating viral proteins, we bioinformatically assessed identified phosphorylation motifs using NetPhos 3.1 and GPS5 (Blom et al., 2004; Wang et al., 110 2020) (Table S3) . Some motifs present in nucleoprotein were predicted to be modified by CMGC kinases. Among several others, casein kinase II (CK2) kinases are part of the CMGC family and have been independently identified as interaction partners of the nucleoprotein, when expressed in cells (Gordon et al., 2020) . Inhibition of CK2 kinases, could be employed to study possible functional interactions between kinase and viral protein. Taken together, we identified extensive changes in phosphorylation of host and viral proteins after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The roles of viral protein modifications remain unclear. However, targeting the corresponding host kinases may offer new treatment strategies.",

Patterns of co-regulation were identified using protein-protein 125 correlation and hierarchical clustering ( Figure 2A ). This generalized approach allows to study large scale patterns of dependencies of protein and phosphorylation levels, that then can be dissected into individual phosphorylation sites and protein levels for downstream analysis.

We mapped identified members of GFR signaling and their respective phosphorylation differences upon SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure  3C ) revealing an extensive overall increase in phosphorylation of the whole pathway, including related components for cytoskeleton remodeling and receptor endocytosis.

            "text": "Since GFR signaling seemed to be central during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examined the use of inhibitors as antiviral agents. Since there are several GFRs integrating their signaling and 190 regulating a number of processes inside the cell, directly targeting downstream signaling components is likely to be more successful to prevent signaling of different GFRs and to avoid mixed effects of multiple pathways. GFR signaling, amongst others, results in activation of 1) the RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK signaling cascade and 2) integrates (via phosphoinositide 3 kinase [PI3K] and protein kinase B [AKT]) into mTORC1 signaling to regulating proliferation ( Figure 4A ). To 195 explore the antiviral efficiency of targeting proteins downstream of GFRs, we first tested the PI3K inhibitors pictilisib and omipalisib (Ippolito et al., 2016; Sarker et al., 2015; Schmid et al., 2016) . Both compounds inhibited viral replication, based on their propensity to prevent cytopathogenic e ect (CPE) and viral RNA production in cells ( Figure 4B -D, S5, and S6). Our drug-target analyses identified mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K2, better known as MEK) 200 and the RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Wilhelm et al., 2006) as promising targets inhibiting downstream signaling of GFRs ( Figure 4A ). Thus, we tested sorafenib and the dual RAF/MEK inhibitor RO5126766 in our viral replication assays. Both compounds inhibited cytopathic effects during infection and the viral replication ( Figure 4B -D, S5, and S6). To validate our findings in another cell line, we repeated the treatments in UKF-RC-2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Quantifying 205 the viral RNA copies in the supernatant, we observed that the compounds efficiently inhibited virus replication ( Figure 4E and S7A) at non-toxic conditions ( Figure S7B , except for sorafenib).",

Although similar effects in SARS-CoV-2 are likely, this remains to be studied in this novel virus. A recent paper analyzed the interaction profile of SARS-CoV-2 proteins expressed in HEK293T cells (Gordon et 225 al., 2020) . For the heavily phosphorylated nucleoprotein they could identify interactions the host casein kinases, which might indicate possible modification events by the latter.

By targeting the RAS/RAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR downstream axes of GFR signaling, we found efficient inhibition of viral replication in two different cell lines derived from different tissues (Figure 4) . GFR signaling was shown to play a role in diverse virus infections as well as in fibrosis induction by SARS-CoV-1 (Beerli et al., 2019; Kung et al., 2011; Lupberger et 255 al., 2011; Pleschka et al., 2001; Ueki et al., 2013; . Thus, our results in cytopathic effects might indeed indicate cytoprotective roles for GFR signaling axes during SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible development of fibrosis (Luo et al., 2020) . Notably, some inhibitors used in our study such as omipalisib were shown to suppress fibrosis progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which may share deregulation of signaling pathways 260",

Concentration of proteins was determined by Bradford assay and 300 \u00b5g of protein per samples was used for digestion. For digestion, the samples were diluted to 1 M Urea with 10mM EPPS pH 8.2 and incubated overnight with 1:50 LysC (Wako Chemicals) and 1:100 Sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). Digests were acidified using TFA and tryptic peptideswere purified by tC18 SepPak (50 mg, Waters). 125 \u00b5g peptides per sample were TMT labelled and the mixing 475 was normalized after a single injection measurement by LC-MS/MS to equimolar ratios for each channel. 250 \u00b5g of pooled peptides were dried for offline High pH Reverse phase fractionation by HPLC (whole cell proteome) and remaining 1 mg of multiplexed peptides were used for phospho-peptide enrichment by High-Select Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide enrichment kit (Thermo Fisher) after manufacturer`s instructions. After enrichment, peptides were dried and 480 resuspended in 70% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA and filtered through a C8 stage tip to remove contaminating Fe-NTA particles. Dried phospho-peptides then were fractionated on C18 (Empore) stage-tip. For fractionation C18 stagetips were washed with 100% acetonitrile twice, followed by equilibration with 0.1% TFA solution.
