Further, UK data reveal increases from May 2019 to May 2020 in perceived urgency of climate change and support for climate change mitigation policies-the opposite of what \"finite pool of worry\" would predict (11) . Both 2020 surveys were based on relatively small sample sizes (United States n = 312, United Kingdom n = 284), and their comparison with previous surveys was via a repeated cross-sectional design-different people responded to each survey. To assess the robustness of the emerging findings, we conducted a survey with a large-scale representative and longitudinal sample (n = 1,858) in the United Kingdom-identical respondents in April 2019 and June 2020.",

None of these had significant correlations (at P < 0.05) with respondents' change in perceived climate change severity from April 2019 to June 2020. This suggests climate change stories are not effecting change in perceived severity. This cautions against being overly optimistic about the capacity for climate change news and risk communication to heighten issue concern. Again, however, COVID-19 clearly could be a confounding historical event here.",

Future research that examines climate beliefs, attitudes, and affect over periods of high societal attention to climate change with few major conflicting crises could shed light on the relationship, as could additional research that examines additional operationalizations of \"worry\" to include measures based more on affect. Repeated cross-sectional survey data suggest a similar pattern to ours (10, 11) ; does this ambiguity over finite pool of worry extend to other national and cultural contexts? Finally, does the obduracy of beliefs about climate change work both ways-will perceived severity and reality of climate change increase in the absence of major COVID-19 concerns, or does a strongly reified set of beliefs mean little change can be expected in either direction?",

These items were replicated from reliable and valid measures used in prior research (17) ; see SI Appendix for exact items.
