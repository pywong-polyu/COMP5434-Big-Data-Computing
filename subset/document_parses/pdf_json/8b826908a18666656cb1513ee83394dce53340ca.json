Methods: We use longitudinal data from the INCAP birth cohort, Guatemala (n = 1386). Using wealth as a measure of socio-economic position, we assess the association of life course relative mobility using latent class analysis and absolute material gains using conditional wealth measures. We estimate associations of wealth mobility with indicators of human capital, specifically height, weight status (BMI in kg/m 2 ), psychological distress (WHO SRQ-20 score) and fluid intelligence (Ravens Progressive Matrices score; RPM) in middle adulthood.",

Intergenerational persistence, the extent of remaining at the same relative position from birth (parental) to adulthood, may therefore perpetuate health inequities (Marmot & Bell, 2012) . Comparison of intergenerational mobility in income and education levels shows that Latin American countries perform worse than their high income country (HIC) counterparts, suggesting that parental SEP matter more for relative mobility in the former, despite intergenerational improvements in standards of living (absolute wealth gains) (Azevedo & Bouillon, 2010; Behrman et al., 2011 ; Narayan et al., 2018; Neidh\u00f6fer, 2019) . Intergenerational social mobility reflects heritability of ability, early childhood education, social norms, market failures, credit constraints and government expenditure on public services in health and education (Causa & Johansson, 2010) . Intergenerational social persistence is correlated with cross-sectional income inequality, such that educational attainment, a key driver of mobility, is often tied to parental income in the absence of government investment (Neidh\u00f6fer, 2019) .",

Washington, D.C. :The World Bank). The Gini index, a measure of income inequality, decreased from 0.58 in 1986 (when it was first reported) to 0.48 in 2014 due to increased social assistance spending since early-2000s. Guatemala's Gini index continues to be among the highest in the world (World development indicators. Washington, D.C. :The World Bank). Upward relative mobility and absolute wealth gains can co-occur for individuals in transitioning societies, such as Guatemala, which experienced economic growth and intergeneration gains in attained schooling (Orozco, 2017) . However, downward relative mobility only requires an individual's rise in standard of living to be slower than his or her peers, and can occur in the presence of generalized wealth gains at a group level.",

The association of gains in schooling with wealth mobility and its consequences for health and human capital in later life is underexplored in LMIC settings given the absence of life course data (Azevedo & Bouillon, 2010; Neidh\u00f6fer et al., 2018) . Additionally, the relative importance of absolute material gains during different life stages for health in later life in LMICs is unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first study which uses prospectively collected life course wealth data to understand the drivers of relative (positional) wealth mobility over the life course in LMIC settings.

We additionally created a temporally harmonized wealth index based on only the common assets and housing characteristics, the details of which have been reported previously (Varghese et al., 2021) . The difference in asset scale between individuals (or over time) derives from differences in asset availability such that the weight computed for an asset is multiplied by the standardized (centered and scaled) value, and then summed across all assets (Filmer & Pritchett, 2001) . Our results suggested that the temporally harmonized index was robust to omission/inclusion of assets or study waves, as well as factor extraction procedure (exploratory factor analysis, polychoric PCA, multiple correspondence analysis). We provide the loadings on the first principal component for all asset indices used in Supplementary Table 2.",

We estimate the association of early life characteristics (assignment to supplementation group, exposure in first 1000 days, maternal schooling, year of birth and sex) which are potential predictors of class membership. We additionally used attained schooling as a predictor of class membership given its role in social mobility during transition to adulthood. We fit models with 2 to 5 latent classes. The model fit statistics from different runs are provided in Supplementary  Table 3 . Based on the results, BIC recommended 3 classes, sample-size adjusted BIC recommended 4 or 5 classes, BLRT recommended 5 classes and entropy recommended 5 classes. However, the size of one of the classes for the 5-class run was 100 (<10% sample). As a compromise between model fit, entropy and class size, we proceeded with 4 latent classes.

The Stable Low and Upwardly Mobile classes, which were otherwise similar, differed markedly in attained schooling (2 y vs 6 y). This potentially explains gains in fluid intelligence (which peaks in young adulthood) and protection against psychological distress in middle adulthood. Similarly, the Stable High and Downwardly Mobile classes differed in schooling attainment despite being similar in several early-life characteristics including maternal schooling. Attained schooling for our study population peaked in adolescence. Therefore, any schooling-related gaps in human capital and wealth accumulation are unlikely to close over time, highlighting the importance of early life investments. The proportion of females in the Stable High class (57%) was lower than in the Downwardly Mobile class (63%). However, there was no association of sex with class membership after adjusting for attained schooling and other early life characteristics, suggesting a potentially leveling role of schooling in reducing sex disparities. We additionally note that wealth mobility, as defined by relative wealth trajectories, is a zero-sum game. The association of relative wealth and health is hypothesized to be mediated by preferential access to resources and psychosocial stressors which may manifest itself in absolute health inequities. Alternative formulations that consider absolute wealth gains and relational positioning could be useful in examining this issue.",

Nationally in 2016, the mean adult BMI was 25.8 kg/m 2 among men and 27.5 kg/m 2 among women, similar to other LMIC countries in the region (Worldwide trends in body-, 2017). Our analysis adds to the evidence that upward social mobility (in both absolute and relative terms) is associated with lower psychological distress (Gaydosh et al., 2018) . Our results also support the hypothesis that cumulative deprivation and loss of wealth are associated with greater risk of mental health issues (Melchior et al., 2018; Nicklett & Burgard, 2009) . A country's or community's stage of obesity transition was an effect modifier for association of persistently high SEP or upward mobility with adiposity such that in many LMIC settings upward mobility was associated with higher adiposity while results were dependent on race and community in HIC settings (Gaydosh et al., 2018; Jaacks et al., 2019; Lartey et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2020) . Both relative mobility and household income were shown to be inversely associated with rates of depression in HIC and LMIC settings (Melchior et al., 2018; Nicklett & Burgard, 2009; Tiffin et al., 2005; Ward et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Our analysis represents the longest follow-up for a prospective birth cohort in a low-or middle-income country setting. Data on assets and housing characteristics were collected at each wave for participants residing in or near their birth village, and for those participants who migrated elsewhere in Guatemala in 2015-16 and 2017-18. Despite this, our analysis has certain limitations. Firstly, asset data was not available for cohort members who resided outside study villages in 1987 and 2002. We assumed missing at random while proceeding with our analysis (FIML for relative wealth mobility and multiple imputation for absolute wealth gains). Our analysis with and without auxiliary covariates for imputation showed similar results. Second, the study experienced attrition such that of the 2021 cohort members who were known to be alive in 2015-18, 1391 participated. A prior analysis comparing participants with non-participants showed that participants were more likely to be female and had 1 year lower median maternal schooling (Varghese et al., 2021) . Third, since our study villages were representative of rural non-Indigenous Guatemalans in 1967, we cannot generalize findings to those who were born in urban areas or those belonging to Indigenous communities (Poder & He, 2015) . High levels of intergenerational persistence of poverty and affluence, marked by ethnic (indigenous and ladino) and regional (urban and rural) differences, continue to be observed in Guatemala. A recent study shows that schooling and wage inequalities between ladino and indigenous populations persist, although improvements in educational outcomes have led to convergence in wages over time (Canelas & Gisselquist, 2018) . Given the share of average tax burden, personal income taxes and social spending at 13.0% (2013), 0.4% (2013) and 7.4% (2015) of GDP respectively, among the lowest in Latin America, tax-based redistribution is limited (Cabrera et al., 2015) . Moreover, our measures of wealth mobility are constrained by the observed sample and therefore, do not capture the extent of possible mobility in Guatemala. Fourth, our analysis looks only at wealth mobility in terms of asset indices. Though other dimensions of social mobility (income, savings, occupational prestige, education, height) could present different results, these measures of SEP are often highly correlated. Additionally, the absolute wealth gains observed in our study could be the result of local structural investments (such as sewage or garbage disposal) or asset purchases by the household that might not be captured by our instrument. Asset-based wealth measures rely on the inherent assumption that accumulation of household assets and housing characteristics is a proxy for wealth. Our study is also different from wealth mobility studies in high-income settings that rely on estate inventory reports, gifts or inheritances and financial assets (Adermon et al., 2018; Pfeffer & Killewald, 2018) . Finally, our latent classes for relative mobility indicated potential misclassification with moderate entropy (0.62). An ideal entropy of 1.00 would have indicated perfect separation between latent classes.",

Possible mechanisms include transitioning dietary and activity patterns which lead to higher adiposity as well as pursuit of leisure and lower exposure to stressful experiences (Popkin, 2015) . Given that economic disparities have been amplified all over the world in recent months by SARS-CoV-2, research on long-term implications of downward relative mobility and loss in absolute wealth is also important (Dorn et al., 2020; Slotman, 2020) . In the absence of intergenerational social mobility, a combination of labor market dynamics and disproportionate gains in wages from higher skills (from investments in human capital by the rich) can amplify inequality (Azevedo & Bouillon, 2010) . This is especially crucial in LMIC settings where exposure to financial adversities and income inequality in childhood might compromise early life growth and developmental trajectories potentially setting today's children on a course of cumulative deprivation and restricted social mobility (Neidh\u00f6fer, 2019) . Previous research from this population showed that association of parental resources with overall schooling outcomes decreased over time but efforts in reduction of gender disparities in schooling lag behind other Latin American countries (Yount et al., 2013) . Policies aimed strengthening existing social safety nets and developing remedial mechanisms for lost opportunity ought to be prioritized.",
