            "text": "Several societal issues could be mitigated by reducing global consumption of meat and animal products (MAP). In three randomized, controlled experiments (n = 217 to 574), we evaluated the effects of a documentary that presents health, environmental, and animal welfare motivations for reducing MAP consumption. Study 1 assessed the documentary's effectiveness at reducing reported MAP consumption after 12 days. This study used methodological innovations to minimize social desirability bias, a widespread limitation of past research. Study 2 investigated discrepancies between the results of Study 1 and those of previous studies by further examining the role of social desirability bias. Study 3 assessed the documentary's effectiveness in a new population anticipated to be more responsive and upon enhancing the intervention content. We found that the documentary did not decrease reported MAP consumption when potential social desirability bias was minimized (Studies  1 and 3) . The documentary also did not affect consumption among participants whose demographics suggested they might be more receptive (Study 3). However, the documentary did substantially increase intentions to reduce consumption, consistent with past studies (Studies 2 and 3) . Overall, we conclude that some past studies of similar interventions may have overestimated effects due to methodological biases. Novel intervention strategies to reduce MAP consumption may be needed.",

Authoritative enjoinments for such a dietary shift have highlighted its potential to improve public health [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , reduce risks of zoonotic pandemics and antibiotic resistance [7] , curb environmental degradation and climate change [3] [4] [5] [6] 8] , and limit the preventable suffering and slaughter of approximately 500 to 12,000 animals over the lifetime of each human consuming a diet typical of their country [6, 9] . Nevertheless, MAP consumption in Western countries far exceeds nutritional recommendations [3, 6] and, worldwide, continues to rise substantially [4] . Whereas existing research attention has often focused specifically on reducing consumption of red and processed meat [10] , in this paper, we focus more broadly on shifting consumption of all meats (i.e., edible animal flesh) and animal products (i.e., eggs and dairy) to plant-based diets. In contrast, shifting consumption from red and processed meat to poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs would be beneficial for individual health, but probably less so than making comparable shifts to healthy plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes, that are severely lacking in the standard Western diet [3, 11, 12] . Furthermore, producing poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs causes considerable environmental and ecological damage [13] [14] [15] and has severe animal welfare impacts [6] .",

Educational interventions that make appeals to individual health [10, 16] , the environment [10, 16] , or animal welfare [16, 17] may be effective. More subtle \"nudge\" interventions that may operate outside participants' conscious awareness, for example by repositioning meat dishes to be less prominent in cafeterias, may also be effective [16, 18] . Although these types of interventions are promising, many existing studies have methodological limitations [17] . These include the potential for social desirability bias that could artificially inflate apparent intervention effects [19] , measurement of outcomes only in terms of participants' attitudes or intended behavior rather than actual MAP consumption, and small sample sizes. As a result, we are aware of very few specific interventions that are adequately well-evidenced to strongly support their widespread dissemination at this point.",

Namely, our studies took stringent precautions against social desirability bias, used longitudinal designs, and measured food consumption outcomes using food frequency questionnaires. The intervention was a 20-min documentary that encourages dietary shifts from all meats and animal products to plant-based diets. We selected this documentary because its content reflects certain best practices for designing effective interventions in general, and its content also harnesses the specific psychology of MAP consumption [17] . In general, providing educational information can influence beliefs and intentions that may subsequently shape behavior [20] . The public appears to be poorly informed about the aforementioned consequences of global MAP consumption; in fact, many individuals appear to deliberately avoid such information [21] . Thus, providing information that helps remedy this knowledge gap may be effective. Additionally, portraying the desired behavior as aligning with social norms (what others believe one should do, or what others actually do) can effectively shift behaviors, including food choices [22, 23] . Providing concrete suggestions for how to change one's behavior (e.g., recipes) may help individuals to form concrete implementation intentions for what they plan to do when faced with food choices [24] . According to the Theory of Planned Behavior, providing such suggestions may increase individuals' perceived ability to control their future behavior and their intentions to do so [20] . Indeed, previous interventions to reduce consumption of meat and/or animal products that invoked these components have obtained preliminarily promising results. Such interventions have included, for example, providing leaflets, news articles, and videos [17, [25] [26] [27] .",

            "text": "In addition to leveraging these general components of effective behavioral interventions, the documentary we studied was designed to also harness the unique social, moral, and affective psychology underlying MAP consumption [28, 29] . For example, although ethical concern about factory farming conditions is now a majority stance in several developed countries [30] , MAP consumption remains nearly universal. This discrepancy between people's ethical views and their actual behavior, termed the \"meat paradox\" [31] , can induce cognitive dissonance. Previous interventions have successfully invoked this dissonance by using meat-animal reminders, which are simple visual or verbal reminders of the connection between MAP and animals (e.g., photographs of meat dishes presented next to photographs of the animals from which they came) [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Last, physical disgust and moral disgust are closely intertwined and powerfully shape food choices [38, 39] . Experiencing physical disgust can amplify negative moral judgments, and conversely, experiencing moral disgust can induce physical disgust [40] . Previous interventions to reduce consumption of meat and/or animal products have often invoked disgust by describing, for example, \"crowded conditions [and] pens covered in excrement and germs\" [41] . We also selected this documentary because it has been disseminated in practice via social media advertising by a nonprofit, The Humane League. For example, in 2019, the nonprofit's advertising generated 13 million visits to websites deploying documentary-driven interventions, including this documentary, resulting in 8 million minutes of viewing.",

In Study 3, we aimed to assess the documentary's effectiveness in a different population and upon adding new components to the intervention, which were designed to increase participant engagement. To this end, in Studies 1 and 3, our primary outcome was participants' total MAP consumption over the past week (henceforth \"consumption\"), reported approximately 2 weeks after random assignment and exposure to the documentary. In both studies, we secondarily assessed consumption of specific categories of MAP as well as consumption of healthy plant-based foods. We also assessed the extent to which the intervention's effects might differ by participants' demographic characteristics; such findings could be used to cost-effectively target dissemination. For example, previous work has suggested that sex, education, and political liberalism could moderate the effectiveness of interventions to reduce consumption of meat and/or animal products [42] [43] [44] [45] . Studies 1 and 3 took stringent precautions against social desirability bias. In Study 2, to further examine the potential for social desirability bias, our primary outcome was participants' immediate intentions to increase, decrease, or not change their consumption, similar to many existing studies in the literature.",

To minimize social desirability bias by blinding participants to the study's purpose, we used new recruitment text that described the follow-up wave (T 1 ) as if it were a standalone study and did not reveal its connection to the T 0 wave. We refer to this approach as \"na\u00efve re-recruitment\". At T 1 , participants self-reported their consumption frequencies and typical serving sizes of 6 individual categories of meats (chicken, turkey, fish, pork, beef, other meat), 2 categories of animal products (dairy, eggs), 5 categories of healthy plant-based foods (leafy green vegetables, other vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes), and 2 decoy foods that were not analyzed (refined grains and sweetened beverages). We included the decoy foods to further conceal the purpose of the study. Participants also completed items that assessed their awareness of the purpose of the study and exploratory attitude measures, detailed below. All questionnaire items appear in the Supplementary Materials.",

Through its multiple narrators, the documentary makes recommendations to eat, for example, \"plant-based\" and \"vegetarian, and better yet, vegan\" diets. In addition to these direct educational appeals, the documentary uses indirect means to shift dietary behavior, as discussed in the Introduction. First, the documentary invokes physical disgust by showing graphic footage of factory farms and slaughterhouses (e.g., of laying hens in filthy battery cages). Second, the documentary uses both verbal and visual meat-animal reminders (e.g., by cutting directly from footage of broiler chickens in a factory farm to footage of packaged chicken in a supermarket). Third, the documentary invokes social norms regarding increased demand for plant-based meals. For example, a narrator states: \"Restaurants are catering to the millenial population that is really demanding...a vegan diet, a vegetarian diet, a flexitarian diet.\" As described in the Introduction, psychological theory and empirical findings suggest that these elements may be potent means of reducing MAP consumption [17] . We added to the end of the documentary a brief screen stating, \"For practical tips on shifting to plant-based eating, see: www.eatingveg.org/how and www.eatingveg.org/what.\" These websites provide, for example, recipes and tips for handling social pressure from family and friends. (These websites have since been moved and modified. Examples of content similar to what participants would have seen at those URLs are publicly available at https://osf.io/xrckh/). Providing such practical tips may help individuals to form concrete implementation intentions, as discussed in the Introduction.",

Demographic characteristics whose estimate direction was consistent with improved intervention effectiveness were, in descending order of estimate magnitude: living in a more politically liberal county (by 10 percentage points), being female, having completed at least 2-year college, being a Democrat (vs. a Republican), being Caucasian, being politically Independent/other, and being \u226425 years old. These findings regarding sex and education [44] and political liberalism [45] are directionally consistent with previous literature.",

The discrepancy could reflect a genuine difference in effectiveness if, for example, the specific documentary we tested was less effective than existing interventions, or if the participants we recruited were less receptive to its effects. Alternatively, the discrepancy might be an artifact of differences in biases affecting our estimates versus those in existing studies. Most existing studies measured outcomes in terms of participants' immediate, reported intentions to reduce consumption, but immediate intentions may not accurately predict actual consumption for at least 2 reasons [17] . First, participants may not follow through on their genuine intentions [66] . Second, when participants are aware of the study's purpose, the intervention might bias some participants' reported intentions (i.e., social desirability bias). We sought to reduce these biases by measuring outcomes after 12 days, by using na\u00efve re-recruitment, and by including decoy food items. Our analyses suggested that these precautions did successfully blind participants to the study's purpose. To specifically investigate the extent to which these biases might have contributed to the discrepancy in results, we conducted Study 2, which was designed to resemble the majority of existing studies. Table 3 . For Study 1, estimated moderation by baseline demographic variables of the intervention's effect on the primary outcome (total MAP consumption). Raw mean differences represent ounces consumed over the past week. Main effects represent differences in average consumption by the demographic variables. Effect modification estimates represent differences in intervention effectiveness for each demographic variable, with negative values representing greater effectiveness (i.e., greater reductions in consumption).

To help mitigate widespread limitations of previous research regarding the potential for social desirability bias [17] , we introduced methodological innovations to help prevent and benchmark social desirability bias in studies of reported food outcomes. First, in the 2 longitudinal studies (Studies 1 and 3) , we used na\u00efve re-recruitment to conceal the purpose of the study. We also included decoy foods (e.g., sweetened beverages) in the outcome measurements. Awareness probes in these studies indicated that, with these methods, participants indeed remained largely unaware of the purpose of the experiment during follow-up data collection. In Study 2, as a benchmark of the severity of social desirability bias, we investigated \"retrospective causation\" by asking participants to report on their past-week consumption, mere minutes after they had viewed either the documentary or the control video. Any apparent intervention effects on reported consumption over the week prior to random assignment would seem to necessarily reflect social desirability bias. We estimated that the documentary affected these retrospective reports of total consumption by \u22124.07 oz/week (95% CI: [\u221211.74, 3.60]). Although the confidence interval is wide, this spurious point estimate is in the vicinity of typical intervention effects seen in studies of interventions to reduce meat consumption, most of which had similar designs that are susceptible to social desirability bias [17] .",

Indeed, we intentionally selected an intervention that has already been widely disseminated at relatively low cost. However, it is difficult to precisely establish small intervention effects without very large sample sizes and high retention. Although Study 1 achieved high retention, Study 3 did not, which compromises statistical precision and increases susceptibility to missing data bias. Additionally, reported dietary data can be subject to substantial measurement error even when collected via measures such as 24-h recalls or food frequency questionnaires [75, 76] ; such measurement error can further obscure small intervention effects. Although Studies 1 and 2 used somewhat longer durations of follow-up (approximately 2 weeks) than most existing studies [17] , even longer durations would help identify potential delayed adoption and would characterize how well effects are sustained over time. The documentary we studied was previously disseminated by a nonprofit, so it is possible that some individuals may already have viewed it prior to participating in our studies, although no participants mentioned having seen the documentary when they provided free-text feedback on the study.

Similarly, 20% participants in the control group reported that they intended to reduce consumption, compared to 68% in the intervention group. Thus, the documentary increased the percentage of participants intending to reduce consumption by 3.42-fold (95% CI: [2.49, 4.92]; p < 0.0001). As in Study 1, there was little indication of moderation, although Study 2 was not well-powered to detect such effects (SupplementaryTable S3).Regarding spurious retrospective causation, the documentary did not substantially affect participants' reported total consumption over the week before random assignment (\u22124.07 oz/week; 95% CI: [\u221211.74, 3.60]; p = 0.30; SMD = \u22120.12; 95% CI: [\u22120.35, 0.11]), though the point estimate was in the direction consistent with social desirability bias.
