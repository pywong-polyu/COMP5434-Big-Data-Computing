This would use limited deployment to keep global mean temperatures below a given threshold, buying time for emissions reductions and negative emissions to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. However, we suggest the trade-offs inherent in such scenarios are not widely appreciated. In this study, we explore general features of such scenarios, using a combination of simple analytical relationships between emissions and temperatures and modelling to illustrate the strong trade-off between the duration of geoengineering deployment and the temperature overshoot that is suppressed by geoengineering, as well as the scale of negative emissions that are required. Our results indicate that, unless climate sensitivity is at the high end of estimates, shaving a substantial peak -say, of 2K to 1.5K -would require at least a century of deployment of solar geoengineering and large-scale negative emissions, under a broad range of emissions trajectories. If negative emissions are not available at the scale of tens of gigatonnes of CO 2 per year, substantial peak-shaving will require deployment of geoengineering for multiple centuries. Our analysis emphasise the importance of factoring in the scale, feasibility, and cost of the negative emissions required to avoid indefinite commitment to solar geoengineering.",

Some have suggested that solar geoengineering, where particles are put into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight and cool the planet, could reduce the negative effects of this climate change. Small amounts of geoengineering may have more benefits and fewer risky side-effects than larger amounts. For example, we could use geoengineering to keep to below a temperature threshold, like those agreed upon in the Paris Climate Accord. In this paper, we use mathematical equations and computer models to explore a range of ways that this could be done. We show that there is a trade-off. In cases where you only need geoengineering for a short time, this is unlikely to have much of an effect on temperatures. Or, you can reduce temperatures by a larger amount, but then you must keep geoengineering going for many decades, which could be difficult politically. We also note that, because greenhouse gases remains in the atmosphere for centuries, if you want to stop the geoengineering, you must remove billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide. We argue that these trade-offs should be carefully considered and made apparent in discussions of geoengineering.",

            "text": "Under what circumstances could we consider solar geoengineering? Many authors have observed that solar geoengineering cannot be a substitute for mitigation (Goes et al., 2011) (Keith & Irvine, 2016) . Solar radiation management (SRM) imperfectly compensates for the effects of greenhouse gases, leading to residual climatic changes. These residual climate changes are likely to be worse as the amount of radiative forcing from SRM is increased. For example, SRM reduces precipitation more quickly than temperature. This is because the net result of cooling the surface with SRM, while the troposphere is warmed by greenhouse gases, is an atmosphere that is more stable to convection. Consequently, trade-offs exist between regions and between returning temperature and precipitation to preindustrial baselines using SRM. (Moreno-Cruz et al., 2012) SRM would do little to address ocean acidification (Williamson & Turley, 2012) , and may result in residual polar ocean warming or changes to large-scale circulation (Fasullo et al., 2018) . The greater the radiative forcing that is offset by SRM, the more dangerous it would be to suddenly cease its use due to the termination effect: a rapid rebound of temperatures (Jones et al., 2013) . For this reason, we suggest that the temperature change compensated for by geoengineering is referred to as \"suppressed\" rather than \"avoided\". In addition, the magnitude and latitudinal distribution of the radiative forcing that can be obtained with the most viable method, stratospheric aerosol injection, is not yet clear, with model studies in disagreement (Niemeier & Timmreck, 2015) (Kleinschmitt et al., 2018) . A scenario where humanity is committed to ever-increasing deployment of SRM while emissions continue to climb is evidently fraught with risk.",

Assume that no mitigation occurs until a particular threshold temperature -say, 1.5C -is crossed. Thereafter, CO 2 emissions begin falling at a constant rate, becoming net-negative emissions at this same rate. Under these circumstances, the temperature peak will be approximately parabolic, as the emissions in a given year are approximately proportional to the rate of temperature change in that year. Let D be the duration of peak-shaving above a given temperature threshold, T be the temperature excess above threshold, and R be the rate of warming when the threshold is first exceeded (noting that this is approximately the Transient Climate Response to Cumulative Emissions, TCRE, multiplied by the emissions when the threshold is exceeded.)",

For example, at the current rate of warming of 0.25K per decade, shaving a peak of 2C to 1.5C implies a commitment to deployment of around 80 years. (In reality, this is likely to be an underestimate, as we will explain.) Considered in the context of the Paris Agreement, current scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5K (or 2K) include overshoot scenarios where temperature temporarily rises above the target, before falling at the end of the century. SRM could be deployed to suppress such an overshoot, as in SR1.5 Section 4.3.8. In the example considered in the IPCC report, overshoot of around 0.1K is avoided. Assuming rates of warming and cooling are similar to today's magnitude of warming at 0.25K/decade, the rule-of-thumb implies a commitment of 32 years, which is similar to the indicative time-scale shown (35 years). This exemplifies the trade-off between the duration of the implied commitment to SRM and the magnitude of the suppressed temperature overshoot.",

The negative emissions rate is sampled from the range [3.5, 30.0] GtCO 2 /yr. While the lower end of this range assumes that sustained large-scale BECCS and DAC are unavailable, and is determined by the land-use change negative emissions from the Low Energy Demand scenario, the high end of this range is well beyond the maximum considered feasible for BECCS by any 1.5C-compliant sce-nario, and substantially higher than the largest negative emissions of 18.5GtCO 2 /yr in the scenario database. There is clearly a strong trade-off between the suppressed temperature overshoot and the years of commitment to SRM in any of the scenarios. Even with a very rapid mitigation rate and a high negative emissions floor, scenarios that suppress more than 0.5K of temperature overshoot generally require around a century of commitment to SRM. Realmonte et al. (2019) compared the use of DAC across two integrated assessment models, considering a maximum deployment by 2100 of 30GtCO 2 /yr and a maximum scale-up rate of 1.5 GtCO 2 /yr/yr (Realmonte et al., 2019) . This does not imply that the most extreme scenarios sampled here are feasible -for example, the rapid mitigation under the LED scenario may not be compatible with the large-scale expansion in energy required for DAC on a 30GtCO 2 /yr scale. If large-scale direct air capture is the predominant form of negative emissions, then constraints are likely to be set by societal willingnessto-pay, energy availability, and the speed that the technology can be scaled up and deployed.

Even if the most rapid mitigation and large-scale negative emissions are assumed, shaving a peak of 2C to 1.5C requires a deployment in excess of 80 years. If negative emissions are not available at sufficient scale (> 2\u22123GtCO 2 /yr), shaving a substantial (>0.5K peak) becomes impossible on the 450-year timescale considered here. Figure 2 , but with the UKESM1 ECS and TCR of 5.4K and 2.7K respectively, at the higher end of any estimate for climate sensitivity. This illustrates that the trade-off between geoengineering duration and the suppressed temperature overshoot is arguably more favourable when climate sensitivity is high. Because the TCRE is high, small CO2 excursions lead to significant rises in temperature. This means that the CO2 corresponding to a temperature rise of 0.5K could be removed in decades, rather than around a century as in the low climate sensitivity case. This is dependent on climate sensitivity, as illustrated by Figure 3 . With the UKESM climate sensitivity (Sellar et al., 2019) , temperature overshoots are larger and occur more quickly for the same emissions trajectory. Higher climate sensitivites mean smaller carbon budget overshoots correspond to larger temperature overshoots. Given that the duration of SRM deployment is equivalent to the time spent overshooting the carbon budget, added to the time required to remove the carbon budget overshoot, higher climate sensitivity implies shorter overshoot commitment times to avoid the same level of warming.",

It assumes that the carbon budget is exceeded rapidly, with high emissions, and that mitigation begins immediately after emissions peak, which both reduce the carbon budget and temperature overshoot compared to scenarios where changes in global emissions occur more slowly. Here, we consider only the scale of global net-negative emissions. However, additional negative emissions will likely be required even to reach net-zero emissions (Anderson & Peters, 2016) , so the actual requirement for negative emissions will be higher. This analysis also allows for the largest mitigation and negative emissions rates found in the ambitious 1.5C-compliant literature. In a world where SRM is deployed, assuming it is effective in small doses at reducing climate risks (Irvine et al., 2019) , the perceived urgency of reducing emissions and deploying negative emissions at scale may be reduced, a form of \"mitigation deterrence\".",

We find that, under median estimates of climate sensitivity, deployments of SRM that are complete within a few decades are unlikely to shift global mean temperatures a great deal beyond multidecadal variability. Cost-benefit analyses that assume SRM deployment is not indefinite must consider the cost and feasibility of cumulative negative emissions equivalent to the exceedance of the carbon budget, as well as the timescales required to draw these emissions down.",

We see an analogy between these two situations. The R-rate during the uncontrolled initial phase of the epidemic is analagous to our emissions before net-zero is reached, and the rate of negative emissions we can attain is analagous to the R-rate in lockdown. The curves of new case numbers in countries that implemented lockdowns resembled the asymmetric parabolas of section 2.2, as in general the R during the uncontrolled epidemic phase was larger than the reciprocal of the R during lockdown. Therefore, each additional week of delay prior to lockdown required several weeks of commitment to lockdown to return infection numbers to their previous levels, as well as entailing a greater overall burden in terms of death and economic damages. Countries that were able to implement early lockdowns, prior to substantial spread of the disease, were generally able to adopt less stringent, less expensive, and shorter-duration social distancing measures, while experiencing a lower rate of mortality. Similarly, the more rapidly mitigation takes place, the shorter any long-term committment to costly geoengineering measures would be.",

Different examples illustrate the trade-off between the implied duration of and height of the peak. For this example, we choose mitigation rates between a maximum of 7% per annum, which corresponds to halving emissions in just under a decade, and 0.5%, which corresponds to halving emissions in around 140 years. This is illustrated in Figure 4 . Note the tradeoff between the duration of geoengineering and the height of the peak shaved in all scenarios. The quadratic approximation, where mitigation occurs at a constant rate in terms of gigatonnes of carbon, is also illustrated and its gradient depends entirely on the rate of negative emissions, rather than the mitigation and deployment rates.",

Physically, the concept of a constant TCRE depends on the approximate cancellation of two factors: residual surface warming as the ocean comes into equilibrium with the high-CO 2 atmosphere, and uptake of carbon dioxide by the ocean sink and biosphere (Allen et al., 2009) . Consequently, factors that vary between models -such as the rate of uptake of CO 2 by the oceans and the biosphere, as well as the timescale and magnitude of long-term warming as the deep ocean comes into equilibrium with the atmosphere -can introduce a hysteresis effect in temperature as cumulative emissions are reduced, and hence an apparent time-dependence of the TCRE. Figure B1 . Ratio of TCRE during positive and negative emissions periods for various Realised Warming Fractions (TCR/ECS ratios). This was calculated by simulating simple emissions trajectory where emissions linearly decrease to zero and then become negative at the same rate, until cumulative emissions are zero. Differences both in the total anthropogenic CO2 excursion and the RWF give rise to different levels of hysteresis. The approximation that the TCRE is constant for removals and additions of CO2 -which is relied on for the simple algebraic models, but not the FaIR analysis -breaks down for RWF far from the FaIR default of 0.53, or for large anthropogenic CO2 excursions. Lower RWF or greater CO2 excursions would result in a greater implied duration of geoengineering to maintain temperatures below a given threshold.",

The TCRE is evaluated for the ascending and descending branches by calculating the gradient of the temperature-cumulative emissions curve, then averaging across the periods of positive and negative emissions respectively.

This will result in the analytical formulae of Section 2 underestimating the commitment time to peak-shaving geoengineering. By contrast, if the RWF is high, and the carbon perturbation is small enough, the TCRE ratio can be less than 1: in other words, natural removal of CO 2 by sinks exceeds the effect of long-term warming, which results in faster cooling during the negative emissions branch, as concentrations decline more quickly.",
