In anaerobic environments, carbohydrates are converted into volatile fatty acids and alcohols. These can be used as building blocks in biotechnological or chemical processes, e.g., to produce bioplastics. In this study, xylose fermentation by mixed microbial cultures was investigated and compared with glucose under the same conditions. The product spectrum obtained with both substrates was comparable. It was observed that, in the case of xylose, a higher fraction of the carbon was converted into catabolic products (butyrate, acetate, and ethanol) and the biomass yield was approximately 20% lower than on glucose, 0.16 versus 0.21 Cmol X/Cmol S. This lower yield is likely related to the need of an extra ATP during xylose uptake. When submitted to a pulse of glucose, the population cultivated on xylose could instantaneously convert the glucose.

Hemicellulose is a heteropolymer of hexose and pentose sugars, with Dxylose as the major constituent. Xylose is the second most abundant carbohydrate monomer after glucose in agricultural wastes.

An alternative anaerobic process could aim for the production of intermediates in the methanogenic process from complex substrates. This can be established by specific inhibition of methane production using operational measures like non-neutral pH-values or decreasing the solid retention time. Potentially interesting products that can be produced in this way include organic acids (acetate, butyrate, lactate, succinate), solvents (ethanol, butanol, acetone) and energy carriers like molecular hydrogen. Which mixtures of products are formed will depend on the substrate treated, the microbial population present and the operational conditions Lengeler et al. 1998 ). An extra advantage of anaerobic processes is its association with a low biomass yield, i.e., low waste production. Fermentation of hemicellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysates is a major subject of research, mostly aimed at the production of ethanol (Sommer et al. 2004; van Maris et al. 2006) . One of the problems of this process is the inability of many microorganisms to metabolize efficiently all the carbohydrates derived from hemicellulose.

As opposed to pure-culture processes, mixed cultures furthermore allow for the use of continuous processing, and are capable of dealing with mixtures of substrates of variable composition. All these aspects significantly reduce the costs of mixed culture processes compared to pure-culture-based industrial fermentations. The impact of the operational conditions on glucose fermentation by mixed cultures has been studied extensively (Hawkes et al. 2007; Temudo et al. 2007; Zoetemeyer et al. 1982a; Zoetemeyer et al. 1982b ). However, until now, almost no attention has been given to xylose fermentation. Recently, xylose has been reported as a suitable substrate for biohydrogen production (Calli et al. 2008; Lin et al. 2008; Lin and Cheng 2006; Lo et al. 2008) or electricity production by microbial fuel cells , in both processes by open-mixed cultures. In order to optimize the above-mentioned processes, it is of high relevance to gain knowledge on the differences that exist when fermenting glucose or xylose with open-mixed cultures. D-Xylose is not so readily utilized as D-glucose for the production of chemicals by microorganisms (Jeffries 1983) . The reason may lie on the biochemical pathways used for pentose and hexose metabolism. In most fermentative anaerobic bacteria, D-xylose has to be converted into Dxylulose-5-phosphate (X5P). This metabolite is further metabolized through either pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), or through the phosphoketolase pathway (PKP; Fig. 1 ). The PPP concerns a series of reactions where Dxylulose-5-phosphate is rearranged and converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP; Eq. 1), an intermediate of the glucose metabolism. The phosphoketolase cleaves X5P into GAP and acetyl phosphate, which is further converted into acetate and generates one ATP (Eq. 2; Tanaka et al. 2002) . Despite the fact that the PPP is the most common pathway, many bacteria also have the capacity to catalyze the PKP pathway.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 628, "end": 648, "text": "(Hawkes et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 649, "end": 668, "text": "Temudo et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 669, "end": 693, "text": "Zoetemeyer et al. 1982a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 694, "end": 717, "text": "Zoetemeyer et al. 1982b", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 886, "end": 905, "text": "(Calli et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 906, "end": 922, "text": "Lin et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 923, "end": 942, "text": "Lin and Cheng 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 943, "end": 958, "text": "Lo et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1351, "text": "(Jeffries 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2004, "end": 2023, "text": "Tanaka et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1677, "end": 1683, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The aim of this research is to investigate the product spectrum of xylose fermentation by mixed cultures and compare it to glucose fermentation under comparable process conditions.

This culture was capable of converting xylose efficiently as the concentrations were kept lower than the detection limit (0.01 Cmmol/L), suggesting a high affinity for the substrate. The xylose-grown chemostat culture was also able to degrade glucose, not showing a preference for glucose or xylose when point doses of the two substrates are supplied to the bioreactor. One of the major differences observed between mixed cultures grown on xylose and on glucose is the biomass yield on ATP (Y X/ATP ), see Table 1 . The yield of catabolic products is higher for xylose, which would suggest a higher generation of ATP (Y ATP/S ); however, the biomass yield is in fact higher when glucose is the substrate (Y X/S ). This difference has also been observed in studies conducted with pure bacterial cultures, where the biomass yield on the catabolic ATP yield estimated (Y ATP/S ) is significantly higher for glucose than for xylose (Biesterveld et al. 1994; Heyndrickx et al. 1991; Ounine et al. 1985) . Furthermore, in solvent-producing bacteria, not only growth is inhibited but also the xylose uptake is affected by the solvents (Ounine et al. 1985; Qureshi et al. 2006) . This is in agreement with the lower energy provided during xylose catabolism. This might be a result of different transport systems that are present in the different species (Jeffries 1983) . Facilitated diffusion is the most common mechanism in yeast, the glucose transporters can also catalyze xylose uptake, but have a much lower affinity (Hamacher et al. 2002) . In bacteria, however, a number of xylose-specific transporters with different affinities have been identified (Strobel 1993a, b) . Of particular interest is the high affinity transporter that consists of an ABC protein and therefore involves one ATP consumption for each xylose transported (Ahlem et al. 1982; Hasona et al. 2004 ). According to genome databases (http:// www.genome.jp), this transporter is widespread over bacterial species able to metabolize xylose, e.g., in fermentative (gram-positive) microorganisms like C. acetobutylicum, but whether it is expressed remains unknown. In case this is the most active transporter in the microbial population selected, the catabolic ATP yield can be recalculated by considering the need of one ATP for xylose transport and one for activation inside the cell. As one molecule of pyruvate comes from 0.6 mol of xylose, this means that the ATP yield associated to pyruvate, as written in Eq. 1, will be affected by this value and becomes 0.4 mol ATP/mol pyruvate formed from xylose. Whereas glucose requires only one ATP for transport and activation, being the glycolytic efficiency estimated to be 1 mol ATP/mol pyruvate. Including these assumptions in our calculations, the Y X/ATP becomes 12.4 g VSS/mol ATP for xylose, which is highly comparable to glucose (12.2 g VSS/mol ATP). We therefore suggest that the lower biomass yield (Y X/S ) for growth on xylose compared to glucose, is related to the ATP consumption required for active xylose uptake. Such a difference has not been reported for modified yeast cells that were able to ferment xylose (Kuyper et al. 2005a) , where the Y ATP/S remained in the same range for the two substrates.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1054, "end": 1079, "text": "(Biesterveld et al. 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1103, "text": "Heyndrickx et al. 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1123, "text": "Ounine et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1274, "text": "(Ounine et al. 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1295, "text": "Qureshi et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1487, "text": "(Jeffries 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1640, "end": 1662, "text": "(Hamacher et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1775, "end": 1793, "text": "(Strobel 1993a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1974, "text": "(Ahlem et al. 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1975, "end": 1993, "text": "Hasona et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3266, "end": 3287, "text": "(Kuyper et al. 2005a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 632, "end": 639, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, a mixed microbial population was selected especially for xylose conversion.
