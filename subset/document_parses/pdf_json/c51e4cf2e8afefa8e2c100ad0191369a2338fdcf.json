            "text": "Background: COVID-19 typically presents with respiratory symptoms which may progress with severe disease. There are standard guidelines for managing respiratory distress (e.g. opioids, anxiolytics) and palliative care teams are well versed in managing these symptoms. Aim: Determine the extent to which hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate respiratory distress received medications or palliative consultation for symptom management and if these interventions had any association with outcomes. Design: Retrospective chart review for hospitalized COVID-19\u00fe patients from March 2-April 30, 2020. Setting: Large integrated health system in the New York Metropolitan area. Patients: 312 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with an order for a non-rebreather mask and meeting criteria for moderate respiratory distress on the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale: concurrent respiratory rate \ufffd30 and heart rate \ufffd110 at any point during hospitalization. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation or intensive care were excluded. Results: Most COVID-19 patients experiencing moderate respiratory distress did not receive medications or palliative consultation for symptom management. Patients who received medications were predominantly white, older, and had a Do-Not-Resuscitate order. Patients who received a palliative consultation were more likely to be older, female, and white, with a Do-Not-Resuscitate order. Mortality was similar between those receiving medication and those who did not. Conclusion: Medications and palliative expertise for symptom management were underused for patients with moderate respiratory distress due to COVID-19. Education and triggers may help providers to identify moderate respiratory distress and consider symptomatic treatment and palliative consultation when appropriate.",

            "text": "The novel coronavirus (COVID- 19) was first detected in late 2019 and quickly escalated to a global pandemic causing devastating morbidity and mortality. [1] [2] [3] Since the beginning of 2021, over 500,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States alone, overwhelming hospitals and health systems across the country. 4 Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, many articles described the symptomatic needs and course of disease for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. 5, 6 Dyspnea is one of the most common presenting symptoms, along with cough and fever. Some studies reported dyspnea in up to 71% of all COVID-19 cases, and in 88-91% of cases requiring mechanical ventilation. 6, 7 The proportion of COVID-19 patients experiencing dyspnea may be even higher due to underreporting with patient sedation, delirium, agitation, altered mental status, or innate cognitive changes associated with the end of life. [7] [8] [9] While no specific tools have been recommended to assess dyspnea burden in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (RDOS) is a validated tool commonly used by palliative care experts. This instrument can be easily used to objectively assess dyspnea in all patients, even those with impaired communication. 9, 10 Respiratory symptoms of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 can for the most part be managed conservatively. Standard of care includes oxygen supplementation and hydration. Some experts have recommended a symptom-driven approach, such as antipyretics, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and opioids as additional treatments. 7, 11 In general, opioids are a common and effective treatment to relieve dyspnea in patients with advanced respiratory illness regardless of underlying etiology. 12, 13 Despite concern over the perceived potential to hasten death in patients with advanced illness, and observations that orders for opioids are a marker of end-of-life, 14,15 the use of opioids for management of dyspnea has not been associated with a significant decrease in time to death. 16, 17 Additionally, prescribing practices remain uneven and there are notable disparities for Black and Hispanic patients in the face of solid evidence that use of opioids in the context of advanced illness is effective. 18, 19 Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, dyspnea was under diagnosed and undertreated among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). 20 The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased the number of patients experiencing dyspnea while simultaneously hindering the ability of physicians to appropriately assess and treat it, due to both sheer numbers of cases admitted over a short time span and reduced clinician-patient interactions related to isolation precautions and need for personal protective equipment. This study seeks to examine the extent to which moderate respiratory distress in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was treated with opioids and/or anxiolytics or palliative care input.",

Female gender (p \u00bc 0.0277), older age (p < 0.0001), white race (p \u00bc 0.0014), non-Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (p \u00bc 0.0356), having an early DNR status (p \u00bc 0.0025) and dying prior to discharge (p < 0.0001) were each associated with having a palliative care consult (Table 3) . Those patients seen in palliative consultation were more likely to receive medication to manage respiratory distress (p < 0.0001). Table 3 describes hospital disposition of the (109) patients that received any medication for symptom management, palliative consultation, or both. The median time from moderate respiratory distress to first medication (for any patient receiving medication after consult) was 9 hours (IQR: 2, 20). Of 45 patients that received both medication and a palliative care consult, 19 (42%) received medication before palliative care consult and 26 (58%) received medication after palliative care consult. Time from moderate respiratory distress documentation to first medication did not differ significantly by palliative care consult vs. none. Of those that received a medication and expired during their hospitalization, the median time from first medication to death was 26 hours (IQR: 14, 88). Time from first medication to death did not differ significantly by whether the patient had a palliative care consult: 24 hours (IQR: 14.5, 85.5) for those that received a palliative care consult vs.33 hours (IQR: 14, 91) for those that did not receive a palliative care consult (p \u00bc 0.38).",

Medications for routinely managing such symptoms (e.g. hydromorphone, lorazepam, morphine, oxycodone) were only ordered for 38.5% of cases. Palliative care expertise, though able to help with managing this distressful symptom, was requested for only 25% of cases.",

Palliative consultations were more likely to be called for goals of care discussions, particularly for patients who already had advanced directives in place. Although patients were more likely to have their respiratory symptoms addressed when the palliative team was involved, patients who were consulted for GOC conversations were still experiencing moderate respiratory distress. The results suggest that the primary medical teams were either not recognizing and/or not addressing respiratory distress. It could be that providers were concerned that pharmacologic treatment of symptoms might tip the balance toward mortality and so were reluctant to administer these treatments. Although patients prescribed medications with no palliative consult did not have a statistically significant longer time to mortality than those who received a palliative care consult, this may have been due to the relatively low numbers of patients (36 hours vs. 24 hours, p \u00bc 0.33). The primary managing team may have recognized an end-of-life scenario in some cases and so were more likely to provide pharmacologic comfort, and this is support by a similar time interval between first documentation of respiratory distress and medication administration. Palliative care consults typically occurred late in the patient's hospital course, suggesting that some of these patients may have experienced more prolonged respiratory distress with the same final outcome.",

The lack of symptom management for the majority of patients with respiratory distress and the time lag between onset of respiratory distress and first medication provides a window of opportunity for improving patient care. As healthcare becomes more automated and technology-oriented, a respiratory distress trigger may be an effective tool to alert healthcare providers to patient needs, especially if a patient is unable to communicate directly or patient-provider interactions are limited by a highly infectious condition such as COVID-19. The goal is to highlight \"blind spots,\" address biases and reduce disparities in provision of symptom management medication. These triggers may be particularly important in the context of COVID-19 or similar crises where the healthcare system is stretched far beyond usual capacity.",

            "text": "There were a number of study limitations. First, due to the exponential increase in patient admissions during this time period, traditional medical floors were transitioned into makeshift ICUs. Despite extensive checking and cleaning of data, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that some patients in this dataset received ICU level care during the course of their hospitalization. Additionally, this analysis could only use data indicating that medications were ordered but cannot confirm at what point they were actually administered or the reason for administration. For example, while we believe that all opioids prescribed were for management of respiratory distress, there is the possibility that some may have been prescribed for pain management. Similarly, we are unable to incorporate the prescription of bronchodilators for respiratory distress, as the use of these medications was reduced in the first stages of the COVID-19 pandemic over concerns of aerosolization. 21 Second, the rapid surge of patients requiring hospitalization led health systems to bring in redeployed physicians who may not have been familiar with current standards of respiratory distress symptom management and/or knowledge to consult palliative care. The overwhelming surge of admissions and severity of illness that occurred in the spring of 2020 resulted in an unparalleled increase in palliative care consultation requests. The demand for palliative services was so out of proportion to the usual consult load that the existing teams were unable to see every patient for whom a consult was requested. 22 This mismatch could have affected the results. Finally, we were unable to determine to what extent symptom management may have been affected by limitations of staffing and patient contact precautions. In the early days of the pandemic, assessment and monitoring of dyspnea in this population may have been limited by the need for protective equipment and shortened physical contact between patients and providers in order to protect clinical staff from exposure.",

While overall symptom management was underprovided, it did not require additional palliative medicine intervention to be effective. Quality improvement initiatives to rectify such under-treatment might include the use of medical record triggers for respiratory distress, interprofessional education for inpatient care teams, and/or use of validated protocols for addressing respiratory symptoms (e.g. pharmacologic management, option for palliative care consultation).",
