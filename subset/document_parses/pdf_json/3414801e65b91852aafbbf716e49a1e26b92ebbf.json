Previous findings on the effects of retirement on wellbeing have been mixed. The present study explores the effects of employment and retirement on health and wellbeing among a sample of rural Australians. Methods: Australian Rural Mental Health Study participants who were aged 45 or over (N = 2013) were included in a series of analyses to compare the health and wellbeing of individuals with differing employment and retirement circumstances. Self-reported outcome variables included perceived physical health and everyday functioning, financial wellbeing, mental health, relationships, and satisfaction with life. Results: Across the outcomes, participants who were employed or retired generally reported better health and wellbeing than those not in the workforce. Retired participants rated more highly than employed participants on mental health, relationships, and satisfaction with life. There was also a short-term benefit for perceived financial status for retired participants compared to employed participants, but this effect diminished over time. Conclusions: While retirement is a significant life transition that may affect multiple facets of an individual's life, the direction and magnitude of these effects vary depending on the retirement context, namely the pre-retirement and concurrent circumstances within which an individual is retiring. Personal perceptions of status changes may also contribute to an individual's wellbeing more so than objective factors such as income. Policies that promote rural work/retirement opportunities and diversity and address rural disadvantage are needed.",

This phenomenon will be among the most significant social transformations of the twenty-first century, with wide-ranging implications across many areas, including labour and financial markets, housing, and family structures and intergenerational ties [2] . Ensuring the health and wellbeing of older people will become increasingly important as this demographic group will account for a greater proportion of the population, while the resources to support them decrease [2] . Retirement represents a major life transition affecting older adults [3] . In Australia, it is projected that one in four individuals will be at the nominal retirement age of 65 or over by 2056 [4] . This effect is expected to be especially pronounced in regional and remote areas [5] ; consequently, understanding the key associations between retirement and health and wellbeing in these locations is likely to be increasingly important, given the relative absence of existing research.",

The authors concluded that further longitudinal research in this area is needed, particularly studies considering the contextual factors surrounding retirement, as this was noted to be lacking. Transition to retirement may also take several forms, including, for example, a single retirement episode (either voluntary or involuntary), multiple employment/retirement status changes over an extended period, or a shift from unemployment or other benefits to an age-based pension. These transition phases also need to be evaluated within the context of other key influences, such as chronic disease, recent adverse life events, and periods of unemployment, which have all been shown to impact on or be associated with physical, social, and emotional wellbeing [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , as have a range of other psychosocial factors [14, 15] . Early retirement may also be influenced by different factors to those associated with leaving the workforce at 65, and contribute to role uncertainty related psychological discomfort, at least in the medium term [16] .",

Australia's population is diverse, as residents inhabit a broad geographical area, and factors such as socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics, community relationships, and the meaning and value of work often vary accordingly [24, 25] . Rural work, especially in certain industries such as farming, is often inter-generational and involves significant ties to the local community. The rural workforce is typically older than that in urban areas, with the average age of farmers being 53 years compared with 40 years for workers in other occupations [24] . Likewise, compared with major cities, rural areas have a greater proportion of residents aged over 65 [26] . The meaning of retirement itself among such diverse groups is worthy of exploration, together with changing societal attitudes and expectations. Moreover, cessation of an employment role can entail a significant impact on personal identity, as well as finances, property and housing, sense of purpose and belonging in the local community [25] , and potentially initiates a major change in lifestyle. Compounding this, evidence suggests that rural residents are less likely to retire voluntarily, with forced retirement due to illness or injury being significantly more common than in urban areas [27] . Not only does this often necessitate a greater reliance on health and social support, it in turn is also associated with further negative outcomes, including poorer self-reported physical and mental health [28] .",

Employment/retirement effects were explored in relation to six self-reported outcome variables, namely, perceived: physical health, everyday functioning, financial position, mental health, relationships, and satisfaction with life. For each of these outcomes, a separate generalised estimating equation (GEE) was run to explore the independent associations (reported as raw regression weights) with the following predictor variables: aggregate work/retirement status, study phase (and selected interactions by work/retirement status), sex, whether participants live on a farm, chronic illness (No/Yes), marital status (currently married: No/ Yes), recent adverse life events (continuous score: 0 to 9), ARIA accessibility/remoteness (continuous score: 0 to 15), and current/previous occupation (11 categories). As this analysis strategy differs somewhat from conventional analyses of longitudinal data (i.e., analyses examining differential changes in outcome variables over time), some additional explanation is warranted. By-andlarge, our data set did not facilitate a prospective evaluation of employment transitions (during the actual study period), with the vast majority of participants (85.8%) in the same category at all study phases (i.e., employed, not in workforce, or retired); consequently, the reference category used in the GEE analyses for the dummy-coded work/retirement status predictor variables was the 'Employed (all phases)' group. However, there were sufficient numbers of participants who experienced a single transition during the study period (i.e., from employed, or not in the workforce, to retired) to enable some specific comparisons with the other work/retirement status groups. Aggregate differences between study phases and a targeted subset of interactions were also examined in the GEE analyses. For example, within-subject dummycoded predictor variables assessing study phase differences were included, together with interaction predictors examining phase by work/retirement status effects; with the latter predictors only anticipated to reveal differential changes involving the transitioning groups (if they were present).",

On the other hand, as most of the outcome measures were rated on comparable 1 to 5 scales, the raw score regression weights reported here are relatively easy to interpret and compare. So, by way of illustration (using the first regression weight of \u2212 0.76 in Table 2 ): when controlling for the other predictor variables, perceived physical health was typically rated 0.76 units lower (on the global rating scale) by participants who were not in the workforce compared with those who were employed at all phases; this is comparable to the unadjusted mean difference between these groups across all phases of 0.80 (i.e., with corresponding group mean ratings of 2.50 and 3.30; see Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 1a) .",

Over the four survey phases, there were a total of 5379 responses, with participants completing an average of 2.8 surveys in total. There were small but statistically significant correlations (ranging from 0.10 to 0.14, p < 0.001) between baseline ratings for five of the These sub-groups were excluded from the primary analyses due to small sample sizes and variable employment/retirement patterns outcomes (except perceived relationships) and the number of survey phases completed; collectively, they accounted for 3.1% of the variance in this study retention index, with participants who perceived their baseline health and wellbeing more positively likely to complete more phases. By comparison, baseline outcomes ratings were moderately correlated (p < 0.001) with the corresponding ratings at subsequent phases (ranging from 0.52 to 0.58 for the global health ratings, and 0.69 for perceived financial position). Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1 by data source (since different subsets of data were used in the various analyses). The majority (78.4%) of the sample were either employed or retired across all available phases, with a further 7.4% out of the workforce across all phases (e.g., unemployed, unable to work). Only two of the remaining aggregate work/retirement status groups had sufficient sample sizes at baseline to be retained in the primary analyses, including 6.8% of participants (N = 136) transitioning from employment to retirement across the study phases, and 3.4% (N = 68) who transitioned from not in the workforce to retirement. Consequently, only 10.6% of participants included in the primary analyses (N = 204 of 1931) actually transitioned to retirement during the study; amongst whom, 4.9, 58.3 and 36.8% were identified as transitioning by the 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-ups, respectively. There was a clear age progression across the retained groups, reflective of their delineation. On average (using all available data), participants who were employed (mean age = 55.54, SD = 6.66) or not in the workforce (mean age = 55.22, SD = 5.36) at all phases were younger, followed by the two transitioning groups (employed to retired: mean age = 62.65, SD = 5.31; not in workforce to retired: mean age = 61.14, SD = 3.85), with those retired at all phases being much older (mean age = 71.99, SD = 6.85). Other socio-demographic differences between the retained groups were in the expected directions (see Supplementary Table S1 ); for example, participants who were employed at all phases were more likely to live on a farm (32.6% vs. 12.9%) and reported lower aggregate rates of chronic disease (43.1% vs. 69.5%), largely reflective of our rural sampling and age-related effects. As shown in Table 1 , the average age of the sample also rose by 4.16 years from baseline to the 5-year follow-up, while rates of chronic disease increased from half (53.1%) to two-thirds (66.5%) of the sample during this period, with blood pressure problems being the largest contributor (increasing from 40.0% at baseline to 53.4% at 5-years).",

Participants who retired more than 5 years before the study tended to report a younger retirement age, particularly female respondents (53.29 vs. 58.95 years), which is consistent with national retirement Note: In Australia, 'superannuation' typically refers to money compulsorily put aside by your employer over your working life that you can access when you retire (currently equivalent to a minimum of 9.5% of your salary). The four categories reported here were based on employment status at baseline, any subsequent retirement during the study period, and self-reported duration and reasons for retirement from the 5-year follow-up survey (with a minimum of one reason required for inclusion in this analysis). Statistical significance was based on overall Chi-square tests (df = 3): *p < 0.01, **p < 0.001 age trends. Overall, the most frequently given reason (35.9%) for retiring or being likely to retire was reaching the usual or desired retirement age. There were some notable differences between the reasons for retirement reported by those who had already retired (either prior to the study, or during the study phase) and the proposed reasons for retirement among those who planned to retire in the next 5 years. Eligibility for superannuation (or being financially secure) was listed as a proposed reason for retirement by almost half (44.2%) of those who planned to retire in the next 5 years, but was listed as an actual reason for retirement by only 19.1% of participants who were already retired. Similarly, lifestyle reasons and a declining interest in work were listed as proposed reasons for retirement by one-third (33.7%) and one-quarter (25.6%) of participants who were yet to retire, respectively, with significantly fewer retired participants indicating that these factors actually influenced their retirement decision (17.6 and 11.3%, respectively); these two reasons also showed the clearest progression across the four retirement timeframes in Table 4 . Participants who had actually retired were also significantly more likely to report that this was due to their own sickness, injury, or disability than those who were yet to retire (15.3% vs. 3.5%). In addition, we compared self-reported reasons for retirement provided by male and female respondents. Overall, males were more likely than females to list eligibility for superannuation (or being financially secure) as a reason for retirement (29.3% vs. 18.5%; \u03c7 2 (1) = 9.00, p = 0.003); however, this disparity was less marked among those who planned to retire in the next 5 years (46.2% vs. 43.3%). While males were also more likely to list their own sickness, injury, or disability as a reason for retirement (18.1% vs. 10.2%; \u03c7 2 (1) = 7.34, p = 0.007), this disparity was greatest among those who retired more than 5 years before the study (24.7% vs. 6.3%). The progression across categories noted in Table 4 for a declining interest in work was more evident among female respondents (2.7, 8.5, 15.1, 25.0%), although there was no overall difference in the endorsement of this reason between male and female respondents (15.9% vs. 11.7%; \u03c7 2 (1) = 2.10, p = 0.147). In contrast, two reasons for retirement were clearly less likely to be listed by male respondents, retirement of partner (1.7% vs. 21.5%; \u03c7 2 (1) = 46.13, p < 0.001) and caring for family member/friend (2.6% vs. 9.5%; \u03c7 2 (1) = 10.55, p = 0.001).

Therefore, to a large extent, the window on work/retirement effects provided by these data is a relatively stable one, a multi-phase cross-section if you like, that probably reveals as much about baseline characteristics, long-term employment benefits, and associated capacity to retire effects as it does about recent or pending transitions. In short, the factors that contributed to non-participation in the workforce and/or to retirement decisions are likely to have had an ongoing impact on perceived health and wellbeing.

For example, while participants who were not in the workforce for the duration of the study rated significantly poorer mental health, relationships, and satisfaction with life compared with employed participants, these differences tended to dissipate somewhat when participants transitioned from being not in the workforce to retirement. In Australia, the age pension has reasonably similar financial benefits to other government assistance schemes, such as disability benefits; although unemployment benefits are currently substantially lower (however, they were temporarily boosted during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic). These findings are therefore less likely to be related to financial circumstances, and may reflect the importance of self-perception, sense of purpose, or stigma, and the effects that these may have on an individual's wellbeing. Negative perceptions associated with receipt of unemployment benefits have also been shown to dissipate with re-entry to the workforce [40] ; perhaps, similar reductions in self-perceived stigma occur with transition to an age pension.",

            "text": "Given the broad range of factors impacting on retirement decisions, it is not surprising that there is now considerable heterogeneity in retirement timing [41] . Previous research has also indicated that contextual differences play a role in individuals' experience of retirement, resulting in inconsistent research findings regarding the effects of retirement on health and wellbeing. In NSW's 45 and Up study, significant decreases were found in physical functioning for men and women following retirement, with men also reporting a small increase in their psychological distress during this time [42] . An earlier analysis of this data set showed that retirement had a negative effect on psychological distress for those aged 45-64, as well as for men aged 65-74, but that this effect did not occur in those aged 75 and older [43] . The authors, and others [16] , speculated that such patterns may be attributable to involuntary retirement in younger age groups (e.g., due to physical health issues, redundancy, or caring responsibilities) and, therefore, may not be the result of retirement directly. Conversely, findings from both the 45 and Up and the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) studies have shown that retirement has a positive effect on health behaviours, including physical activity, smoking, and sleep [44, 45] . This improvement in health behaviours following retirement may negate some of the physical effects of aging, which may explain the current study's findings that retirement had no effect on perceived physical health. Overall, findings from the HILDA survey suggest that there is a high level of diversity in people's post-retirement experiences, with 60% of people experiencing fluctuations in life satisfaction following retirement [46] . In concordance with this, research from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing concluded that there appears to be no categorical benefit or harm associated with retirement, in itself [47] .",

Those with 'good, stable' living standards (> 85% of the population) in the period preceding pension eligibility reported relatively stable mental health with age but moderate declines in physical health. By comparison, among subgroups characterised initially by hardship, those with 'increasing' living standards reported improvements in mental health with age but no change in physical health, whereas those with 'decreasing' living standards reported declining mental and physical health with age.

Those who were yet to retire were more likely to indicate that retirement decisions would be based on financial security or eligibility for superannuation, or due to a declining interest in work or other lifestyle reasons. Interestingly, the proportion of people who had retired for these reasons increased among those recently retired (e.g., 21% of respondents who retired during the study period reported that it was due to lifestyle reasons, compared with 14% of those who had been retired for longer than 5 years). Therefore, while the results of this analysis may reflect perceptions of retirement differing among those who are yet to retire, it may also indicate a genuine change over time in the circumstances surrounding the decision to retire, with control over this decision increasing compared to previous generations. Conversely, ongoing environmental stressors and associated financial hardship within the farming sector may have contributed to higher rates of exit from the industry in more recent times [24, 32] .",

Arguably, localised strategies also need to be fostered within rural communities that address social connection, mental health problems, early intervention, service accessibility, and health workforce challenges [54] . More broadly, policies that promote identification and alleviation of poor health and material hardship in the decade prior to retirement (or pension/superannuation eligibility) may reduce health inequalities in later life [48] .
