During the pandemic, patients with ESRD were of particular concerns. They have increased rates of comorbidities, hospitalization and deaths, which adds up to the burden of COVID-19. Patients on HD are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the worst outcomes of COVID-19, because they are usually elderly and have a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension [7, 8] .

Half of the patients completed their high school, 27.3% had a university degree, 13.2% had basic education or less and 9.8% were illiterate. More than half the patients were not working or retired and about 10% were housewives. Over two-thirds of the patients were living at urban areas. About 70% of the patients had other chronic health conditions. The most frequent chronic comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cardiac diseases (57%, 20%, 20% respectively). Only 1.5% of patients were not insured (i.e. out-of-pocket spending). The most common causes for hemodialysis in our patients were CKD of unknown etiology and hypertension (38% and 36% respectively). About 56% of the patients were on hemodialysis for five years or more. Only one patient had had a history of chronic peritoneal dialysis who was shifted to HD one-year prior to starting this study. Likewise, 18 (8.8%) patients had had a history of kidney transplantation, but they developed chronic rejection and were maintained on HD before the study. Forty-three percent of the patients reported private transportation as the mean transportation method to the hemodialysis center. Sixty percent were not accompanied by anyone on their way to the center. Twenty-five patients had a past history of COVID-19, either clinically suspected (12 patients, 5.9%) or PCR-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (13 patients, 6.3%) ( Table 1) . About twothirds of patients were adherent to the social distancing and home-isolation measures, while most patients were adherent to other protective measures such as mask and gloves (85.4%); or disinfection and hand washing (91.7%). Adherence to medications and hemodialysis was selfreported by the ESRD-AQ. Subdomains and items scores of the ESRD-AQ were summarized in the Supplementary table 1 (S1). There was a significant agreement between the self-reported attendance and the actual attendance (retrieved from patients' medical records) of the hemodialysis sessions (Kappa = 0.733, p < 0.001). Self-reported attendance was less than actual attendance in 28 patients (13.7%). Forty patients (19.5%) were not adherent during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to 24 (11.7%) before the pandemic, with a statistically significant difference. Sixteen (7.8%) patients who were adherent before the pandemic turned to non-adherent during the pandemic, while 15 (7.3%) patients with pre-pandemic good adherence turned to moderate adherence during the pandemic ( Table 2) .",

The attribute claimed for rising non-adherence among patients with ESRD was the psychological distress. A study by Lee et al. [27] showed that over 85% of the studied ESRD patients were anxious about having their dialysis treatments because of the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during transportation or during dialysis sessions. In our study, we assessed fears of COVID-19 among our patients using FCV-19S. Earlier studies using FCV-19S in the general population reported a mean score of 18.5 and suggested that a cutoff point of \u2265 17.5 considered as a predictive risk for development of anxiety, depression or other psychiatric symptoms [28, 29] . The mean score of FCV-19S among our ESRD patients was 18.8, which was consistent with the mean score reported in the general population. Moreover, our study findings were [29] in that ESRD patients on HD might cope better with the pandemic as they are less affected by measures of social distancing and have high resilience. In our study, FCV-19S showed significant positive correlations with the pre-dialysis phosphorus and potassium. A study by Sousa et al. [30] showed that levels of serum albumin and dialysis adequacy decreased significantly, while phosphorus levels increased, during COVID-19 outbreak, and suggested that results were because of difficulties in dietary restrictions and diminished physical activity during the lockdown [30] . However, in our study, the FCV-19S score showed a significant negative correlation with the pre-dialysis PTH. This unanticipated finding could be explained by the significantly higher FCV-19S score among non-adherent patients who showed less pre-dialysis PTH, compared to adherent patients. Furthermore, the low pre-dialysis PTH was observed in many non-adherent patients in our sample who were either on calcimimetics or had had a partial parathyroidectomy (8 and 10 patients, respectively). Further studies with appropriate power are needed to investigate these observed correlations.",

Patients on HD should be carefully monitored for nonadherence during the COVID-19 pandemic, to avoid the adverse consequences of poor adherence. Patient-tailored strategies should be implemented to improve adherence and mitigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on HD patients.",
