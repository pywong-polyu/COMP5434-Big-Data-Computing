These drugs are active as the specific inhibitors of cytochrom P-450 enzyme lanosterol 14-\u03b1demethylase [3] , which determines the biosynthesis of ergosterol-the main structural component of the fungus cell membrane [4, 5] . The problem with treating fungal infections is quite difficult since it requires the creation of effective and non-toxic drugs acting exclusively against them. Moreover, unfortunately, fungi develop resistance to many drugs used. Such an evolutionary process pushes the medical scientists to a constant searching for new antifungal molecules.",

            "text": "Modern drug discovery methods tend to advance large and hydrophobic molecules, which are likely to suffer from limited solubility and low bioavailability [6, 7] . The pharmaceutical industry widely uses the drug delivery systems that can mitigate these risks. To achieve solubility improvement, the systems based on: micronization [8] , nanoparticle formation [9] , lipid-based formulations [10] , cocrystallization [11] , formation of host-guest complexes with cyclodextrins [10] and associates with biopolymers [12] and micellar surfactants [13] are widely applied. Estimation of drug solubility in mixtures of water and cosolvents can provide valuable information on solubility enhancement and the factors controlling the solubility phenomenon. The ability of the surfactants to form the micelles in aqueous solution is due to the formation of self-assemblies, which can incorporate poorly soluble drug into the hydrophobic core, while the hydrophilic part provides protection against micelle-protein interactions that contribute to longer-lasting action and stability [13] . Moreover, preventing the precipitation of the drug in solution allows the maintenance of the required therapeutic level of the drug in the blood. In turn, cyclic oligosaccharidescyclodextrins forming soluble 'host-guest' type complexes with drug compound in solution have been successfully applied for drug solubilization, both in the research environment and in clinical use. The ability of cyclodextrin to form an inclusion complex with a guest molecule is determined by the steric factor and the thermodynamic interactions between different components of the system (cyclodextrin, guest, solvent) [14] . Toxicity studies have demonstrated lack of absorption of CDs from the gastrointestinal tract [15] . A vast array of native and modified CDs is applied in pharmaceutics. Amongst them, \u03b2-CD is of a high importance since it has a potential for complex formation due to availability, low cost and high efficiency [14] but, at the same time, has several limitations, such as limited aqueous solubility, nephrotoxicity because of the interactions with lipid membrane components [15] . In turn, many branched derivatives are highly soluble and bio-adaptable. Among them, 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and 6-O-Maltosyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, which have been used in the present study, possess high aqueous solubility and lower toxicity as compared to \u03b2-cyclodextrin [16] . Furthermore, 6-O-Maltosyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin synthesized by enzymatic addition of maltose to the external (primary) hydroxyl groups of the initial \u03b2-cyclodextrin macrocycle through an \u03b1-(1\u21926) glycosidic linkage. Being a useful functional excipient in the pharmaceutical industry [17] , this glycosylated cyclodextrin does not have a pronounced taste and is suitable for use even in the food industry [14] . Notably, 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin has greater applicability in pharmaceutics than 6-O-Maltosyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin.",

Among them there are studies devoted to fluconazole-structure analogue of S-119-the object of the present investigation. As it has been identified, within the literature, the solubility of fluconazole was improved in \u03b2-cyclodextrin [28, 29] , 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and sulfobutyl ether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin [30] solutions. Besides this, the increased dissolution rate of fluconazole in solid dispersions with \u03b2-cyclodextrin, PEG-6000 and PVP K30 was demonstrated [31] . Taking into account the results of our previous study [32] where a poor solubility of S-119 in aqueous solutions was estimated (4.45 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol\u00b7L \u22121 at pH 2.0 and 4.01 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol\u00b7L \u22121 at pH 7.4) and data from the literature review it seemed reasonable to check the possibility of S-119 solubility improvement via cyclodextrins and polymers.",

This method was successfully applied by di Cagno et al. [36] for the permeability evaluation of a whole set of diverse drugs. The donor solution of the investigated compound was placed in the lower chamber. The membrane was mounted between the donor and acceptor chambers. At the start of the experiment, the upper (acceptor) compartment was filled with the respective pure buffer. The donor solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer bar. The samples of 0.5 mL were withdrawn from the receptor solution each 30 min over 5 h and replaced with the same volume of pure buffer. The volume of the donor solution in the lower compartment was 7 mL and the receptor volume was 1 mL. A schematic diagram of the equipment is illustrated in Figure 2 . Two types of barriers were applied for the permeability evaluation: the regenerated cellulose membrane (RC) with a molecular weight cut off MWCO 12-14 kDa (Standard Grade RC Dialysis Membrane, Flat Width 45 mm) and the PermeaPad (PP) barrier (PHABIOC, Germany, www.permeapad.com, accessed on 20 May 2021). The PermeaPad barrier was used as received from the supplier. The cellulose membrane was pretreated with distilled water for 30 min and the traces of water were removed with filter paper before use. The membrane effective surface area was 0.785 cm 2 . Buffer solution pH 2.0 was applied throughout the experiment due to impossibility of the drug detection in the receptor solution at pH 7.4, where S-119 solubility is extremely low. The permeability coefficients of S-119 were measured with buffer pH 2.0 and 1.5 w/v% of \u03b1-CD, HP-\u03b2-CD and O-M-\u03b2-CD in the donor compartment. The temperature of the system was maintained at 37.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u2022 C. The concentrations of the sample solutions were measured using spectrophotometer (Spectramax 190; Molecular devices, Molecular Devices Corporation, California, CA, USA) in 96-well UV black plates (Costar) at \u03bb = 261 nm.

It has poor solubility in aqueous media (4.45\u00b710 \u22123 M and 4.01\u00b710 \u22125 M in buffers pH 2.0 and pH 7.4, respectively, at 25 \u2022 C), which would be a reason for its inadequate transport properties and bioavailability. In the present work, we made attempts to improve the solubility with the help of different pharmaceutical excipients (solubilizing agents). To this end, the equilibrium solubility of S-119 was measured at several concentrations of polymers (including those forming the micelles in solution) and cyclodextrins. The concentrations of the saturated solutions were determined by UVspectroscopy. The spectra of the solutions in the presence of all excipients were similar to those in pure buffers at both pHs (\u03bb = 261 and 266 nm) indicating no changes in S-119 state. As an example, the plots of UV spectra for the solutions in buffer pH 7.4 are introduced in Figure S1 (Supplementary Materials). As previously shown [32] , the solubility of the substance is affected by the pH of aqueous medium. Due to this fact, the experiments were carried out in two pHs in order to reveal the simultaneously impact of the pH and excipient on the solubility. The solubility of the compound at different concentrations of the excipients is listed in Table S1 (SI). As follows from the table, a pronounced effect of pH on the shape of the solubility dependences was revealed. An increase in S-119 apparent solubility in all systems was observed at the elevated solubilizers concentrations in buffer pH 7.4, as opposed to buffer pH 2.0, where a diverse solubility behavior in the presence of excipients was revealed. [28] [29] [30] deal with unbuffered water, the difference can be attributed both to the structural features of the studied compounds and the ionization state of the molecules. In addition, the observed situation clearly proved the validity of using buffer solutions when ionizable compounds are under study.",

            "text": "The slope values of the phase-solubility diagrams are lower than unity, indicating the 1:1 stoichiometry of the complexes in the investigated range of cyclodextrin concentrations [21] . The calculated K S values of the complexes are illustrated in Figure 4 and listed in Table S2 (SI) along with the complexation efficiency and drug:CD molar ratio. Evidently, neutral S-119 (at pH 7.4) exhibits higher affinity to CDs than cationic particles (at pH 2.0), due to an essential contribution of the hydrophobic effect on complex formation [38] . Importantly, only the stability constants obtained by S-119 with all CDs at pH 7.4 belong to the range from 200 to 5000 M \u22121 . As stated by Szejtli [39] , this range meets a sufficient potential bioavailability due to an optimal drug release and amount of free drug intended to be absorbed in the lipid layer of the biological membrane. In turn, the stability of the complexes forming in acidic solution (pH 2.0) is low (from 5 to 27.4 M \u22121 for \u03b1and \u03b2-CD, respectively), which is coming from a small number of intermolecular interactions between the CDs and compound. As such, this can promote a rapid release of a substance and reduce the influence of complexation on the solubility [39] . The following sequence of the stability constants was stated: \u03b1-CD < HP-\u03b2-CD < O-M-\u03b2-CD < \u03b2-CD (Table S2, Figure 4 ) at both pHs. A similar trend was reported for fluconazole/HP-\u03b2-CD and fluconazole/\u03b2-CD complexes by Orgovan et al. [40] : the stability constants for neutral state of the FCZ molecules with \u03b2and HP-\u03b2-CD as 93.3 M \u22121 and 43.6 M \u22121 , respectively, were derived by the authors from the phase solubility diagrams. Interestingly, the complexes of S-119 at pH 7.4 are essentially more stable (47-and 52-fold for \u03b2and HP-\u03b2-CD, respectively), as compared to those of FCZ. Undoubtedly, the lipophilicity of the compounds plays a crucial role in the interactions with the hydrophobic CD cavity. According to logD oct = 0.5 [41] , FCZ belongs to the substances of moderate lipophilicity, whereas for S-119 logD oct = 1.43 [32] . The K S values for the cationic species of FCZ in acidic solution were shown to be lower (10.7 and 13.5 M \u22121 ), similarly to S-119, according to a poor affinity of the charged particles to the hydrophobic cavity of CD [42] . This trend is correlated with the intrinsic solubility S 0 2 , which is significantly lower for the uncharged S-119 molecules. Obviously, a driving force for the inclusion in the CD cavity is lower when the aqueous solubility is higher [43] . The stability constants of FCZ in unbuffered water (68.7 M \u22121 and 34.6 M \u22121 for \u03b2and HP-\u03b2-CD, respectively) were reported by Fern\u00e1ndez-Ferreiro et al. [30] and follow the regularity K S (\u03b2-CD) > K S (HP-\u03b2-CD). The more stable complexes of nimodipine with \u03b2-CD as compared to HP-\u03b2-CD were obtained by Kopecky et al. [44] . The possible reason for the observed regularity is hindering the penetration of a bulky compound molecule into the cavity by the hydroxypropyl group [45] and, thus, lowering the complexation ability in comparison to the parent CD, especially at the higher degree of substitution. The least stable complex with \u03b1-CD as compared to parent \u03b2-CD and derivatives occurs probably due to the geometrically more suitable cavity of \u03b2-CDs for incorporation of the aromatic fragment of the S-119 molecule.",

The small difference indicates only negligible steric hindrance of maltose residue attached to the primary hydroxyl group of \u03b2-CD. In a whole, maltosyl branches only minimally affect the inclusion complex formation compared to native \u03b2-CD. In spite of the higher stability of S-119/\u03b2-CD complexes, undoubtedly, branched HP-\u03b2-CD and O-M-\u03b2-CD are better solubilizers for poorly water-soluble S-119, since their high aqueous solubility allows for the achievement of much higher concentrations of the compound and no solid complexes precipitate even at higher CD concentrations.",

At the same time, a dramatic solubility growth above 4 w/v% takes place. In these systems the dissolution at low excipient concentrations is associated with the predominance of the processes strengthening the structure of water by the hydrophobic mechanism, since upon the small additions of polymers their non-polar groups stabilize the structure of water [46] . In turn, the polar groups of the excipients can replace the water molecules in the nodes of the ice-like framework and destroy the quasicrystalline structure of water by forming hydrogen bonds. The cumulative influence of all these factors determines the compound solubility at low contents of a non-aqueous component [47] . The dramatic solubility increase, from 4 to about 7 w/v% of the excipients, is due to the processes of destruction of quazicrystalline structure of water with polymer molecules and replacement of water molecules in the solvate shell of S-119 by the polymeric molecules which promotes the process of dissolution. Moreover, in buffer solution at pH 7.4, the consequence of the polymers in respect of the extent of the solubilization changed: PVP (232-fold) > PEG 6000 (193-fold) > PEG 35000 (79-fold). Highly probably, the reason for this phenomenon is similar to CD solutions, namely, a driving force for the association between the compound and polymer is lower when the aqueous solubility is higher. Taken together, the presence of the non-polar regions in the polymer structures can reduce the water polarity and weaken its intermolecular hydrogen-bonding network, resulting in a solubility increase in a non-polar substance. At the same time, for ionized (at pH 2.0) species of S-119, this effect is not pronounced due to the affinity to hydrophilic aqueous medium. In addition, the ability of polymers to change the hydration state of the substance, per se, and to form water-soluble associates with the excipients [48] , via van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding, are also responsible for the solubility increase [49] . For the sake of comparison, the reported data [50] on the solubility enhancement of imidazole class antifungal-clotrimazole show 17.5-fold solubility growth in 20% solution of PVP K30, which is essentially lower than for S-119 in 20% PVP (232-fold).

As follows from Figure 5 , even a certain decrease in S-119 solubility in both surfactants solutions at pH 2.0 is observed. Obviously, the ionized particles of the compound do not undergo the incorporation into the micelles of Brij S20 and F-127. As it was reported [52] , the more nonpolar the solute, the more likely it is to be incorporated in the core of the micelle. Moreover, the increase in the surfactant concentration can reduce the number of hydrogen binding sites available for the association of the compound and surfactant. At that point, the surfactant molecules interact with water, affect its structuring and hinder the interactions with positively charged species. As opposed to pH 2.0, at pH 7.4 a pronounced growth of S-119 solubility (199-fold and 281-fold for Brij S20 and F-127, respectively) in 10 w/v% was detected. The solubilizing potential of the micelles of both surfactants towards S-119 in solution from the linear phase solubility diagrams at pH 7.4 was obtained.

It can be determined from the slope of the dependence S m /S 0 on surfactant concentration ( Figure S3 ). As a result of the regression, K m/w equal to 2303 \u00b1 29 and 35343 \u00b1 302 for S-119/Brij S20 and S-119/F-127, respectively, were determined, clearly demonstrating a higher solubilizing effect of F127 on S-119. Possibly, availability of extended polypropylenoxide (hydrophobic) block in the structure of F-127 molecule promotes the inclusion of S-119 hydrophobic molecules into the micelles. The obtained results proved that the structure of surfactant strongly influences the solubilizing effect towards a poor soluble substance. This observation is confirmed by the literature data [59] on another antifungal-ketoconazole-for which different solubilizing capacity (\u03c7) (0.15, 0.26 and 0.29), as well as partition coefficient micelle/water (26,779, 33,458 and 35,317) were obtained in such non-ionic surfactants as Myrj 52, Tween 80 and Brij 35, respectively. Evidently, the solubilizing capacity of all these agents with respect to ketoconazole drug is comparable with that of Brij S20 and lower than that of F-127 with respect to S-119. Obviously, the ionization of S-119 species at pH 2.0 makes it absolutely impossible the incorporation of the compound in the micelles of both block copolymers.",

In the present study, the transport of S-119 through the regenerated cellulose (RC) membrane and the PermeaPad barrier (PP) was investigated and compared. The PermeaPad barrier is composed of lipid substrate approximating it to the real membranes of the intestine epithelium [36] . As reported [60] , semi-permeable cellulose membranes are highly permeable to many drugs and are useful for the optimal design of drug-cyclodextrin formulations. As opposed to lipophilic biological membranes and also the PermeaPad barrier, both drug and drug-CD complexes can diffuse through the membrane of sufficient MWCO [61] , for example, 12-14 kDa. As a result, the transport across the RC is influenced by the possibility of drug penetration not only as free molecules but also in the content of CD complexes preventing the precipitation of poorly soluble compound. Since the size of the complex is essentially greater than that of the free drug molecule, its diffusion coefficient is lower, which would decrease the movement through the membrane. From all the aforesaid, rather different modes of permeability across PP and RC membranes should be considered for the interpretation of the results.",

As follows, the permeation experiments were carried out at pH 2.0 for all studied systems, as reported in our previous study [32] . The initial experimental data used for the P app calculation, and the resultant cumulative amounts of the permeated S-119 and FCZ (for comparison), steady state fluxes and permeability coefficients through the PP barrier and RC membrane are given in Table 1 . Figure 6a depicts the kinetic dependences of the cumulative amount of the permeated S-119 from pure buffer and from 1.5 w/v% solutions of \u03b1-CD, HP-\u03b2-CD and 6-O-M-CD. As evident from Figure 6a , for pure buffer and all CD solutions, the flux J (slope of the kinetic dependence) through the RC membrane is higher than the PP barrier, possibly due both to the high retention of a lipid layer in the PP and the diffusion of both drug and drug/CD complexes through RC (in case of CD solutions). The same regularity of the permeability coefficients is illustrated in Figure 6b . The comparison of the results for S-119 and FCZ revealed an essentially faster diffusion of FCZ through both barriers (1.8-and 1.2-fold for RC and PP, respectively). An essentially larger value of P app for FCZ through RC as compared to S-119 can be explained by its higher diffusion coefficient in water. As stated by Avdeef et al. [62] , diffusion coefficients in pure water (D w ) at room temperature can be calculated by the empirical formula: logD w = \u22124.113 \u2212 0.4609 logMW (6) where MW is the molecular weight of the diffusing molecule. Expectedly, the calculations showed the diffusion coefficients equal to 5.51 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 4.17 \u00d710 \u22126 for FCZ and S-119, respectively. Interestingly, the difference in the P app values between these compounds is smoothed in the case of PP barrier. Obviously, the lipophilicity plays a crucial role upon the permeation through a lipophilic layer of PP: a highly lipophilic S-119 (logD oct = 1.43) more readily passes the lipid layer than moderate lipophilic FCZ (logD oct = 0.5).",

Complex analysis of the driving forces of the solubilization, micellization and complexation processes proved the solubility results and suggested pluronic F-127 and O-maltosyl-\u03b2-CD as promising solubilizing agents for poor soluble S-119 compound. The comparison of the S-119 permeability through the regenerated cellulose membrane and lipophilic PermeaPad barrier revealed a considerable effect of the lipid layer on the decrease in the permeability coefficient. According to the PermeaPad, S-119 was classified as highly permeated substance. The addition of 1.5 w/v% CDs in donor solution moves it to low-medium permeability class. ",

It seems interesting to compare the degree of the solubility enhancement by CD complexation of the newly investigated drug (S-119) and the closest structural analoguefluconazole. According to the literature [28], only a 1.1-fold solubility growth was obtained for fluconazole in 0.0016 M aqueous \u03b2-CD solution as compared to 6.8-fold for S-119 (0.0015 M \u03b2-CD, pH 7.4). Analogous regularity is characteristic for HP-\u03b2-CD-the solubilization is more effective for S-119 (a 24-fold increase in 0.01 M CD) as compared to a 1.2-fold solubility increase in 0.004 M HP-\u03b2-CD for fluconazole. Interestingly, Fern\u00e1ndez-Ferreiro et al. [30] reported a 4-fold higher solubility of fluconazole in 0.08 M aqueous HP-\u03b2-CD, as compared to our data for S-119, which indicates a 151-fold solubility growth in 0.07 M CD.
