The CLP procedure comprises the cecal ligation below the ileocecal valve, followed by needle perforation (puncture) of the cecum [16] . Since rodent sepsis induced by CLP mimics the pathogenesis (bacteremia evoking the host immune response, leading to septic shock, multiorgan failure and finally death) and symptoms of the human disease well, it is considered a realistic and therefore clinically relevant sepsis model [16] [17] [18] . The surgical procedure was performed according to the published protocol by Rittirsch et al. [18] .

The CLP procedure comprises the cecal ligation below the ileocecal valve, followed by needle perforation (puncture) of the cecum [16] . Since rodent sepsis induced by CLP mimics the pathogenesis (bacteremia evoking the host immune response, leading to septic shock, multiorgan failure and finally death) and symptoms of the human disease well, it is considered a realistic and therefore clinically relevant sepsis model [16] [17] [18] . The surgical procedure was performed according to the published protocol by Rittirsch et al. [18] . In short, the cecum of the mice was exposed after midline laparotomy under a ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (120 mg/kg ketamine and 16 mg/kg xylazine in 0.9% NaCl). The cecum was ligated at the medium position for the induction of a midgrade sepsis with the ileocecal valve as a reference to determine the cecal length (Figure 1 ). Using a 21-gauge needle, the cecum was punctured in a mesenteric-to-antimesenteric direction. A small droplet of feces was milked into the peritoneum to induce bacterial peritonitis. After relocating the cecum into the abdominal cavity, the wound was closed by running sutures to the abdominal musculature and to the skin. After completed surgery, animals were resuscitated by injection of prewarmed saline (37 \u2022 C, 50 mL/kg, s.c.). Sham animals underwent the same surgical procedure except for the cecal ligation and puncture step. Mice were monitored closely after surgery and buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.) was injected every 6 h for postoperative analgesia (until euthanasia). For best consistency and reproducibility, the procedure was done at the same time of the day and performed by the same operator.",

It is released after food uptake from the intestine and is involved in human blood sugar regulation. Analogs of the peptide like liraglutide are established drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and clinical trials proved a positive effect on the cardiovascular outcome of diabetic patients [31] (for review see [2] ). Several preclinical and clinical trials have aimed to elucidate the cardiovascular protective effect of GLP-1 analogs beyond glycemic control. This is complicated by the fact that the GLP-1 receptor is expressed on various cell types including cells of the cardiovascular system of inflammatory cells. Today it is known that not only one single mechanism is relevant for the cardiovascular protection by GLP-1 analogs, several pathways are involved of which the anti-inflammatory action of GLP-1 analogs might play a predominant role [32] . In animal studies it was shown that native GLP-1 and its analogs reduce vascular monocyte adhesion and/or macrophage infiltration within blood vessels [33] [34] [35] . Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 and the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP) have been shown to be downregulated by GLP-1 analogs and inhibitors of the DPP-4 (sitagliptin) [4, [36] [37] [38] . It can be speculated that GLP-1 analogs like liraglutide not only suppresses cytokine release in bacterial septic shock, but also in viral sepsis such as caused by SARS-CoV-2.",

We demonstrated that DPP-4 inhibitors (linagliptin) and GLP-1 analogs (liraglutide) improved survival in sepsis. Both, DPP-4 inhibition and the GLP-1 analog improved hypotension and endothelial dysfunction in endotoxemic rats. Systemic inflammation was suppressed and vascular oxidative stress was reduced in septic animals treated with liraglutide. Additionally, we observed a positive effect on hemostatic parameters distorted by LPS-induced sepsis (tail bleeding time and activated partial thromboplastin time) [11] . In a subsequent study we used a similar animal model and further investigated effects of GLP-1 analogs on LPS-induced disseminated intravasal coagulation (DIC) and microvascular thrombosis. Thrombocytopenia, microvascular thrombosis in the pulmonary circulation, endothelial dysfunction and increased markers of inflammation in the aorta and whole blood were improved by the GLP-1 analog in LPS-induced sepsis. By using GLP-1R knockout animals we were able to confirm that the beneficial effects of liraglutide on mortality and DIC are mediated via the GLP-1 receptor [12] .",

            "text": "The present study is an important addition to the mentioned previously published findings on beneficial effects of GLP-1 analogs in LPS-induced sepsis. Herewith, we used a clinically more relevant sepsis model compared to LPS-induced sepsis, because the latter model has its limitations [15] . In terms of pathophysiology, CLP is comparable to a peritoneal sepsis in which perforation of the intestine leads to the leak of feces into the peritoneum, which results in a fulminant immune response. As we have already demonstrated that the GLP-1 analog liraglutide ameliorates the exaggerated inflammatory reaction in LPS-induced sepsis, we hypothesized that liraglutide has similar effects in CLP-induced sepsis. However, it has to be acknowledged that CLP leads to the effusion of bacteria in the peritoneum with subsequent bacteremia. We thus speculated that suppression of the inflammatory response by liraglutide leads to an adverse effect compared to the findings in LPS-induced sepsis. The present study underlines the potent immunomodulatory action of GLP-1R activation by liraglutide leading to ameliorated vascular dysfunction and reduced oxidative stress/inflammation. Zaky et al. reported that DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin in cholestatic sepsis resulted in increased GLP-1 levels, which reduced fever and ileal NF-\u03baB, TNF\u03b1 and myeloperoxidase [39] . Similar effects on NF-\u03baB signaling in cardiomyocytes have also been reported for cell culture experiments with LPS stimulation [10] . In angiotensin II-induced arterial hypertension, our own studies revealed that the GLP-1 analog liraglutide has the ability to ameliorate blood pressure and improve endothelial dysfunction by reduction of the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils [40] . This resulted in less oxidative stress and was also associated with a modulation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. We were also able to clarify that this effect is not mediated by a direct effect of GLP-1 on inflammatory cells but on endothelial cells, as the protective effects of liraglutide were lost in endothelial cell specific (Glp1r flfl \u00d7 Cdh5 cre ) but not in myeloid cell (Glp1r flfl \u00d7 LysM cre ) GLP-1R knockout mice [40] . The body temperature lowering effect of liraglutide in CLPinduced sepsis observed in the present study might also be explained by the modulation of NF-\u03baB signaling. Besides the modulation of systemic inflammatory pathways, liraglutide ameliorated vascular inflammation (Il6, iNos, Tnf\u03b1, Icam1 and Nox2) and oxidative stress resulting in improved vascular function (endothelium-dependent relaxation) without impacting the response to vasoconstrictors. The latter findings are similar to previous studies investigating the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 analogs on improved survival in LPS-induced sepsis by the reduction of systemic and vascular inflammation [11, 12] . In this study, aortic Nox2 and iNos mRNA expression correlated well with 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) expression, suggesting a dominant role for peroxynitrite (ONNO \u2212 ) as a nitrating species. However, we did not investigate a possible contribution of myeloperoxidase in this regard, which has been shown to use nitrite (NO 2 \u2212 , an autooxidation product of \u2022 NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to form reactive nitrogen species also capable of nitrating tyrosine residues in inflamed tissue [41] [42] [43] . Another limitation is that we did not analyze biological oxidative damage exerted by peroxynitrite other than 3-NT (e.g., lipid peroxidation, sulfoxidation of methionine or cysteine protein residues), which, however, was not a focus of this study.",

In critically ill patients, GLP-1 levels reflect the severity of the disease and mortality and in acute myocardial infarction it has been shown that GLP-1 levels predict the cardiovascular outcome.

            "text": "This study has some limitations. In LPS-induced sepsis, we performed survival studies and demonstrated that pharmacological DPP-4 inhibition or genetic deletion and administration of the GLP-1 analog liraglutide improved mortality [11] . Due to ethical considerations we decided to not perform survival studies in CLP-induced sepsis as this would have required at least another 40-50 CLP mice with and without the liraglutide treatment. However, based on the included mice in this study, we did not detect any difference in survival in CLP-induced sepsis by treatment with liraglutide (3 of a total of 30 mice died in the CLP group and 5 of a total of 27 mice died in the +Lira group). It can be assumed that without an antibiotic cotreatment there is no survival benefit in CLP-induced sepsis (in contrast to LPS-induced sepsis) since the bacteremia is not treated. However, this study was not designed to answer this hypothesis and further research would be needed. Methodologically, L-012 has been discredited for superoxide formation as a byproduct of redox-cycling in the presence of peroxidases [45] . However, in our hands, it seems suitable for the phorbol ester or endotoxin (e.g., PDBu, zymosan A)-stimulated oxidative burst of isolated leukocytes or whole blood, which largely results from NADPH oxidase derived superoxide and subsequent hydrogen peroxide formation as the L-012 ECL signal is absent in the whole blood of gp91phox deficient mice [22, 46] . A general limitation of the study is a reduced sample size in some experiments of only three to four animals, the cytokine measurements on mRNA and not protein level and the study of male mice only to exclude the known effects of sexual hormones on vascular function [47] . Despite these limitations, liraglutide is an approved drug with few known side effects and low treatment costs. For clinical use, a placebo controlled double-blind randomized trial would be needed to test the beneficial effect of GLP-1 analogs in septic patients.",

CLP-induced mid-grade polymicrobial sepsis led to a reduction in body weight and blood sugar in both vehicle and Lira-treated mice.
