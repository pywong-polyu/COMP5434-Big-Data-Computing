Examining how multiple, intersecting forms of privilege and disadvantage compound points to the ways that while everyone has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to contain it, not everyone is impacted in the same way, nor to the same degree (Marmot et al., 2020) . Initial claims that COVID-19 would be a great equalizer have since been disproven, both in terms of health and wealth (Devakumar et al., 2020; Phillips, 2020) . In terms of health, certain groups have higher infection risk due to their work, social circumstances, or living conditions that do not allow them to maintain social distance. For example, many lower-paid, essential workers (eg., food, cleaning, delivery services) were required to keep working in person, resulting in greater risk of exposure for themselves, their families, and others at the work place or using public transport (Bambra et al., 2020 (Bambra et al., , 2021 . Socially disadvantaged and underserved groups are more likely to develop medical conditions that correlate with severe forms of COVID-19 infection (Marmot et al., 2020; Marmot, 2015) . For example, mortality rates in more deprived areas of the UK were two times those of less deprived areas between March and July (Johnson et al., 2021) . Infection risks in Germany followed regional patterns of inequality, with socio-economic differences among risk-groups for severe COVID-19 (Wachtler and Hoebel, 2020) .",

The measures enacted to contain the spread of the disease include restrictions on movement and on a variety of business and non-business activities that have serious socioeconomic repercussions. The \"second pandemic\" disproportionately affects those who were already in precarious social, economic or working conditions, and reduces services for those who were already poor (smaller businesses, unofficial forms of work, precarious contracts or economic conditions, poor housing, underserved areas). It has \"exposed, fed off and increased existing inequalities of wealth, gender and race\" by making the rich richer and the poor poorer (Oxfam, 2021) . Country-specific as well as global data are clear in this respect, raising significant concerns that the world has emerged even more unequal through the COVID-19 pandemic (Marmot et al., 2020; Oxfam, 2021; Human Rights Council, 2020) .",

For instance, while northern Italy made headlines in March 2020 for being particularly devastated, a year later, secondary effects reached the entire country with a 105% increase of the \"new poor\" (people seeking aid for the first time) between March and May 2020 (Italiana, 2020) . At least one family member in 2.1 million Italian households is working irregularly; these households are expected to become actually poor due to the pandemic (Focus Censis Confcooperat, 2020) . In Ireland, the Economic and Social Research Institute calculated that 400,000 families would lose 20% of their disposable income without significant policy changes (Beirne et al., 2020) . The unemployment rate in Ireland rose from 5 to 20% during 2020, with a 20% consumption drop in the first lockdown period (McQuinn et al., 2020) . In Austria, those who were already at greater risk of poverty or exclusion were more affected by the socioeconomic consequences than the average, demonstrating increasingly visible divides between the poor and middle class, unemployed and employed, the old and the young (Austrian Federal Ministry, 2020). Those working part-time jobs to supplement unemployment payments or pensions were particularly affected (Austrian Federal Ministry, 2020) . Similarly, people working in lower income brackets in Germany lost the most income in relative terms, and were affected by losses almost twice as often as those with high incomes (Kohlrausch et al., 2020) .",

Numerous out-of-home support services provided by the state or civil society ended during lockdowns, with consequences for the neediest youth (Stiftung, 2020) .

The interviews followed an interview guide developed by the SolPan consortium. Interviews ranged from 30 to 80 min, and were conducted in the official language of the country, with the exception of one English interview in Germany. Consent was obtained orally. Interviews were recorded on a digital recorder or using a GDPRcompliant video chat recorder. Only audio material was stored. The interviews were transcribed and pseudonymized. The study was approved by the following ethics committees: Technical University of Munich (208/20 S; also covered Switzerland), University College Dublin (HS-E\u2212 20-70-Galasso), the University of Vienna (00544; also covered (continued on next page) UK and Italy). T1 data consisted of: 46 interviews in Germany, 80 in Austria, 35 in the UK, 33 in Italy, 32 in Ireland, and 31 in Switzerland. Of these, 43 participants in Germany, 72 in Austria, 30 in the UK, 29 in Italy, 25 in Ireland, and 26 in Switzerland were interviewed again in T2. 482 interviews were analyzed for this paper. The interviews were coded using an inductively-generated coding scheme following a Grounded Theory approach. Coding was checked by a second researcher for consistency. Relevant text passages relating to structural inequality across forms of economic, domestic, generational, educational, and technological inequalities were extracted and analyzed inductively via the Atlas.ti query function. Data analysis was initially conducted by authors working on the 6 country teams; authors wrote memos summarizing the main findings. Thus, while not engaging in a traditional comparison between national contexts where indicators are predetermined, we were sensitive to differences where they became apparent. At the same time, we sought to explore similarities in people's experiences across countries. The impacts of health and wealth on people's ability to cope with the situation, and the entanglements of the two domains, clearly emerged as the most dominant themes. Results were then analyzed again for sub-themes within these two categories. Although we discussed participant responses in relation to the five sub-themes that emerged, coding was conducted with attention to overlapping inequalities, and our organization of the data in the sub-themes does not aim to draw strict conceptual divisions between different concerns. Abbreviated interview codes are included to indicate the country of residence of the participant and the time period of the interview. All quotes have been translated into English; original language quotations are provided in Table 2 .",

Respondents' statements suggest that many people have an intuitive understanding of the alignment of health and economic wellbeing, which was heightened by the circumstances of the pandemic. In a situation in which many governments and media were playing out the protection of \"our economies\" against public health, respondents articulated through their own experiences that protecting health and \"the economy\" are two sides of the same coin. If some restrictions, aimed to limit the spread of the virus and prevent hospital overload result in significant economic struggles, this is likely to expand the spread of the pandemic and to burden the healthcare system with further health and mental health issues. On the other hand, if keeping some business activities \"open\" has the effect of expanding and prolonging the pandemic, this is also to the detriment of the economy as well as peoples' health.

Yet, government support in mitigating the effects of the pandemic was nonetheless fraught. For example, the critique of governmental decisions in setting precedents for the impact of the COVID-19 crisis was most pronounced in the UK case, with several individuals offering keen analyses of how the recent history of austerity had predisposed particular segments of the population to be worse-off when the pandemic hit (Marmot et al., 2020) .

Difficult health situations, such as those who were already at high risk due to preexisting or chronic health problems, had been made more challenging due to cancelled treatment, or the inability to access social support networks. Yet in general, there was not as pronounced a difference between the two time periods as we might have expected. Those who had been less affected early in the pandemic were also doing relatively well by the time of the second interview. For example, like the participant who described their own situation of a \"luxury quarantine,\" some were still benefiting from their accumulated resourcesof space, time, remote work, savings in the banklater in the pandemic as well. Similarly, those who had fewer resources when the pandemic began were having an even harder time six months later. Such findings are supported by reports illustrating the large percentage of people who have no savings to buoy them through moments of crisis (Blundell et al., 2020; Fessler and Sch\u00fcrz, 2017) . We suggest that one of the reasons that there was no dramatic difference between the two periods has to do with the fact that most of the inequalities addressed in the interviews are rooted in deeper economic and social structures; that is, the stratification of relative advantage and disadvantage seen in participant experiences largely preexisted the pandemic.",

Yet, some participants also expressed skepticism of the widespread discussion of how the pandemic may have prompted an increase in solidaristic social action, noting with disdain that community efforts were not accompanied by political change. Some asked where the outpouring of support was for those who had been dealing with food or housing insecurity for years (Blundell et al., 2020) . Indeed, while the pandemic has strengthened some forms of solidarity (e.g. public healthcare (Prainsack, 2020) ), it has also made societal dividing lines more visible (Lindstr\u00f6m, 2020) across generations, genders, economic levels, and engendered racialized narratives of blame.",

Our participants perceived those who were already underserved, discriminated against, or in precarious economic and working conditions, to be disproportionately impacted by the pandemic both in terms of health and wealth, with these two domains being deeply entwined in their effects. The often cited dichotomy between strategies that oppose the health of the population to economic needs, does not correspond to any 'real life' division in our data. Instead, people saw economic struggles also causing major health issues, and vice versa.",

These mechanisms and instruments of support, although essential for preventing even worse scenarios, can only patch up some of the most pressing and evident needs. Our data show that the things people struggled with the most were due to more deep-rooted structures that impacted the range of possibilities and resources available to some during the pandemicwhat we advance as the \"second pandemic.\" In other words, while ad-hoc measures to mitigate the risks and effects of the crisis partially alleviated economic problems for people, structural factors such as housing, working conditions, good access to digital tools and information infrastructure, social networks, and health conditions in general seem to have had a bigger impact on people's ability to cope. If, as articulated by one of our participants, \"the biggest protector against coronavirus is wealth,\" then a different, and more equal, distribution of wealth and resources could better mitigate the detrimental effects of the pandemic, both in terms of population health and economics. As the disproportional effects of the pandemic made structural inequalities more visible, we argue that this can and should be taken as an opportunity to rethink our societies and to reform them in more equal ways (Peter et al., 2006) . More equal and just societies will be less exposed and more prepared to handle public health challenges going forward (Daniels, 2007) . ",
