Methods One hundred thirty-six patients undergoing laparoscopic colon resection randomly received either TEA or TAP with ropivacaine only. The primary endpoint was opioid requirement up to 48 h postoperatively. Intensity of pain, time to onset of bowel function, time to mobilization, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and patients' satisfaction with pain management were also assessed. Results We observed a significant decrease in opioid consumption on the day of surgery with TEA compared with TAP block (30 mg vs 14 mg, p < 0.001). On the first two postoperative days (POD), the balance shifted to opioid consumption being smaller in the TAP group: on POD 1 (15.2 mg vs 10.6 mg; p = 0.086) and on POD 2 (9.2 mg vs 4.6 mg; p = 0.021). There were no differences in postoperative nausea/vomiting or time to first postoperative bowel movement between the groups. No direct blockade-related complications were observed and the length of stay was similar between TEA and TAP groups. Conclusion TEA is more efficient for acute postoperative pain than TAP block on day of surgery, but not on the first two PODs. No differences in pain management-related complications were detected.",

            "text": "Both pain relief techniques, TEA and TAP block, have been shown to reduce surgical stress in postoperative pain management [28, 29] . This puts consideration of the method of postoperative analgesia into perspective since the emphasis is strongly on its safety. Utilizing the ERAS protocol has made postoperative recovery so prompt and effective that the benefits of TEA are likely to remain marginal. According to our results, the opioid-sparing effect of epidural analgesia is limited to the day of laparoscopic colon surgery. On the first POD, TAP block is not inferior to TEA and on the second POD, TAP was opioid-sparing in comparison to TEA, in this study. The question of whether any blockade is necessary after elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery was answered by Zhao et al., who compared postoperative TAP block with saline [30] . They reported decreased need for rescue opioids, faster bowel function onset, faster mobilization, and shorter LOS, with TAP block. With this background, our results support TAP block as a routine pain regimen in elective laparoscopic colon surgery and support the statement of the most recent ERAS guidelines in colorectal surgery restricting the use of TEA to specific well-reasoned situations.",

We report a significant reduction in opioid consumption and faster onset of bowel function on the day of surgery with TEA compared to TAP block. However, on POD 1, TAP block was not inferior to TEA in both opioid demand and bowel function. On POD 2, the opioid demand was significantly reduced with TAP block compared with TEA. Overall patient satisfaction with pain management was similar between groups and no blockade-related complications were detected.",
