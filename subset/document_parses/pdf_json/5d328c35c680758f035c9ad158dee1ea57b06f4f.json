The first schools of public health soon followed, but growth was slow, with only 12 schools by 1960. With organization and growing numbers, accreditation became an expectation. As the mission of public health has grown and achieved new urgency, schools have grown in number, depth and breadth. By mid-2011, there were 46 accredited schools of public health, with more in the pipeline. While each has a unique character, they also must possess certain core characteristics to be accredited. Over time, as schools developed, and concepts of public health expanded, so too did curricula and missions as well as types of people who were trained. In this review, we provide a brief summary of US public health education, with primary emphasis on professional public health schools. We also examine public health workforce needs and evaluate how education is evolving in the context of a growing maturity of the public health profession. We have not focused on programs (not schools) that offer public health degrees or on preventive medicine programs in schools of medicine, since schools of public health confer the majority of master's and doctoral degrees.

Concomitant with the growth in independent public health schools were important changes in the numbers and composition of formally trained public health professionals. During the 1960's teaching methods changed, with greater attention to problem-based learning, especially in medical schools. 9 Support for public health professional education has been inconsistent over the decades, with a marked erosion of federal funding, beginning in the 1980's. This trend only reversed in the last few years but is again at risk in the wake of a serious recession. State government support also has been variable but significant; 34 of the current 46 schools are public institutions, with different levels of state assistance. Most schools with state funding have seen that support eroded over the last few years, some very significantly.

Schools also translate research into evidence-based policies and practices in communities, clinical care settings and governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private organizations. Research in SPH ranges from basic laboratory research (e.g., to explain molecular signatures for particular viruses, cancers and other diseases) to applied research in communities as well as policy research. In fact, it is this continuum from basic research to translation of research into practice and policies that makes SPH especially relevant and skilled in solving problems. Public health researchers often collaborate with faculty in schools of medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, nursing, and others. They conduct bench and clinical research as well as communication research, comparative effectiveness studies, clinical effectiveness research and translational research, frequently with community-based research components. These varied roles reflect, in part, the fact that public health is not just a profession, 10 but also a professional culture and commitment. 12 SPH educate undergraduate, master's, doctoral, postdoctoral, and certificate students. Schools also provide continuing education to public health professionals within and beyond their geographic reach. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds training centers within SPH charged with developing leadership skills among certain groups of health professionals (e.g., those from underserved groups). Similarly, the CDC has funded preparedness centers that focus on training particular kinds of professionals within assigned geographic regions. 13, 14 This training and related concepts enabled schools to provide direct responses to training needs of first responders and health department personnel, in response to the events following September 11, 2001 and outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza A (H1N1). Since September 11, 2001 , public health students and many practitioners are trained to understand concepts and language of biosurveillance, health risk communication, and the critical roles government agencies and nongovernment partners play in responding to public health emergencies. 14 The landmark 1988 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, The Future of Public Health, criticized SPH for being overly research intensive and disconnected from practice. 4 In response, many schools made administrative and policy changes that institutionalized the means by which practice communities can access academic public health expertise and also increased opportunities for academicians to connect with communities. Despite some successes in addressing acknowledged deficiencies in practice, there still are many challenges to create permeable boundaries between academic public health and practice. For example, the need to demonstrate publication productivity may cause many younger faculty members to choose professional focus areas that have quicker timelines to publication than those required to build relationships and consensus with practice communities. Some schools have modified their appointments and promotion guidelines to reflect the importance of practice, but this varies from school to school.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1261, "end": 1263, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1314, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1880, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1881, "end": 1883, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2088, "text": "September 11, 2001", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2182, "end": 2200, "text": "September 11, 2001", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2463, "end": 2465, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2632, "end": 2633, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ROLES OF SPH"}, {"text": "Within SPH, students pursue their education with an extraordinarily interdisciplinary range of faculty, including biomedical scientists, medical care professionals, behavioral and social scientists (e.g., economics, sociology, politics), epidemiologists, biostatisticians, information scientists, lawyers, health service researchers and health educators, among others.

To achieve this mission, CEPH reviews SPH resources, structure and programs through its established criteria, which are updated periodically. Accredited SPH must offer coursework in at least the five core areas of knowledge basic to public health: biostatistics; epidemiology; environmental health sciences; health services administration; and social and behavioral sciences. 15 The core, broad knowledge areas form the basis of how schools structure curricula. However, schools are not limited to these disciplinary areas. Some schools have added departments of genetics, maternal and child health, nutrition and other areas. Nothing precludes expansion of the five core areas, but all students must get sufficient exposure to core public health disciplines (Table 1) . 15 Over the last several years, ASPH has developed competencies in a number of areas, such as undergraduate education and master of public health programs, and identified cross-cutting areas, such as cultural competence, public health biology and health informatics which augment the disciplinary focus of the core areas. Review of competencies shows the richness of subject matter area included under disciplinary areas, such as epidemiology.

As well, the availability and capacity of a global public health workforce needs to be significantly expanded.\" 21 Although for some time, there has been widespread recognition that the US has a shortage of well-trained public health professionals, no quantitative estimates of projected needs had been taken prior to 2007. 31 At that time, a taskforce of the ASPH set about quantifying public health workforce needs projected for 2020. 6, 30, 31 We summarize below the findings and implications of the workforce report and related subsequent efforts. 21 As shown in Table 3 , \"in 2000, there were 50,000 fewer public health employees than in 1980. 32, 33 The workforce ratio in 1980-220 public health workers for every 100,000 US residents-although a likely underestimate of need, was used as a benchmark. 21 Given population increases, a total of 600,000 (vs. the 450,000 available) would have been necessary in 2000 to maintain the workforce ratio that existed two decades earlier. In 2020, a public health workforce of more than 700,000 would be needed to achieve the 220:100,000 ratio. That creates a need for some 250,000 more workers than are available today.\" 21 Table 3 Public Health Workforce to US Population Ratios Even that number is undoubtedly conservative, since public health departments across the US absorbed substantial personnel cuts during the recession of 2008-2010. Extrapolation of these data to projected shortages by state is demonstrated in Figure 3 . These estimates also do not take into account the large potential retirement effects of an aging worker cohort. Although some retirements may be postponed due to the economic recession, by 2012, more than 110,000 US public health workers in government-24 percent of an estimated 450,000-person workforce-will be eligible to retire. In addition, the estimates are supply-based and do not attempt to quantify need or demand or the serious issue of geographic distribution and discipline-specific projects (e.g., laboratory workers vs. epidemiologists). Several other organizations (e.g., APHA 35 , Trust for America's Health, 36 Association of Academic Health Centers (AAHC) 37 ) and efforts have addressed specific disciplines. For example, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) has reported a shortage of 10,000 public health physicians, recommending a doubling of public health physicians currently in practice. 38 Moreover, there are demonstrated racial and ethnic disparities and significant geographic gaps in the public health workforce as the Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce concluded. 39 \"Today's physicians, nurses, and dentists have too little resemblance to the diverse populations they serve, leaving many Americans feeling excluded by a system that seems distant and uncaring. The fact that the nation's health professions have not kept pace with changing demographics may be an even greater cause of disparities in health access and outcomes than the persistent lack of health insurance for tens of millions of Americans.\" Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce. 39 Public health workforce shortages are even more critical in much of the developing world. For example, sub-Saharan Africa has 11 percent of the world's population and 24 percent of the global burden of disease-yet it commands less than one percent of the world's health expenditures. 40 The World Health Organization has said there is a \"major mismatch\" between population needs and the available public health workforce in terms of overall numbers, relevant training, practical competencies and sufficient diversity to serve all individuals and communities. 39, 41 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 448, "end": 450, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 660, "end": 662, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 773, "end": 775, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 776, "end": 779, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 780, "end": 782, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 888, "end": 890, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 985, "end": 988, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 989, "end": 991, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1145, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2409, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2440, "end": 2442, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2489, "end": 2491, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2743, "end": 2745, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2951, "end": 2953, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3457, "end": 3459, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3744, "end": 3746, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4019, "end": 4022, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4023, "end": 4025, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 903, "end": 910, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1507, "end": 1514, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1805, "end": 1813, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "ASSESSING PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS"}, {"text": "Events and population health changes of the last few decades, have shown that countries do not exist in isolation and are increasingly interdependent. 9, 42, 43 Health professionals move from one country to another in a permeable manner.
