Our intervention proposed the deployment of technology-enabled, female frontline health workers known as the Guddi baji (meaning The Good Sister) in a rural village.

This pilot program has significantly influenced patient adherence and health awareness within the rural communities. It has bridged the gaps between the patient and community health workers in a primary care setting by leveraging technology. The findings indicate that the re-integration of pharmacists into the health care delivery pathway in order to overcome primary health care issues in a rural community, is promising. This model has demonstrated the expansion of the role of the pharmacist by engaging them in a seamless virtually integrated e-health system. This in turn has generated patient health awareness and improved drug adherence by addressing the communication gaps within the primary care setting. This intervention has contributed to the prevention of medication errors as the model enables the rural community to access quality healthcare services as well as have access to a trained health care professional in real time, ensuring safe medication practices. Similar to this rural tele-pharmacy intervention, doctHERs aims to continue working towards the implementation of innovative, sustainable, evidence-based healthcare solutions.",
