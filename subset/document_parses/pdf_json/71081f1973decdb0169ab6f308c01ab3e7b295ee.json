Anger is influenced by extroversion, psychoticism and neuroticism, respectively. That is, a high level of extroversion means that the person's experience of Anger is reduced. The same is true for the other two personality traits. It has also been shown that for Joy, the personality traits that have a negative influence are psychoticism and neuroticism. That is, people with a high level of both psychoticism and neuroticism show less Joy. However, the personality trait of extroversion negatively influences Disgust while neuroticism negatively influences Sadness.",

In relation to this point, it was found that when the subjects declare having felt an intense emotion (whether or not this coincides with the micro-expressions), brand recall is very high; thus, in the case of brands unknown in the environment of the interviewees, the advertisements remembered by the subjects as more emotional obtain much higher levels of recall than those obtained with advertisements which, according to the recall data of the subjects, transmit very low levels of emotion.",
