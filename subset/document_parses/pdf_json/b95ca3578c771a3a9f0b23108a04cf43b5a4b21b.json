The search for defining features of mental disorders in non-Euro American settings is historically charged for the field. Yet, as illustrated by analysis of the NIMH objectives, the biological study of mental disorders cannot be scientifically sound without better inclusion of under-represented, globally diverse populations. It is time for global mental health researchers to take up the challenge and advance impactful research across the full translational spectrum.",

            "text": "Tension between universal and local sources of mental disorders may have discouraged neuroscientific investigations in GMH research. The history of GMH research includes long debates to accurately and ethically negotiate between universal and biological understandings of mental disorders versus those that are indexed to local culture (Ommeren et al., 2005; Summerfield, 1982) . The field of medical anthropology was an important contributor to these debates. Dr. Arthur Kleinman, a psychiatrist and medical anthropologist, used the concept of the \"category fallacy\" and argued that the cultural context of emotional experience is central to the definition of mental conditions as normal or pathological (Kleinman, 1977) . The World Health Organization (WHO) led a number of early studies exploring mental disorders and outcomes across multiple countries. One of these was the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia, which followed the course of 1202 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia in nine countries and reported heterogeneous outcomes between countries of low and high economic development (Sartorius et al., 1972) . The WHO was also an early investigator of strategies to diagnose mental disorders in different cultural settings (Sartorius et al., 1980) . Today, the effort to optimally define mental pathology continues, now with a focus on creating integrated understandings that embrace both biological and environmental variables. Research organizations, including the NIMH and the European Roadmap for Mental Health Research, created initiatives to explore pathways that cut across current diagnostic categories, such as the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) (Marquand et al., 2016) . Deploying a powerful set of new technologies, researchers strive to disaggregate and reorganize biological and environmental factors into categories that more consistently define mental health and dysfunction. However, most of these studies focus on populations in high-income countries and have not included the global diversity of mental disorder manifestations (Hyman, 2019) . Endeavors to define the underpinnings of mental disorders are unlikely to succeed unless we can find a way to ethically investigate them across a broad range of human genetic and environmental influences. Traditional divisions between GMH and neuroscientific research obstruct our advancement toward better understanding and treatment of mental disorders. Below, the NIMH strategic priorities are explored as an example of how cooperation between GMH and neuroscience research could accelerate science toward its goals.",

Galea asserts that epidemiology should expand its focus on causal architecture to include the \"exposure-based epidemiologies\"-the macrosocial, economic, and political determinants of health and disease (Galea, 2019; Galea & Keyes, 2019) . Galea argues that the mechanisms of mental health and dysfunction will never be coherent or effective for the improvement of population health unless we grapple concurrently with both the biological and the macrosocial determinants of disease. Because we cannot study the effect of macrosocial determinants of disease without a diversity of those exposures, it follows that we cannot effectively study gene-environment interplay without inclusion of populations living with a global diversity of social, economic, and political conditions. NIMH Strategic Objective 2, \"Chart Mental Illness Trajectories To Determine When, Where, and How to Intervene,\" includes observational research to identify developmental trajectories of the brain and behavior across the lifespan, as well as clinically useful biomarkers to predict illness change. Observational research is sensitive to misclassification and selection bias. Misclassification refers to an information bias (such as culturally irrelevant mental disorder definitions) resulting in misdiagnosis-studying mental disorders across a wide range of cultures improves the chances of identifying those universal, biological factors that contribute to mental illness across all populations. Selection bias refers to failure to select a representative sample (e.g., failing to include a global diversity of study populations), limiting the identification of biological drivers of mental disorders and the generalizability of study results. Without a wide diversity of biological, social, and other environmental factors, as well as diverse life courses in the study population, we risk selection bias and compromised external validity, restricting the advance of mental health research and related population health gains in the USA.",
