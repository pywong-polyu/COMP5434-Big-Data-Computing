Specifically, different studies have addressed the characteristics of adequate family interactions, as well as those characteristics with the potential to jeopardize children's development [1] [2] [3] [4] . Research findings in the field of parent-child relationships and interactions are very relevant, since the family has been acknowledged as one of the first socialization environments for each individual [5] [6] [7] . Parent-child interactions are, thus, determinants not only for the development of children, but also for the wellbeing of families. These interactions are modeled by the social, emotional, and cognitive skills of both a parent and a child, in which they respond and adapt to each other's style [4, 8] .",

Each dyad would sit at a desk in the room without other stimuli (e.g., toys), with the parent and child sitting next to each other and facing the camera. The researcher would place the puzzle pieces face up on the desk and provide an A5 picture of the complete puzzle. Then, the researcher would ask the parent to get the child to complete the puzzle, set up the camera to record the activity, and leave the room. The activity was programmed to be completed in 15 min. After this period, the researcher would see if the dyad was still performing the activity. If needed, further time was provided to the dyad to complete the activity. However, when the dyad took more than 15 min to complete the activity, only the first 15 min of the video were considered for coding purposes.

The FOS is a micro-analytic coding system, found to be reliable and sensitive [40] , in which the presence or absence of behaviors of both the child and the parent under observation is scored in 10 s intervals. In the current study, the observation interval was adapted to a 30 s period. Further adaptations to the system excluded two discrete behaviors regarding parents (contact and aversive contact) that were not identified during the evaluations of the videos. Moreover, their definition was very similar to two more comprehensive behaviors that were maintained (social attention and aversive social attention). In addition, following a deductive approach, three additional discrete behaviors were included regarding parents' behaviors (performs side-by-side with the child, and performs preventing the child from performing), and child behaviors (noncompliance). All three additional discrete behaviors were observed in the pilot study. The discrete behaviors used in the micro-analytic coding procedure are described in Table 1 . Whenever the parents took less than 15 min to complete the structured task, to prevent possible scoring bias related to the intervals considered in the observation, a prorating approach was considered to estimate the number of behaviors per 15 min of interaction (30 intervals).

Model fit was evaluated considering the Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the approximate weight of evidence (AWE), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the classification likelihood criterion (CLC) and the Kullback information criterion (KIC), in which lower values indicate a better fit, and entropy, in which values above 0.64 are deemed to be acceptable [43] .

For the current study, no power analysis is presented regarding the LPAs. As acknowledged by Spurk and colleagues [44] , power analysis regarding latent profile analysis cannot be presented in every study because of their complexity. LPAs' power analyses are made through simulation studies that require knowledge of population parameter values driven from prior work or theory, which are often unavailable [43] .",

Class 1 included 35 participants who displayed a lower quality interaction with their child, characterized by less involvement, positive affectivity, responsiveness, and stimulus quality.

Among the total behaviors identified by the micro-analytic coding procedure, 18 behaviors revealed at least a moderate agreement, as indicated by the ICC values. Discrete behaviors such as aggression and opposing behavior, which revealed poor inter-rater agreements, were hardly ever identified in the current study. The literature suggests that in observed structured activities, especially in the context of play such as assembling a jigsaw puzzle, some behaviors such as aggression and opposing behavior tend to be displayed less often [48] . In the current study, children's aggression and opposing behaviors occurred less often, which may have hindered the estimation of the inter-rater agreement, contributing to the poor agreement outcomes found. In addition, the agreement given by the \u03ba coefficient revealed an almost perfect agreement for the dimension involvement, while for the other dimensions, it revealed a moderate agreement.

The result regarding the lower quality subgroup is in line with prior findings suggesting that, in at-risk families who experienced adverse environmental conditions, the parent-child interactions usually showed lower levels of positive interactions, responsiveness, sensitivity, and involvement [14, 41] . Importantly, it should be highlighted that the current study's results enabled the identification of a subgroup with higher quality interactions, even if it was in a smaller number of families. However, it should be noted that the global rating dimension of directivity was not considered in the characterization of parents into classes. The literature regarding parent-child interactions suggests that effective interactions are characterized by high responsiveness and moderate to low directivity [49] . Still, the parents in the current study presented a somewhat constant level of directivity, which precluded the dimension of contributing to the subgroups' identifications.",

None of the children's behaviors were different between subgroups, which is a somewhat different finding from that of other studies, in which negative parental behavior may lead to more externalizing problems in children [8, 50] . Although child misbehaviors are a common topic of study in the area of child maltreatment, often these behaviors are more related to a parent's perceptions and, indeed, do not represent their child's behaviors displayed in the interaction [51] . Nevertheless, the lack of differences in the children's behaviors between the subgroups can also be a consequence of the type of activity and method chosen, in which the nature of the observational structured activity does not allow for the variability of the child's behavior over the interaction [48, 52] .",

It is possible that the parents' self-report measures and the observational procedure address distinctive phenomena. The parenting outcome measures address global parenting constructs that are evaluated through questionnaires and regard parents' behaviors and perceptions related to different situations of parents' and children's everyday lives, whereas the structured activity, herein evaluated, pertains to a specific situation in a given setting. Moreover, the observation procedure captures a parent's behavior at a single time point (e.g., a 15 min interval), whereas the self-report measures require parents to reflect on their own behaviors over a longer period (e.g., over the last week, or the last month) and over several situations [55, 56] .

Data collection took place since October 2019 and was negatively affected by the lockdown measures imposed by the Portuguese Government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, which precluded families' face-to-face evaluations for several months, thus, limiting the ability of the research team to increase the sample size. Additionally, the observations of parent-child interactions were carried out in a single period, which may have contributed to a loss of external validity of the results from the observation measures. The small sample size is also acknowledged as a possible limitation to the LPA performed. As previously reported, no power analysis for LPA was estimated, as this procedure is identified in the literature as being complex and requiring knowledge of population parameter values which may not be available [44] . However, a relevant issue to address when performing an LPA is the parsimony and meaningfulness of the profiles. The subgroups, herein described, are meaningful and both subgroups regard more than 1% of the current sample (lower quality subgroup 74.50%, and higher quality subgroup 25.50%), even though the higher quality subgroup includes fewer than 25 participants [44] .
