This is an important consideration for a nutrition intervention, where short-term provision in the early phase of illness may not plausibly affect outcomes. The timing of nutrition delivery may be important for its impact. There is evidence that early delivery of some enteral nutrition (EN) is likely to have a number of benefits including on subsequent gut function, stress ulcer disease and possibly bacterial translocation. 8 Early delivery of EN to meet estimated energy requirements can result in gut dysfunction and glucose intolerance. 6 Later in intensive care unit (ICU) stay and throughout the subsequent hospital admission may be a time when the amount of energy and protein is important for recovery, with metabolism changing to allow exogenous nutrition to be processed. Although it is plausible that nutrition may be important, the limited data available indicate that both energy and protein intake during this period is worse than in the early ICU period for factors relating to patients, clinicians and system issues. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] A cumulative energy deficit because of inadequate energy delivery after ICU discharge, coupled with the deficits observed during the ICU period, may be an explanation for the lack of benefit observed in critical care nutrition trials to date.",

To increase the robustness of the sampling distribution, we will use non-parametric bootstrapping with unrestricted random sampling to produce cost and effectiveness replications, and confidence intervals for the costeffectiveness ratios. These will be represented graphically on a cost-effectiveness plane. In addition, each QALY will be valued at a willingness to pay threshold for a QALY gain of $50 000, in conjunction with the costs of each treatment strategy to report the incremental net benefits of intensive nutrition care compared with usual nutrition care. We will also present the data on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve to enable determination of costeffectiveness at various willingness to pay thresholds.

However, this trial will hopefully inform a programme of research that will evolve and assess both patient and clinician acceptability of the intervention, and patient opinion of nutrition and aspects of nutrition care following critical illness. Inclusion of patients and carers is critical in generation of evidence in this area. Patients will be unable to provide informed consent prior to randomisation/enrolment. Accordingly, the patient's medical treatment decision maker (relative/ friend) or legal surrogate will be approached to provide consent for the patient to participate prior to enrolment in the study. In New Zealand, the respective ethics committee has approved the use of a deferred consent \u25ba Non-interventional PN being provided when interventional PN should have been provided \u25ba Interventional PN not commenced within 2 hours of randomisation \u25ba Incorrect rate of interventional PN provided \u25ba Interventional PN not provided during a fasting period \u25ba Study oral nutrition supplements not prescribed when oral diet commenced \u25ba Study energy requirement not targeted (EN delivered higher than 25 kcal/kg CBW) \u25ba Failure to complete the daily nutrition review in ICU \u25ba <3 days of data collected per week on the ward Open access model. Family/Whanau are approached as soon as possible to inform them about study enrolment and to seek their views on whether or not the patient would be agreeable to being included in the research study. In both countries, the patient will be approached to give consent for continued participation in the trial if they recover the ability to do so and the timing is appropriate. The master information and consent forms are available in online supplemental appendix 7. Results will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed journal(s), scientific meetings and via social media.",
