We present a consecutive retrospective COVID-19 cohort with findings of frequent pulmonary thromboembolism (17%), high pulmonary artery pressure (60%) and lung MRI perfusion disturbances. We demonstrate, in swine, that infusing angiotensin II or blocking ACE2 induces increased pulmonary artery pressure, reduces blood oxygenation, increases coagulation, disturbs lung perfusion, induces diffuse alveolar damage, and acute tubular necrosis compared to control animals. We further demonstrate that this imbalanced state can be ameliorated by infusion of an angiotensin receptor blocker and low-molecular-weight heparin. In this work, we show that a pathophysiological state in swine induced by RAAS imbalance shares several features with the clinical COVID-19 presentation. Therefore, we propose that severe COVID-19 could partially be driven by a RAAS imbalance.",

However, although patients with severe COVID-19 can meet the ARDS Berlin definition 14 , several reports from our intensive care units (ICU), as well as described by others, have noted relatively wellpreserved lung mechanics that is not associated with a typical ARDS-pattern 6, 15 . Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines have been found to be lower than the levels expected during cytokine-release syndrome 16, 17 . Meanwhile, a preliminary report from Wuhan and a more extensive retrospective cohort described that ANGII levels in COVID-19 were markedly elevated and closely associated with lung injury, while renin levels remained similar to controls 18, 19 . This suggests that plasma ANGII elevation may be related to the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology. In two other studies of another cohort, normal ANGII but lower circulating ANG(1-7) levels were associated with a more severe outcome in COVID-19 20, 21 .",

Despite the low viral detection in the systemic circulation, currently published histopathological reports have found end-organ failure in the lung, kidney, heart, and small intestines, amongst others [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . We initiated this translational project to investigate the degree to which a disturbance in the RAAS could possibly contribute to the pathophysiological syndrome of COVID- 19. In this work, we report high frequencies of thromboembolism, signs of high pulmonary artery pressure and in one case lung perfusion disturbances in a consecutive retrospective COVID-19 imaging cohort. We further sought to develop a large animal model that demonstrates the systemic effects of RAAS imbalance, which significantly raise pulmonary artery pressures, place the animal in a hypercoagulation state, significantly reduce blood oxygenation and lead to lung perfusion disturbances that share similarities with COVID-19.",

We show multimodal evidence of raised pulmonary artery pressure supported by invasive pressure monitoring, frequent pulmonary thromboembolism and a disturbance of blood perfusion on functional MRI. In the cohort of patients undergoing CTPA examination, we found no clear evidence of cytokine levels indicative of cytokine release syndrome, despite a potential indication bias that would skew the cohort characteristics towards those patients most ill. To further explore Large animal infusion of supraphysiological levels of angiotensin II. Based on the above-mentioned findings, it seemed probable that at least part of the COVID-19 pathology involved vasculature disturbances in the lung. We therefore designed a number of experiments, with an overview presented in Fig. 3 . Initially, we designed a hypothesis-generating experiment where we infused ANGII in three sedated swine targeting a systolic arterial pressure of 150 mmHg. Within five minutes, arterial and PA blood pressures started to climb ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). All three swine reached systolic PA pressures exceeding 30 mmHg during the experiment, and one swine died of acute right ventricular heart failure with extensive pulmonary thrombosis/ embolism. Meanwhile, PaO 2 tended to decrease paralleled by a trend of increased PaCO 2 ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). We started screening for deep venous thrombosis from swine #2 by ultrasonography to exclude pulmonary embolization, but we could not detect any in this group (Supplementary Table 1 ), suggestive of in situ thrombus formation in the pulmonary circulation, rather than embolisms. We acquired samples for histology from macroscopically wedge-shaped blood discolored areas. After hematoxylin and eosin staining, we observed severe blood stasis, thickening of alveolar septa, debris in the alveolar sacs and diffuse alveolar damage. We performed bleeding time assessments in swine #2 and #3 with baseline bleeding times of 285 s and 255 s, respectively. These were reduced to <120 s after 90 min of ANGII infusion and remained low for the remainder of the experiment. The von Willebrand factor activity (GP1bA) increased directly after the initiation of the infusion. In this hypothesis-generating experiment, D-dimer increased, and paradoxically, fibrinogen also increased or remained unchanged despite increased D-dimer. Interleukin-6 and TNF-\u03b1 remained below the level of detection in all swine during the experiment. Osmolality successively increased in all three swine by > 11 mosmol/kg. We present all clinical chemistry data individually in Supplementary  Table 1 .",

For brevity, we will refer to this group as the model group. We also sedated four additional animals as a control group that received vehicle injections and infusions. We observed a significant increase in systolic pulmonary artery pressure for the model group ( Fig. 4a) . At three hours into the experiment, systolic pulmonary artery pressure in the model group was significantly higher with an estimated difference of 7. To better understand these physiological differences, we performed lung MRI perfusion (Fig. 6) . We used the same definition for MRI perfusion disturbance as in the patient, i.e., a contrast bolus peak later than the aorta or no peak at all. We calculated TTP parametric maps of the model group ( Fig. 6a ), control group (Fig. 6b ) and treatment group (Fig. 6c) . After approximately five to eight hours (mean time to MRI scan 368 min, p = 0.94 for difference between groups, ANOVA), the proportion of the lungs with perfusion disturbance was significantly higher in the model group, 17 \u00b1 1.2% (Fig. 7a, b) , relative to the control group, 10 \u00b1 4.3%. (n = 11, 0.95 CI for difference 1.1-13, p = 0.02, ANOVA with multiple comparisons). The mean normalized overall contrast peak (reflecting the average timing of lung contrast enhancement) was significantly higher in the model group, 0.73 \u00b1 0.058, relative to the control group, 0.54 \u00b1 0.040 (n = 11, 0.95 CI for difference \u22120.29-\u22120.071, p = 0.003, ANOVA with multiple comparisons) (Fig. 7c) . The normalized mean range is between 0 (pulmonary artery peak) and 1 (aorta), and physiologically, we would expect it to be somewhat higher than 0.5 due to arterial inflow from the aorta to the pulmonary circulation. In the dynamic contrast series, we also noted that there was stasis and slow outflow of contrast enhancement in dependent areas. The lung fraction with stasis was more extensive in the model group at 13 \u00b1 3.9% than controls at 6.3 \u00b1 3.9%, albeit not significantly so (n = 11, 0.95 CI for difference \u221219-6.6, p = 0.27, ANOVA). The hourly urine production tended to be lower in the model group (41 \u00b1 25 ml/hour) compared to the control group (210 \u00b1 120 ml/hour), albeit the difference was not significant (n = 11, 0.95 CI for difference \u2212352-11, p = 0.07, ANOVA with multiple comparisons). Four hours into the experiment, the estimated bleeding time was 156 s shorter in the model group as compared to controls, a difference that was statistically significant (n = 11, 0.95 CI for difference: \u2212301-\u221212, p = 0.03, linear mixed errorcomponent model with multiple comparisons, model coefficients in Supplementary Table 2 ). Interestingly, we noted that the surface body temperature was higher in the model group. We could discern no clear pattern in D-dimer or fibrinogen except for one individual who also suffered a groin hematoma during the placement of the arterial introducer (#16) and already had elevated levels at baseline and then coagulation in the test tube.",

ANGII has previously been used in the ATHOS III clinical trial 32 . Sub-analyses of this trial highlighted significant thrombotic and infectious complications associated with ANGII 33 . If SARS-CoV disturbs the expression, distribution or function of the ACE2-receptor to produce a subsequent increase in ANGII 2 , it could be argued that the same mechanism of receptor disruption from SARS-CoV-2 would lead to some of the effects observed in the animals in this work. A hallmark of severe COVID-19 is ventilation pathology. We show that this is likely closely associated with coagulopathy and elevations of pulmonary artery pressure. Axial PA diameter measurements are a relatively sensitive marker for detecting even borderline pulmonary hypertension with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 62% when using the cutoff of \u226528 mm 29 . These results are in accordance with similar studies which have found enlarged segmental pulmonary arteries, lung perfusion and microvascular abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . On lung perfusion MRI, both in a COVID-19 patient and in our swine model without the virus, there was a marked reduction and, in some areas, likely cessation of blood flow even in the absence of infiltrates. Taken together, our findings provide multimodal evidence of pulmonary blood flow disturbances in COVID-19.",

In itself, this finding would warrant caution in using ANGII as a vasopressor for COVID-19 patients, something that is now reported 41 . A limitation of this study is that we did not measure RAAS components in our imaging cohort. This was not possible due to the retrospective nature of that part of the study. There are however other reports; a recent study of 82 individuals with COVID-19 showed higher ANGII than in controls and a linear relationship between high ANGII levels and poor clinical outcome 18 . In contrast, renin levels remained similar, suggesting that more specifically the increase in ANGII is closely related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two other studies from another cohort showed no difference in ANGII but significantly lower ANG(1-7) levels 20, 21 . In light of those studies, our large animal model blocking ACE2, coupled with a low infusion of ANGII, seems like a plausible model of a possible RAAS dysregulation in COVID-19, which could then be used for testing treatment interventions, as also demonstrated in the present study. The effector mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are debated, and it could be argued that a limitation to our large animal studies is that we do not infect the swine with the virus. However, viremia is seldom found in patients, and the panorama of COVID-19 is hard to explain by an exclusive direct viral infection of cells or cytokine release syndrome 22 . We are suggesting that the pathophysiological syndrome of severe COVID-19 may, therefore, in part, be explained as a downstream effect of a disruption of the RAAS. This work does not provide conclusive evidence about how much RAAS disruption might contribute to COVID-19. We only show that by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for cellular access for SARS-CoV-2, we can induce a pathophysiological syndrome that shares several features with COVID-19, including elevated pulmonary artery pressures, reduction in blood oxygenation, disturbances in the lung circulation, shortened bleeding time, diffuse alveolar damage, and acute tubular necrosis.",

The ratings of the radiologist were considered the gold standard and the inter-rater agreement was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (two scans were not available for inter-rater analysis due to rejection of image quality by the second rater but not by the gold standard rater). The inter-rater agreement was excellent (n = 290, ICC = 0.97, P < 0.001). All CTPA imaging was performed on Siemens SOMATOM Definition Flash (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany), GE Discovery CT750 HD and Revolution CT (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, USA) according to clinical routine and scanner allocation was based on the clinical and logistical needs.",

The pulse oximeter was placed on the tail. All animals received a urine catheter and hourly diuresis was recorded. Prior to skin incision, local anesthesia (lidocaine 10 mg/ml without adrenaline, Aspen Nordic, Ballerup, Denmark) <0.4 mg/kg) were given. Bleeding time was assessed by cutting the skin of the ear for 10-15 mm and removing any blood every 15 s. When no further bleeding could be identified, this was determined to be the bleeding time. A 7 F central venous catheter (Therumo, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted by open technique via the left internal jugular vein for administration of drugs. For an overview, please see Fig. 3 of the experimental groups. ANGII infusion started at 20 ng/kg/min in swine #1-5 and were incrementally elevated to 80 ng/kg/min in 60 min, followed by a stepwise increase to a maximum dose of 240 ng/kg/min after 515 min except for swine #2 who suffered acute right ventricular heart failure at a dose of 100 ng/kg/ min and died. Swine #4 and #5 were administered with the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 with a starting dose of 20 ng/kg/min which was stepwise increased to a maximum 640 ng/kg/min after 150 min; then decreased to 320 ng/kg/min for 15 min; then stopped while a subsequent infusion of ANGII started at 20 ng/kg/min and similarly stepwise increased to 640 ng/kg/min during 275 min.

Mean relative contrast enhancement was defined as the enhancement between 10 to 25 s after the aortic peak divided by baseline signal during the initial 10 s. Stasis was estimated as the fraction with relative contrast enhancement above noise defined as three standard deviation of the signal during the measurement volumes. Other descriptive statistics on MRI perfusion were also generated in MATLAB. To generate Fig. 7 , curves were interpolated using the modified Akima method. This was done to generate a unified x-axis for simultaneous plotting. No interpolation was performed prior to calculating the functional ratio, mean TTP values or max relative enhancement of the lungs.

This corresponded to areas with stasis perfusion as illustrated by a parametric max enhancement map from the same model animal (yellow is higher contrast enhancement). f High power magnification (x40) with fluids in the alveolar sacs and sloughing of pneumocytes into the alveolar space (marked by arrows), consistent with early diffuse alveolar damage (scale bar 100 \u00b5m).g Parametric relative contrast enhancement, with same color lookup table setting as in e, of control animal. h High power magnification showing a fluid collection in control lung (marked by arrow) in the alveolar sacs (scale bar 100 \u00b5m). i The macroscopic texture of the model lung was rubbery. Large areas of the model lungs were fully consolidated (scale bar 2.5 mm). j Fluids and cells in bronchi in a fully consolidated model lung (scale bar 100 \u00b5m). k In small areas in the most posterior aspects of the model lungs we could also identify fully consolidated lung (arrow, scale bar 2.5 mm). l Ventilated bronchi in fully consolidated control lungs (scale bar 100 \u00b5m). m Model kidney. n Histological sample from model kidney with narrowing of proximal tubule wall thickness and sloughing of epithelial cells (arrows), consistent with acute tubular necrosis (scale bar 100 \u00b5m). o Control kidney. p Control kidney without signs of acute tubular necrosis (scale bar 100 \u00b5m). q Model liver without histological damage (scale bar 250 \u00b5m). r Model small bowel (scale bar 500 \u00b5m). s Control liver (scale bar 250 \u00b5m). t Control small bowel (scale bar 500 \u00b5m).",
