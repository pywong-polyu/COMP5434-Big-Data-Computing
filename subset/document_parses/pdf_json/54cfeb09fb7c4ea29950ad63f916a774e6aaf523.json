Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of destroying AH around houses in reducing malaria incidence. An agent-based model is proposed for controlling malaria's incidence through population sensitizing campaigns on the harmful effects of AH around houses. Methods: The environment is constituted of houses, AH, mosquitoes, humans, and hospital. Malaria's spread dynamic is linked to the dynamics of humans and mosquitoes. The mosquito's dynamic is represented by egg-laying and seeking blood. The human's dynamic is animated by hitting mosquitoes. AH are destroyed each time by 10% of their starting number. The number of infected humans varied from 0-90 which led to a total of 1001 simulations. Results: When the number of houses and AH is equal, the results are approximate as the field data. At each reduction of AH, the incidence and prevalence tend more and more towards 0. When there is no AH and infected humans, the prevalence and incidence are at 0. Conclusions: When there is no AH site, the disease disappears completely. Global destruction of AH in an environment and using many parameters in the same model are recommended.",

For example, according to this report, we can note that 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and India have concentrated almost 80% of the total number of malaria cases in the world. The 10 countries where group and goes to establish his new home in other places, sometimes very distant (often hundreds of kilometers). The family can grow and become another grouping. These kinds of habitats are found mostly in Africa country and there are a small grouping and huge grouping [3, 4] .",

            "text": "Among the most widely used malaria control measures in Africa, we find mainly: larval source management (LSM) and insecticide-treated nets (ITN) [4] . We note that despite all the efforts made to reduce or eradicate this disease, it continues to persist. Therefore it is important to bring new tools to fight against malaria. However, LSM notably played a very large role in reducing the incidence of malaria [5] . Among LSM methods, targeted source reduction (TSR) is the one that researchers precaunize much more than others [4, 5] . Indeed, according to several recent studies, TSR is more precaunized because it is more effective and less expensive [4] . However, TSR is contraried because they just treat a part of the AH while neglecting the other in a given environment. However, neglected other AH can make malaria reappear [5] and the disease will persist in the area. By knowing the number and speed of mosquito reproduction [4] , even if there are few mosquitoes in an area, in a short time the number of mosquitoes will grow at a rapid rate. Do not also forget that mosquito can fly up to 10 -12 km overflight during its lifetime with a speed of 1.6 -2.4 km/h [6] and can live up to 40 days [7] . Depending on the houses of humans, larval development may be accentuated thereby increasing the number of mosquitoes. However, for the control of malaria, TSR are increasingly recommended. We can see that TSR is not a better method for Africans, since wastewater is a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes. This wastewater also comes out every day because it is part of actions linked to the habits of Africans.",

            "text": "Today, environmental management (EM) has taken Aquatic Habitat Management (AHM) of mosquitoes from new angles. First, new EM tools are being implemented and are costing more and more less [8] . We could for example mention aerial spraying through drones or planes [9, 10] . Thus, rather than going into the field to spray, we can use aerial rain by using products that are not harmful to humans such as new formulas of pesticides or biopesticides for example [10, 11] . However, the side effects on humans of spray products pose a major challenge. We realize that treating an entire area can become cheaper and take less time compared to going down on the ground to spray or destroy aquatic habitats of mosquitoes [12] . The overall treatment of an area requires a good understanding of the production and effectiveness of control measures for the entire area [13] . Second, communication tools can be used to sensitize the population and also promote environmental sanitation to avoid the production of AH as much as possible around houses [14] [15] [16] . Reduce the breeding grounds can prolong the development of the gonotrophic cycle and the spread of malaria [4] . The life cycle of the female anopheles consists of two phases: a laying phase (the mosquito searches for a lava site for the laying of eggs) and development and a phase of searching for blood in a host. Search oviposition sites and hosts can have important implications for the spread of malaria. The female mosquito cycle (egglaying and blood-feeding) can help us to deny mosquito to have an opportunity to reduce the blood feeding's frequency and egg-laying by using these programs. So, mortality over the cycle can be increase. Understanding the dynamic of mosquito help the programs of intervention's development especially to know demarcate, and guide the perimeter of environmental sanitation areas. Nevertheless, taking parameters such as behaviors, movements, gonotrophic cycle, a cycle of malaria in each individual, and the status of individuals in the same model is often not possible. However, the consideration of these parameters in a model is important because it better reflects reality [7] .",

In this work, we develop an ABM (Agent-Based Model) to simulate development and malaria evolution in each individual. Hence, our study's objective was to assess and examine the impact of mosquito's aquatic habitat destruction program and also bring out guidelines for LSM by aquatic habitat destruction. To achieve that, we take into account: the questing resting to properly define the activities of mosquitoes, the different stages of the disease to know the evolution of the disease in each individual, the different stages of mosquito development namely the immature (egg, larva, pupa) and adult phase to follow the individual development of individuals, the daily activities and behaviors of individuals (human and mosquitoes). We also take into account the efficiency of the distribution of mosquito AH and use the GIS (geographic information system) of sub-Saharan Africa grouping.",

A single bite is not always enough for a mosquito or human to become infectious. Yet most ABMs designed so far consider that a single mosquito bite can transmit plasmodium. Also, the majority of ABMs do not take into account the evolutionary cycle of malaria which would take us from susceptible mosquitoes to latent then infectious and from humans susceptible to recovery via latent and infectious. In this model, we use the questing resting as in Kamgang et al. [17] to represent the number of infectious bites. Also, we use the classes of individuals from the kamgang et al. and Chinit [18] mathematical models to represent the evolution of malaria in each individual.",

Indeed, in African behavior, households generally pour dirty water not far from their homes which creates a small AH around the houses.

The migration of mosquitoes is not taken into account. This laying depends on the probability of laying which is also constant.

For this, we used the campartment models of Chinit [18] and Kamgang et al. [17] to represent the classes of human and mosquito individuals respectively. We have chosen the Chinit model for humans because it takes into account the majority of the individual's classes including the return of the resettles to the susceptible class. The Kamgang et al. model was chosen for mosquitoes because it represents the majority of mosquito classes and takes into account questingresting. Indeed, the questing resting makes it possible to represent the fact that the mosquito bites a human several times before becoming infected or infecting humans. The classes of individuals of humans are: Susceptible Fig. 3 ). When a human is healthy, it is considered that he is susceptible and he becomes latent (or enters the incubation phase) when he receives an acceptable level of plasmodium represented here by a probability also called contact rate as in Chinits. Note that this is only valid when an infected and active mosquito comes into contact with a healthy human. After 15 days in this phase, humans become infectious and can transmit malaria to a healthy mosquito. It is at this level that he seeks the health center to treat himself. If after 100 days [4] , he cannot find the health center for treatment (represented here by the cure rate), he dies of malaria, otherwise, he becomes recovered. Between one to three months [19], the recovered becomes susceptible again at a certain rate. The cycle can then start again and this happens on every human. At each initialization, each individual has a randomly assigned class date, that is, 1-100 years for humans and 1-40 days for mosquitoes.",

Likewise, a healthy mosquito is considered as active susceptible if it searches of a resource (aquatic habitat or house) and susceptible at rest when not in motion. When an active susceptible comes into contact with an infected human or recovered, it becomes latent with a certain rate. If the blood dose is necessary for the development of these eggs, he can return to the AH to rest. This is the reason why the mosquito in the model starts from susceptible active to latent at rest. After a certain time (rest period represented here by a rate), the mosquito if it is still alive, switches from the Er i class to the Ea i class (i = 1,2,3). When a mosquito in the Ea i class manages to take its blood meal (with speed), it migrates to the Er i+1 class. After a certain time spent in the Er4 class, it migrates to the Ia class and when it succeeds in having its blood meal, it switches from the Ia class to the Ir class; after he returns to class Ia and this repeats for life. For infection rates (mosquito to human infection and vice versa), we used Chinit rates. We take the infection rates of Chinit rather than that for Kamgng et al. because it represents the different links of infections (For example, in Kamgang et al. model there are no recovered but Chinit takes into account the recovered which can also transmit the disease.",

We observe in these figures that the state of health of the population tends more and more to be normal in the time. This means that all humans who were not susceptible change their status until to become susceptible. This is the reason why the likelihood curve grows over time. On the other hand, the curve of the other statuses (latent, infected, restored) decreases over time. Other things, we realize that when there are infected humans in the environment, they quickly change their status in other to be restored and then susceptible. This is what the humans' infected curves decrease until to be at zero at a certain time. Once humans become susceptible, they remain there for the rest of their lives because there are no mosquitoes in the environment. Figures 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 , 20, 21, 22, 23 show the cases where there are HAs and mosquitoes in the environment. We can observe in these figures that the infection curve is never at 0. This is what explains the fact that the incidence is always different from 0 in these cases, hence the existence of malaria in the environment. Moreover, unlike the cases where there is no HA, we can observe that the human recovery curve is always increasing. This simply means that a lot of people have become infected at least once. Besides, since the death rate is low, most infected humans become recovered. Figures 24, 25, 26 , 27, 28, and 29 show the population of vectors. These figures show that the number of infected humans depends on the growth of the number of mosquitoes in the environment. Indeed, if there are fewer infected humans in the environment, this means that mosquitoes are not able to take their blood meal properly. If mosquitoes fail to feed on the blood meal, it also means that their reproduction will also be reduced.",

For example, we can see in Fig. 24 that throughout the simulation, the total number of mosquitoes does not exceed 18 and the number of infected mosquitoes does not exceed 11. This is explained by the fact that in the environment, there are no infected humans and the initial number of mosquito is only 5. So the probability of infected mosquito is low because all humans are healed. The same thing is seen in Figs 25 and 27. Worse, when there is no AH in the environment, we do not find any infected individuals. On the other hand, Figures 26, 28, and 29 show that mosquitoes are abundant in the environment. Figure 29 for example shows that the total number of mosquitoes can exceed 300. This can be explained as follows: as there are more than 15 AH and consequently more than 75 mosquitoes at the beginning, then there is a high chance that certain mosquitoes lay and develop their eggs. Indeed, even if in the model mosquitoes have many obstacles (death, death due to activity), some will still obtain resources for egg-laying and development. Table 2 shows that the entomological inoculation rates (EIR; the number of infected mosquitoes divided by the number of persons) increases in the same way as incidence and prevalence.",

Indeed, whether we use the targeted reduction technique or the overall reduction technique with 2 km of perimeters (as in recent studies [4] ), we just reduce the incidence of malaria but we do not return it to 0. This means that malaria will go away for a certain time but come back later if the treatment is not done regularly. Our simulations show that it is when we destroy all the AH in an environment that we can greatly reduce the development cycle of the mosquito, hence the eradication of malaria. Indeed, by destroying AH, the mosquito no longer has a place to lay the eggs, lava development, and a place to rest. However, large-scale treatment poses a problem of resources, cost, and timing. If you want to do a large-scale treatment, you need a lot of materials to do it which will give rise to a lot of expenses. The timing is important here because if the overall treatment is not done simultaneously, there is a good chance that mosquitoes from an untreated area will migrate to areas already treated. But these problems could still be addressed using new environmental management mechanisms such as the use of drones. This also poses another problem: the effect of the products to be used on the hosts (humans and animals). Second, it is important to destroy only mosquitoes that cause malaria. Destroying all mosquitoes can have a lot of impact on the ecosystem as many species feed on mosquitoes [7] . Starting from the fact that not all mosquitoes species are blood-sucking (just 6% [12] ), we could thus eliminate only those who seek the host for their blood meal. However, the question of adopting a product that kills only certain species of mosquitoes without a primary and/or secondary effect on the other species remains.",

Using the two results of the struggles listed above will be useless if the populations continue to follow their habits. Indeed, if the population continues to pour wastewater close to homes, this could allow mosquitoes to continue their development (human and aquatic habitats are available). In addition to sensitization, it will also be necessary to think about cleaning up their environment by channeling wastewater. However, there is a major challenge in the techniques of sensitization and sanitation. Indeed, most African areas, especially those in the South Sahara, are enclosed [3] and difficult to access [3] , hence the issue of sensitization and sanitation remains unresolved. But, a draft of a solution can be brought within the sensitization in particular by using the means of communication which exist more and more nowadays (example: social networks, proximity radio, communicating to the population through their leaders traditional,. . .). This communication or sensitization can also be used to show the simple and easy techniques of wastewater sanitation and/or pipes to the populations.",

Unfortunately, the distance at which mosquitoes can find a certain resource is poorly understood. Recent studies show that mosquito can fly 200-400 m per day. Also, a mosquito can fly up to 10-12 km during its lifetime. From these results, our model shows that if we remove just a few AH, an infected mosquito can contaminate an environment having a surface which range is more than 10 km 2 of its AH. Thus, the disease can be prolonged in the environment if only a few AH are destroyed. This result suggests that forbearing mosquitoes from their resources can severely limit their development and growth around AH.",

So, increasing the flying over's distance of mosquito out of their resources for egg-laying and maturation of eggs could greatly slow down or completely reduce the number of mosquitoes.

It should be noted that our fight does not fall only on the fight by larvicides, but also on the environmental sanitation through the pipeline and sensitization of the populations on the management of domestic waste and wastewater from their household. Although treating water may help to reduce the development of hematophagous mosquitoes, but does not help the ecology. To help humans on the fight against malaria and ecology in the preservation of certain species, it is important to operate only on hematophagous (that feed on blood) mosquitoes since they are only a minority (6%) [12] . So to be able to operate on these species only, we suggest to the governments to sensitize their populations on the management of their environment. This can be done for example by using the means of communication that exist today to give the building plans even to those living in the deep villages. Also, the canalization of wastewater used by households and domestic waste can be resolved by proposing the methods which use the means adapted to Africa. We can also focus studies on products against mosquitoes that would only operate on hematophagous species without having effects on humans, other species of mosquitoes, animals, and other insects.",

We took into account the questing-resting to represent the number of infectious bites in our ABM model which had not yet been carried out until now. To achieve this, we used the parameters of some mathematical and ABM models. We also took into account: the different stages of the disease, the life cycle of the mosquito, the daily activities, heterogeneous landscapes, status, and movement. It emerges from this study that makes global destruction is great than TSR. Also, the use of many parameters in the same model makes the model more robust. The main limitation of our study is that it is not robust enough because some control parameters (such as the use of the INT for example) were not considered. Also, the fact of not using the means of protection limits the observation of the movements of mosquitoes as it happens in reality. To make work even more robust and efficient, in future work, we provide to include the use of insecticide net treated associate with the aquatic habitat destruction in other to well understand the behavior of individuals (mosquitoes and host). other parameters will be added also to the model like the activity of humans for example.",
