Methodology: HCWs at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH) assigned for COVID-19 patients between 18 March and 10 June 2020 were tested for past infection using total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin assay, demographic data and compliance with safety measures were assessed using a questionnaire. Results: A total of 340 HCWs participated in the study, 260 were close direct care. Three HCWs tested positive for total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin. Close direct care were more compliant with personal protective guidelines than those providing direct care. Conclusion: HCWs compliance with personal protective guidelines might explain the low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in hospital settings.",

A total of 113 physicians and 227 nurses participated in the study; results showed a high level of compliance among HCWs working in close direct care and a relatively lower level of compliance among those providing direct care. Three of the HCWs tested positive for the total immunoglobulin assay, indicating the importance of adhering to the safety measures to decrease the risk of contracting the virus.",

Therefore, countries around the globe, including Jordan, imposed unprecedented restrictions and adopted safety measures attempting to limit the spread of the virus among public and healthcare facilities [3] [4] [5] . Healthcare workers (HCWs) are exposed to an elevated risk relative to the general population because of closer contact with infected patients especially for those who are designated for taking care of COVID-19 patients [6] . Even some would suggest that its considered as one of the occupational injuries [7] . The availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) in addition to the level of HCWs awareness/compliance with personal protective guidelines is crucial in reducing the rate of the viral transmission especially with the redeployment of less experienced clinical staff to frontline positions [8, 9] . Studies showed that standardized and strict adherence to PPE can reduce nosocomial transmissions [10] . Screening for hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection is vital for limiting subclinical transmission to noninfected patients, family members and the community as a whole [11] . Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay for nasopharyngeal swabs is the diagnostic test for active infection [12] . However, the timing of the RT-PCR assay is a crucial limitation in the molecular diagnostic perspective, where false-negative results may ensue, especially at the early incubation period and late recovery stages of infection [13, 14] . Therefore, RT-PCR is limited to confirmation of active disease and contact tracing [13, 14] . On the other hand, the usage of the early developed rapid antigen tests has shown promising results in detecting COVID-19 among HCWs due to its short term of detection but it had less sensitivity compared with the RT-PCR tests [15] .",

During this period, 177 confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. A total of 344 HCWs (physician and nurses) were assigned to provide direct care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These HCWs were screened by RT-PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swap during May 2020 with no positive results [18] . About 4 weeks later, they were asked to participate voluntarily in this study. Physicians and nurses at KAUH who were assigned to taking direct care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and had at least one RT-PCR assay were included in this study, while the other HCWs and employees were excluded. Close direct care in our study included those who provided care to COVID-19 patients within a distance of \u22641.5 meters and \u226515 min/24 h or participated in aerosol-generating procedures. Any other type of COVID-19 patient's care in the designated locations was defined as direct care [19, 20] . A questionnaire was structured and sent through emails with a covering letter explaining the purpose of the study. Participation required signing a consent form, answering the questionnaire and providing a blood sample for the total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin assay. The questionnaire included demographic data, occupational characteristics, nature of COVID-19 care, work allocation sites, working hours per shift, comorbidities (hypertension, allergies and smoking history), history of flu-like symptoms during COVID-19 care periods (fever, runny nose, cough, generalized weakness, muscles and joints pain, sore throat), annual influenza vaccination, contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients (outside the hospital, family member) and co-worker confirmed by RT-PCR assay, sleeping pattern changes (difficulty going to sleep, interrupted sleep, nightmares) and changes in regular daily activities (appetite, socialization, irritability, concentration). Compliance with personal protective guidelines recommended PPE and the hospital infection control and prevention (ICP) policy were assessed separately with choices of (always/most of the times/frequently/occasionally). Satisfaction with the hospital education/training process for using PPE (highly satisfied/satisfied/satisfied with preservation/not satisfied) was also included. Sleep pattern changes were considered positive if the HCW answered yes with one or more sleep components. Changes in regular daily activity were considered positive if HCW replied yes with one or more of the question components. Compliance with personal protective guidelines, ICP policy and PPE use was defined if participants reported that always/most of the time. Being satisfied with education/training for PPE use was defined if participants' answers were highly satisfied/almost satisfied. The hospital database and records of the ICP committee were used for relevant data related to the study (date of patient admission and discharge, total admitted confirmed cases, assigned HCWs with their RT-PCR assay, mean hospital stay for confirmed patients).",

Therefore, international and national health authorities recommended extra safety measures and protective guidelines to assure HCWs' safety [3, 22] . Physical distancing, standardized safety measures, contact/respiratory droplets precautions and early identification/isolation of suspected HCWs were recommended to decrease the risk of transmission in healthcare setup [1, 5, 23] . As physical distancing is challenging to achieve in a hospital setup [5] , COVID-19 hospital care in this study was classified as close direct care and direct care. Several investigators reported an increased risk for HCWs providing close contact care compared with those providing care with physical distancing greater than 1-2 meters [19, 24] . The overall prevalence of positive serology assays for HCWs in this study was 0.9%. Of the three HCWs confirmed to have COVID-19, two got the infection from outside hospital contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. There is accumulative evidence suggesting risk reduction with protected direct care [19, 24] Furthermore, the risk of transmission is high from exposure to undiagnosed asymptomatic patients, coworkers, household members and the community outside hospitals [5, 25] . Therefore, it would be difficult to finally judge where the source of the infection was finally from. Although most HCWs in this study were close direct care providers (76.5%), the prevalence of positive immunoglobulin assay was 0.7% compared with 1.2% for direct care providers. This apparent difference cannot be analyzed for significance due to the limited numbers. The low hospital influx of COVID-19 patients, low community transmission during the first pandemic wave in Jordan and overall compliance with personal protective guidelines and ICP policy were responsible for low prevalence in this study. Close direct care providers were more compliant with personal protective guidelines and ICP policy than direct care providers (p < 0.05). A substantial risk reduction was observed for HCWs while providing protected direct care for confirmed patients [26, 27] ; several other investigators reported a high HCWs risk for transmitted infection due to inadequate training, lack of protective equipment and noncompliance with safety precautions [10, 11] . HCWs providing close direct care in this study had to work for long shift hours compared with direct care providers. The hospital policy offers them 10-14 days of home isolation after each close direct care working shift. Even though reports showed an increased risk of HCWs transmitted infection with increasing load of work and long working shifts hours during the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [11] . However, nurses had high compliance with the recommended face mask and face shield/eye goggles compared with physicians (p < 0.05), all seropositive assays were found in nurses. Nurses constitute (66.8%) of the study population, and 2/3 of seropositive nurses had an outside hospital contact with confirmed cases, as stated earlier.",

Recent reports demonstrated a reduction in hospital-acquired infection among HCWs due to accumulated knowledge, experience, early detection, isolation, understanding of the ICP measures/personal protective guidelines, proper education/training, availability of PPE and compliance [22, 33] . Although the optimal and proper PPE is a matter of debate, standardized and high compliance with personal protective guidelines and infection prevention/control policies can dramatically reduce nosocomial transmissions [34] . Despite all these improvements in safety precautions, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among HCWs is several folds higher than that for the community in general [9] . In this study, HCWs providing close direct care had a higher prevalence of sleeping pattern changes. It was established that a considerable proportion of healthcare personnel reported symptoms of mental health problems, ranging from depression, anxiety, insomnia and stress [22] . Also, a considerable proportion of in-hospital quarantined COVID-19 infected patients reported symptoms of depression, regardless of their COVID-19 infection severity [35] . Data has shown that a fourth of HCWs reported mild anxiety, depression or insomnia [36] . Apart from the constant fear of infecting family members, HCWs also described being stigmatized, as they were assumed to be potential sources of contamination [37] .",
