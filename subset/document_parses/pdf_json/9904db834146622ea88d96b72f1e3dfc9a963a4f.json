Groundwater and surface water reservoirs for drinking water as well as water from receiving rivers of Monterrey Metropolitan Area were sampled repeatedly during a peak phase between October 2020 and January 2021, and the virus RNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Forty-four percent of groundwater samples demonstrated detectable virus loads between 2.9 and 5.6 copies/ml. A significant correlation with sucralose concentration in groundwater reaffirmed the hypothesis of leaching and infiltration of effluents from surface and/or failing sewage pipes, and emphases the importance of water disinfection. Thirteen percent of surface water dam samples tested positive, with values varying between 3.3 and 3.8 copies/ml. Finally, 21% of river samples marked positive for viral RNA, with concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 7.0 copies/ml. Raw wastewater samples taken in the same period show viral loads of up to 3535 copies/ml, demonstrating a dilution effect and/or efficiency of wastewater facilities.",

These loads are two to three orders of magnitude lower than those reported by 63 Guerrero-Latorre et al. (2020) for Quito's river. This could be because Monterrey treats more 64 than 90% of its municipal wastewater, while the urban rivers of Quito are impacted by the 65 direct discharge of sewage water from the city (3 million inhabitants). Similarly, the negative 66 results derived from the analysis of river water samples from Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan 67 (Haramoto et al. 2020) and Milan, Italy (Rimoldi et al. 2020) could be possibly attributed to 68 the fact that both studies collected water from rivers receiving treated wastewater. 69 It is expected that wastewaters from WWTPs with a complete treatment were tested as 70 negative. Thus, the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a few samples in La Silla and 71 Pesquer\u00eda river water could stem from different sources coexisting in the same basin. For 72 example, aliquots of non-treated sewage can be present because of illicit discharges, 73 malfunction of sewerage systems, and their increased relative contribution during dry periods 74 (Mosley et al. 2015). The lack of separation of the urban runoff waters from the domestic 75effluents, which causes combined sewer overflows (CSOs), could also be a reason(Rimoldi  76   et al. 2020).

First, groundwater in 133 MMA is currently disinfected by gas chlorination removing pathogenic viruses and bacteria. 134 Since coronaviruses are sensitive to oxidants like chlorine (La Rosa et al., 2020b), it is 135 important to continue strengthening and advancing treatment processes of groundwater, 136 especially in wells located in shallow aquifers in combination with places where sewage 137 effluents from health care facilities, sewage, solid landfill and drainage water are not treated 138 or treated inefficiently (Guerrero-Latorre et al. 2020) and expected to infiltrate, or where 139 sewage pipes could be leaky (Torres-Hernandez et al., 2020).

This shows that the concentration of 149 SARS-CoV-2 in surface (<5.6 GC/ml) and groundwater (<7 GC/ml) in MMA is 150 approximately three orders of magnitude lower than in raw wastewater. This means that the 151 viral load could not be eradicated completed as observed in Haramoto et al. (2020), however 152 the result is similar to Rimoldi et al. (2020). 153 Importantly, the presence of genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 in freshwater should not 154 be considered as direct indicator of the presence of infective viral particles. Establishing 155 infectivity requires the successful isolation and culture of actual viral particles from water 156 samples (Giacobbo et al., 2021). However, the presence of detectable amounts of genetic 157 material from SARS-CoV-2 in freshwater should not be taken lightly. 158 4.5 Future directions 159 This study shows the importance of monitoring programs to determine the fate of SARS-160 CoV-2 in the urban water cycle. Until now, there is no evidence and enough data to confirm 161 if the water or wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2 could be the potential source of its 162 transmission. Some studies predicted a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via wastewater 163 (Chin et al., 2020; Rimoldi et al., 2020; Ihsanullah et al., 2021), but the investigations in this 164 topic are still in an early phase. Future research should be oriented towards the understanding 165 of the fate of the virus in different water environments, factors which are favorable and 166 unfavorable for its development, and the potential exposure risk of water contaminated with 167 this virus in its different variants. Experimental research must go hand in hand with the 168 development of conceptual and computational analysis. 169 A look on studies performed so far shows that there is a lack of standardized protocols 170 for the sampling, detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater 171 (",

These low viral loads demonstrate the dilution effect and/or 187 efficiency of wastewater treatment facilities in MMA. Raw wastewater measured during the 188 same period shows viral loads of up to 3535 GC/ml. Some samples that tested positive in the 189 river stem possibly from aliquots of non-treated sewage due to illicit discharges, malfunction 190 of sewerage system and their relative contribution during the dry period. A further indication 191 of water aliquots of fecal origin of water is a weak correlation with E. coli bacteria. These 192 findings highlight the importance of a good coverage of wastewater treatment facilities such 193 as in MMA.

Moreover, differences of viral loads in groundwater between 209 the municipalities inside the metropolitan area are observed; they appear to be consistent with 210 the trends of reported daily cases of infections in each municipality.
