We used an innovative online diary instrument that has proved both reliable and quick-to-field. Combining diary information on activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily behavior, we show clear changes in risk-associated behavior between the pre, full-lockdown and post full-lockdown periods. We document a shift from more to less risky daily behavior patterns (combinations of activity/ location/co-presence categories) between the pre-pandemic pattern and full lockdown in May/June 2020, followed by a reversion (although not a complete reversal) of those patterns in August 2020 following the end of the first lockdown. Because, in general, a populations' time use changes relatively slowly, the behavioral changes revealed may be interpreted as a consequence of the UK COVID-19 lockdown social restrictions and their subsequent relaxation.",

            "text": "Governments around the world are urgently redesigning social distancing measures as they assess the trade-offs between economic and psychological distress and the need to avoid resurgences in COVID-19. At a time when there is still limited capacity in respect both of immunization and track-trace technology, governments must continue to rely on changes in people's daily behaviors to contain the virus. In this paper we introduce a new time use based approach enabling policy-makers to assess and quantify changes in daily behaviors following the imposition of social restrictions, and the impact they are likely to have on overall behavioral-associated risks. Using an online time-use diary survey first deployed in the UK in 2016, then conducted in real time during the period of full lockdown (late May 2020) and again following the easing of social restrictions in July 2020, we provide an overview of changing behaviors associated with infection risk both prior to, and during, recent phases of social restrictions. Many aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic are still poorly understood. Of the main approaches to modelling the heterogeneity of infection, demographic approaches have focused on a variety of individual risk-related characteristics-age, sex and ethnicity in particular [1] [2] [3] . But these demographic characteristics, although they are shown to be important discriminators in terms of infection risk, are less proximate than are the daily patterns of behavior which underlie the actual routes of infection. It is clear that the effective means of transmission of infection is contact: close interaction of an uninfected individual with an infected individual or location [4] . Contact-based instruments, derived particularly from 'Polymod' [5, 6] , record the actual physical proximity of contact (such as the speaking/touching/distancing distinction). Such surveys ask respondents who they met during specific periods (e.g. 'yesterday' or 'between these times'), or while they were in a defined area at a particular time of the day, and what the extent of their physical contact was with others during that time [6] [7] [8] . This type of information has been the main source for the formal modelling of infection spread; for example, contact-based surveys showed substantial decreases in physical contact following the imposition of first lockdown in the UK [8] . However, contact-based surveys have often not provided much information on the types of locations in which contacts occurred, or on the likelihood that respondents were surrounded by people other than those they describe as 'contacts' (e.g. on a train, or in the cinema), or about time spent in activities/locations during which respondents did not report being in contact with specific others.",

It is regarded as the 'gold standard' when it comes to the collection of information on population activity distributions and sequences [9] . Major COVID-19 related UK social surveys conducted over the course of the pandemic have not collected time-use diaries [10] , while the UK Office of National Statistics collected a pilot online time-use diary only once during the pandemic, in March-April 2020 [11], without linking the results to behavioral infection risk. However, when time use diary-derived patterns of behavior are linked to infection risk (through assessment of the 'riskiness' of certain combinations of activity, location and co-presence), this enables the identification of those changes in behavior patterns which are likely to contribute to subsequent changes in infection rates.",

Subsequently, in August 2020, we observe the modification of behavior in the direction of more time again being spent in more risky behaviors (associated with the easing of social restrictions), leading in turn, via increasing infection rates, to the imposition of a second lockdown.",

Deploying time-use diary evidence in this context has been done before [15] [16] [17] , but not in respect of combining multiple diary fields (activities, locations, co-presence and durations) to estimate behavior-related infection risks, and not to report changing behavioral-related infection risks at successive surveys reflecting periods of changing social restrictions.",

We fielded the same instrument using the same UK research panel in May-June 2020-at the peak period of lockdown, providing a real-time comparison with 2016 behavior, and again in late August 2020 following the relaxation of social restrictions in July 2020.",

Research panel members were recruited separately for each wave and accepted up to the point the quota limits were reached. Quotas were set to represent the UK population in 2016 according to sex, age group, region and social grade. Response days (1-3 per respondent) were randomly allocated to respondents, to include one weekday and one weekend day where there was more than one diary completed (most respondents completed 2 or 3 diaries). Diaries were first reweighted for analysis to ensure a correct distribution of days of the week by sex and age group. For each survey wave we took 6 (broadly 10-year) age-groups, the two sex-groups and each day of the week, adjusting the achieved sample for each of the resulting (3 \ufffd 6 \ufffd 2 \ufffd 7) cells to give the appropriate representation of each day, then normalizing to retain the original overall sample numbers. The survey waves provided 1011 diary days in 2016, 1007 in May/June 2020, and 987 in August 2020. Table 1 shows the distribution of diary days according to the nationally-representative quota target specifications for sex, age, region and social group in 2016. In general there is a close fit between quota targets and achieved diary numbers across the survey waves, with three exceptions: there is an under-representation of the 65+ age group in the two recent surveys, a lesser under-representation among the 18-24 group in the August 2020 survey only, and an under-representation of social grade C2 in the two 2020 survey waves (although quota specifications were met for grades D+E). In the case of social group the difference may reflect a move from C2 employment into unemployment in the population (and also among panel members) as a direct effect of the pandemic. With respect to age it is possible that the changes in the quota representation across waves represents a response bias due to pandemic conditions, with both older and younger age groups having been seriously impacted by social restrictions. We therefore also reweighted the 2020 samples according to the 2016 quota distribution for age group 65+ (normalizing again for achieved sample sizes). While total sample size allowed us to adjust the achieved sample to compensate for under-representation of the older age group cells in the 2020 waves, further sub-division by social group produced too many vacant cells. The fact that quotas were met for social grades D+E, however, means that the social grade distribution did include some representation from the lower end of the scale. We use the reweighted samples for our analyses.",

New waves of data collection using the same methodology are quick to commission (both 2020 survey waves took less than a fortnight from first consideration to enter the field). Response quality was comparable to other on-line diaries, with a mean of 19 episodes recorded each day across all three waves.

Consequently, our behavioral risk variable has an average of only 14 minutes (out of 1440) missing or unallocated per day in 2016, 13 minutes/day missing in May-June 2020, and 12 minutes/day missing in August 2020.",

Mean minutes spent in risk level 5 were 190 minutes higher (CI: 165-215, P < .001) in 2016 than during lockdown in May-June 2020, and 66 minutes higher (CI: 39-92, P < .001) during the following period of social restrictions in August 2020.

Describing the activity/location/copresence combinations that make up risk categories 1-5 in Fig 1 in more detail , at the bottom of the stacked columns the average daily time spent at home alone or with other household members doing self-care activities (including sleep, personal care, and meals) increased from 609 minutes/day in 2016 to 674 minutes/day in May-June 2020, then decreased to 632 minutes/day in August 2020.

Paid home working increased dramatically from 42 to 116 minutes/day at full lockdown, but remained almost at the same level following the relaxation of social restrictions, at 111 minutes/day by August 2020.

As with most time-use diary surveys, the CaDDI is accompanied by an individual questionnaire, enabling detailed disaggregated analysis by socio-economic and demographic characteristics to explore the distributional correlates and consequences of daily activity patterns. So beyond population average measurement of the changing risk-related behavior in response to social restrictions, the questionnaire information also allows analysis of the distribution of the behavioral risk of social distancing measures across subgroups disaggregated by, for example, age [3] , gender [23] and occupation [24] . This will enable the investigation of how different subgroups (for example, women compared to men, younger ages compared to older ages) respond behaviorally to changing regulations, enabling more efficient targeting of particular at-risk subgroups.",
