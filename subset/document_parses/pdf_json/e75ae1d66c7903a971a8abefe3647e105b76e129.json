Numerous studies have shown that it plays a significant role in reducing inequalities, improving social justice, enhancing benefits, and sharing responsibility towards public health. Despite this, the extant literature of community engagement in public health (CEPH) has topic-focused boundaries and is scattered across disciplinary. Large-scale studies are needed to systematically identify current status, hotspots, knowledge structure, dynamic trends, and future developments in this field.",

One thousand one hundred two papers out of 70.8 million publications over the period of 1980 to 2020 and their 15,116 references were retrieved as the sample set. First, basic characteristics of publications, including distributions of geography, journals and categories, productive authors and frequently cited articles, etc. were obtained. Then, four bibliometric methods, i.e. social network analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence clustering, and burst detection, were further conducted to sketch the contours of the structure and evolution of CEPH. Results: Between Jan 1, 1980, and Apr 25, 2020, CEPH has attracted a sharp increase in interest all over the world. Total 117 countries or regions have participated in the field of CEPH and the contributions are geographically and institutionally distinct. The United States is the key region performing such research, which accounts for more than half of the total number of publications. Developing countries, such as South Africa, India, Brazil and China also contributed a lot. The advancements of CEPH are marked by historically momentous public health events and evolved from macroscopic strategies to mesoscopic and microscopic actions. Based on keyword clustering and cocitation clustering, we propose a 4O (i.e. orientation, object, operation, and outcome) framework of CEPH to facilitate a better understanding of the current global achievements and an elaborate structuring of developments in the future.",

To meet the big challenges, the traditional paradigm of public health is confronting urgent calls to be reshaped and strengthened from the exclusively vertical, top-down and curative scheme to an inclusive, whole-of-society, and peoplecentered one [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Community engagement (CE), involving communities in decision-making and in the planning, design, governance and delivery of services [9, 10] , has been regarded as effectively responding means to offer the fundamental support for public health by reducing isolation and improving social capital) [11] . To put the \"public\" into public health, CE first came to prominence in the public health arena since the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration [12] . It reflected a revolutionary thinking that health is not only an outcome of biomedical interventions, but also a result of social determinants [13] [14] [15] . In the following period, the concerns on CE proliferated [16] [17] [18] . After the SARS crisis, 196 countries across the globe elaborate an international legal instrument, the International Health Regulations, laid stress on working with communities in response to the international spread of disease in 2005 [19] . Later, both WHO report of the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health [20] and World Report on Primary Health Care [21] highlighted the important role of CE in empowerment and local capacity building again [22] . In 2016, WHO Framework on Integrated People-Centred Health Services re-emphasized CE as one of its key strategies [23] . In the age of COVID-19, pandemic control increasingly relied on CE which could ensure thoughtful applications of diverse measures with respect for specific contexts and rights [6, 8] .",

China's barefoot doctors, India's rural health centers, Nigeria's community health extension workers, Malawi's health surveillance assistants, Ghana's Navrongo Experiment, and Basic Development Needs Programme in Eastern Mediterranean Region are all typical examples [13, 28, 29] . Evidence has shown that CE plays a significant role in reducing inequalities, improving social justice, enhancing benefits, and sharing responsibility towards public health [9, 25, 30, 31] . Ironically, despite the recognition that CE is a critical element of successful health programs to achieve \"the health for all\" goals [22] , engaging communities has still been somehow under-represented or \"lost\" in promoting public health with grave consequences [13, 32] . For instance, sluggish response to early disease events often impaired the rapid detection and headstream control while communities are the first to know unusual things happened [11] . Lack of data tracking and limited community ownership constrained the coverage and left the poor behind [13] . The extreme manifestation of community fear could even lead to the killings of health workers [7] . Achievement of high and equitable coverage public health requires long-term decision making, elaborate designing, better local training, and supportive supervising. Burgeoning the power of community, revitalizing CE, and learning from the decades of experience is crucial to reconstruct public health systems in all countries, both developed and developing.",

Since these publications have topic-focused boundaries and are scattered across disciplinary, a robust synthesis of the research is needed to pull the literature together in a coherent way and an agreed terminology for future development. However, to the best of our knowledge, the extant literature fails to provide a big and fine-grained picture of academic research on community engagement in public health (CEPH) which could systematically describe current status, hotspots, knowledge structure, dynamic trends, and future developments in this field. As a quantitative approach, the bibliometric analysis could provide an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of specific research areas involved based on a large-scale publication [33, 34] . Therefore, aiming to fulfill this gap, we adopted a longitudinal bibliometric analysis to draw an outline of the global review on the contemporary and crossdisciplinary research of community engagement and public health. The technology-based review presents an opportunity to take stock and understand the march of knowledge as well as the logical venation underlying research activities which are fundamental to inform policy making.",

Therefore, we exclude this document and choose the first document after the Alma Ata declaration appeared in 1980 for thematic analysis.

First, expert interviews were conducted to help the search term identification. Second, Web of Science Core Collection was selected as the original database which fully contains the mainstream international academic journals over a long period and offers detailed information, especially the references, of publications.

The reason for this distribution seems obvious: these countries have been plagued by epidemic diseases, and the residents have great health and survival pressure, which forces the countries to look for new ways to improve the current health care pressure. Table 2 ranks the top ten productive institutions including specific information. Johns Hopkins University is the institution that publishes the most articles, with a total of 70 articles, accounting for 6.35%. Three of the top five institutions belong to the United States. It is worth mentioning that, among the top five institutions, Johns Hopkins University is the agency responsible for the statistics of the new coronary pneumonia in the United States. The fifth-ranked World Health Organization promotes the prevention and treatment of epidemics and endemic diseases and plays a guiding role in improving public health. Table 3 lists the top ten most productive authors in the CEPH, as well as their H index, total citations, and average citations per item. Among them, England and USA both have three authors, and one from Kenya, China, Australia, Cuba, meaning most productivity authors come from developed countries. The author with the largest total number of articles is South J. from England. A total of 8 articles have been published with an H index of 4 and a total of 65 citations. The highest number of total citations is Cargo M., who comes from Australia, with an average of 130.25 citations per article.",

The underlying thinking of this ultimate aim reflect serious humanistic solicitude that fairness and morality are just as important to human beings as the individual survival. Communities, in which people live or work closely together and share the same risks [28, 32] , have emerged as typically embodied organizations to meet the development of public health [13, 25, 26] .

Children, woman, and disadvantaged people (e.g., people with low socioeconomic or be socially excluded) are the typical populations who need extraordinary concerns [13, 27] . Community engagement, relying on innovative healthcare delivery embedded in the community, could timely respond to objective and expressed health demands and overall development by reducing alienation from society for the vulnerable members [59] . In Africa, the continent suffering from serious health issues, strengthening weak ties to community groups and institutions does facilitate obtaining information and resources and linking to opportunities. This significantly improves the underlying determinants of health, such as the environment, agriculture, education, and livelihoods, and then leads to better morbidity, mortality, and health inequalities [27] . Since the planet is all interconnected in terms of health and well-being, there is an urgent call for providing convenient health and other essential services, and protecting the most vulnerable among us based on community engagement, not only for children and women, but also for ethnic minority, indigenous, immigrant communities, and displaced people.",

Significant studies were crowned with achievements in chronic disease, behavioral health problem, prevalence, Malaria, and Ebola. This dimension is the tangible performance evaluation of CEPH due to specific issues. Involving infectious, chronic and mental disease, public health has a broadening scope related to everyone. Engaging community for public health can be considered to be both conceptually distinct but also practically purposeful in its effects. It could not only fight against epidemics in a collaborative manner, but also alleviate psychological disorder (e.g. depression, PTSD) and build interpersonal trust. For chronic diseases, communities might be the gatekeeper, which is responsible for outpatient follow-up and medication guidance for their ill members, and actively conduct interventions to reduce the rate of injury, disability, and mortality of chronic diseases, then improve health status and quality of life [15] . Since resultsbased evaluation is an incentive assessment of a planned, ongoing, or completed intervention, the focuses of final outcome stemmed from CEPH would ensure its relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability. Despite of great progresses, large gaps still exist in the current practice. The lack of systemic design leads to a fragmented situation that various departments independently operate in their own ways. This discordance often brings about duplication of efforts, an exercise in futility, and even a backfire. Inverse care law furtherly distorts the allocation of resources and services resulting in the acute shortage of coverage in the regions that urgently need healthcare on the ground [11, 62] . Formal and informal institutions are not unanimous proponents of the recognition that there is no public health without community supporting [24, 63] . Community engagement mechanism is not mature enough when citizens' rights of participation and supervision are not guaranteed [64] . To show the longitudinal patterns related to the 4O dimensions, a quantitative visualization based on the annual number of publication belonged to each dimension is given in Fig. 9 . The results are familiar with the findings of burst analysis. In the first half of the time, the distribution of 4O is uniform. As people began to focus on to the level of healthcare, scholars are encouraged to pay more attention to new techniques, methods or applications responding to the emerging public health problems. Object and outcome dimensions are evenly consistent. On the contrary, the orientation dimension has the least amount of published articles due to its abstract characteristics. The advancements in orientation would have a bearing on foundations of CEPH.",

Urgent calls from practitioners, policymakers, and researchers have been to engage members of the communities [6, 25] . By enhancing the social and environmental determinants that underpin public health, engaging communities alleviates social, economic, and demographic inequalities, with the influence eventually felt by all populations [18, 28] . Academic progresses on CEPH provide theoretical and technical guidances on community engagement as well as independent assessments of its health effects. The evidence is clear that interventions by community engagement have serious implications for our health, wellbeing, and the evolution of organized society. Its direct effects result from proximal surveillance, instant response, accurate information, convenient services delivery, and improved intervention efficacy [11] . The impacts of community engagement will also be mediated through less direct pathways, including changing health behaviors, building trust, strengthening social capital, and reducing inequalities [10, 27] . Although many of these effects are already identified, the absence of elaborate community engagement strategy will potentially amplify existing global public health challenges. Typically, the lagging community engagement does not perfectly work for much of the world's population in terms of providing an integrated, synergistic response to COVID-19. People, with limited cognition on community engagement, often only rely on assistance from community residents or communal general practitioners. Insufficient training in up-to-date healthcare knowledge constrains the prevention of complicated situations. The traditional interventions confined to health facilities only offered faint glimmers without implementation within communities. Thus, engaging local communities needs the highest priority and skilled social worker and community staff have to be better integrated in response teams since it would be inevitable that responding to public health issues in diverse environments will become more common. Equally essential, therefore, will be an improved understanding of challenging operational contexts among affected communities and external responders alike [11] .",

A good many of scholars and institutions have made significant contributions to the scientific advances in CEPH over the period 1980-2020 that have been brought to light. By a bibliometric analysis on a sample of 1102 relevant publications and their 15,116 references, this study tries to draw the outline of the global review on the latest research and that of newly emerging topics of CEPH. The evolution trajectory, based on the quantity of literature, geographical and periodical distribution, national comprehensive strength, journal distribution, productive authors and institutions as well as category, citations, keyword cooccurrence, and co-citation analysis, is drawn to present research hotspots, valuable ideas, and developing tendency of CEPH in a global context.",

Most of the research is carried out in North American and European countries, and African countries occasionally get involved. The advancements of CEPH are marked by historically momentous public health events and evolved from macroscopic strategies to mesoscopic and microscopic actions. A four-dimension framework (orientation, object, operation, and outcome), due to the clustering pattern, is proposed to facilitate a better understanding of the current global achievements and an elaborate structuring of developments in the future.
