Due to its high infectivity and morbidity, WHO has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The sheer scale and severity of this pandemic is unprecedented in the modern era. At present, COVID-19 has affected more than 200 countries, and the newly confirmed case is increasing everyday [2]. This disease has devastated the economy, presents a significant challenge to the healthcare system worldwide. According to the literature, the impact of COVID-19 in some medical specialities are also very evident. Lisi and his coworkers reported that COVID-19 has resulted in a major reduction in the colorectal surgical caseload in Italy [12] . Thompson et al. pointed that their daily endoscopy volume was cut by over 80% and ambulatory endoscopy practice was closed in Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School [13] . To date, COVID-19 outbreak has come into resuming period in China, routine medical activities begin to return to normal. After experienced massive pressure fighting against the virus, we have the extra time to estimate the losses in the field of GI endoscopy during COVID-19 outbreak period.",

Our results showed that there was a dramatic decrease of GI procedures and participants getting training related to COVID-19 outbreak. The remarkable reduction in endoscopic activities can be due to the following reasons: (i) The practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of towns restricted people for reference to the superior hospital in another city. (ii) Endoscopists and nurses were relocated to other departments to assist with COVIDpositive patients, such as intensive care unit or emergency ward. So there would be a lack of endoscopic unit personnel. (iii) Several recommendations and guidance worldwide called to limit endoscopic procedures to urgent endoscopic interventions and deferral of elective non-urgent endoscopic procedures.",

As the highest-risk areas overwhelmed by the pandemic, Hubei province, had the most losses ratio of procedures (the volume in 2020 is a fifth of that in 2019). The reason was all electives in these regions were canceled, most medical resources were allocated to deal with the COVID-19 cases, and the available limited resources were devoted to only emergency therapeutic procedures. Another interesting finding is that Beijing had the highest number of reduced procedures, although the epidemic situation there was not severe. The reason for that is not difficult to understand. Beijing is the capital and political center of China, so prevention and control measures of COVID-19 there are much more strict than other regions in China. Not only were the endoscopic activities limited but large numbers of immigration workers to this city were restricted, which means the number of patients decreased.",

Our results also indicated that participants of various endoscopic training declined drastically. The classical teaching models, lectures, seminars, hand-on-hand teaching and others are no longer safe and applicable in times of the pandemic. Implementation of alternative learning strategies, such as telemedicine, tele-mentoring of procedure, are warranted to mitigate adverse effects on endoscopists' training.",

In northern Italy, Repici reported SARS-CoV-2 infection among nurses and physicians was confirmed in 12 endoscopy units, and six endoscopy personnel (three nurses and three physicians) required hospitalization [15] . Several organizations and societies have issued guidelines and position papers to instruct safe GI endoscopy practice during the pandemic [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The CSDE also issued guidance for endoscopic examinations on Feb 3, 2020 [10], which elaborated specific recommendations for endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to recommendations from other societies, proper use of personal protective equipment, risk stratification of patients, reduced normal endoscopic activities, postponing procedures, modified the waiting room, standardized reprocessing procedure for flexible endoscopes and others were written in the guidance. Due to high adherence to the above recommendations by CSDE, there was no endoscopy-related COVID-19 nosocomial infections reported in our study. In addition to the strict and standardized workflow needed in clinical practice, some emerging endoscopic devices can also play an important role in preventing virus transmission. A novel non-contact magnetically-controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) system has been recently developed to avoid the direct contact between doctors and patients for upper endoscopic examination [16] . Furthermore, a disposable endoscope can have particular advantage. An ultrathin disposable endoscope has been applied for detection of upper gastrointestinal diseases, and shown excellent outcomes comparable to that of conventional endoscopes [17, 18] .",

So it is necessary to conduct study to understand the psychological stress status of endoscopists and nurses in future.
