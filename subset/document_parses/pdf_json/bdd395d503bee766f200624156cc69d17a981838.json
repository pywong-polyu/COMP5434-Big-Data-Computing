            "text": "COVID-19 belongs to Coronaviridae family and was identified in December 2019; since then, it has been spread to more than 200 countries worldwide, raising widespread fear and anxiety among people, particularly high-risk groups (1) . Scientists across the globe are strictly working on the different aspects of the disease, including mechanisms of transmission, clinical spectrum, new diagnostic approach, and prevention and treatment strategies to reduce the concerns about this disease (2, 3) . However, the recent sharp rise of mortality rates and claims of the national and abroad experts regarding Iran's lack of preparedness for COVID-19 epidemic have caused increasing anxiety and panic among the Iranian community. On the other hand, the unknown nature of the disease has worsened the situation in Iran. However, the anxiety caused by this disease harms people even more than the Coronavirus itself (4). In an outbreak, people may be frightened for their own health or their family members', which may have negative effects on their sleep or dietary patterns, concentration, and may even lead to chronic health problems. In some cases, it even increases the use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs (5) . Therefore, anxiety in reaction to COVID-19 may cause great harm to people and can lead to some implications which raise more concerns than the Coronavirus itself. In many cases, these people look for different sources of information to ease anxiety and uncertainty and easily access the stimulating news. Due to the spread of the Coronavirus in Iran and the importance of fear in the society, the present study investigated the perceived stress of COVID-19 disease in different groups in the society.",

The study population included all individuals living in Iran. The perceived stress scale developed by Cohen et al (1983) was used to collect data. This scale includes 14 questions and the scores range from 0 to 4 on the Likert scale: 0 (never), 1 (rarely), 2 (sometimes), 3 (most often), and 4 (always) (6) . In the demographic part, questions regarding fear symptoms and risk groups reported on the WHO website were used (7) . People were also asked where they mostly get information on the new ______________________________ Corresponding author: Dr Amjad Mohamadi Bolbanabad, a.mohammadib@muk.ac.ir cases, mortality, and disease control tips. To investigate the source of information, people were placed in the 2 groups: (1) people who got information from official and valid sources, including the national television channels, Medical University channels, Health care Channels, and other official channels; (2) people who got their information from social and invalid networks, including Instagram pages, Telegram channels/ groups, satellite channels, and other unofficial channels. Eight researchers collected data (information that was sent to participants in 2 weeks) electronically through email, mobile SMS, Facebook, Instagram direct, WhatsApp direct, and Telegram groups. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, t test, and multiple linear logistic model to examine the relationship between different variables and the rate of Coronavirus fear based on the source of information.",

Also, the perceived stress among individuals with cumulative trauma disorders caused by upper extremity trauma was 23.9\u00b17.1 (6) . Therefore, high stress scores in a community can make it vulnerable to the disease (8) .

Consistent with our findings, the results of the study of Gao et al (2019) in China showed that the prevalence of mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, is correlated with higher exposure to social networks (9) . However, some studies showed that social networks have had a significant role in informing and increasing the perceived risk of the community at the time of the MERS epidemic (6, 8) . The media is a source for triggering anxiety because of their emphasis on bad news. In other words, the media have repeatedly emphasized the rapid spread of the disease and unavailability of treatment. Therefore, limiting the exposure to media, especially those that disseminate inaccurate or unreliable information and providing credible and reliable information to individuals, especially those who feel vulnerable is of paramount importance. Moreover, considering community stress management measures during epidemics, such as COVID-19, along with other preventive and therapeutic interventions, is highly recommended. ",
