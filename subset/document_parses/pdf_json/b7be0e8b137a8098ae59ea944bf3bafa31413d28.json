Our objective was to estimate and understand the psychosocial barriers to the medical students' well-being at the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Marrakesh (FMPM) by evaluating their coping strategies, difficulties and needs. Methods: We conducted a mixed method study among pregraduate medical students. For the quantitative part, we did a cross-sectional study using an online four-part self-administered questionnaire. We compared Likert scales of perceived wellbeing before and one year after the lockdown. The scales ranged from 0 (very low state of well-being) to 10 (complete state of well-being). Coping strategies were assessed by the Brief-COPE questionnaire. The qualitative perspective was a case-study with semi-structured interviews using an interview guide based on the literature review. Finally, a one-phase triangulation analysis, underlined by a convergence model, was done. Results: We had 355 participants for the quantitative part (participation rate of 16.6%). The mean age was 19.2\u00b11.6. The female/male sex ratio was 1.8. The first cycle students represented 76%. The well-being mean state was better before than after the pandemic (7.8 vs 5.4; P<0.001). The main coping strategy was the acceptance of the situation (5.8\u00b11.7). According to the students, their principal need for promoting their well-being at the faculty was having courses about technologies for studies (89.3%). For the qualitative part, we interviewed 16 students. Thirteen had a decline of their well-being after the lockdown. Isolation and adaptation to e-learning were the principal difficulties. However, mainly, they adopted engaging in coping strategies. Conclusion: The medical students' well-being decreased since the COVID-19 pandemic. Students adopting coping strategies were in the best well-being state. Psychosocial and solutionbased measures should be put in place at the FMPM to foster the students' well-being. Michaud S et al.

The World Health Organization issued several proposals for communities to better manage and contain the virus (1) . Morocco was no exception to the rule (2) and decreed drastic emergency measures. Many changes happened on the daily basis for Moroccans like a three-month lockdown, social distancing and sanitation measures, outing or travel restrictions (3) . The balance of the socio-environmental and health system present before the crisis were severely disrupted in many areas (4) . Vulnerable people are particularly sensitive to changes that have emerged since the beginning of the pandemic. There are strong social and health inequities among them and in comparison to the general population (5) . Medical students belong to an at-risk group (6) and variables such as having a low income (7) , and social distancing from relatives or being under a high stress level (8) can disturb their overall well-being. Also, they often represent a health resource person for their entourage which can add a significant psychosocial burden (9) . This pandemic disturbed the training methods for aspiring doctors, too. Not only the universities and the student housings did close but the internships were also canceled. Medical students had only online courses (10) . These new experiences could be challenging for them. The main hypothesis of the study was that there are multidimensional psychosocial barriers to have good health, which undermine medical students' well-being in Marrakesh (11) . We supposed that there are inappropriate coping strategies among them to cope with difficulties encountered in their new daily activities, especially for the new online digital education methods, the change in social interactions and their role as healthcare professionals in the context of the pandemic. The objective of this study was to estimate the wellbeing level of the pre-graduate medical students in Marrakesh since the onset of the health crisis due to COVID-19 during 2021, and identify their needs and expectations for having a better psychosocial well-being. Also, we wanted to learn their coping strategies to cope with their daily challenges.",

It included 5 single choice questions to know their gender, age, education level, marital and socioeconomic status, and origin. If the students weren't Moroccan, they had to write the name of their home country. The second section covered the topic of the changes in the teaching methods to estimate the impact of the educational changes on the well-being. This part had 8 questions including single choice questions and Likert scales questions to evaluate the quality and satisfaction of the online education ranging from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent). The third part had 6 questions related to the well-being of the students. The 2 first questions focused on evaluating the students' perceived wellbeing. We used Likert scales for estimating the well-being before the onset of the pandemic and one year after the lockdown episode. The Likert scales had ranges from 0 (very low state of wellbeing) to 10 (complete state of well-being). The participants chose the number which suited them the best to define their perceived well-being so that we could have the mean degree of well-being before the lockdown and the mean degree of wellbeing one year after the lockdown according to the students themselves. The other 4 questions were multiple choice questions to investigate factors related to 1) the environment for studies that could be improved at the medical school, 2) the need of individual skills which could improve the students' well-being, 3) the community measures that could foster the well-being at the FMPM, and 4) the health services which could be improved at the FMPM. We based our questions on the literature review and particularly on the four actions areas of the Ottawa Charter that are the strength of the community actions, the development of personal skills, the creation of supportive environments and the reorientation of health services. Finally, as a fourth part we used the Brief-COPE questionnaire (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) to measure the different ways to cope with a specific stressful life event (12) ; in our case it was the coping styles adopted by the medical students since the advent of the pandemic. The Brief-COPE has 14 scales which assess the coping strategies utilized by people. The answers are in a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 (I haven't been doing this at all-sometimes-often-all the time). A higher score means a great utilization of a specific coping style. The reliability and validity of the Brief-Cope were established during the initial development of the tool. The reliability of this questionnaire was examined in our study using Cronbach's coefficient alpha. The alpha coefficient of the questionnaire was 0.773. This is considered as an acceptable level (12) .",

On the contrary, the avoidant coping strategies such as the expression of negative emotions were related to a high-perceived stress level and a greater psychological distress. The main difficulties of the students were social isolation and problems to adapt to distance learning. The ones who had most barriers were the 1st cycle students. We can differentiate two main types of coping: avoidance strategies that involve rather passive and potentially negative long-term behaviors regarding the general state of well-being of a person, engagement strategies that involve more active attitudes to problem solving. The students with a positive experience and a feeling to grow were the ones who mostly had a good capacity of resilience in adopting engagement-type coping strategies (12) .",

These axes need to be developed even though initial actions are already put in place. To improve resilience in time of major changes it seems central to boost the capacity of the students by giving them enough resources that sustain their psycho-social wellbeing (18) . Their skills in terms of adaptability to their environment should be strengthened (21) to achieve a better well-being state in their everyday life after a period of strong restrictions. Before the pandemic, some countries like China, the UK or the USA created health promoting universities within the Ottawa Charter in order to foster the well-being of the students (22, 23) , 2) An appreciative inquiry to overcome adversity in bringing people together and increase students' engagement with the help of mental health professionals could be a favorable way to input positive changes. 3) Any actions put in place to improve the students 'well-being at the FMPM should be done in a salutogenesis perspective to put efforts on supportive factors and implement innovative psychosocial changes. This concept takes its origin in the health psychology field. It is about focusing on the protective factors, which could improve the well-being rather than what causes health problems (24, 25) .",

To cope with this special situation, medical schools should support the students and encourage psychological and socio-environmental supports via, for instance, the promotion of student clubs or the development of a sponsorship program to foster the communication between peers. Indeed, it seems essential to strengthen community actions for students. Concerning the development of personal skills useful for studies, they appear to be the main components to focus on to promote medical students' well-being at the FMPM. This means solution-based actions such as workshops on how to manage stress or how to be wellorganized for distance learning. In short, actions need to be taken at the FMPM in order to foster the overall well-being of the medical students of Marrakesh based on a socioecological approach.",
