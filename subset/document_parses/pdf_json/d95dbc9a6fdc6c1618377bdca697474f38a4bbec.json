Knowledge of Risk messages (most encouraging) were 2.9 times more likely to be selected as encouraging handwashing than Comfort messages (least encouraging).

Historically hand hygiene is poor with as little as 19% of the global population thought to wash their hands after using toilet facilities (Freeman et al., 2014) . In response to the Covid-19 pandemic there has been an increased emphasis on handwashing in both national and international campaigns (e.g. Department of Health and Social Care, 2020), but it is not known which campaigns have been effective. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) are considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of handwashing campaigns. However, RCTs are expensive to run. Furthermore, it is impracticable to test multiple variations of a campaign (Judah et al., 2009) . In this paper, we explore a novel approach to evaluating handwashing messages prior to their implementation in campaigns.",

(2009) study found that for most constructs, there was a small but significant increase in soap consumption. Knowledge Activation, Knowledge of Risk and Positive Control messages were particularly effective for women. Disgust and Norm messages were particularly effective for men. Judah et al. (2009) suggest women may have reacted differently because the mention of germs in the knowledgebased messages may have prompted a disgusted response. Therefore, it could be that messages are not eliciting the response that the message designer intended to provoke, and that people's reactions vary depending upon their past experiences and other factors. This is further evident as the effectiveness of the two messages within a construct varied, particularly for Comfort and Social Norms. In a study of healthcare workers, Taylor (2017) found that the effectiveness of different message strategies varied depending on their execution. Images are likely to provoke more emotional reactions compared with text which provokes more rational, logical and linear thought (Joffe, 2008) but their role in communicating hand hygiene is not well understood.",

The others were omitted because in some instances it was difficult to find images to illustrate the connotation of the message (e.g. for the knowledge activation message \"Wsah your hands wiht soap\" the recipient must descramble the words and there is no obvious image that could support this knowledge activation), and because using the full seven seemed very likely to induce participant fatigue. For each of the four theoretical constructs the two messages used in the original study were reproduced verbatim. Additionally, each message was illustrated using three types of images: literal, diagrammatic and metaphorical ( Figure 1 ). The rationale for the three types of image was that each image type, when anchored by the text, operates at a different level of meaning and requires different levels of cognitive processing. The literal image illustrates broadly the subject of the message and only requires basic recognition. The diagrammatic message requires recognising the connection between literal elements and illustrates the contents of the message specifically. The metaphorical message requires making more novel and dramatic connections between the visual elements and the viewer's experiences in the world. It illustrates the contents of the message specifically but attempts to add further realworld associations. A within-subjects design was employed with the message order rotated for each participant. Thus, each participant viewed every message but in a different order so the results can be attributed to the message viewed and not the order of messages.",

Combining images with text has been used to effectively communicate hand hygiene to primary school children (age 4-11) (Rutter et al., 2020) . Further work could usefully be done to identify what images people find disgusting/pleasing in a post-Covid-19 setting and how this might vary by cultural context. Some images used during later Covid-19 campaigns relied heavily on emotional triggers for their impact (Owen, 2021) . For instance, a campaign (by Freuds for PHE, UK) launched in January 2021 featured dark close-up shots of Covid patients anchored by emotive text such as 'Look her in the eyes and tell her you never bend the rules' (Owen, 2021) . A public information campaign from the UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC, 2020) featured solarised/infrared images of hands touching green germ-filled handles in an attempt to use disgust as a trigger. Though it is unclear how effective these approaches have been, such emotive images would clearly benefit from prior testing using techniques described above.",
