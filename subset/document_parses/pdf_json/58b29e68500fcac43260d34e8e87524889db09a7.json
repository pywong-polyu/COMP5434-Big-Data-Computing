However, considering the risk of recurrent nasal bleeding and the benefit of embolization procedure, sinosal mass excision was scheduled with priority. Plan for open resection was kept standby. The excision was successful by an Endoscopic approach. Intraoperatively the lesion was highly vascular despite the embolization procedure, leading to blood loss and fall of hemoglobin to 6 gm/dl. This warranted several blood transfusions to the patient over next few days. These findings further supported VM. Apart from blood transfusion, the post-operative period was unremarkable and there was no nasal bleed or melena. On enquiry the patient denied any symptoms related to renal malignancy, both currently and in past (Figs. 2, 3, 4) . Histopathological study of the sinus mass revealed finding of metastatic lesion of Renal cell carcinoma. The report was unexpected for a maxillary mass presenting with features of typical VM and patient not having any renal symptomatology.

When an underlying hyper vascular mass is detected in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, the differentials can vary from an angiofibroma, hemangiopericytoma, hemangioma, or sinonasalglomus tumors and very rarely a metastatic secondary sinonasal mass [5] . Hemangiomas are lesions characterized by rapid hyper cellular proliferating stage and a slow involution phase. Arterial VM are congenital and grow commensurately with the child. They are characterized by a normal rate of endothelial cell turnover and absence of normal capillary beds [6] . These lesions are usually benign, but in some cases they can be life-threatening because of their potential for intractable bleeding [1] . The most common presenting complaint of VM of the maxillofacial region is chronic intermittent bleeding.",

Approximately 100 cases of maxillary metastases have been reported in literature till now [9] . RCC encompasses a histologically diverse group of solid renal tumors. Clear cell RCC, the most common histologic subtype, upregulates the hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) via loss of function of VHL gene. This increases the function of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), eventually increasing the angiogenesis and vascularity of clear cell RCCs and related metastases. This explains the propensity of sinonasal metastases of RCC for severe nasal bleeding. The spread is hematogenous, by bypassing pulmonary capillary filtration and leading directly to the head and neck region via extensive anastomosis between the avalvular vertebral venous plexus and the intracranial venous plexus [7] or via the classical pathway through the inferior vena cava, lungs, heart, and maxillary artery. The classic pathway can therefore have concurrent lung or brain metastases.",
