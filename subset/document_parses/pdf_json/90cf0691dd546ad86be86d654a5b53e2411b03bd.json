In a large-scale online survey, respondents (N = 1203) watched videos of digital nature, varying in terms of type of nature (wild versus tended nature) and spaciousness. Results show a significant increase of feelings of connectedness to the community after watching digital nature. Furthermore, tended nature scenes elicited more social aspirations than wild nature scenes. A multiple regression model further shows that living further away from nature was a significant predictor for loneliness scores, while number of nature interactions during a week was not. Results of this study confirm the importance of nature interaction for mental and social wellbeing for the general population and stress the potential of digital nature as a complementary strategy. These findings are of particular relevance to those who lack access to nature due to old age and related mobility constraints or a lockdown.",

Likewise, a positive relation has been found between loneliness and perceived distance to public parks and recreational areas [23] : People who experience nature as being closer at hand experience less feelings of loneliness compared to people who experience nature as more distant. Additionally, several studies show that nearby nature is positively correlated with feelings of connectedness and, in line with aforementioned study, reduces feelings of loneliness, while there was no such correlation with number of nature visits [24, 25] . Additionally, nearby nature has a mediating role in the effect of social connectedness (i.e., the number of social contacts in the last week) on subjective wellbeing. In other words, respondents who scored low on social connectedness still reported high subjective wellbeing when they lived in an area with access to green space [25] .",

Additionally, wild and less predictable nature is often more mysterious [9, 32, 33] , more fascinating [15] and provides a greater sense of \"being away.\" Research shows that wild forest scenes (displaying dense forest vegetation) had the largest restorative effect compared to other scenes varying in terms of wildness and density [34] .",

Nature experience thus has the potential to elicit awe and stimulate pro-social behaviours. Furthermore, since experienced vastness is an antecedent of awe, it could be expected that spacious landscapes elicit more awe than dense landscapes, and that they trigger a more collective mind-set (in line with [15] ).",

Findings show that living far away from nature was a predictor of loneliness scores, while number of nature interactions during a week was not, which is in line with previous findings [13, 24, 52] . As such, the results of the present study confirm findings from only a very limited amount of studies that assessed the relationship between nearby nature and loneliness explicitly. Other significant predictors for loneliness scores, such as living alone and being unmarried, are also in line with previous findings [53] .",

When asked about the videos, only a small number of respondents actually mentioned the lockdown, whereas many respondents mentioned feeling relaxed after experiencing the digital nature videos or generally describing the experience as pleasant. Digital nature might also be used when weather conditions render a walk in nature less pleasant or for mediation and mindfulness purposes, as suggested by both previous research [35] , and by comments from our participants. So, digital nature is not only of value for people with restricted access to nature or mobility restrictions but can complement outdoor experience in several ways.",

Additionally in the lab experiment, a large presentation setup with a broad video resolution (32 \u00d7 9) was used to enhance immersion [19] . We aimed to control for screen size by asking respondents to watch the videos full screen and asked them afterwards if they managed to do so. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that participants did not deviate from our instructions. Additionally, screen size (for which we could not control) might influence immersion and arguably the perception of vastness in particular.",
