            "text": "Background: Starting from February 2020, in Italy most organizations have had a forced transition to flexible working practice -called \"smart working in emergency\" -due to the Covid-19 epidemic outbreak. This allowed to continue work activities and services and contributed to contain the risk of infection in different sectors, particularly in the public administration. Objectives: This follow up study focussed on a panel of 187 workers from the Italian Workers' Compensation Authority taking part to a pilot project \"Smart Working in INAIL\" from January 2019 to December 2019. The aim was to investigate the effects of work organization on work attitudes, work-life balance and health outcomes before and after the introduction of the smart working. Methods: The data were collected at two time points through a web-based questionnaire. The first wave aimed to collect information up to one month before the implementation of the smart working. The second wave aimed to collect information about potential changes occurred after one year of smart working. Results: This study showed that high demands, low control and low social support might lead to reduced well-being and less satisfaction with work, and have an effect on work engagement and work-life balance. Particularly, improving social support can moderate the negative impact of high strain on well-being, preventing work-life imbalance and risk of isolation.",

            "text": "Starting from February 2020, in Italy most organizations have had a forced transition to flexible working practice as they had to introduce remote work for full or part of the working week due to the Covid-19 epidemic outbreak, in most cases without any prior preparation or adaptation phase. The use of remote work at home allowed continuing work ac-tivities, preserving productivity, and avoiding the interruption of several public services through the employment of over 70% of public personnel working from home in the course of the lockdown. Flexible work is not a new concept (1) but this emergency has grown the debate on its future implementations since it has highlighted several benefits in the public administration too. Nevertheless, the everyday remote work at home, broadly in use in the public admin-142 istration during the emergency, leads to some concerns as those related to the 24h connection, the risk of isolation or the living together with other people working or studying from home and the intensification of work activity (1) . This requires improving investigation on the effects of different types of flexible work arrangements to inform stakeholders and organizations, and to provide effective policies and interventions in the field of health and safety. In 2019, in Italy 570 thousand workers benefited from smart working for some days a week, and this represents a 20% increase compared to the previous year 1 . This means that several organizations -including public administrations -were already slowly starting to offer flexible work solutions to their workers before the Covid-19 emergency. One of the main drivers came from the introduction of flexible work regulation into the legislative framework on the improvement of the public administration 2 . Thanks to the flexible work, workers can organize their work flexibly and decide, in most cases, their work schedule, when and where they work for some days per week.",

            "text": "Flexible work is a multidimensional concept used as an umbrella term including any arrangement leading to an alteration in terms of time and/ or place that work is done on a regular basis. This may include flexibility in: work schedule (flex time, compressed week), amount of hours worked (part time, job sharing), place and space (working at home, remote work, telecommuting, co-working). Smart working is a new term -particularly used in Italy -that refers to the use of working in flexible space and time for some days per week. Most of the studies on smart working are Italian and published in 2020 (<20 studies on Pubmed using the key term \"Smart working\", out of them 14 are from Italy and published in 2020), as these are particularly related to the working at home typical of the Covid-19 emergency period (2, 3, 4) . Previous studies focused mainly on the benefits of flexible work arrangements for productivity (5) , but also on their impact on work processes and workers' attitudes and well-being (1, 6) . Nevertheless, findings on relationships between flexible work and attitudes, wellbeing and health were not completely conclusive and extremely linked to the way flexibility is applied (1). Formal and occasional use of flexibility has been positively associated with workers' work engagement (7), psychophysical health and well-being (8, 9) . Workers likely are more engaged and satisfied when flexible work arrangements allow them more control over work processes, enhance their autonomy and facilitate efficient communication between co-workers (10, 7). It is well known that increasing employees' control and social support at work should improve well-being (1, 9, 11) . Thus, it is likely that those flexible work arrangements increasing workers' control and autonomy on work schedule have a positive effect on different health outcomes (12, 7) . Nevertheless, some aspects of work organization might have a negative impact also on the use of flexible work arrangements, such as lacking of perceived supervisor support and high workload (12) . As for the effects on work-life balance, findings are controversial (13) . Generally, flexible work arrangements lead to a better work-life balance and this has a positive mediating role in reducing stress and increasing workers' job satisfaction, well-being and work retain (14) . Nevertheless, some studies showed that home-based teleworkers and employees working most of the time at home did not necessarily experience a better work-life balance (15) . This is likely because work and family domains are mutually incompatible in some respects, and family interference with work may emerge in everyday work from home. This could be particularly true in remote work engaging workers all workweek long.",

Moreover, they focused on the associations with flexible work with some dimensions and outcomes related to the working conditions. The purpose of this study is to provide a contribution to the investigation of the effects of flexible work overtime on different psychosocial aspects of work and their potential impacts on outcomes related to health and wellbeing, to inform policy and health and safety practice on its positive aspects and prevent the negative ones. Thus, this aimed to examine whether the use of smart working for one day per week for 12 months might change the perceptions of working conditions and relative impacts to attitudes towards work, health and wellbeing. Particularly, in a unique study we investigated the role of smart working in improving job attitudes, health and wellbeing, and the effects of some changes in aspects of the work organization, such as social support at work, demands and workload, autonomy and clarity of role on outcomes after one year of flexible work. This study focused on a panel of workers from a public administration. This is a sector where flexible work is starting to acquire more importance and thus it is required to investigate most effective ways of applying it in terms of health protection and improvement of working conditions. Moreover, this study has the value added of using a longitudinal approach to verify the existence of changes in relationships among the aspects investigated and the outcomes after one year of smart working experience. Most of the previous studies examined the effects of flexible working conditions on health adopting a cross-sectional design, which does not enable exploration of causality (12) . In particular, we analyzed the influence of work organization on work engagement, work-life balance, general health, wellbeing and work satisfaction over time to investigate changes emerged by moving from the engagement in ordinary work (5 days per week at the office) to flexible space and time job one day per week for 12 months.",

The purpose of the pilot project was to monitor and test the use of flexible work in a small group in view of extending this practice into the organization in the future. Criteria of involvement in the pilot project are based on the adaptability of work activities to flexible work and the skills in using information and communication technologies and tools offered by the organizations.

Therefore the Short version of Indicator Tool is a synthetic measurement tool for psychosocial risks assessment that can be used in working condition surveys. A validation study on this short version is underway. Change: (3 items; \u03b1 T0=0.69; \u03b1 T1=0.73): this assesses the extent to which changes happened into the organization are managed and communicated to the workers. According to the aims of the study, we included an additional item to the dimension Change to investigated aspects related to the attitude of the management towards the innovation (\"The management of my organization encourages an innovative mindset\"). Introducing this aspect informs us about how a change in the way of working, as the one introduced through the smart working, is welcomed and encouraged into the organization. We believe this improves the dimension including innovation as an aspect of organizational change to be considered in the changing world of work (23) . To check the value added and the reliability of this new item into the dimension Change, we estimated the internal consistency of the scale with and without this additional item through the Cronbach's alpha. We verified an improvement in the scale (from \u03b1=0.69 to \u03b1= 0.72) that allowed us to include this item.",

Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for independent study variables and smart working satisfaction. In particular, 90.9% of the respondents are very much or extremely satisfied with the smart working experience and only 1.1% are not at all satisfied. Seventy-nine percent of the study population was composed by females (No. = 147), 52.9% had a post-degree education (No. = 99) and 30% was unmarried (No. = 56). In respect to job positions, the administrative and technical staff made up 84.4% of the participants, only 0.8% are managers and 14.3% are professionals (for example researchers, physicians). Table 2 shows descriptive statistics and paired sample t-test for the study variables. Based on the results of the paired sample t-test, significant changes between time 0 and time 1 are observed for \"work demands interfere with home and family life\", \"family demands interfere with work-related duties\" and \"job satisfaction\" (p<0.05). All the three variables report a decrease of the mean value from time 0 to time 1. Table 3 shows the four most significant random effect models that have been analyzed to offer an analysis of relationships among the variables over time. We need to consider that the coefficients include both the within-time and between-subject effects. In this case, the coefficients represent the average effect of an independent variable over the dependent variable when the independent variable changes across time and between subjects by one-unit. All the significant effects are reported as follows. \"Demands\" are positively and statistically significant associated with \"Demands of my work interfere with my home and family life\" and negatively with \"Well-being\" (Table 3) . Moreover, additional models reported in Table 4 (Appendix A), suggest that a one-unit growth in \"Demands\" results a decrease of 0.70 in perceived \"Well-being\" (p<0.05). Higher \"Demands\" are also positively associated with higher \"Demands of my family or partner interfere with my work-related duties\"(increase of (Table 4 ). A better clarity of \"Role\" within the organization determines a higher \"Work engagement\" (an increase of 0.27 p=.00 for one-unit growth in Role) and an increase of \"Job satisfaction\" (0.42 p=0.00). A good management and communication of \"Change\" within the organization induces a higher \"Job satisfaction\" (in-crease of 0.36, p=0.00). In addition, the third model in Table 3 indicates that an one unit increase in \"Change\" determine an increase of \"Well-being\" (1.46, p=0.00). Finally, changes in \"Managerial Support\" and \"Peer Support\" determine a more positive \"Work engagement\" (respectively an increase of 0.17, p=0.00 and of 0.17, p<0.05). Additional models are reported in Table 4 . Most of them are not significant except \"Control\" over work that is positively and significantly associated with the opinion that smart working simplifies their private life (increase of 0.19, p=0.01).",

This experience has spread a debate among institutions, academics, stakeholders and policy makers on the future implementation of flexible work arrangements in terms of opportunities, benefits, and weaknesses. Nevertheless, we must consider flexible work solutions adopted during the epidemiological emergency completely extraordinary and characterized by some critical aspects due to the need of working at home most or all days a week, such as the risk of isolation, the sharing of spaces and technological tools with others (partners, children), the growing interferences among work and family duties. To identify effective solutions for the future application of flexibility at work, in the view of employees' wellbeing and organizations' productivity, it is needed to consider changes in impacts from standard to different flexible work solutions, beyond the forced narrowing of home-work boundaries linked to the current emergency. This study examined the effects of flexible space and time job for one day a week in a panel of workers from the public administration and allows a comparison in working conditions, attitudes towards work and impacts on health and wellbeing between the standard work and 12-month flexible work arrangements overtime. Moreover, this longitudinal study differed to the most previous ones in this field adopting longitudinal design that allows to verifying changes in impacts from the standard work to the flexible work (12) . Some of our findings corroborated evidence from the literature and allowed to identify solutions and best practices to be applying in moving to flexible work.",

In line with the JDCS model, higher managerial and peer support determine an increase on workers' engagement, indeed help, support and resources provided by line managers and colleagues have shown to lead to a greater engagement with work. In case of changes introduced into the organization, a good sharing and a clear communication from the management were found to be linked to an increase in job satisfaction.

Accordingly, finding strategies for improving social support plays a crucial role in flexible work since it seems to moderate the negative impact of high strain on well-being, work attitudes and work life balance, the last particularly for women. This might be particularly important in view of increasing the days of space and time flexible jobs that may increase the risk of isolation or decrease the sense of commitment with the organization. In such cases, preventive actions aiming to reinforce the social support at work are suggested as enforcing the occasion of virtual meetings and support, providing regular feedbacks on activities and improving tools for sharing information and documents.",

In the view of keeping the positive aspects of flexibility, it is therefore necessary to improve the understanding of potential impacts in moving to flexible work arrangements on workers' health and productivity. In this regard, a further wave of investigation (time 2currently ongoing) will analyze changes introduced by smart working in emergency to identify eventual critical issues related to working at home for a large number of days. Among the others, some aspects could suffer a worsening as the days of working flexibility increase as the narrowing of the boundaries between private and working life, the risk of social isolation and lack of organizational support. A further aspect to be analyzed is the impact of information and communication technology on working conditions and workers' well-being. During the emergency, digitalization processes on work activities have been accelerated. This has required a rapid development of digital skills, enhancement of information technology equipment, and massive use of social and networking technologies that allow for continuous availability and connection. One of the main consequences of the potential negative impacts of the intensive use of technology at work is technostress (37, 38, 39) , defined as a \"disease of adaptation caused by an inability to cope with the new computer technologies in a healthy man-ner\" (40) . Since ICT and networking platforms are strictly necessary in flexible work, future studies will also take into consideration the potential impacts of technology on the psychophysical health of workers and on expectations and perceptions of 24h workers' availability. As explained above, smart working in emergency represents an extraordinary way of distance work that encompasses several critical aspects associated to the remote work all workweek long. Our findings offered reflections on changes and impacts of the introduction of flexible work arrangements that can provide some suggestions to manage future implementation of flexible work in similar public administration (e.g. for 2 or 3 days a week and/or on jobs characterized by specific activities).",

Given the growing number of workers using smart working during the epidemiological emergency, this issue currently assumed great relevance for the OSH and organizational productivity implications. In Italy, research on flexible work arrangements and their implications on the quality of working conditions has acquired a central role during the emergency. This experience lead the government to promote forms of flexibility at work even after the current epidemiological emergency, especially in the public administration. The role of flexibility on innovation in work processes is now recognized, not only in the light of promoting work-life balance, but also for fostering productivity, sustainability and cost effectiveness in organizations. Above all, this requires the introduction of organizational models focusing on autonomy, goal setting, smart communication and flexible job schedule. At the same time, it is necessary to identify potential risks connected to the changes introduced by smart working through prospective studies, in order to improve workers' health and safety protection. The Italian Ministry of Public Administration confirmed the need to identify preventive and organizational measures for workers when smart working was applied in the public administration during the implementing smart working in public administration: a follow up study 151 epidemiological emergency 8 . Among others, it also highlighted the need to invest in worker training to deal with the digital transformation of work and to create specific skills also by addressing psychosocial risks related to the intensive use of technology. Due to the potential negative effects connected to the intensive and pervasive use of technology at work, a scientific and political debate is in progress to identify effective measures for workers health, to prevent technostress and to protect the workers' right to disconnect, namely the right of workers not to be constantly available.",
