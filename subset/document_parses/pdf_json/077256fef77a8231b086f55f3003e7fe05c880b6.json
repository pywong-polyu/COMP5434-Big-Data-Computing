It is shown that the concentration of viruses in the exhaled cloud can increase to infectious levels with time, in a confined space where the air recirculates. The model is used to analyze the air-flow and SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus build-up in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China [17, 16] . It is concluded that the outbreak of Covid-19 in the restaurant in January 2020, is due to the build-up of the airborne droplets and aerosols carrying the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus and could not have been prevented by standard air-conditioning.",

It is believed that the most common form of transmission is by respiratory droplets containing the coronavirus. These droplets were classically divided into heavier droplets that settle at a limited distance around the infected individual and aerosols (or droplet nuclei) that can remain airborn for an extended period and are convected by air inside confined spaces. The more recent scientific understanding is more nuanced. The pathogen-containing droplet can be carried by a turbulent cloud, emitted when the infected person coughs or sneezes.",

As discussed in [20] this increased concentration may spread by air-conditioning ducts from one confined space to another. The remedy is to greatly increase the effectiveness of the air-conditioning, see [20] , or create a through flow through the confined space that washes the droplet/aerosols away. Applying such methods in confined spaces such as restaurants, offices, buses and classrooms, may dramatically decrease the contagion rates.",

In the Lagrangian frame of reference the observer travels with the flow and make his measurements in this traveling frame of reference. The mathematical description in the Eulerian frame is the conventional Navier-Stokes equation, but in the Lagrangian frame it is the Navier-Stokes equation with the material derivative Du DT = \u2202u \u2202t + u \u00b7 \u2207u where the time variable T is the Lagrangian time, u is the fluid velocity and t the Eulerian time.

We want to travel with (in the frame of reference of) the turbulent cloud and see how the droplet/aerosols interact with the cloud and each other. We want to determine if and where the droplet/aerosols settle on the ground or on surfaces, or if they remain airborn. In the latter case, we want to determine to what destinations they are carried by the turbulent flow of air. The strength of the turbulence in the flow is given by the dimensionless Reynolds number Re = uL \u03bd , where L is a typical spacial dimension of the flow and \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity.

The Kolmogorov-Obukhov theory determines the scaling laws in Lagrangian turbulence, for small \u03c4, S p \u223cC p (\u03b5\u03c4) p/2 , see [19, 18] , where \u03b5 is the dissipation rate in the flow, andC p are constants, that are not universal, but depend on the configuration of the flow. In particular, for p = 2, we get S 2 \u223cC 2 \u03b5\u03c4, see [23] . Although the Lagrangian turbulent flow follows these scaling laws for \u03c4 sufficiently small, it quickly deviates from the predicted scaling exponents and approaches values of the scaling exponents that are more similar to their values in Eulerian turbulence [23] . In between, there is a \"passover\" interval where the values of the exponents dip significantly below either their initial or eventual values, see [23] . From a physical standpoint it is reasonably well understood what is going on. Initially, the mixing processes in Lagrangian turbulence cause the droplets to separate in a \"super-diffusion\" much faster than usual diffusion and obeying the Richardsson 4/3 law [21] . It says that the diffusivity is proportional to \u03b5r 4/3 = \u03b5\u03c4 2 , where r is the distance between the droplets. But later the turbulent eddies in the Richardson cascade have developed, as they they do in Eulerian turbulence, see [5] , the droplets are entrained by these eddies and this leads to a slower diffusivity. However, the diffusivity is still much larger than in ordinary diffusion. The problem is that how you pass from one region, measured by r, \"the Lagrangian\" to the other \"the Eulerian\" is still not very well understood. This has blocked theoretical progress in Lagrangian turbulence. In other words, when describing droplet distribution, you cannot stay with the pure Lagrangian description, even at moderate separations r between droplets, you have to mix the Lagrangian with the Eulerian description.",

The part of the restaurant where the contagion took place is of dimensions 6 meters length and 3 meters width, see Figure 1 . Air-conditioners are set so that the restaurant guest experience wind air blowing at the velocity of 0.25 meters per second, see [1] . The corresponding Taylor-Reynolds number is Re \u03bb = 705, since the air is flowing along a 3 meter distance from Table  A to the wall where the air-conditioner is located. The three meter distance, perpendicular to the air-flow, is taken to be the distance across the largest table, where the infected person was sitting, and including one half-meter for each person sitting on opposite sites. Using the energy dissipation \u03b5 = 1.2, taken from the experimental and simulation data in [6] , we get the Kolmogorov time scale \u03c4 \u03b7 = 3.55 ms (milliseconds). We employ the theoretical structure function S 2 from [2] and use the stochastic closure theory (SCT), see [7, 8, 10] , to compute the coefficient C 2 in the exponential of the formula for the Richardson distribution (A.1). This computation, that interpolates the coefficients computed in [14] for the Reynolds number Re \u03bb = 705, is explained in Appendix B.",

In the left figure in Figure 3 , we show the complete distribution for one exhaling event, roughly 340 points \u2248 1.2 second. Observe that the distance between the points is greater in the beginning (Richardson dispersion) but becomes smaller after the exhale event (Eulerian diffusion). We make this clearer in Figure 3 , where on the left we plot the distribution of the cloud for first 340 points or 1.2 seconds and on the right for the subsequent 340 point or the subsequent 1.2 seconds, to see what happens to the cloud immediately afterwards. We call the left the Lagrangian part and the right the Eulerian part of the exhale and propagation events. The cloud is clearly more diffuse during the Lagrangian part (Richardson dispersion) and more concentrated during the Eulerian part. The concentration of the droplet/aerosols is slightly (1.15 times) greater during the Eulerian phase. The cloud is traveling with the airflow, at 0.25 m/s, so the total length of the cloud is 0.3 meters, the Lagrangian part extends to 0.3 meters and the Eulerian part covers the subsequent 0.3 meters. Somewhat surprisingly the droplet/aerosol concentration within the first 0.3 meters is slightly less (0.87 times) than that at the 0.3 to 0.6 meters distance.",

The volume of the whole space containing the contamination is 3 by 6 by 3.14 meters = 56.52 m 3 , see [16] . A pyramid with base on the wall opposite the air-conditioner mostly contains the blue contamination cloud, see Figure 5 . Thus the cloud has roughly the volume 56.52/3 = 18.84 m 3 . The radius of a cylinder containing the exhaled cloud, is the height of the cloud, and reaches its maximum at 100 units on the left figure in Figure 3 . This corresponds to 0.35 seconds and the velocity determining the spread is probably not the velocity at which the cloud is drifting but the velocity with the dropletsaerosols are being ejected. This is taken to be 1.5 m/s in [16] and we will use the same value here. This give the radius 1.5 times 0.35 = 0.53 meters. If we let the exhaled clouds be contained in a cylinder with this radius extending the length of the contamination area we get the volume 5.33 m 3 for this cylinder. The droplet/aerosols in the cylinder now get spread to the pyramid, by the air-conditioning and heat conduction, see Figure 6 . This decreases their concentration by a factor of 14.13/5.33 = 3.54. However, the infected person keeps exhaling a new droplet/aerosol cloud every 12 seconds and since the extent of these clouds is 0.3 meters he needs to exhale 20 clouds to fill the 6 meter long cylinder. This takes 240 seconds or 4 minutes. In one hour he has filled the cylinder 15 = 60/4 times. Thus with no droplet/aerosols lost, the exhaust fan was closed see [16] , the resulting concentration in the pyramid is 15 \u00d7 1/3.54 = 4.23 times what it was in the cylinder, the first time it was full. In other words, the concentration for everyone sitting at the three tables A, B and C, in Figure 1 , in less than 15 minutes, is what it would be if they were sitting next to the infected person. In one hour, the concentration is more than four times what it was initially, if every person on the three table was sitting next to the infected person. This build-up of the concentration of the droplet/aerosols containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the likely reason for the outbreak in the restaurant in Guangzhou.",

            "text": "In [17] it was speculated that the flow generated by the air-conditioning was blowing large droplets from table to table. This is highly unlikely since the air-conditioning flow (0.25 m/s) does not have enough energy to send the droplets on a ballistic trajectory between the tables. In [16] the blame for the outbreak was put on the poor air-conditioning in the restaurant, caused by the closed vents and small injection of fresh air. So we redid the simulation with the recommended [1] injection of fresh air 8 liters per second for each person in the infected area. There are 21 persons at the three tables A, B and C and during the 4 minutes it takes the infected person to fill the cylinder above with a droplet/aerosol cloud, 40,320 liters or 40.32 m 3 are injected into the infected area, if the air-conditioning follows recommendations. Adding this to the total volume above we get 96.84 m 3 , 32.28 m 3 of which pass through the pyramid containing the infected air. The concentration is decreased by a factor of 6.06 and in one hour we get 15 times 1/6.06 = 2.48 fold increase in concentration. This means that the concentration increases to what it would be next to the infected person in 25 minutes, in one hour it is almost 2.5 times that. Thus fixing the air-conditioning, that was present, does not solve the problem. We also asked the question how much injection of fresh air would we need to prevent the build-up in the droplet/aerosols? If we increase the injection to 80 l/s per person in the infected area, the simulation give us as reduction of 1/2 per hour. In other words, in one hour each person only experiences 1/2 of the concentration it would experience if he or she was sitting next to the infected person. In [20] the transmission of the virus droplet/aerosol through an air-conditioning system is discussed with the conclusion that greater volume of outdoor air and MERV-13 or HEPA filters with the capacity of filtering our the droplet/aerosols need to be used. This is consistent with our observations. However, the air-conditioners in current use may be unable to use MERV-13 filters or handle the required volume of outdoor air. Indeed a new generation of air-conditioners that meet these requirements may be needed.",
