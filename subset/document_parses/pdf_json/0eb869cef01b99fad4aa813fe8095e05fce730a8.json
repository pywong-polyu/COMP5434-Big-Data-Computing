Some medical institutions had to cut back on regular healthcare services. There were significant shortages of ethanol for disinfection and personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns, and face masks. Additionally, many medical institutions had difficulty procuring supplies for a brief period. Pharmacies also come into direct contact with patients during medication counselling and dispensing. Therefore, pharmacy staff managed to take extreme care to prevent infection. Although rarely, pharmacists may be directly involved in treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, pharmacists are called upon to provide a variety of other services, such as logistic support for physicians and nurses and procurement and supply of disinfectants. Pharmacists have to be conscious of working to improve public health and control infection among their staff. Pharmacies are visited by patients, pharmaceutical distributors, medical device companies, and other parties. Currently, pharmacies sometimes limit contact with these external parties due to COVID-19. However, there is insufficient information on the approach adopted by individual pharmacies regarding restrictions on meetings and infection control measures, as many pharmacies are unsure of which strategies to adopt. Herein, we aimed to assess the current circumstances and concerns faced by pharmacies in relation to COVID-19. We conducted a questionnaire survey to evaluate strategies for pharmacy services, availability of ethanol for disinfection, and measures adopted for in-house infection control with the aim of enhancing future infection control efforts.",

According to previous reports, although wearing appropriate personal protective equipment was effective in infection control, pharmacists working at pharmacies would have come into direct contact with patients [3, 4] . Using ethanol for disinfection is effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19 [5, 6] , and its demand has grown rapidly during the pandemic. Many pharmacies in this study described using new products instead of their usual products and preparing ethanol in-house for disinfection, such as by adding distilled water to anhydrous ethanol. The World Health Organisation guidelines specify that the concentration of ethanol used for disinfection is 60-80 v/v% [7] . Hence, ensuring an appropriate concentration is important when preparing ethanol in-house for disinfection. This suggests that a flexible approach to obtaining ethanol for disinfection is also important when supplies are limited. It has been reported that ethanol was in short supply not only in Japan, but also in other countries. Moreover, it would be possible to reduce consumption of ethanol disinfectant by effectively washing hands with running water and soap according to the situation [8] .",

Online tools are useful for holding meetings and acquiring medical knowledge [10, 11] . Additionally, proactive use of internet tools for interviews and meetings seems to be beneficial. Places of food consumption are prone to airborne droplet dispersal and likely to increase risks of infection. Hence, pharmacies should ideally ensure proper socially distanced seating and avoid unnecessary conversations in these areas [12, 13] . Regarding staff break areas, the survey revealed that many pharmacies introduced staggered staff breaks and increased the size/ number of break areas. Some pharmacies undertook educational activities involving patients and general citizens. Since it is epidemiologically beneficial for public health and local residents and general citizens to have accurate information on infection control measures and infectious diseases, pharmacies should ideally be pursuing such activities on regional basis.",
