In the US, exposure to parental or caregiver intimate partner violence (IPV), adolescent relationship abuse (ARA), and youth violence pose significant threats to AYA health, and disproportionally impact youth of color living in neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage. [1] [2] [3] [4] The COVID-19 pandemic is both transforming the epidemiology of violence experienced by AYAs and impacting AYA-serving programs and services designed to prevent violence and mitigate negative health sequalae. As AYA-serving health professionals grapple with caring for youth during this pandemic, we recommend actionable, trauma-sensitive practices to address AYAs' unique needs and challenges.",

The lay press has reported an escalation of adult IPV 5 and ARA helplines have seen high call volumes. Detroit and Philadelphia have reported increased community violence 6 and shootings, 7 respectively. Experiencing multiple forms of violence concurrently can compound risks. 8 For example, AYAs living in homes with IPV that is escalating during necessary shelter-in place orders may leave their homes to keep themselves safe, potentially leading to more dangerous situations (e.g. residing with an abusive partner), housing insecurity, and increased risk of exposure to COVID-19. The sudden and rapid technological transformation of all facets of adolescents' lives also increases vulnerability to cyber-based violence. Increased reliance on technology creates opportunities for cyber abuse, where abusive partners control, stalk, or discredit their partners through texts, social media, or mobile applications. 9 For those who may be at risk for perpetrating interpersonal harm, including gang and clique-related violence, social media becomes a place to share frustrations and threats about future acts of violence -called \"internet banging.\" 10 While more research is needed to understand these trends, the pandemic has amplified unique vulnerabilities faced by AYAs in violent environments and relationships.",

With the closure of many school-based health centers, clinics, and pharmacies, access to safe and confidential reproductive health services may be limited for youth experiencing reproductive coercion or sexual violence. Youth experiencing community violence may have more limited access to violence intervention specialists known to be critical for supporting victims and reducing reinjury. Additionally, with school and community program closures, youth may lose access to programs which provide connection to trusted adults, peer support, and access to food and behavioral health services. Violence prevention programs, such as school or community-based interventions focused on promoting healthy relationships and developing positive conflict resolution strategies, have also likely stopped during this pandemic.",

Using telehealth offers opportunities for clinicians, as youth feel more comfortable using technology as compared with older adults. However, unlike in-person visits, providers cannot ensure during virtual visits that adolescents feel safe speaking confidentially. Providers should prioritize confidentiality during all parts of a visit, from scheduling to documenting. Schedulers should ask adolescents if they have a comfortable space to speak and if they have a safe phone where the virtual visit can be completed without being monitored. When completing AYA virtual visits with parents or other parties present, clinicians should set up expectations regarding the importance of having time to speak alone with the adolescent, aligned with best practices during in-person visits. If an adolescent does not feel safe talking during a virtual visit, providers may consider using the chat function, as long as the adolescent's phone or computer is not being monitored and conversations are not being saved. Additionally, although conducting visits virtually is safer for physical distancing, AYAs should be given a choice about completing a visit virtually or in-person. For some AYAs, healthcare centers may be one of the only available safe places.",

While the clinic is closed due to the pandemic, he receives a call from a youth coach who offers a phone or video visit with a clinician. The youth coach also offers information about confidential services provided by a local intimate partner violence agency. The clinician speaks with Daniel by phone and offers to help make a call to this victim service agency together. While Daniel declines, he also knows that he can reach out to the youth coach or clinician any time. Nate* (age 16) sustained a gunshot wound following a dispute in his neighborhood. Nate is admitted to the hospital trauma service for medical stabilization. His physical wounds begin to heal and he is discharged home to continue his recovery. Sitting in the passenger seat on his way home, his heart begins to race as his mother's car nears the block where the shooting took place. Nate is worried about his safety and the safety of his siblings amidst an escalating turf war.",
