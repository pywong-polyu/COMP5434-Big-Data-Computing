In our study, it is unclear if this rate was an evidence of vertical transmission or it was contacted post-delivery due to delayed RT-PCR testing 5 days from birth. Some of the cases in reported studies, despite initial testing at birth was negative, had positive RT-PCR results on repeat testing. In addition, it was found that three newborns, whose mother admitted with COVID-19 infection 23 days before birth, had IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at birth [24, 25] . Recent articles showed the potential intrauterine placental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection [26, 27] . Therefore, vertical transmission could not be excluded with the knowledge up to now. Furthermore, median time between symptoms and delivery was longer in the newborns with SARS-CoV-2 group (6 vs. 2 days) in our study, although it was not statistically significant.

Also, in a study from Iran, authors demonstrated that of nine pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, seven died, one was critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation, and one recovered after long hospital stay [30] . It has been publicized that pregnant women are not at increased risk of susceptibility, infectivity, and severity of COVID-19 compared with the general population or nonpregnant women perhaps with the good intention of reducing anxiety among this vulnerable population group [31] [32] [33] . In contrast, a systematic review of 108 cases of laboratoryconfirmed pregnancies with COVID-19 reported the possibility of increased risk of severe disease among pregnant women [34] . An analysis based on an estimate of the total number of pregnant and non-pregnant women in the population of Sweden revealed that the relative risk (RR) for pregnant and early postpartum women (< 1 week) with COVID-19 to receive intensive care was 5.4 and the RR to require invasive mechanical ventilation was 4.0 (95% CI 1.75-9.14) compared with non-pregnant women of similar age [35] . According to the current data of the Ministry of Health, the overall mortality rate in our country has been 2.63% [2] . The cause of high mortality rate in our study may be attributable to underlying conditions in pregnant women, but more information in the literature is needed to interpret it. Although the World Health Organization, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, and the TNS state that COVID-19 mothers can breastfeed, we found that the rate of formula (56.8%) and expressed breast milk (36%) use was higher than that of exclusive breastfeeding [1, 19] . Information in the literature on breastfeeding data of COVID-19 mothers is still insufficient. According to a systematic review, of the 28 newborns with confirmed COVID-19 infection, seven were breastfed, three formula fed, and one was given expressed breast milk, and in 17 newborns, the method of infant feeding was not reported [36] . All mothers in our study had proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, and majority of the newborns (86.4%) were followed in an isolation room in the NICU. In contrast to recommendations by proposals, isolation of the patients in the NICU, health status of the mothers, and the anxiety of both parents and physicians on the possible contamination to breast milk could have affected the rate of breastfeeding in our cohort. Neonates positive for SARS-CoV-2 must be isolated and clinically monitored, but this does not necessarily require NICU admission. It might be done in a single room, without full NICU capabilities, according to local settings [28] .

First, the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibody may play an important role in the diagnosis of vertical transmission. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain an antibody test as our time to share data was limited. Second, a small number of samples of placental tissue, amnion fluid, deep tracheal aspirate, serum, stool, and breast milk from the mother-neonate pairs could be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, newborns with SARS-CoV-2 did not have these investigations. The potential transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in a newborn born to a mother infected in the last trimester through placenta and by extra-respiratory routes such as breast milk show that suggesting testing for SARS-CoV-2 in placenta, amniotic fluid, and breast milk may be a part of routine evaluation of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection [17, 26, 27] . However, our study has several strong implications. It is a large multicenter Fig. 1 Imaging findings of four newborns with SARS-CoV-2 cohort study throughout Turkey that allowed us to prospectively obtain data via a special network, and RT-PCR results of all pregnant women included in this study were positive, which allowed us to interpret the effects of the disease on transmission, neonatal outcomes, and breastfeeding practice better.
