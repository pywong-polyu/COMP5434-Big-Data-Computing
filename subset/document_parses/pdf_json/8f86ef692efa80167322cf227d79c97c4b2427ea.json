The healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic has required rapid changes to the provision of secondary healthcare services, including the creation of new hospitals 2,3 . Critical care capacity has increased substantially in high-income countries, requiring redeployment of staff and equipment from other departments 4 . Surgical services represent a large portion of healthcare activity, accounting for 5 million hospital admissions to the UK National Health Service (NHS) every year 5, 6 . In March, NHS England 7 issued guidance to postpone non-urgent surgery from 15 April. Only very urgent and emergency surgical treatments continued, with the cancellation of almost all planned cancer and noncancer surgery 8, 9 . However, the number of surgical procedures cancelled during the pandemic response, and the excess of untreated surgical disease, remain unknown 2, 8 . As the UK NHS response to the pandemic develops, reintroduction of elective surgery is planned with a particular focus on cancer surgery 10 . However, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within hospitals is a concern and further complicated by uncertain rates of asymptomatic infection in the general population (17-56 per cent) 11, 12 . Asymptomatic infection rates may be as high as 24 per cent among healthcare staff 13, 14 . New procedures introduced to protect patients and staff from virus transmission have reduced the capacity for surgery, as has a lack of appropriately trained staff, requiring redeployment to other clinical areas 2, 4 . NHS plans to prevent in-hospital infection include preoperative patient screening, establishing 'clean' hospitals, routine staff testing and/or universal personal protective equipment (PPE) 8, 15 . However, the optimum strategy, resource requirements and time scale for reintroducing elective surgery remain uncertain 15 . Critical care utilization remained high for patients with COVID-19 in some areas after the peak had passed 16 . Capacity for surgical care remains limited in operating rooms, postanaesthetic recovery units and critical care units, while the incidence of serious postoperative complications among patients with COVID-19 is very high 4, 17 . A clear understanding of the number and type of overdue surgical procedures is urgently needed to inform national healthcare policies for reintroducing surgical services.",

Surgical procedures were stratified according to a classification published by NHS England on 17 March 2020, which described operations that should be stopped or continued during the initial pandemic response 7 . Surgical procedures were divided into four classes of decreasing urgency: class 1, emergency operations needed within 72 h; class 2, urgent surgery that can be deferred for up to 4 weeks; class 3, semiurgent surgery that can be delayed for up to 3 months; and class 4, elective surgery that can be delayed for more than 3 months. A prespecified, data-driven approach was used to identify emergency, urgent and elective surgical procedures based on waiting times and expert review of procedure coding (Tables S1 and S2). The monthly volume of surgical activity that would have been expected had there not been a pandemic until 28 February 2021 was estimated, by calculating the annual change in activity during the 5-year interval from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2019, and extrapolated using a linear growth assumption. Estimations of monthly volume were calculated using NHS England Monthly Activity Returns, and the pooled mean age for each class of surgery was estimated.",

First, it was assumed that class 1 (emergency) surgery would continue at the prepandemic rate. The second assumption was that class 2 surgery would continue at a reduced rate; four scenarios were calculated, where 20, 40, 60 and 80 per cent of class 2 surgical procedures were assumed to have continued. Third, it was assumed that 50 per cent of class 3 and 4 procedures continued in March and then stopped completely in April and May, reflecting between-hospital heterogeneity in the timing of stoppage of surgery. The results were presented as the deficit of surgical procedures between 1 March and 31 May 2020 with a 95 per cent confidence interval. The fourth assumption was that widespread reintroduction of surgical activity would start from 1 June 2020 and continue to increase to prepandemic levels. For each of the four scenarios of class 2 procedures, a linear increase in activity over the 3 months from 1 June to 31 August 2020 was assumed, with class 3 and 4 surgical procedures remaining cancelled until 31 August. In the final model it was assumed that 80 per cent of class 2 procedures continued. This analysis was repeated in an iterative fashion, by adding class 3 procedures on 1 September and class 4 procedures on 1 December. The fifth assumption was that prepandemic levels of surgical activity would be reached by 28 February 2021 (Fig.  S1 ). The estimated number of surgical procedures carried out each month between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021, and a rolling deficit of surgical activity compared with the expected volume according to the previous 5-year average, are presented. Assumptions about a second peak of COVID-19 were not included, and neither were assumptions regarding the impact of reduced operating theatre utilization owing to enhanced infection control procedures. A post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed assuming that all classes of surgery restarted on 1 June 2020 and increased linearly over a 6-month interval.",

This is equivalent to 45 per cent of the total number of surgical procedures performed in England each year before the COVID-19 pandemic, and is larger than the existing waiting list to start surgical treatment in March 2020, which already stood at over 1.8 million patients 30 . The cost of clearing this postpandemic waiting list is in excess of e5 billion, or 4.2 per cent of the total NHS England budget 31 . Additional costs of delivering surgical services under strict infection control procedures exceed e500 million, and include PPE, preoperative screening and extra bed-days in hospital. No attempt was made to model the reduced operating theatre utilization efficiency, suggesting that the true excess cost may be far greater. Nor does this estimate account for additional costs of contracts with non-NHS providers, or the costs of postoperative complications among surgical patients with COVID-19 4, 17 . To reduce the size of any future backlog of overdue surgery, elective surgical services would need to be reintroduced at the earliest opportunity and at the maximum capacity possible.

            "text": "The postoperative mortality rate is much higher in patients with COVID-19 infection, compared with the expected prepandemic rate 17 . An international cohort study 17 of more than 1000 patients with COVID-19 found the incidence of postoperative death was more than 1 in 4 patients, compared with an expected mortality rate of 1 in 30 patients undergoing emergency surgery. This will inevitably lead to greater resource use, longer lengths of hospital stay and greater financial costs. Furthermore, emerging data from the UK suggest that as many as 1 in 12 healthcare workers had asymptomatic infection during the first peak of the pandemic, and were at risk of transmitting the virus to other staff and patients 14 . Consequently, many surgeons may choose to avoid surgery in patients with COVID-19 infection, to reduce the active reservoir inside the hospital and to mitigate the higher risk of postoperative death. When surgery does go ahead, the benefits must be weighed against the potential harm of bringing vulnerable patients into contact with SARS-CoV-2 and the potential risks to staff members. It is likely that preoperative screening for the virus and PPE for healthcare workers will become universal. It is estimated that, by February 2021, over 160 000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests will be required every week for preoperative screening alone. Permanent infrastructure for testing will need to be included in strategic plans for pathology services to support elective surgery. There are no national data regarding the use of protective equipment at individual institutions. However, many societies have exercised caution and have advocated for the deployment of full PPE for all high-risk procedures and examinations, including all aerosol-generating procedures 24 .",

            "text": "There are no published data on the rate of cancellation of surgery within the NHS in England during the COVID-19 pandemic response. However, the results of this analysis are consistent with data from an international survey, which reported that the majority of both urgent cancer and non-cancer operations were postponed during the peak of the pandemic 9 . This analysis provides early evidence that disruption to surgical care has been widespread, and that reintroduction of this care will have substantial resource requirements that will differ between healthcare settings. Delays to the reintroduction of surgical procedures may result in increased secondary morbidity and mortality, not directly attributable to COVID-19 infection but owing to increased volume of undiagnosed surgical disease and delays to curative therapy 2 . If delays in surgical care result in a higher incidence of more advanced disease, it is likely that postoperative morbidity and mortality rates will also increase, as well as critical care bed utilization and duration of hospital stay. Strategies for undertaking safe surgery after the pandemic, during a prolonged pandemic response, or if COVID-19 becomes endemic, include reorganization of referral pathways, restructuring of the surgical workforce, dedicated surgical critical care resources, isolated 'cold' hospitals, and prioritization of certain patient groups 2 . If second or subsequent peaks of COVID-19 occur, it is likely that surgical services will again be curtailed, with further increases in the number of cancelled procedures. NHS leaders should make plans for the future continuity of surgical care. This analysis has several strengths. Robust national data were analysed that describe the whole healthcare setting of a single country according to a prospectively published statistical analysis plan. Conservative estimates are purposely provided of estimates of procedure volume and associated resource requirements. Procedures are reported at the admission level, rather than the episode level, which will likely underestimate the volume of surgery. Assignment to urgency class based on mean waiting time may have led to some inappropriate classification of individual procedures but was the only feasible option. Multiple sources were used to calculate postoperative critical care admission, which did not include preoperative admission, nor increased critical care utilization for patients with COVID-19. Estimates of PPE only include use in operating theatre, but not on postoperative wards or in clinics. Cost estimates do not take account of potential future reorganisation of care pathways, the use of 'hot' and 'cold' sites or use of private sector hospitals. This analysis also has limitations. A series of assumptions were made based on NHS England guidance, and were applied to a series of plausible scenarios regarding the continuation of surgical activity during the pandemic 7,10 . However, the reality of the volume, type, and timing of continuation and reintroduction of surgery may differ from those of these models. The models implemented in this analysis are highly sensitive to the rate and timing of the resumption of surgical care, as evidenced by the much lower cumulative deficit in the sensitivity analysis. It will be possible to test this in retrospect only once actual numbers of procedures carried out are published. The analysis does not account for lower throughput of surgery because of stricter infection control procedures or a potential second peak of COVID-19 32 . Further research is urgently needed to address these issues. It is likely that the volume of emergency surgery that has continued during the pandemic is lower than prepandemic levels, perhaps owing to patients avoiding hospital or clinicians using alternative management strategies 33 . The age distribution of the surgical population is skewed 6 . However, age adjustment was not possible in the analysis because of limitations of the data source. It is likely that, unfortunately, some patients will have died while waiting for surgery. The numbers of such patients are unknown, and it was not possible to account for these in the analysis. It is likely that patients who have delayed care will have greater care needs and associated financial costs. There will also be higher human costs in terms of chronic symptoms and disability that it was not possible to account for in this analysis 2 . This analysis will be updated as new data become available.",
