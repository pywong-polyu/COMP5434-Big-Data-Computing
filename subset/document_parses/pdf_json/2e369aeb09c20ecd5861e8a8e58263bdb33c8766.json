            "text": "Assessing the digital readiness of companies is becoming crucial to undertake a successful journey towards the digitalization of industry. Recently, the attention of both scholars and practitioners has turned to an extension of the assessment to the whole Supply Chain (SC). Given the importance of reaching a high level of integration and digital readiness in all the various actors that collaborate in the SC, some Digital Supply Chain (DSC) assessment models have been proposed mainly in the consulting field. However, to fully exploit the benefits of measuring the digital readiness of a SC, companies need also to be supported in the identification and prioritization of the most relevant opportunities triggered by the deployment of DSC projects. To this purpose, this paper presents a framework that links the potentials of DSC implementations with the SC operation processes, highlighting the most suitable technologies to deploy them. The framework has been conceived starting from a literature review and aims at providing a valuable tool to all the stakeholders involved in the transformation towards Digital Supply Chains.",

These extreme and severe changes have further fueled some needs and opportunities which were already nurturing in the last years, regarding in particular the digital transformation of the organizations to enable smart working of white collars, on-line controlling and monitoring of production systems, remote assistance of machines, thus mitigating the downfall effects triggered by reduced mobility of people, workers and goods. However, the appropriate adoption and use of these new technologies are not immediate, but require a deep understanding and companies must be prepared for them [1] .",

Depending on the goal and its vision, as a second step, the company formulates the implementation strategy that allows it to achieve its objective(s) [13] . It considers \"how, where, when and who\" for the realization of the objective(s). Different aspects of SCM are affected by digital transformation and need to be defined in this step (e.g., integration, processes, automation, and analytics).

Changing readiness means having the right conditions and resources to support certain company initiatives, to have clear goals and visions of change and to have objectives and the motivation to face it.

The assessment developed by the Digital Supply Chain Institute [18] has been applied to some companies operating in the manufacturing and service industry. The objective of this assessment is to analyze the SC from an internal focus to a customer-supplier focus. The assessment is divided into four areas (Demand, People, Technology and Risk), each area containing three levels. The DSC assessment developed by the consulting group Tecsys [19] aims at analyzing the critical milestones for an end-to-end SC, i.e. Executive Buy-In, Financial Foundations, Infrastructure Essentials, SC Operations, Cross-Functional Collaboration and Strategic Momentum.
