Furthermore, diet-related disparities exist by socioeconomic status (SES) and rural residence. We use data from the 2010-2018 Nielsen Homescan Panel to describe the nutritional profiles of PFPs by store type and to assess whether these vary by household urbanicity and SES. Store types include grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, online shopping, dollar stores, and convenience/drug stores. Food and beverage groups contributing the most calories at each store type are estimated using survey-weighted means, while the associations of urbanicity and SES with nutritional quality are estimated using multivariate regression. We find that households that are customers at particular store types purchase the same quality of food regardless of urbanicity or SES. However, we find differences in the quality of foods between store types and that the quantity of calories purchased at each store type varies according to household urbanicity and SES. Rural shoppers tend to shop more at mass merchandisers and dollar stores with less healthful PFPs. We discuss implications for the types of store interventions most relevant for improving the quality of PFPs.",

However, research examining trends in household packaged food purchases (PFPs) found that the share of purchases from grocery stores decreased from 2000 to 2012 and that the PFPs that were the top sources of calories for US households did not vary meaningfully by store type from 2000 to 2012 [2] . Further research is needed to determine whether these trends have continued to the present day and whether national trends by store type differ among sociodemographic subpopulations.",

Residents of rural areas have been found to depend more on smaller convenience and dollar stores, which have limited and more expensive food items compared to other store types [3, 4] as well as compared to small convenience stores in urban areas [5] . The cost of healthy food in larger grocery stores has also been found to be higher in rural areas [6] . Furthermore, diet-related disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) may be exacerbated in rural versus urban food deserts, where lower income individuals have fewer transportation options (e.g., money for gas or lack of public transportation) to access retail stores with a larger variety of food and/or more affordable prices [7, 8] . While many studies focus only on food access and purchases among either the urban poor or rural poor [9] , no research exists that studies the intersection of urban/rural residence and SES as it relates to store use and the healthfulness of food purchases. As rural individuals are at higher risk of poorly treated diet-related diseases compared to urban residents [10, 11] , it is important to understand how the healthfulness of food purchases varies by urbanicity.",

For example, dollar stores (Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Family Dollar) have nearly doubled in the past decade [12] . Their expansion into poor rural towns hurts local grocery stores, often driving them out of business [13] [14] [15] [16] . In poor urban areas that lack traditional grocers, dollar stores tend to cluster, as their small retail footprint allows them to bypass zoning restrictions faced by larger supermarkets [14] . The proliferation of dollar stores in rural and urban low-income neighborhoods makes it especially important to consider the intersection of urbanicity and SES to understand purchasing patterns [17] . Lastly, the COVID-19 outbreak rapidly increased demand for groceries, particularly through online shopping [18] . Therefore, it is important to understand how the quality of online grocery purchases compares to in-store purchases.",

Data from each purchase occasion were aggregated at the annual level for each household to create household-year observations. To be included in Homescan, households must participate for at least ten months each year (n = 555,085 household-year observations). We further excluded households if they did not purchase a minimum amount of food and beverages for all quarters in a calendar year or had an incorrect county FIPS code (federal five-digit identifier) (n = 3026, 0.5%) for a final analytic sample of 552,059 household-year observations. Nielsen Homescan is a panel that uses an open cohort study design, where households may exit any time and new households are enrolled to replace dropouts based on demographic and geographic targets. Households in our final sample participated in Nielsen for an average of 4 years. Households are sampled from 52 metropolitan and 24 non-metropolitan markets across the contiguous US and are weighted to be nationally representative. Homescan's large sample size (about 60,000 households/year) provides a rich demographic and geographic variation of household characteristics which allows for the comparison of urban and rural trends and epidemiological analysis to understand differences by socioeconomic groups.",

Therefore, a series of outcomes was used to assess the nutritional quality of PFPs. Nutrients of concern included saturated fat, total sugar, and sodium. In addition, we evaluated calories per capita per day from food groups of public health interest (fruits, non-starchy vegetables, processed meats and seafood, mixed dishes, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and junk foods). The public health relevance for each outcome is detailed in Table 1 . In addition, we also examined trends in grains, not as an indicator of nutritional quality but rather because they were a top contributor of calories across store types in prior research [2] . These categories were derived by classifying all products into 27 mutually exclusive food and beverage categories based on Nielsen's product classifications. Mixed dishes include products such as canned soups and frozen entrees, while junk foods include all salty snacks, grain-based desserts, candy, and sweeteners. ",

Dollar stores are likely to sustain their growth. If the economic impact of COVID-19 is similar to the Great Recession, dollar stores are likely to see an increase in sales as consumers look for less expensive products [45] . In comparison, while the volume share of purchases from online shopping remained quite low through 2018, COVID-19 has resulted in a rapid increase in online grocery shopping, which is likely to be sustained. This is because shoppers are likely to continue using online shopping once they try it, and companies are likely to accelerate their investment in the infrastructure needed for online shopping to meet demand [45, 46] . In addition, by the end of October 2020, 45 states and D.C. had approved new pilot programs to allow online purchases using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in response to COVID-19 [47] . After investing in the infrastructure for online SNAP purchases, these programs are likely to continue.",

One exception is that juice has been replaced by alcohol as a top beverage, which is consistent with other findings that juice consumption is declining [48] . Grains are a top contributor of calories and include a mix of healthy and unhealthy grain-based foods. This is notable because it suggests that our unhealthy food groups provide a conservative estimate of low-quality purchases. One recent study compared the nutrient densities of foods to thresholds used by the Chilean government in assigning foods unhealthy warning labels and found that 66% of calories from breads and 100% of calories from ready-to-eat cereals qualified as junk foods by these standards [49] . Therefore, since all breads and cereals were included under grains in our study and grains were the top contributor of calories, our categorization of foods based on Nielsen groupings likely understates the proportion of calories from unhealthy junk foods.",

            "text": "However, while there was little difference in which groups were the top contributors of calories between store types, the relative proportion of calories from these groups differed between stores. The largest difference is in candies, which are not a top contributor of calories from grocery stores or club stores but comprise 10% of calories from mass merchandisers and 28% and 34% of calories from dollar stores and convenience stores, respectively. While the nutritional quality of PFPs is low among all store types, our findings indicate there are important differences between stores. PFPs from dollar stores and convenience stores are particularly high in sugar as a percent of total calories (36% and 39% respectively), and PFPs from mass merchandisers and online shopping (28% and 27%) are slightly higher in sugar than PFPs from grocery stores and club stores (25% and 23%). As a point of reference, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that added sugar not exceed 10% of total caloric intake [50] . While added sugars are a component of our study measure of total sugars, dollar stores and convenience stores are a negligible source of packaged fruits and vegetables with naturally occurring sugars. Relative differences in the percent of calories from sugar in these store types is likely to drive the high numbers of calories from junk foods. Our findings using nutrient outcomes align with previous research using expenditures from Nielsen 2004-2010 to calculate a single healthfulness score of purchases, which found supermarket purchases to be the healthiest, followed by club stores, supercenters (e.g., Walmart), convenience stores, and dollar stores [44] . Store stocking requirements [51] are a potential policy lever to increase the ratio of healthful to unhealthful foods (e.g., eligibility criteria for stores to accept SNAP or local ordinances). However, a recent evaluation of the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance found that corporate-owned stores made greater gains in complying with healthy stocking requirements compared to independently owned stores [52] . Therefore, such requirements should be coupled with financing initiatives [53, 54] to help independently owned stores stock healthy foods (e.g., refrigerated storage) and community engagement to increase demand for healthy foods to support the commercial viability of such efforts [55] .",

            "text": "We find few differences between urban and rural households in the nutritional quality of foods purchased among shoppers at a given store type. However, since meaningful differences do exist in the quality of purchases between stores, the mix of stores that households shop at matters. In particular, rural households tend to shop slightly more at dollar stores and substantially more at mass merchandisers. Therefore, interventions in these store types should be prioritized to reduce urban vs. rural diet-related disparities. Rural households may shop at these stores more frequently due to the lack of grocery stores and/or the convenience of shopping in bulk for food and non-food items at mass merchandisers to save on transportation costs [56, 57] . While aspects of food marketing, including the product selection, pricing, point-of-sale promotion, and product placement, influence the healthfulness of purchases (the 4 Ps) [58] , further research is needed to understand how these strategies differ between mass merchandisers, dollar stores, grocery stores, and club stores. Since both dollar stores and mass merchandisers consist of only a few large national chains, corporate engagement may be a potential strategy to shift marketing strategies in these stores to improve the quality of PFPs. Advantages of working with national chains include that decisions to shift to healthier products affect many store locations, chains have reliable supplier distribution networks, and chains can negotiate lower prices through buying in bulk [59] . For example, Dollar General aims to equip 5000 of its roughly 15,000 stores with the ability to sell fresh produce, and the Natural Resources Defense Council has secured commitments from Dollar General to prioritize locally sourced produce [60] (product selection). However, evidence suggests that voluntary initiatives by large food retail chains to encourage healthier purchases, through strategies such as reformulation (product selection), reducing prices on healthy foods, and healthy front-of-package labels (promotion) [61] , may not be successful by themselves [62] and that corporate stores are more likely to sell and market more unhealthy foods compared to independently owned stores [63] . More research is needed to identify effective healthy retail strategies that are scalable across these large chains and how retailers can be held accountable to voluntary pledges.",

Low-income households purchase more calories from supermarkets, while higher income households purchase more calories from club stores, which is likely due to the membership fees required for these stores. Among households who shop at mass merchandisers, we find in urban counties that low-income households purchase more than high-income households, which is consistent with previous findings [64, 65] . However, we find no income difference in purchases from mass merchandisers among rural households. This may be because most barriers faced by rural households, such as the lack of local food stores and long travel time to retailers [66] , affect households of all income levels. These findings have implications for the types of retail interventions mass merchandisers should prioritize to promote equity. For example, since rural households purchase far more calories from mass merchandisers compared to urban households but there is no difference in calories purchased by low-vs. high-income rural households, it is important to improve the selection, promotion, and placement of healthy products for all consumers in rural locations. In comparison, mass merchandiser stores located in urban counties should prioritize making healthier PFPs more affordable, since low-income households purchase more than high-income households from these stores.",

            "text": "The use of household purchase data has several limitations. First, the participant burden of scanning each purchase is high, resulting in underreporting, especially for small purchases. However, the degree of measurement error found in Nielsen Homescan is no different than in other household panel datasets [67] . Second, packaged foods are an incomplete picture of household food purchases. Without the inclusion of unpackaged, random-weight purchases (e.g., deli meats, loose produce, bakery goods), we are unable to examine the overall healthfulness of purchases. However, packaged foods make up the majority of foods purchased from stores [19] . Lastly, purchases do not equal consumption. Not all food purchased at the store is consumed, and we are unable to account for food waste. However, the nutritional profile of purchases is correlated with diet quality as measured by 24-h recalls and therefore a good representation of overall intake [68] . Lastly, since Nielsen predominantly samples urban counties, the rural sample is much smaller than our urban sample, and rural households are more likely to be sampled from counties closer to major markets. Therefore, they may not be fully reflective of all rural areas/households. However, our study has several important strengths. Compared to food retail sales data, household purchase data are directly tied to the sociodemographic characteristics of the household. This allows us to understand how purchasing patterns in urban and rural areas differ among high and low SES households. In comparison, retail sales data can only be linked to area-level measures of socioeconomic characteristics, precluding epidemiological analysis to understand the behavior of different consumer groups. Compared to dietary 24-h recalls, panel data are collected over a longer period of time, which better captures usual intake and avoids bias from seasonality in purchases [30] . In addition, our research group annually updates links between food items and brand-specific Nutrition Facts Panel data, capturing product reformulation and the entry/exit of products to better reflect the nutritional quality of products in a rapidly changing food market. Importantly, our access to data as recent as 2018 allows us to understand how sociodemographic factors are related to the healthfulness of purchasing patterns today.",
