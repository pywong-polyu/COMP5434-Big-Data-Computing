We propose a rigorous hybrid model-and-data-driven approach to risk scoring based on a time-varying SIR epidemic model that ultimately yields a simplified color-coded risk level for each community. The risk score \u0393 t that we propose is proportional to the probability of someone currently healthy getting infected in the next 24 hours. We show how this risk score can be estimated using another useful metric of infection spread, R t , the time-varying average reproduction number which indicates the average number of individuals an infected person would infect in turn. The proposed approach also allows for quantification of uncertainty in the estimates of R t and \u0393 t in the form of confidence intervals. Code and data from our effort have been open-sourced and are being applied to assess and communicate the risk of infection in the City and County of Los Angeles.",

The confidence interval reflects uncertainty in both the parameter of the underlying model and uncertainty in the data itself. Further, we present the mathematical derivation of the distribution of R t . Second, we propose a novel risk score \u0393 t for a community that is proportional to the probability that an individual will get infected in the next 24 hours. We show that the risk score can be calculated given estimates of four quantities: a) an estimate of I rep,new (t), the most recently reported count of new confirmed infectious cases, b) an estimate of R t as discussed above, c) an estimate of K, the ratio of true infectious cases to the number of confirmed cases, and d) an estimate of S(t), the current number of susceptible individuals in the community. To make the score more meaningful, we normalize the probability of infection by multiplying it by 10,000. Then, a risk score of x is an indication that there is, on average, a chance of x in 10,000 of an individual in the community becoming infected in the next 24 hours.",

This software is being used at USC to process the daily data of communities within Los Angeles County to estimate and generate maps of risk levels by community. The block diagram in figure 1 illustrates key elements of our system design. Our data parser is able to get the raw data from online data sources, clean them up and store them in machine-friendly (csv and json) formats. Our code for infection risk calculation uses this data in conjunction with a time-varying SIR-based Bayesian mathematical model to obtain risk estimates and prediction for different communities.

We show how this can be estimated using a time-varying SIR model, a generalization of the well-known SIR compartmental model [4] , [5] which consists of three states, namely the susceptible state, the infected state, and the recovered state. While traditionally this model is assumed to have a interaction rate / infection rate parameter that is constant, one recent work has used a time-varying SIR model to recover the time-varying effective reproduction number [6] . Going beyond that work, we also show how to derive a confidence interval for R t in this work. Further, the authors of [6] make strong assumptions on the number of susceptible individuals by approximating it as a constant factor of the entire population. This assumption may not be accurate when the number of infected individuals are high compared to the total population of a community; we therefore take a more general approach.",

In the SIR model, each member of a given population is in one of three states at any time: susceptible, infectious, recovered. Any individual that is susceptible could become infected with some probability when they come into contact with an infected individual. Any individual that is infectious eventually recovers (in the context of COVID-19 when applying the SIR model, note that the category of recovered individuals will also include removed individuals due to deaths, which could be modeled as a constant fraction of all individuals in this category).",

The risk score can be derived as the average number of people in that community that are likely to get infected in the next 24 hours by the currently infectious people divided by the current number of susceptible individuals. We further normalize this probability by multiplying by 10,000, so that a score of 1 implies a 1 in 10,000 chance of getting infected, a score of 2 implies a 2 in 10,000 chance of getting infected, and so on.

The approximation follows from the fact that I rep,new (t) is approximately equal to I(t) D I \u00b7K and S(t) the number of susceptible people in the community is approximately equal to N in the early stages of the epidemic. Confidence intervals for the risk score \u0393 t could be obtained numerically using a similar process as described for R t accounting also for uncertainty in K. Note that since K may not be known for a given community, it may be helpful to use the following normalized form of the risk score: \u0393t K , which is still proportional to the probability of infection for an individual. 4) Color-coded Risk Levels: To further simplify the presentation of the risk score to a wider audience, we propose to classify the risk levels into four color-coded levels: (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red). The risk level is determined by evaluating the normalized risk score ( \u0393 K ) with respect to three pre-specified threshold levels \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 , \u03b8 3 , such that when \u0393 K < \u03b8 1 the risk level is green, when \u03b8 1 \u2264 \u0393 K < \u03b8 2 the risk level is yellow, when \u03b8 2 \u2264 \u0393 K < \u03b8 3 the risk level is orange, and when \u0393 K \u2265 \u03b8 3 the risk level is red.

In accordance with LA county daily press releases, there is a sharp jump in both R t and risk score around the beginning of July. Note that the reason the risk score during the beginning of July is higher than the risk score during the last week of March, despite having the same R t , is due to the fact that there are significantly more confirmed cases in July compared to March.
