            "text": "While the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically restricted everyone's lives, its impact on young children may be especially important for at least four reasons. First, according to developmental systems theory [1] , children's trajectories and developmental outcomes are the result of dynamic interactions between individual (e.g., genetic, neural, biological, and cognitive), family, and contextual factors. Crucially, children's outcomes show heightened susceptibility to the influence of family processes, especially during sensitive periods of development. One such period is the preschool to early school-age years, when children make the important transition to school and begin to develop friendships [2] . Second, compared with older school-aged children and adolescents, young children spend much of their time near parents and so may be indirectly affected by the impact of the pandemic via parental wellbeing and availability (e.g., [3] ). Third, young children lack the experience and skills needed to maintain social relationships via virtual platforms, so their social interactions depend upon face-to-face contact and outdoor play [4] . Fourth, difficulties in understanding health risks may amplify the stress associated with changes and restrictions, for example, \"stay-at-home\" rules and mass school closures.",

Compounding these child demands, the pandemic has also generated widespread financial strain, family conflict, and concern for loved ones [8] , while mass school closures have obliged many working parents to deliver home-schooling, further escalating parent stress [9] . Parental distress in response to these multiple stressors may have cascading effects on child mental health [10] , as illustrated by worrying evidence of a significant increase in child abuse during the pandemic [11] . In presenting this conceptual framework, Prime and colleagues [10] draw on evidence illustrating both direct and indirect adverse effects of natural disasters/economic crashes on parent wellbeing, with negative consequences for children.",

This is significant as developmental systems theory (e.g., [12] ) emphasizes the importance of interactions between familial and societal factors (i.e., micro and macro levels of influence) that vary across time and place. Contrasts in both levels of virus transmission and political motivations have led to significant between-country variation in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic (c.f. [13] ) such that families have had markedly different pandemic experiences. This between-country variation accentuates within-country socioeconomic and racial inequalities. Focusing on between-country differences, the current study adopted an international design combining data from six different countries to estimate specific effects of COVID-19-related experiences on child adjustment difficulties. Informed by Prime's theoretical framework [10] , we also sought to test whether the effect of COVID-19 disruption on child adjustment difficulties was mediated by parental distress. To this end, given the hypothesized importance of parental wellbeing, a preliminary goal of the current study was to test whether our measure of parent distress was invariant across site.",

Whilst this suggests a pervasive adverse effect of COVID-19 restrictions on children's psychosocial adjustment, meaningful cross-cultural research hinges upon establishing the equivalence of measures. This entails testing whether instruments assessing child adjustment difficulties show \"measurement invariance\" across groups [15] . Adopting this approach, the current international consortium brought together researchers with a common interest in family influences on children's adjustment across six countries with diverse COVID-19 experiences: Australia, China, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.",

These six sites also adopted distinct policies to limit the spread of the virus. Indeed, Sweden was widely considered an outlier on the global stage with their relatively liberal level of pandemic restrictions and, crucially for young children and their parents, lack of national school closures. After demonstrating across-site measurement invariance for parental SDQ ratings [16] , we showed that during the pandemic, Swedish parents reported the lowest levels of child peer problems and the highest level of child prosocial behaviors, whilst British parents reported the highest levels of child emotional and hyperactivity problems. These descriptive data are important, but research is needed to understand the mechanisms underpinning these adverse effects [17] . The overarching aim of the current study was to test whether similar or distinct family and COVID-19 experiences are associated with individual differences in children's adjustment difficulties across these six different countries.",

As noted above, the developmental systems framework [1] posits three levels of influence on developmental outcomes: individual, family context, and society/culture. Empirical evidence also highlights the domain-specific nature of influences within any one of these levels. For example, in a longitudinal and detailed observational study, Hughes and Devine [18] found that while some family measures (e.g., home learning environment and frequency and complexity of family talk) have a relatively global influence, other measures (e.g., negative control and parental scaffolding) show specific associations with distinct aspects of children's development.",

            "text": "Three pandemic studies indicate that child adjustment problems are associated with poorer parent mental health, household chaos, and family conflict. However, these family risk factors have yet to be considered in tandem or across different contexts. As a result, little is known about either their relative salience and independence or about the generalizability of pathways. Addressing these gaps, the current international study examined the unique impact of parent mental health, household chaos, and family conflict on both child internalizing and externalizing problems in the early stages of the pandemic. Findings from two studies suggest a differentiated pattern of associations between family risk factors and child outcomes in the context of COVID-19. First, consistent with robust evidence for a negative impact of parental depression on children's behavioral and emotional problems [19, 20] , Romero et al. [21] surveyed parents of 1049 Spanish 3-to 12-year-olds and found that parents' self-reported distress showed moderate links with ratings of child externalizing problems but was unrelated to ratings of children's prosociality. Second, in an American study of 303 parents of 6-year-olds, Waller et al. [22] reported that reduced parental warmth and increased harsh discipline during the pandemic were each associated with elevated levels of callous unemotional traits, but only harsh parenting was associated with elevated levels of conduct problems. These findings are consistent with theoretical accounts attesting to the negative impact of \"coercive cycles\" of conflictual parent-child interactions (rather than simply the absence of warmth) on children's conduct problems (e.g., [23] ). By contrast, less differentiated findings have emerged from a socially diverse American sample of preschoolers [24] . Specifically, increased levels of household chaos and parenting stress appear associated with elevated depressive symptoms and externalizing problems [24] . These domain-general findings are consistent with longitudinal work with 511 families establishing the negative impact of household instability and disorganization on a variety of outcomes across China, Colombia, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, and Thailand [25] .",

This is surprising as parallels between economic adversities and the pandemic indicate that both can affect child wellbeing via couples' dyadic processes, such as increasing hostility or withdrawing support [26] . Associations between conflict and child negative outcomes may be direct, for example, via social learning mechanisms, triggering child distress or undermining feelings of security [27] , or indirect via impacting the quality of parent-child relationship [28] . Thus, in addition to considering parent-child conflict, our study sought to test whether couple relationship conflict also had a deleterious effect on children's adjustment and, crucially, whether patterns of association between family risk factors and children's psychosocial problems were similar across six different pandemic contexts.",

Alongside these cross-cultural comparisons, our study addressed two further questions. First, do family risk factors and COVID-19-related experiences show specific influences on child adjustment difficulties? Here, we hypothesized independent contributions from each risk factor to child difficulties but anticipated that more proximal COVID-19-related disruption would exert a stronger influence than distal factors (i.e., government stringency). We adopted an exploratory approach when considering whether the magnitude of associations would differ by child outcome. Second, does parental distress mediate the association between COVID-19 social disruption and child adjustment difficulties? Here, we hypothesized that COVID-19-related social disruption would indirectly impact child adjustment difficulties via elevated levels of parental distress.",

To test measurement invariance across site, we used multigroup CFA, which involves systematically adding equality constraints to the model and testing the change in model fit of these nested models [36] . Nested model comparisons were judged to be invariant if the CFI decreased by \u22640.020 and RMSEA increased by \u22640.003 [37] . From this basis, we then conducted between-site comparisons of our independent variables of interest and examined correlations between the main measures ( Table 2) . Next, we adopted a path modeling approach to examine the associations between COVID-19-related experiences, family processes, and child adjustment [34] . We used a maximum likelihood estimator with robust standard errors (MLR) and evaluated model fit using Brown's [35] recommended criteria. Model parameters and standard errors were estimated in Mplus using all available data [38] . To assess whether path estimates were similar across countries, a multiple group model was fitted [35] . Brown [33] notes multiplegroup solutions can be evaluated when the group sizes vary. To this end, we fitted a model in which all paths were freely estimated across site and subsequently compared this model to a model in which all paths were constrained to be equal across site. We assessed differences in model fit using the Satorra-Bentler \u03c7 2 difference test [39] . Finally, we tested whether parent distress mediated the association between COVID-19 disruption and child adjustment problems using Mplus' bootstrapping procedures (5000 bootstrap samples).",

As illustrated in Table 3 , increased levels of parent distress, parent-child conflict, and household chaos were associated with higher levels of problem behaviors. A Wald chisquare test of model constraints revealed the association between parent distress and child problems was similar in magnitude between conduct, hyperactivity, and emotion problems but weakest for peer problems (\u03c7 2 (3) = 54.38, p < 0.0001). There was a stronger association between parent-child conflict and conduct problems than between parent-child conflict and hyperactivity, emotional, or peer problems (\u03c7 2 (3) = 68.81, p < 0.0001). The association between household chaos and conduct problems was also stronger than the association between household chaos and emotion or peer problems (\u03c7 2 (3) = 35.63, p < 0.0001). There was a stronger association between couple conflict and emotion and conduct problems than with hyperactivity (\u03c7 2 (3) = 39.28, p < 0.0001).

First, children from families characterized by parental distress, increased levels of parent-child conflict, and chaos showed elevated levels of hyperactivity, conduct, and emotion problems. In contrast, increased peer problems were more strongly related to COVID-19-related experiences (both stringency of national restrictions and family-level social disruption). The magnitude of these associations was strongest for chaos, while couple conflict was not significantly related to child adjustment problems. This differentiated pattern of associations supports domainspecific models of social influences on child development and highlights the potential multiplicity of mechanisms implicated in young children's psychosocial adjustment in the context of the pandemic [41] . Second, our analyses revealed indirect associations between COVID-19-related social disruption and child adjustment difficulties that were mediated by parental distress.

Instead, highlighting the impact of depriving children of the stimulation and enrichment associated with interactions with other children, peer problems were more clearly associated with the country-wide severity of containment and family-level disruption. On this latter point, it follows that in experiencing unemployment, financial strain, work-family conflict, and worry about loved ones, parents themselves are (or feel) unable to participate in typical group practices, thus limiting children's opportunities to observe and practice their social skills [46] . Importantly, positive peer relationships are associated with a host of other child outcomes, including the development of children's identity, socio-cognitive skills, and understanding of social norms [47] . As a result, \"catch-up\" interventions need to extend beyond the academic domain to include emotional support and enriched opportunities for peer play. Notably, these suggestions are possible due to our inclusion of peer problems as a specific outcome of interest, a domain largely absent from earlier research that demonstrated large-scale economic crashes were linked to decline in children's mental health [48] .",

Our results highlighted the impact of parental distress as a mediator of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child adjustment. This is consistent with a recent American study that showed experiencing the disease in the family as well as the succeeding economic effects both impact family wellbeing [8] . Social learning accounts would suggest the onset and maintenance of child difficulties result from children modeling their parents' behaviors or ineffective coping strategies. Alternatively, this indirect effect may be carried by changes in parent-child talk, such as inappropriate health risk communication, or compromised parenting practices, such as reduced sensitivity (e.g., [50] ). Interestingly, an American study found parents' worries about COVID-19 were not associated with harsh discipline or reduced warmth [22] . However, this null association may reflect the focus on worrying about contracting and passing on the virus, which may have instead manifested in other behaviors, such as increased handwashing. Future longitudinal research will help tease apart these competing explanations as well as test whether changes in parents' wellbeing across the pandemic contribute to individual differences in the trajectories of children's psychosocial problems. That said, it seems evident that family-based interventions may prove most effective in mitigating the negative impact of the pandemic on child adjustment. Furthermore, the advent of innovative work evaluating the success of online family therapy suggests that these interventions do not have to wait until families can meet their therapist in person [51] .",

Nevertheless, with regard to mechanisms of influence on child adjustment, the findings from the different sites indicate striking similarities. This generality of results strengthens the evidence suggesting the cascading impact of economic pressure on child developmental outcomes via parent wellbeing across a variety of family structures, ethnic backgrounds, and geographic locations [52] .",

            "text": "First, our convenience sample of parents from middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds impacts the external validity and generalizability of our findings. The subsamples were restricted in terms of geographic (e.g., American parents in Pennsylvania and Ohio and Chinese parents in Beijing) and socioeconomic (e.g., almost 60% of Italian parents in our study had a tertiary education qualification compared to the national average level of 20% [53] ) position and were ethnically homogenous. Here, it is worth noting that, unfortunately, a large proportion of parents in China did not report on their ethnicity, which further limits our understanding of the representativeness of the Chinese subsample. Furthermore, the necessary reliance on online research designs during the pandemic increases the likelihood of selection bias and collider bias [54] . For example, participation is likely associated with increased engagement with social media campaigns, scientific interest, and higher education levels [54] . As a result, we cannot rule out that our models replicate across different countries because those who took part were largely similar (i.e., middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds). However, given we found associations between COVID-19 disruption, family risk factors, and child adjustment within a restricted range of SES, it is likely our estimates are conservative. Further research is required with more diverse samples as well as with families living in low or middle income countries to test whether our results replicate beyond this specific demographic. Second, the cross-sectional design limits our appreciation of the nature of the mediation findings. The findings may not be pandemic specific given we cannot rule out the impact of pre-existing levels of distress on parents' current mental health. That said, our sample did not have a history of psychopathology, and our theoretically informed analyses focused on disruption to life due to COVID-19-specific changes in association with current levels of distress [13] . Future longitudinal research is required to rule out alternative explanations regarding the directionality of our results (i.e., child difficulties eliciting parental stress).",

However, as illustrated in Table 2 , we found modest associations between family processes and child outcomes. Our results are strengthened by including an objective assessment of COVID-19 experiences. Specifically, a publicly available data set that assessed the stringency of national restrictions enabled us to test the impact of this distal influence on child adjustment. As this measure is strongly positively correlated with national rates of infection [55] , it also provides a proxy for national infection rates and a time-specific index of the severity of the disease's impact. As we move towards more open science, future collaborative efforts that pool individual participant data measuring similar constructs will be helpful in developing an understanding of the varied impact of the pandemic on parent and child adjustment across diverse contexts.",
