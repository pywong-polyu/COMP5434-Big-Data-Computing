Before the virus was circulating in Norway, there were strict traveling quarantines for blood donors.

We realized the potential negative effect it would have on the blood center's reputation if a donor contracted covid-19 from another donor or an employee, and therefore focused on measures to avoid this and on making donors feel safe. Also, precautions were taken to reduce uncertainty and stress among staff. Social distancing led to cancellation of internal meetings, or these were rescheduled on a digital platform. Information was increasingly given by e-mail. Donation in our mobile unit was cancelled or moved to the blood center because of the limited space in the bus.

All information relevant to blood donation is readily available on our website, which can also be downloaded as a smartphone app. To prevent entry of potentially infected donors into the hospital, a screening system (pretriage) has been set up. Outside the building, donors are questioned about symptoms, history of travel abroad, and contact with covid-19 patients, and there is disinfectant available both in the entrance area and inside the blood center. Waiting areas have been marked to prevent donors from being close to each other. Both donors and personnel wear facemasks when distancing is impossible, and we have plexiglass screens for protection both in interview booths and at the donation chairs. We have also introduced video interviews to reduce the number of people present, and to prevent crowding. The concept is to keep a distance between personnel and donors at all times. Until now, this has been successfulno transmission of virus has been traced to the blood center, and during the autumn none of the employees has been quarantined.",

Fortunately, the need for blood products has been low during this period, whereas the blood donors have actually shown up to a greater extent than usual. In daily life with work from home and social distancing, the occasional visit to the blood center may actually represent a welcome moment of social contact for the blood donors! Efforts to use this pandemic to speed up implementation of ongoing projects to modernize the blood center, have not been successful. The new situation has emphasized the need for improvements like webbooking of donor appointments (increases the probability that a donor will turn up for the appointment) and electronic health declaration forms (can be filled in at home before arrival in the blood center, thus reducing the number of people and the physical handling of paper forms). Electronic transfer of donation data (from blood mixers directly into the blood bank information system) could reduce time, work in narrow areas and physical contact with blood bags and samples; however, several dependencies remain before this is in place.",

Furthermore, an assay measuring antibody-dependent inhibition of binding between viral proteins and the ACE2-receptor has been adapted to the MAP format. The results are in good agreement with those obtained using tests for the ability of serum to neutralize virus (Gr\u00f8deland), and the proxy assay is now being chosen as the national platform for evaluation of CCP for patient therapy (Lund-Johansen/Andersen).",

Several new variants of concern have been found in Norway. Therefore, the government has imposed even stronger contact-reducing measures. The higher number of cases generates an increased number of available CCP donors, but the motivation to produce CCP is falling both due to lack of demand from clinicians and large-scale vaccination within reach. Vaccination against covid-19 has started with vaccination of elderly individuals in long-term care and a limited number of health care personnel. Other individuals in the highest age group will follow. However, until a protective effect of the vaccine in the older age groups has been achieved, CCP is a treatment option available for local outbreaks, as supported by the results from the INFANT.COVID-19 group [4] .",
