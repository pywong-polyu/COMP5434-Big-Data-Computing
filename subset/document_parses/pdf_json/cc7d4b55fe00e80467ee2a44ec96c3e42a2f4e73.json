We designed a novel micro-longitudinal study, the Talk Together Study, which allowed us to create a rich corpus of parent-child speech interactions in a fully online environment (N participants = 142, N recordings = 410). In this paper, we discuss the methods we used, and the lessons learned during adapting and running the study. These lessons learned cover nine domains of research design, monitoring and feedback: Recruitment strategies, Surveys and Questionnaires, Video-call scheduling, Speech elicitation tools, Videocall protocols, Participant remuneration strategies, Project monitoring, Participant retention, and Data Quality, and may be used as a primer for teams planning to conduct remote studies in the future.",

In the original research plan, a visit to the family home would initiate a series of audio recordings, including high fidelity recording of the parent's voice in their different languages, a parent-child interaction centred on a picture-book narration task, and a day-long ambient speech recording using a baby-worn recording device [e.g., a Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) device (Gilkerson and Richards, 2008) ].",

Strict lockdown measures from 8 April, 2020 precluded visits to family homes (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2020). With our corpus-building goals in mind, we designed a novel study that would allow us to develop a large corpus of parentchild speech. The Talk Together Study is a remote micro-longitudinal study in which parent-child dyads participated in an online book-sharing session at three time-points, separated by at least 1 month. Embedded in the micro-longitudinal design was a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) of an intervention to enhance child-directed talk through \"daily tips\". We preregistered the RCT and a target of 150 participants (for further details, see Sundaray et al., 2021) . The adapted design allowed us to create a large corpus of parent-child interactions (typically around 20 min in duration) using a novel, remote procedure. This report describes the strategies adopted and lessons learned while running the study.",

However, in the transition to online studies, sharing a picture book by pdf or \"broadcasting\" the pages onscreen may infringe on the copyright of a published work, depending on the legal jurisdiction. To ensure our study materials would have applicability in a variety of geographical and technical contexts, we created an open access wordless picture book \"Little Orangutan: What a Scary Storm!\" (Styles, 2020b) .

Secondly, vouchers may be hard to utilise during a global pandemic, if the vendors in question are inaccessible, unable to make deliveries, or go out of business before voucher redemption. Finally, and most importantly, cash payments do not expire, and are maximally fungible.

In these cases, researchers paused the study and reassured parents that the video call was not a formal assessment of their parenting skills or their child's general language abilities, but was a snapshot of language use in Singapore. Ethical training before beginning the study included the concept of parental consent coupled with the child's assent. In line with best practice in studies involving minors (Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Ethics Advisory Committee, 2000), the Data Collection team reserved the right to stop the video call if they believed a parent was coercing a child to participate without assent.",

With these low attrition rates across three timepoints, we were able to record a total of 410 video calls, making this the largest collection of parent-child speech in Singapore. Transcriptions of the recorded video calls are underway and will be reported separately.",

Since our task involves a live video call with parent and child, researchers could monitor engagement, and check eligibility as they would in a lab-visit scenario. In addition, questions in the survey chain about language use in the home also acted as screeners and allowed us to detect ineligible participation (including one family who signed up the same child twice). Since the preregistered study measures will be derived from multilingual transcriptions of the parent-child interactions, our primary data quality concern was whether the audio track in the recording would be sufficiently clear to enable word-level transcriptions. When planning the original study, we conducted a pilot of the parent-child storybook protocol in a sound attenuating room, using Zoom H4n Pro precision audio recorders. Compared to this small sample of 11 parent-child dyads, the research team noted that the audio quality from the video calls was noisier and of more variable clarity, depending on hardware, internet connectivity, and position in the home. Technology failures like poor Wi-Fi connections, low battery and faulty devices sometimes disrupted data collection, leading to videocall rescheduling. However, since the protocol included an opportunity to change devices or locations, recordings did not proceed until they were judged to be of sufficient audio quality to be transcribed manually.",

The procedures could be readily adapted for studies investigating toy play, theory of mind, numerical processing, spatial problem-solving, motor development, and a variety of other developmental milestones. We were able to conduct the study using Zoom, in part due to the prevalence of stable, high-bandwidth home internet connections in Singapore. Although these technological overheads may not be available in some research contexts, lower bandwidth versions of the protocol may be achieved by serving onscreen stimuli by a separate slide-sharing website and recording only audio Online parenting groups are a great way to connect with potential participants, using posts and shares rather than paid ads.",
