However, the exact aetiology behind such autoimmunity to islet cell antigens is not entirely understood. Genetic factors may have a strong impact, but the immoderate global rise in the incidence of type 1 diabetes over the last few decades is mostly attributable to environmental factors that are yet to be determined. 2 An example of such factors is viral infection. A relationship between viral infections and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with T1DM has been proposed in numerous studies. 3, 4 After reviewing the available literature, this case report appears to be the first reported case of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus with COVID-19 in the paediatric population without any respiratory involvement. Here, we have described a case of COVID-19 in which the patient presented with DKA as the first presentation of T1DM during the COVID-19 outbreak in KSA.",

She was haemodynamically stable, apart from mild tachycardia and mild dehydration in the form of dry mucus membranes. The chest was clear on auscultation with no Kussmaul's breathing and no supplemental oxygen required. Her weight was in the 25th percentile for her age, and she did not have any evidence of insulin resistance. Her initial laboratory investigations confirmed the clinical diagnosis of T1DM with DKA ( Table 1) . As per our general hospital policy concerning paediatric patients presenting with DKA, admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is warranted, regardless of the severity of the patient's presentation, in order to facilitate proper management and close observation. In addition, based on the concurrent hospital's strict infection control guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic, all patients who require admission to the hospital must be tested for COVID-19. Therefore, our patient was screened for COVID-19 using the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV-2 PCR) test, which yielded a positive result. The laboratory PCR methodology used was a rapid real-time RT-PCR automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 using Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. The specimen was collected from the patient via nasopharyngeal swabbing. This test is FDA-approved and has been validated and considered acceptable for patient testing. The manufacturers of Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test performed strict clinical and analytical evaluation processes. These evaluations showed a 97.8% (95% CI: 88.4%e99.6%) positive percent agreement (PPA) and a 95.6% (95% CI: 85.2%e 98.8%) negative percent agreement (NPA). Additionally, its analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) was claimed to be 0.0200 PFU/mL with 95%e100% hit rates. The test's analytical specificity (exclusivity) confirmed its ability to only detect human and bat SARS-coronavirus with no unintended cross reactivity with other organisms. 5 Serological testing was not undertaken due to its unavailability at our centre at the time. The patient was started on the DKA management protocol for the correction of her metabolic derangements. The management consisted of intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation, initially in the form of a 0.9% normal saline solution and an insulin infusion (0.1 U/ kg/hr); the patient was then started on IV fluid maintenance plus deficit. The types of IV fluids were decided based on her hourly glucose level during the DKA period. Potassium chloride and phosphate were added to her maintenance fluid regimen as part of the attempt to correct her metabolic derangements. Eventually, DKA resolved within 21 h. Her 24hour heart rate, urine output, and intravenous fluid rate trends are shown in Figure 1 . Other parameters that were monitored during her ICU stay included her GCS, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and temperature; these were all within the normal ranges.",

Over the last three decades, T1DM incidence has been increasing due to the involvement of multiple different factors, such as genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. 6 These factors play an integral role in promoting the initiation of an autoimmune reaction against b-cells, resulting in islet cell destruction and insulin degradation, and eventually an increase in serum glucose levels. In our patient, the evidence supporting the diagnosis of T1DM was clear due to the presence of a very low insulin serum level (<1.6 mU/ mL) and high serum glucose levels (>500 mg/dL) ( Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic b-cells could be initiated by viral illnesses through several processes. The devastation of b-cells might be directly caused by either the virus amplification process and/or viral antigen diffusion from circulation. 9 In a recently published report, SARS-CoV-2 has been recognised as one of the viruses associated with DKA in adults; the suggested mechanism linking the pathophysiology of DKA and SARS-CoV-2 is the interaction between the coronavirus and the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). 10 One of the key enzymes in RAAS is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which helps in converting angiotensin II to angiotensin. The lungs and the pancreas are the two organs with the highest expression of ACE2. ACE2 expression is downregulated after the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the lungs and the pancreatic b -cells. 11 As a result of this intrusion, two parallel processes may aggravate the pathophysiology of DKA. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2's direct invasion of the islet cells might lead to b-cell injury.",

In the absence of respiratory symptoms or a positive history of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, our case report highlights the possibility of discovering similar future cases due to both the in-creasing global incidence and prevalence of T1DM in general and the worsening COVID-19 pandemic in particular.

Explanation: The figure demonstrates the trends of three clinical parameters, namely heart rate, urine output, and the rate of intravenous fluid received by the patient during the first 24 h of admission at 3-hour intervals. The relatively low urine output for this diabetic patient may second the suggested interaction between the renineangiotensin system (RAS) and the coronavirus. 9, 10 In addition, this may have prevented the occurrence of a severe degree of dehydration due to the water retention effect caused by the increased synthesis of aldosterone, which is reflected by her relatively stable heart rate. the majority of paediatric cases presenting to emergency departments.
