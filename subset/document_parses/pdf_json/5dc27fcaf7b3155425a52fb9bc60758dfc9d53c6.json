When compared to their high-income country (HIC) counterparts, many African LMICs have fared well, with substantially fewer recorded infections [4] . Some of this difference may be accounted for in underreporting, because LMICs are more likely to have limitations in testing and reporting capacities [5, 6] . Younger populations and pre-existing immunity due to overall higher rates of infectious diseases, including other coronaviruses, may also have contributed to lower rates of infection [7] . It is also likely that the swift implementation and strong enforcement of effective public health practices, such as lockdowns, along with previous experiences in responding to other outbreaks, aided these countries in stemming the early spread of COVID-19 disease [8] . While employing public health tactics proved effective in the medium-term, buying these health systems valuable time to build capacity for larger responses, these strategies have resounding social, economic, and health-related impacts and are not sustainable in the longer term [9] . As lockdowns are loosened around the globe, these regions have experienced an uptick in cases [10] .",

This lack of vaccinations, in combination with previously low infection rates and nascent healthcare systems, means that the pandemic may continue for the foreseeable future in African LMICs [12] . Clinicians and health system planners need to be able to allocate limited healthcare resources as cases inevitably rise. Establishing an early understanding of a patient's likely outcome is integral to decreasing mortality in LRS, with previous evidence suggesting that risk stratification can improve patient outcomes from a range of illnesses and injuries, while reducing resource utilisation [13, 14] . While many prognostication tools have been developed for, or applied to, COVID-19 patients, no tools to date have been purpose-designed for, and validated in, truly low-resource settings (LRS). A recent review identified 39 risk stratification scores (including severity and mortality indices) being used for COVID-19 prognostication. Only two of these tools were deemed feasible for use in LRS, where laboratory and imaging are not readily available, and neither was intended for such a setting or validated in it [15] [16] [17] [18] . The enduring impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on LMICs make it essential that clinical decision-making tools with the potential to reduce mortality be made widely available. A mortality scale holds promise in aiding frontline providers in LRS in managing the pandemic SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease by allowing them to allocate potential resources that a patient will need throughout the duration of both emergency unit (EU) and hospital stays based on mortality likelihood.",

Although pulse oximetry is limited in some LRS, it is available in Sudanese referral hospitals, and local stakeholders requested its consideration for inclusion in this scale.

Two versions of the tool exist, each using seven demographic, historical, and clinical inputs to evaluate potential risk of death in COVID-19 patients. The tool is intended for frontline use and, as such, does not include clinical inputs that may take significant time to obtain or may be completely unavailable in LRS EUs, such as laboratory and imaging investigations. One version of the AFEM-CMS does, however, include pulse oximetry, which has been found to be a strong predictor of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients but has variable availability in LMICs [16, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Both versions of the tool have good discriminatory power, although associated confidence intervals are somewhat wide. While the C-statistic for the scale including oxygen saturation is somewhat higher than for the one excluding it, their confidence intervals do overlap. Given this, it is difficult to state with certainty that the model including oxygen saturation is better and should be prioritised for use in whenever possible. Some settings may have the capacity to perform pulse oximetry but have a limited number of monitors to do so; in these instances, it may be detrimental to slow down the assessment process in efforts to obtain a patient's oxygen saturation for use with the AFEM-CMS. It will be crucial that recommendations for AFEM-CMS implementation address such issues, and we emphasise that current data do not suggest significantly poorer discrimination in the tool without oxygen saturation.",

In the absence of oxygen saturation measurements, however, heart rate became significantly predictive. Heart rate is likely serving as a proxy for decreased oxygenation in the model without pulse oximetry, as it will typically increase to compensate for decreasing blood oxygen levels. Three other vital signs are included in both models: systolic blood pressure, GCS, and respiratory rate. Decreases in systolic blood pressure and consciousness are late indicators of clinical deterioration and indicate increased potential for mortality. Respiratory rate has been characterised as a key predictor in nearly all existing COVID-19 risk stratification scores, and although cut-points for significance have varied, most tools consider rates greater than approximately 20 breaths per minute as abnormal. We originally sought to stratify patients into three classes-<20, 20-29, and \u226530-as is seen in the 4C Mortality Score; however, the penalised coefficients for the 20-29 and \u226530 classes were extremely similar and generated the same weighting in both models.

For example, in the COVID-19-specific 4C Mortality Score, a mortality rate below 2% represents low risk, a rate between 2% and 14.9% represents intermediate risk, and a rate 15% and above represents high risk [29] . Our original intention was to align our scale with these widely used cut points; however, analysis of the distribution of fatalities across AFEM-CMS scores suggested that case fatality rates (CFRs) for COVID-19-patients in Sudanese hospitals were much too high for the aforementioned cut-point values to have any clinical utility. As such, substantially higher but much more clinically relevant cut points were selected that categorise patients into mortality risks of below 33%, 33% to 66%, and above 66%.",

This study, which represents the largest record review of Sudanese COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals in the literature to-date, provides key information about hospitalised patients in the country that may be of use to researchers and systems planners. It describes an extremely ill cohort of patients: A majority have at least one comorbidity, the median age is higher than the nation's general life expectancy, and most presented with some abnormal vital signs. More than half of this cohort died in-hospital. Unfortunately, it is expected that patients presenting to hospitals in Sudan with COVID-19 are very sick and at high risk of death. While mortality rates have varied widely, both geographically and temporally, in Sudan, the country has been noted to have one of the highest infection fatality rates in the Arab world: 5.7% [6] . Sudan has some of the poorest physical access to healthcare for adults in sub-Saharan Africa, with 40.9% of adults 60 years or older traveling longer than six hours to the nearest hospital [39] .

            "text": "To our knowledge, the AFEM-CMS is the first purpose-designed tool for mortality prediction of COVID-19 patients by frontline providers in extremely LRS. It is intended for rapid use at the frontlines of the response in EUs and other receiving areas of healthcare facilities where laboratory and imaging investigations are limited or unavailable. In the face of an enduring pandemic in many LMICs, the tool could serve as a practical solution to aid frontline providers in effectively allocating limited healthcare resources. However, the tool's generalisability is likely limited outside of similar LRS with similarly high fatality rates. Future work will be undertaken to validate the tool and to compare it to other scales that may be feasible in LRS as more data become available.",
