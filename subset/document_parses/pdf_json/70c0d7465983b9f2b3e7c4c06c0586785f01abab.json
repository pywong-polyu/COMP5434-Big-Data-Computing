While the incidence is unclear, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia have been reported in pediatric patients with COVID-19 [13] , and presence of these lab findings should raise suspicion for a workup for the virus. Others have reported that procalcitonin is sometimes elevated in pediatric patients with COVID-19 [10] , but this test was not sent for this infant. While our patient had a short hospitalization and good clinical outcome, there are subpopulations of children who may be at higher risk for complications [2] .

Healthcare institutions should set guidelines to ensure that proper protective equipment is provided to medical personnel to avoid exposure to healthcare workers while the diagnostic process is ongoing. In the setting of limited testing and access to protective equipment, national discussions are required to strike the right balance between identifying at-risk pediatric populations while conserving resources. Parents of SARS-CoV-2-positive children should be counseled on methods to avoid further community spread of the virus. M a n u s c r i p t 9 Funding Source: No funding was secured for this study.",
