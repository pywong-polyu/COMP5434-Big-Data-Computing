TPCs are activated by PI(3,5)P2, which is synthesized by PIKfyve. Here, we found that YM201636, a widely used PIKfyve inhibitor, potently inhibits PI(3,5)P2-induced human TPC2 channel Na + currents in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.16 \u03bcM.",

            "text": "YM201636 also effectively inhibits the currents of a constitutively open TPC2 mutant channel, whereas it exerts no effect when applied in the channel's closed state. A YM201636 analog, PI-103, an inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR, also inhibits human TPC2 with an IC50 of 0.64 \u03bcM. Substitution of the pore-constriction residues Leu690, Leu694 and Tyr312 by Ala reduced the effectiveness of YM201636 and PI-103 in channel inhibition. Interestingly, a His699 residue located near the cytosolic pore entrance is a key determinant for the TPC2 channels' sensitivity to YM201636 and PI-103, whose substitution with a Phe in the human TPC1 largely accounts for the channel's loss of inhibition by YM201636. Molecular dynamic simulation and docking analysis of YM201636's binding to TPC2 indicated that His699 can interact with the inhibitor and facilitate the channel-blockade at the cytosolic end of the pore. We conclude that YM201636 and PI-103 directly block the TPC2's open-state channel pore at the cytosolic entrance where the His699 is a key determinant for the blockers' access to the pore. These findings identify two new potent TPC2 channel blockers, reveal a channel pore entrance blockade mechanism, and provide a new protein target in interpreting the pharmacological effects of these two widely used phosphoinositide kinase inhibitors.",

Humans and mice have two functional TPC isoforms: TPC1, which is broadly expressed in different stages of endosomes and lysosomes, and TPC2, which is expressed mainly in latestage endosomes and lysosomes 1, 2 . TPCs are homodimeric cation channels whose each subunit contains two transmembrane domains of the basic structural unit (six transmembrane segments and a pore loop) of a voltage-gated ion channel. They are potently activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) [3] [4] [5] [6] , inhibited by ATP via mTORC1 7 , and slightly blockaded by cytoplasmic and luminal Mg 2+ 5 . Human TPC1 is voltage-gated and regulated by cytoplasmic and luminal Ca 2+ 8 , whereas human TPC2 is not sensitive to voltage or Ca 2+ 5 . The recently reported cryo-electron microscopic (Cryo-EM) structures of mouse TPC1 9 and human TPC2 10 have provided a structural basis for understanding TPC function.",

Similarly, PI-103 is a potent multi-target inhibitor of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTOR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) 42 . PI-103 has nearly the same chemical structure as YM201636 but without YM201636's 6-amino-nicotinamide group.

It is unclear whether TPC2-mediated NAADP and PI(3,5)P2 signaling processes can mutually affect each other. Therefore, we tested whether suppression of PI (3, 5) P2 production by application of a PIKfyve inhibitor, YM201636, affects NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ release. We observed that direct microinjection of YM201636 greatly reduced NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ elevation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A) . However, HEK293 cells' response to NAADP was largely unaffected upon microinjection of apilimod, another potent PIKfyve inhibitor (Fig. 1A) . Taking advantage of the plasma membrane-targeted TPC2 L11A/L12A mutant (TPC2 PM ) channels 9,10 , we performed an inside-out patch-clamp recording of the TPC2 PM currents to determine whether YM201636 directly acts on these channels. We observed that YM201636 application from the cytosolic side at sub-micromolar concentrations directly inhibited PI(3,5)P2-induced human TPC2 channel Na + currents (Fig. 1B) . YM201636 potently inhibited TPC2 channels in an antagonist concentration-dependent manner at a low IC50 of 0.16 \u03bcM (Fig. 1C) . YM201636's inhibition of the human TPC2 channel was voltage-independent, as shown by the similar levels of inhibition at both negative and positive voltages (Fig. 1D) .",

In this experiment, we activated the TPC currents by perfusion of the activator TPC2-A-N1 on the extracellular side. Although YM201636 at 1 \u00b5M still caused ~70% inhibition of the currents when applied from the extracellular side (Fig. 1F) , it was less potent applied from the extracellular side than when it was applied on the cytosolic side, suggesting possible action of this inhibitor from the cytosolic side. Its action from the extracellular side presumably resulted from its high lipophilicity property, which allows it to cross the membrane. Interestingly, both tetrandrine and Ned-19 inhibited TPC2 much more effectively when applied from the extracellular side, as their application at 10 \u00b5M reduced TPC2 curretnts by ~60% and 50%, respectively (Fig. 1F) . However, both tetrandrine and Ned-19, even at higher levels such as 10 \u00b5M were less effective than YM201636 at 1 \u00b5M. Nifedipine at 10 \u00b5M had no effect on TPC2 currents when applied on the extracellular side (Fig. 1F) . Therefore, we concluded that YM201636 is thus far the most potent inhibitor of human TPC2 available. In addition, given the complexity of the NAADP signaling process, which is not well understood yet, our results showed that a direct analysis of the channel activity by electrophysiology is needed to determine whether these observed effects on NAADP signaling were actually caused by the inhibitors' action on TPCs.",

We found YM201636 inhibited the human TPC2 channel quickly with a \u03c4on of ~2 s when the channels were pre-activated by PI(3,5)P2 (Fig. 2B) . The wash-off of YM201636 in the presence of PI(3,5)P2, i.e., in the open state, was slow at a \u03c4off rate of ~60 s (Fig. 2B) . To determine the state dependence of YM201636 binding to the human TPC2 channel, we applied YM201636 when the channels were in the closed state, i.e., in the absence of PI(3,5)P2 for 2 min, followed by the activation of the channels by PI (3, 5) P2 in the absence of YM201636 (Fig. 2C) . We found that the time courses of TPC2 currents activated by PI (3, 5) P2 were similar in the absence and presence of the pre-application of YM21636 ( Fig. 2A , C, and D), indicating that YM201636 cannot bind to TPC2 for channel inhibition in the closed state. To evaluate the wash-off rate of YM201636 in the channel's closed state after the channels were inhibited by YM201636, we washed the excised patches with the bath solution alone (no PI(3,5)P2 and YM201636) for different time lengths and then applied PI (3, 5) P2 to check the residual effect of YM201636 on channel activation ( Fig. 2E-G) . We found that the residual effect of YM201636 on PI(3,5)P2-induced channel activation after perfusion with the bath solution alone was washing time-dependent. The residual inhibitory effects were estimated to be 58%, 33%, and 19% after a 40-s, 80-s and 120-s wash, respectively (Fig. 2H) , a time course that was similar to that observed for the inhibition left when YM201636 was washed off in the presence of PI(3,5)P2 ( Fig. 2B) . Therefore, YM201636 can only bind to and inhibit the channels when the channels are activated, whereas its dissociation is largely independent of the presence or absence of PI(3,5)P2 or the channel's activation status.",

We were unable to obtain functional channels from the single mutation of L690A or L694A. However, the double mutant channel L690A/L694A produced Na + currents in the absence of any agonist, and application of PI(3,5)P2 did not increase the currents (Fig. 2I) , indicating that the channels are already constitutively fully open. This result provides functional evidence that these two residues are indeed involved in the formation of the activation gate. The T308A and Y312A mutant channels remained closed in the absence of an agonist and sensitive to PI(3,5)P2 for channel activation, suggesting that these two residues are less important in activation pore-gate formation. With the L690A/L694A mutant channel in the absence of an agonist, we observed that YM201636 could still reduce the channel's constitutively open currents in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 0.54 \u03bcM ( Fig. 2J and K) . This result clearly indicates that YM201636's inhibition of the human TPC2 channel is independent of activation by any ligand. This inhibitory property of YM201636 agrees with a channel pore blocker. The more than 3-fold increase of YM201636's IC50 by the L690A/L694A double mutation also suggests a role of the pore structure in TPC2 inhibition by this inhibitor. Therefore, we consider YM201636 as a TPC2 open-channel pore blocker.",

The Y312A mutation significantly increased the IC50 for TPC2 inhibition by YM2.1636, by more than 4-fold (IC50 = 0.67 \u00b5M) ( Fig. 3C and F) . The H699A mutation drastically reduced the channel's sensitivity to YM201636, as indicated by a more than 20fold increase in the IC50 (IC50 = 4.33 \u00b5M) compared to that of the wild-type channel ( Fig. 3D and F) .

These results indicate that the cytosolic-side pore-gate formation of L690, L694, and Y312 residues, together with the H699 residue located immediately outside of the pore, determines YM201636's inhibitory effect on TPC2, likely by forming the inhibitor's binding sites.",

To identify the inhibitors' binding poses around the pore entrance, we limited the docking grid space to the pore entrance region. With this docking space restriction, we were able to observe YM201636's bindings at the pore entrance region below the pore-gate with a suboptimal average affinity of -9.27 kcal/mol for the top 30 poses (Fig. 6B) . Among most (n = 26) of these 30 top poses, the imidazole ring of H699 interacted closely (within 4 \u00c5 excluding hydrogen atoms) with YM201636. The interactions with H699 appeared flexible, involving nearly all the different parts of YM201636 in different poses, suggesting that these interactions are likely dynamic. Similarly, PI-103 was also observed to bind at the pore entrance, although the averaged affinity for the top 30 poses was reduced to -8.19 kcal/mol. We selected 4 representative poses of YM201636 in complex with TPC2 (Fig. 6C) for further analysis by molecular dynamic simulations for 100 ns. For the first three simulations, the initial poses appeared to be only relative stable for only a short period, e.g., ~ 20 ns, and then became more mobile and adopted new binding modes different from the initial one. However, no full escape from the pore entrance was observed during these 100 ns simulations. For the fourth simulation, the YM201636's interactions with the channel pore became enhanced in that the inhibitor moved slightly inward the pore and kept the pore entrance blocked during the 100 ns simulation as indicated by some interactions with the pore gate region residues L694 and A309 (Fig. 6C) . With the PyContact program 44 , we performed a systematic analysis of the interactions between YM201636 and protein residues in the four 100ns simulation trajectories and found that YM201636 remained strongly interacting with H699 most time (Fig. 6D) , including H-bond interaction (20% in average). According to the mean contact score and total contact time, YM201636 interacted predominantly with R316, H699, and E695, secondarily with L698 and M320, and marginally with Y312, S313 and N696 (Fig. 6D) . The results of molecular dynamic simulations on YM201636's bindings at and near the pore entrance indicate that the inhibitor dynamically interacts with the residues around the pore entrance and can move inside the pore for more sustained channel blockade. Similar to H699, we expect that R316 and E695 also play an important role in TPC2 inhibition by YM201636. The equivalent residues of R316 and E695 in X. tropicalis TPC3 were found to be important for the channel gating via electrostatic interactions and their mutations could result in non-functional channels 45 . Because both R316A and E695A mutations in human TPC2 produced non-functional channels, we pursued no further mutational analysis on them.",

YM201636 and PI-103 act similarly on TPC2 as their inhibitory effects on the channels are similarly affected by pore mutations. Importantly, as pore blockers, YM201636 and PI-103 can block the channels in an agonist-independent manner as YM201636 inhibited NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ elevation, PI(3,5)P2-activated TPC2 currents, and mutation-induced constitutively open TPC2 channels. Furthermore, YM201636 and PI-103 are TPC2 selective, as they are much less effective on TPC1 largely because of the His \u2194 Phe switch near the cytosolic-side pore entrance (H699 on TPC2 vs. F692 on TPC1).",

Therefore, it has remained to be scrutinized whether these drugs can inhibit TPC activity directly and effectively. Direct patch-clamp recording of enlarged endolysosomes is doable but technically challenging and not efficient. With the use of mutations, both TPC2 and TPC1 channels can be targeted to the plasma membrane 4,10 , which allows inside-out or whole-cell patch-clamp recording of TPCs to be done as with plasma membrane ion channels. In this study, we took advantage of the plasma membrane-targeted TPC mutant channels to obtain large and reliable recordings of the TPC currents and test putative TPC inhibitors for their effects on TPC2. Previously, it has been unclear whether the NAADP signaling antagonist Ned-19 can directly target TPCs 34 . We found that Ned-19 can inhibit TPC2 much more effectively from the extracellular side than from the cytosolic side, which is consistent with the more extracellular side location of its binding sites in the transmembrane domain of the plant TPC1 channel structure 35 . Although 10 \u00b5M Ned-19 can produce ~50% inhibition of TPC2 currents when applied from extracellular side, its action on TPC2 on lysosomes might require treatment of the cells with much higher concentrations because of the need of crossing both plasma and lysosome membranes to act on the luminal side of the lysosomes. Unexpectedly, tetrandrine, a reportedly potent TPC inhibitor, was largely ineffective when applied from the cytosolic side. However, it did inhibit TPC2 when applied from the extracellular side, but the required 10 \u00b5M concentration for an effective 60% inhibition is 20 times higher than previously reported (0.5 \u00b5M for ~60% inhibition of lysosomal TPC2 currents) and 200 times higher than the IC50 of ~55 nM for reduction of ebolavirus infection 30 . Furthermore, we found no support for the notion 37 that CaV antagonists in general, e.g., nifedipine, inhibit TPC2, as supported by our tests from both the cytosolic and extracellular sides. Our results demonstrate the necessity of a close examination of the putative TPC modulators, particularly those obtained from Ca 2+ -imaging analysis of NAADP-induced Ca 2+ elevation. The submicromolar IC50 values of YM201636 and PI-103, 0.16 \u00b5M and 0.6 \u00b5M, respectively, are much lower than those of Ned-19 or tetrandrine whose IC50 appeared to be close to 10 \u00b5M. Therefore, we considered YM201636 and PI-103 the most potent TPC2-selective antagonists available thus far.",

            "text": "However, its inhibitory effect is independent of the mechanisms of channel activation, consistent with the property of an open-channel pore blocker. Our mutational analyses showed the importance of the L690, L694, Y312, and H699 residues located at or near the cytosolic end of the channel pore on TPC2 inhibition by YM201636 and PI-103. The role of Y312 can be easily understood as it sits at the very cytosolic end of the channel pore and its side-chain forms the port to the channel pore. Similarly, the L690A/L694A double mutation, which caused the channel to constitutively open, alters the channel pore structure and thus affects the inhibitors' potency. However, structural perturbation of the H699 residue, which sits immediately outside of the pore, produced the largest impact on the TPC inhibition by YM201636 and PI-103. Its substitution with a Phe in human TPC1 also largely accounts for the greatly reduced sensitivity to the inhibitor. The role of H699 in TPC2 inhibition by YM201636 appears to be indispensable as mutations to other amino acids, regardless of size, polarity, or charge, all resulted in a loss of the channel's sensitivity to the inhibitor to some extent. The histidine residue plays a unique role in protein structure and function. Its imidazole side chain gives rise to its unique aromaticity and acid/base properties at a physiologic pH. YM201636 and PI-103 are chemicals of multiple rings with both aromatic and some polar properties. H699 could interact with YM201636 and PI-103 via both Van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions including the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, cation-\u03c0 (if histidine is protonated), and hydrogen-\u03c0 interactions 46 . Our molecular dynamic simulation analysis suggests that H699 can interact with YM201636 and PI-103 and contribute to the inhibitors' initial docking around the pore entrance. Overall, our data favor the possibility that YM201636 binding and blockade mainly occur at the cytosolic end of the pore as mutations deep in the pore had much less effect, and the H699 residue, which is immediately outside the pore, plays a key role in inhibition by interactions with the inhibitors around the pore entrance, allowing the inhibitor to block ion conductance directly at the pore entrance and/or alternatively serve as initial docking sites to facilitate the inhibitors to bind inside the pore. The slower process of YM201636's wash-off than its wash-on agrees with the notion that the inhibitor initially binds and blocks the channel at or near the pore entrance and then moves more inside the pore for more sustained channel blockade.",

            "text": "using the reported human TPC2 Cryo-EM structures 10 directly. With the whole proteins included in the grid space for docking and a cut-off affinity of -8.5 kcal/mol, YM201636 molecule docked inside the channel pore was observed in 13 out of 34 poses for the PI(3,5)P2-bound open-state structure (PBD ID:6NQ0), 3 out of 22 poses for the PI(3,5)P2-bound closed-state structure (PBD ID:6NQ2), and none out of 7 for apo/closed-state structure (PBD ID:6NQ1). This result is consistent with our finding of the requirement of the channel's open-state for channel inhibition by YM201636. Thus, we focused on docking analysis of YM201636's bindings on the PI(3,5)P2-bound open-state structure. Most molecular docking programs including AutoDock Vina treat the receptor proteins as rigid bodies to be computation efficient but at a cost of limitation in accuracy because of the dynamic nature of protein-ligand binding involving the protein's local conformational changes in binding. To better identify the inhibitors' binding sites in the TPC2 open structure, we first performed a molecular dynamic simulation of the PI(3,5)P2-bound human TPC2 open-state structure (PDB: 6NQ0) 10 . After simulation for 200 ns, we clustered the trajectory structural frames from the last 50 ns of the simulation and generated 76 representative snapshots of the simulated dynamic structures. With them, we performed virtual molecular docking analyses individually via the AutoDock Vina program and allowed the output of the top 20 poses based on calculated affinity. Among the ~1500 generated poses, we chose the 30 poses with the highest affinity for visual examination and further analysis. If the whole region of the channel pore was included in the grid space for docking, the top 30 poses had an average affinity of -11.05 kcal/mol, and all YM201636",

To facilitate identification of transfected cells, an IRES-containing bicistronic vector, pCDNA6-TPC2-V5-IRES-AcGFP 18 , was used in the electrophysiological experiments. Mutations were made with QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies). Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids with transfection reagent of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or polyethylenimine \"Max\" (PEI Max from Polysciences) and subjected to experiments within 16-48 h after transfection. For the cell health of the mutant L690A/694A after transfection, 2.0 \u00b5M YM201636 was added into the complete serum medium to block TPC2. For human TPC1 channels, pEGFP-C1 was cotransfected at the same time to identify transfected cells for patch clamp recording. Cells were treated with 1% trypsin 4-6 h after transfection and seeded on polylysine-treated glass coverslips soaked in an incubator until recording.",

            "text": ". Briefly, cells were co-transfected with cDNA constructs of human TPC2 and the Ca 2+ reporter GCaMP6f, and the transfected cells were identified by GCaMP6f fluorescence. Fluorescence was monitored with an Axio Observer A1 microscope equipped with an AxioCam MRm digital camera and ZEN Blue MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). To minimize interference by contaminated Ca 2+ , the pipette solution was always treated with Chelex 100 resin (#C709, Sigma-Aldrich) immediately before use. Microinjection (0.5 s at 150 hPa) was made ~30 s after pipette tip insertion into cells. Only cells that showed no response to mechanical puncture, i.e., no change in GCaMP6f fluorescence for ~30 s, were chosen for pipette solution injection. Successful injection was verified by fluorescence of the co-injected Texas Red. Elevation in intracellular Ca 2+ concentration was reported by a change in fluorescence intensity measured as \u2206F/F0, calculated from NAADP microinjection-induced maximal changes in fluorescence (\u2206F at the peak) divided by the fluorescence immediately before microinjection (F0).ElectrophysiologyThe HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasma membrane-targeted TPC2 L11A/L12A or TPC1 L11A/I12A mutant channels. Human TPC1 or TPC2 channel currents were acquired at room temperature with EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA) by inside-out patch-clamp recording of excised plasma membranes.For inside-out recording, the bath solution contained 145 mM KMeSO3, 5 mM NaCl, and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.35), and the pipette solution contained 145 mM NaMeSO3, 5 mM NaCl, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.35). For the constitutively open L690A/694A mutant TPC2 or human TPC1 channel, the solutions were switched, i.e., the K + -based solution was used as the pipette solution, and the Na + -based solution was used in the bath instead. Patch pipettes were polished with a resistance of 2-3 M\u03a9 for recording. Similarly, for whole-cell recording to allow drug application on the extracellular side, the K + -based solution was used as the pipette solution, and the Na + -based solution was used in the bath. The TPC2 and TPC1 channel currents were elicited by perfusion of PtdIns(3,5)P2 diC8 (#P-3058, Echelon) on the intracellular side in inside-out recording or by perfusion of TPC2-A1-N (MedChemExpress) on the extracellular side in whole-cell recording with a voltage ramp protocol of -120 mV to +120 mV over 200 ms for every 2 s. All reagents were purchased commercially: PI-103 (#1728; Biovision), nifedipine (#21829-25-4; Tocris), YM201636 (#sc-204193; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), apilimod (#sc-480051; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), tetrandrine (#sc-201492; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and trans-Ned-19 (#1354235-96-3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Dose curves were fitted by the Hill logistic equation. \u03c4on and \u03c4off were acquired from singe exponential fitting.Molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamic simulationMolecular docking analyses of the bindings of the inhibitor YM201636 on TPC2 channel structures were performed using AutoDock Vina program43 according to the developers' instructions with Cryo-EM structures (PDB IDs: 6NQ0, 6NQ2 and 6NQ1) of human TPC2 10 either directly or after molecular dynamic simulation in the closed state in the presence of and the absence of PI(3,5)P2 (PDB ID: 6NQ2 and 6NQ1) 10 . For molecular dynamic simulation, the Cryo-EM structure of human TPC2 in the open state in complex with PI(3,5)P2 (PDB ID: 6NQ0) was used. The missed flexible C-terminus (residues 702-752) in the original structure was added by modeling with the GalaxyFill algorithm 49 integrated in the CHARMM-GUI webserver 50 . The protein/lipid/solvent systems and input files for molecular dynamic simulation were generated with the CHARMM-GUI webserver 50 . The structural model was embedded in a lipid bilayer of 1palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) within a water box containing 0.15 M KCl in which the protein charges were neutralized with K + or Clions. The molecular dynamic simulation was carried out with Gromacs 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5053220) 51 and the CHARMM36m forcefield",
