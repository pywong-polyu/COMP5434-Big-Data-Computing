The aim of the present study was to investigate intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as well as the predictors of such intentions. A representative sample of the Norwegian population (N = 1,003, 49.5% females, M age = 47.9, SD = 17.1) filled in an online questionnaire assessing the components of the Theory of planned behavior (attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control), as well as optimistic bias and anticipated regret. Results showed that a majority (61.6%) of participants intend to get vaccinated. Regression analysis revealed that intentions were predicted by positive attitudes toward vaccination (\u03b2 = 0.31, p < 0.001), subjective norms in favor of vaccination in one's family (\u03b2 = 0.23, p < 0.001), perceived behavioral control (\u03b2 = 0.09, p < 0.001), and by anticipated net regret (\u03b2 = 0.32, p < 0.001), explaining 69% (f 2 = 2.23) of the variance in intentions. Optimistic bias did not predict intentions.",

(2020) found the following predictors of vaccination intentions in a sample of United Kingdom adults: more positive COVID-19 vaccination beliefs and attitudes, less concerns regarding vaccination side effects, greater perceived information sufficiency to make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination, increased risk perceptions of COVID-19 to others (but not risk to oneself), older age, and having been vaccinated for influenza last winter (2019/20). Vaccination rejection correlated with the belief the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, and with inadequate health literacy and lower education in an Australian study (Dodd et al., 2021) and with mistrust of vaccine benefit, worry about unforeseen future effects, concerns about commercial profiteering from pharmaceutical companies, and preferences for natural immunity in a North American study (Taylor et al., 2020) .",

According to the TPB intentions are the direct precursor of behavior, and are in turn determined by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Attitudes are defined as the individual's cognitive and affective evaluation of a given behavior as either positive or negative. Subjective norms represent the individual's perceived social pressure to perform that behavior and consist of injunctive norms (describing how people should act) and descriptive norms (describing how people actually act).

According to Regret theory (Bell, 1982 (Bell, , 1985 Sugden, 1982, 1987) people anticipate the feelings they might experience once the outcome of a decision becomes apparent. Foreseeing possible unwanted outcomes of an alternative may lead decision makers to anticipate regret and shun that option. A meta-analysis (Brewer et al., 2016) has shown anticipated regret to affect various types of health behaviors including vaccination. For vaccination, the analysis showed that ratings of anticipated regret from vaccination were generally lower than ratings of anticipated regret from not vaccinating. This might be explained by the fact that people anticipate less regret and self-blame for easily justifiable decisions than for less justifiable ones (Zeelenberg and Pieters, 2007) .",

Findings are comparable to Brewer et al. (2007) who in a meta-analysis of vaccination behavior for various infectious diseases found vaccination rates to vary between 6 and 86% (with a median uptake of 51%). Vaccination rates for seasonal influenza in Norway are somewhat lower than the reported intentions in the present study, about 38% for those above the age of 65 in 2019 (OECD, 2021). Intentions to get vaccinated are mainly predicted by positive attitudes toward vaccination as well as the degree to which anticipated regret for non-vaccination outweighs anticipated regret for vaccination. Another predictor of intentions was one measure of perceived behavioral control, i.e., perceived capability, but not perceived autonomy. Subjective norms toward vaccination within one's family, but not among one's friends predicted vaccination intentions. Together these variables explain 69% of the variance in intentions. Neither perceived relative susceptibility nor seriousness, nor optimistic bias predicted intentions to vaccinate. This is in line with Sherman et al.'s (2020) findings which showed that participants were more willing to vaccinate against COVID-19 when they perceived greater risk for others, but not for themselves. Findings are, however, in contrast with other research that has found increased risk perceptions and increased vulnerability to predict protective health behaviors including vaccination (Brewer et al., 2007) . Since COVID-19 may not constitute a significant risk for the majority of respondents, vaccination intentions might be predicted by a motivation to protect others rather than a motivation to protect oneself. This would contrast with other diseases where research has found that increased perceived vulnerability does predict vaccination uptake (Brewer et al., 2007) . Note also that we measured relative susceptibility and seriousness, i.e., perceived vulnerability compared to that of others in one's age group. We therefore do not know whether absolute perceived susceptibility and seriousness are high or low in the population. These variables were assessed this way to obtain a measure of optimistic bias, as this has been suggested to predict vaccination (Bond and Nolan, 2011; Dubov and Phung, 2015) . Optimistic bias, however, did not predict vaccination intentions in the regression model. This finding would be expected if vaccination against COVID-19 is motivated by the protection of others, not oneself. Optimistic bias may still play a role in vaccination behavior regarding other diseases. Anticipated regret was found to be one of the strongest predictors of intentions to vaccinate. This is in line with previous research, and as in previous research, it was found that anticipated regret was lower for getting vaccinated (action regret) than for NOT getting vaccinated (inaction regret) (Brewer et al., 2016) . As pointed out earlier, this might be explained by the fact that people anticipate less regret and self-blame for easily justifiable decisions (e.g., virtues, health promoting behavior) than for less justifiable ones (e.g., vices, risk behavior) (Zeelenberg and Pieters, 2007) . It was also found that net-regret (the degree to which anticipated regret for NOT getting vaccinated outweighed regret for getting vaccinated) was the strongest predictor of intentions, followed by positive attitudes toward vaccination.",

To the degree that anticipated regret is determined by the possibility of negative outcomes of the chosen option, regret for getting vaccinated and for NOT getting vaccinated should correlate positively. This is because the greater the disadvantages of not vaccinating the population are, the greater side effects of vaccination will be accepted by society. The paradoxical negative correlation in the population could be explained by the affect heuristic (Finucane et al., 2000; Slovic et al., 2007) . According to this heuristic people use their affective reaction toward a stimulus to judge its' risk and benefits. Liking something leads to an evaluation of that stimulus as low in risk and high in benefits, while disliking something leads to an evaluation of the stimulus as high in risk and low in benefits. In this way risks and benefits end up being negatively correlated in people's minds, even though they are positively related in the real world. That is, society accepts high risks technologies or activities only if benefits are high as well (Finucane et al., 2000) .",

These items were planned as a compound measure of perceived behavioral control but did not correlate. Furthermore, perceived vulnerability was measured in relative (compared to others) not absolute terms. Therefore, we do not know whether the perceived risk of COVID-19 is high or low in the population. Measures were constructed this way to assess optimistic bias. In hindsight, COVID-19 may not be a disease that lends itself well to assessing whether optimistically biased people are less inclined to get vaccinated, simply because the disease does not constitute a significant risk for most people, at least not in Norway (Folkehelseinstituttet, 2020) .",

If this is the case, interventions aimed at increasing vaccination uptake for COVID-19 should not focus too much on how the disease may harm the individual, but rather on how the disease may harm others, like elderly family members, or society at large, and on how high vaccination rates will protect those that are at risk. Focusing on benefits of vaccination for older family members may also increase social norms in favor of vaccination within one's family, which is another potential predictor of vaccination uptake. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the TPB explains a large proportion of intentions to get vaccinated.
