            "text": "Background: There is concern that the PUFA composition of readyto-use therapeutic food (RUTF) for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is suboptimal for neurocognitive recovery. Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that RUTF made with reduced amounts of linoleic acid, achieved using high-oleic (HO) peanuts without added DHA (HO-RUTF) or with added DHA (DHA-HO-RUTF), improves cognition when compared with standard RUTF (S-RUTF). Methods: A triple-blind, randomized, controlled clinical feeding trial was conducted among children with uncomplicated SAM in Malawi with 3 types of RUTF: DHA-HO-RUTF, HO-RUTF, and S-RUTF. The primary outcomes, measured in a subset of subjects, were the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) global z-score and a modified Willatts problem-solving assessment (PSA) intention score for 3 standardized problems, measured 6 mo and immediately after completing RUTF therapy, respectively. MDAT domain zscores, plasma fatty acid content, anthropometry, and eye tracking were secondary outcomes. Comparisons were made between the novel PUFA RUTFs and S-RUTF. Results: Among the 2565 SAM children enrolled, mean global MDAT z-scores were -0.69 \u00b1 1.19 and -0.88 \u00b1 1.27 for children receiving DHA-HO-RUTF and S-RUTF, respectively (difference 0.19, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.38). Children receiving DHA-HO-RUTF had higher gross motor and social domain z-scores than those receiving S-RUTF. The PSA problem 3 scores did not differ by dietary group (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.67, 1.26 for DHA-HO-RUTF). After 4 wk of treatment, plasma phospholipid EPA and \u03b1-linolenic acid were greater in children consuming DHA-HO-RUTF or HO-RUTF when compared with S-RUTF (for all 4 comparisons P values < 0.001), but only plasma DHA was greater in DHA-HO-RUTF than S-RUTF (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Treatment of uncomplicated SAM with DHA-HO-RUTF resulted in an improved MDAT score, conferring a cognitive benefit 6 mo after completing diet therapy. This treatment should be explored in operational settings. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03094247.",

            "text": "Dietary \u03c9-3 PUFAs are essential to normal brain development and function. Brain accretion of the key neural structural component, \u03c9-3 DHA, accelerates in the third trimester of gestation and continues until the age of 18 y (3, 4) . Tissue DHA is derived from either preformed dietary DHA or a precursor, typically plant-derived \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA). ALA is less efficient in supplying brain DHA than dietary DHA (5) (6) (7) . Omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) is metabolized by the same desaturases (FADS2, FADS1) and elongases (ELOVL2, ELOVL5) as \u03c9-3 PUFAs, and uses the same pathways to incorporate into membranes (8, 9) . LA intake required to eliminate overt clinical abnormalities and support growth in infants is about 2% of energy or about 1% of fatty acids from diets deriving half their energy from fat (10) . RUTF and breastmilk are examples of such diets. Suppression of \u03c9-3 PUFA tissue accretion by excess dietary LA is an impactful clinical phenomenon (11) . High LA dietary vegetable oils create a metabolic demand for all \u03c9-3 PUFAs, thus requiring higher dietary DHA intake to produce similar tissue DHA concentrations (12) .",

Perinatal brain development depends on a balanced supply of brain-specific nutrients. Overwhelming amounts of LA in vegetable oils suppress trace amounts of ALA when the brain is rapidly accreting DHA. This inhibits neurobehavioral development at the levels of gene expression, hormonal balance, affect, and adaptive responses to environmental cues (13) . Omega-3-deficient diets cause poor impulse control leading to potentiated stress response, increased depression and aggression, and poorer cognitive performance (14) (15) (16) . Evidence-based guidelines include EPA and DHA supplements as a treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and major depressive disorder (17, 18) .",

This deleterious effect is observed in all domains of the MDAT, except for the social domain. The magnitude of the insult suggests that a frameshift in thinking and approach may well be warranted with respect to SAM treatment and recovery. The focus on cognitive recovery must rise to equal importance as anthropometric recovery to enable the child to thrive. The distribution of MDAT scores in children aged <1 y mirrors a healthy population (Supplemental Figure 2 ) and offers hope that improvements in treatment may avert long-term disabilities. The increase seen in MDAT by the inclusion of less LA and more DHA in RUTF is encouraging and actionable. Differences seen between dietary groups were not dramatic (Supplemental Figure  1 ) when compared with the SAM insult. Our results report a functional benefit that extends the importance of our previous biochemical results, indicating that children recovering from SAM require a source of DHA to ameliorate the cognitive insult (19, 37) .",

In a previous study, MDAT domain scores were reported in Malawian SAM children upon discharge from the hospital (23) . All 4 domain scores were remarkably lower among hospitalized SAM children than in our population. The MUAC of these hospitalized children was 11.5 cm, similar to that in our population, although the clinical status due to infectious complications was likely worse. These findings lead us to speculate that significant improvements in MDAT occur after discharge and that maximizing the potential for cognitive recovery should be a primary goal in malnutrition programs.",

In this study, half of the healthy infants achieved a perfect score on the PSA on all 3 attempts. This is in contrast to our results, wherein only 15% of children achieved a perfect score on any attempt. This suggests the presence of a substantial cognitive deficit at the time of anthropometric recovery. Our PSA was conducted using this very same problem and protocol, and with a sample size increased 3-fold, as previously reported, so it is unlikely the failure to detect differences is the result of methodological flaws. Rather, PSA problem 3 was beyond the intellectual capacity of most children tested. Subsequent use of PSA in SAM should explore its timing relative to anthropometric recovery and the potential utility of repeated testing.",

However, most children recovering from SAM worldwide consume little else but RUTF, and RUTF should meet the needs of such children. Our study population developed SAM largely because of food insecurity. Children in whom chronic illness or excessive inflammation precipitated SAM might not realize similar cognitive benefits of DHA-HO-RUTF. The use of different cognitive assessments at single time points limited the ability to interpret the dynamic nature of cognitive recovery. Food stock-outs resulted in imbalanced randomization, potentially introducing bias. Reanalysis of the sample enrolled outside of these stock-outs did not show evidence of bias. Finally, there was loss to follow-up between SAM outcome and MDAT assessment 6 mo later. We do not suspect this loss to follow-up differentially affected the intervention groups.

Importantly, the effective intervention was to supply RUTF with DHA and with limited LA when recovery food was supplying calories and protein needed to restart a normal or even accelerated trajectory of neurocognitive development. The brain substitutes \u03c9-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA6) for DHA when dietary LA is surfeit and \u03c9-3 is limiting.

This finding is consonant with a body of evidence that extends over many decades, methodologies, and species. Perhaps the most compelling evidence is found in the composition of breast milk. The need to enhance cognitive recovery in SAM is substantial, even crucial, as this insult affects tens of millions of children annually. At present, \u223c85 million children worldwide will develop SAM in the first 5 y of their life, a number roughly equal to the burden of all childhood developmental delays. Changing the composition of RUTF to reduce the insult of SAM is safe, feasible, and effective.
