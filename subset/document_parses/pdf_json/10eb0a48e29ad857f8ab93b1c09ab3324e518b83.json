The development of the ABLE intervention program and feasibility aspects related to content and delivery have been addressed in previous studies. This pilot study addressed remaining uncertainties including evaluation of trial procedures (recruitment and randomisation), adherence, access to information on usual occupational therapy and feasibility of additional outcome measurements. What are the key feasibility findings? The procedures for recruitment and randomisation were feasible; the ABLE intervention program was adherently delivered; and almost all the desired information on usual occupational therapy was accessible. In terms of the feasibility of outcome measurements, the administration of the ADL-Questionnaire (ADL-Q) in this client population was associated with challenges, whereas the Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ11) and Client Weighted Problems questionnaire (CWP) were appropriate. What are the implications of the feasibility findings for the design of the main study? The study results implied a need for a few adjustments related to inclusion criteria, extraction of information on usual occupational therapy and to the outcome measurements. A full-scale randomised controlled trial is recommended.",

A recent register-based study [1] has revealed that 65.5% of Danish residents, aged 16 or above, have one or more chronic condition. Several studies provide evidence to support that persons with chronic conditions generally experience problems performing activities of daily living (ADL) tasks [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . This is also reflected in the definition of chronic conditions proposed by Goodman et al.: 'Conditions that last 1 year or more and require ongoing medical attention and/or limit activities of daily living' [10] . ADL involve tasks that most people need to perform in their everyday lives, including personal and instrumental ADL tasks [11] .",

            "text": "Personal ADL involve basic self-care tasks that are necessary to perform for all people across gender, age, culture and interests. Examples are eating, toileting, grooming and dressing. Instrumental ADL tasks involve more complex household chores, necessary for independent living, including shopping, cooking, cleaning and doing laundry [12] . Addressing ADL task performance problems is a core element in occupational therapy and results from studies indicate that occupational therapy interventions in general may improve ADL ability among older persons with various chronic conditions [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, rigorous studies, testing the outcomes of occupational therapy for persons living with chronic conditions experiencing ADL task performance problems are limited [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . A scoping review on occupational therapy for chronic conditions [14] suggested that similar interventions addressing ADL may be applicable across a range of diagnoses. In support of this, a study examining self-reported quality of ADL task performance among n = 593 persons living with chronic conditions [18, 19] , found similar types of ADL task performance problems across a range of chronic conditions. Hence, there was a need to develop a generic intervention program to address decreased ADL ability across chronic conditions causing disability. Accordingly, the research program \"A better everyday life\", launched in 2015, aims to develop and evaluate an occupational therapy intervention program (named ABLE) focusing on enhancing the ADL ability among persons living with chronic conditions experiencing ADL task performance problems. The research program is guided by the British Medical Research Council's (MRC) guidance on how to develop and evaluate complex interventions [20] . The guidance prescribes four stages: (1) Development, (2) Feasibility/piloting, (3) Evaluation, and (4) Implementation [20] .",

The manual was revised, applying results from the feasibility study and also incorporating updates of the theoretical framework OTIPM [28] underpinning the intervention. To examine the revised ABLE manual in terms of any aspect that could lead to confusion or misunderstanding among OTs delivering the program, a cognitive debriefing [35] was conducted.

Data on adherence to program was limited with no opportunity to gather further data. Thus, results of adherence to intervention program was based on information from registration forms related to two completed and three interrupted ABLE interventions. Data on appropriateness of outcome measurements was limited, based on baseline evaluations of 13 participants. Due to the limited data, a supplementary group interview with assessors on their experiences from baseline assessments was conducted. As the number of baseline ADL-Q data was insufficient for generating ADL-Q measures, they could not be reported. Results of information on usual occupational therapy were based on three completed cases. Therefore, information from client records on another seven clients, representative for the study sample and receiving usual occupational therapy interventions before the pilot study, were included.

OTs were overall satisfied delivering the ABLE intervention. Moreover, adherence was sufficient since the minimum number of sessions, the mandatory assessments and intervention components for good quality of ABLE 2.0 intervention delivery, were applied by the OTs. Additionally, it was possible to extract almost all the desired information on usual occupational therapy from the client records. Concerning the outcome measurements, the application of ADL-Q in this client population was associated with challenges, whereas the OBQ11 and CWP were eligible.",

Striving at recruiting persons who seem to match the aims of the intervention and a sample as less biased as possible [44] , it is suggested to reduce the amount of questionnaires rather than exclude persons being on the edge of this criteria.

Hence, their sensory losses introduced a risk to quality of data, preventing them from participation in the study. Accordingly, the exclusion criteria on 'language barriers' should be adjusted to 'communication barriers'. Another three persons, referred, were not included due to lack of motivation. The legislation in Denmark prescribes that persons, who apply for home care to assist with household chores, instead as a standard procedure are referred to reablement, a time-limited intervention provided in people's homes to support reacquisition of skills to manage their household chores [45] . Being referred to intervention rather than receiving the requested home care, may have resulted in a higher number of potential participants at entrance of the pilot study, who not all were motivated for participating in the program. Furthermore, research indicate that elderly persons who are frail and have decreased health are more difficult to recruit into research [44, 46] , as reflected in the progression criteria of 50% on recruitment in this pilot study. Knowing that differences between participants and non-participants might bias the results of a future RCT and decrease external validity [44] , much attention should be paid on recruitment in a future trial.",

Thus, the inherent flexibility in ABLE 2.0 is regarded a strength. Results of the present pilot study related to dose (sessions delivered, intervention components implemented and time use) was quite in line with the positive results from the ABLE feasibility study on the same aspects. Hence, the minimum of five sessions should be maintained. The biggest challenge on outcome measurements in the ABLE 2.0 pilot was related to answering the ADL-Q performance and satisfaction scales, as only 4 of 13 scored the performance scale, and two of 13 scored the satisfaction scale. Fortunately, we learned from the former feasibility study [23] that the interview-based equivalent, ADL-I, is feasible in this population. Hence, the use of ADL-I seems more appropriate to use in this population as it likely provides more complete datasets. Previous research has shown that measures of ADL ability is dependent on the methods applied with questionnaire and interview yielding different but related information about ADL ability [2] . The pattern is a higher self-reported ADL ability based on questionnaire compared with interview [2] . Thus, it is recommended to replace the ADL-Q with the ADL-I, evaluating selfreported ADL ability in terms of performance and satisfaction in a future trial. Furthermore, this will ease the participants\u00b4burden related to answering questionnaires.",

[41] suggest describing usual care in a trial with the same level of detail as in the intervention group. But usual care is by nature a dynamic phenomenon. Therefore, it is unlikely that all participants in a control group will receive the same usual care, and furthermore, usual care typically reflects locally adapted practices and may vary at different time points during a trial [40, 49] . Hence, description of usual occupational therapy, based on retrospective investigation on what was delivered to participants receiving usual occupational therapy, should be optimal in a future trial. Information on actual duration of each visit could be requested documented in a future RCT, providing data that are comparable to information gathered during the ABLE intervention. Due to lack of accessibility to information on programmatic and/or clinical changes in the client records in the municipality, it is recommended to conduct short and focused interviews on this aspect, with OTs delivering usual occupational therapy, after the intervention period in a future RCT. Also, it is recommended that data collection on usual occupational therapy is conducted by research staff assisted by a person from the Rehabilitation Unit in the municipality, familiar with clinical practice and client records, to extract information on all possible aspects. Finally, it is recommended to maintain the study-specific schedule developed for this pilot, to collect consistent data on usual occupational therapy interventions.",
