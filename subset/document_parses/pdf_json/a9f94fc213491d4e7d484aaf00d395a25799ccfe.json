The aim of this study was to determine the infectivity of a model human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 in the presence of climbing chalk powder on a dry plastic surface. The stability of HCoV-OC43 on a plastic surface dusted with climbing chalk powders (magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate or a blended chalk) was determined by titration on BHK-21 fibroblast cells. No chalk and no virus controls were included. HCoV-OC43 was stable on the plastic surface for 48 h. The stability of HCoV-OC43 was significantly (P \u2264 0\u00c105) reduced in the presence of magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate and the chalk blend; the infectivity was reduced by \u22652\u00c129 log 10 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) immediately upon on contact and by \u22652\u00c146 log 10 TCID 50 within 1 h of contact.

In this study, infectious virus was recovered from the chalk by resuspension in PBS and centrifuging to remove excess chalk. This method was employed to minimize the cytotoxicity of the chalk and allow syringe filtration of the viral supernatant to avoid bacterial contamination. In order to validate the recovery method, the distribution of viral RNA between the supernatant and the chalk pellet after 0 min contact were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). A significantly greater (P \u2264 0\u00c105) number of viral RNA was present in the magnesium carbonate supernatant compared to the pellet, where 80\u00c13 AE 2\u00c14% of the total RNA was recovered in the supernatant compared to the pellet. There was no significant difference (P > 0\u00c105) in the recovery of HCoV-OC43 between calcium carbonate and blended chalk supernatants and pellets, with 50\u00c15 AE 16\u00c14% and 39\u00c14 AE 9\u00c17% of the total viral RNA being recovered in the respective supernatants compared to the pellets. Although a proportion of the viral RNA was lost within the chalk pellet, removal of excess chalk could not be avoided due to cytotoxicity of the chalk against the mammalian cell lines. These results do not change the observations of an overall loss in infectivity of HCoV-OC43 on exposure to the chalk; theoretically if virus from the pellet was also recovered, the maximum increase in infectivity in the blended chalk condition at 0 min would be to 2\u00c19 log 10 TCID 50 per sample (from \u22642\u00c15 log 10 TCID 50 per sample) assuming 39\u00c14% recovery, which still results in approximately a 2 log 10 reduction. It is important to note that detection of nucleic acids does not distinguish between infective and inactive virus and therefore it was not possible to ascertain the TCID 50 sample \u00c01 of HCoV-OC43 within the pellet. Moreover the behaviour of the virus within the pellet would also be in line with those in the supernatant and therefore the majority are likely be noninfectious.",

There do not appear to be any studies in the published literature on the antiviral activity of climbing chalk powders. Magnesium carbonate (1 mg ml \u00c01 suspension) was previously reported to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was in part attributed to its alkalinity (Welch et al. 2016 ). Further research is required to determine the mechanism by which HCoV-OC43 is inhibited by climbing chalk powders. The inactivation of HCoV-OC43 could potentially be attributed to desiccation of the virus, due to the hygroscopic nature of magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate, and/or the alkalinity. Desiccation has been hypothesized to lead to phase changes, peroxide formation and other reactions within the lipid envelope of coronaviruses, leading to denaturation (Casanova et al. 2010) and thereby preventing interaction with host cells. In accordance, previous research has indicated that HCoV-OC43 is more stable in suspension compared to dry conditions, remaining infectious for 2 to 3 days suspended in culture media compared to less than three hours dried onto aluminium, sponge or latex gloves; a similar pattern was also observed for HCoV-229E (Sizun et al. 2000) . Another potential hypothesis is that binding of HCoV-OC43 to fine chalk particles may prevent attachment to and/or entry into the cells, thus rendering the virus noninfectious.",

There is limited published research on the quantity of infectious virus that is shed by COVID-19 patients and therefore a realistic infectious viral load for contaminated surfaces has not been fully ascertained. Previous work on influenza demonstrated that the infectious viral load of one cough was 5 plaque-forming units ml \u00c01 (Lindsley et al. 2010) , suggesting that 5 log 10 TCID 50 per ml may be greater than that encountered under realistic conditions. However, the use of a 5 log 10 TCID 50 per ml inoculum allows viral titre reductions to be monitored above the detection limit of this assay, and can therefore be used to infer the viral stability in the presence of chalk under real life conditions.",

HCoV-OC43 reduces naturally on the plastic surface over time, decreasing by 0\u00c163 log 10 TCID 50 immediately on contact and 1\u00c105 log 10 TCID 50 within one hour, which is significantly less than on contact with the chalk. This suggests that coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 or SARS-CoV-2 are likely inactivated by climbing chalk, limiting the risk of potential fomite transmission. Further research into the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in climbing chalk would enhance our understanding of COVID-19 transmission risks.",
