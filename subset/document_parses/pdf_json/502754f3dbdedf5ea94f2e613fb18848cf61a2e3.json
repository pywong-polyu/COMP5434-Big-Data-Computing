            "text": "Owing to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide at the end of 2019, the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine became an urgent need. In this study, we developed a type 9 adeno-associated virus vectored vaccine candidate expressing a dimeric receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) and evaluated its immunogenicity in a murine model. The vaccine candidate, named AAV9-RBD virus, was constructed by inserting a signal peptide to the N-terminus of two copies of RBD, spaced by a linker, into the genome of a type 9 adeno-associated virus. In vitro assays showed that HeLa cells infected by the recombinant AAV virus expressed high levels of the recombinant RBD protein, mostly found in the cell culture supernatant. The recombinant AAV9-RBD virus was cultured and purified. The genome titer of the purified recombinant AAV9-RBD virus was determined to be 2.4 \u00d7 10 13 genome copies/mL (GC/ mL) by Q-PCR. Balb/c mice were immunized with the virus by intramuscular injection or nasal drip administration. Eight weeks after immunization, neutralizing antibodies against the new coronavirus pseudovirus were detected in the sera of all mice; the mean neutralizing antibody EC 50 values were 517.7 \u00b1 292.1 (n=10) and 682.8 \u00b1 454.0 (n=10) in the intramuscular injection group and nasal drip group, respectively. The results of this study showed that the recombinant AAV9-RBD virus may be used for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the coronavirus family that had never been reported in humans previously (Zhu et al., 2020) . After infecting a human body, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe inflammation in the lungs and even death. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein, thus triggering a viral invasion of the host cells (Zhou et al., 2020) . At present, RBD has become an important target for the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al., 2020) . The RBD-based protein subunit vaccine (Min and Sun, 2021; Yang et al., 2021) and mRNA vaccine (Tai et al., 2020; Karpenko et al., 2021) have achieved good clinical results, exhibiting excellent immunogenicity in animal models and humans. At least one such vaccine is authorized for emergency use (Yang et al., 2021) . Several mRNA vaccines or adenovirus vectored vaccines-based on the full length S protein are also licensed for use as this article is being written.",

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is derived from non-pathogenic wild-type AAV, in which rep, which is related to replication, and cap, which encodes the shell protein, are replaced by foreign genes. After inoculation into a human body, recombinant adeno-associated viruses carrying the exogenous gene can continuously express the antigen in the human cells for more than 3 years (Pasi et al., 2020) and even up to 15 years (George et al., 2020) . In 2012, the EMA (European Medicines Agency) approved Glybera (rAAV1 as the vector) for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency. In 2017, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) unanimously approved Luxturna (rAAV2 as the vector) for the treatment of Leber congenital amaurosis. In 2019, the FDA approved Zolgensma (rAAV9 as the vector) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in children. As of November 2018, a total of 145 clinical trials involving rAAV were registered in ClinicalTrials.gov . Because of its advantages, including low immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, wide host range, stable physical and chemical properties, and ability to express exogenous genes over the long-term (van der Laan et al., 2011; Dismuke et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2019) , rAAV is considered as a safe and effective virus vector (Schultz et al., 2008; Donsante et al., 2007) . It has been widely used in clinical trials for gene therapy (Rakoczy et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2016; George et al., 2017; Mueller et al., 2017; Rangarajan et al., 2017) and the recombinant adeno-associated virus may be also effectively used for vaccine development (Demminger et al., 2020) .",

After the recombinant adeno-associated virus infects cells, it releases its viral DNA into the cell, synthesizes the complementary chain after entering the nucleus, and connects the head and tail into a ring, to form a double-stranded chain, which can exist in the free form in mammalian cells for a long time without being degraded as exogenous DNA (Carter, 2004; Penaud-Budloo et al., 2008) , thus achieving the long-term and stable expression of exogenous genes. At present, there are 12 AVV serotypes (AAV1 to AAV 12) and more than 130 mutants of AAV in existence (Daya and Berns, 2008) . Different AAV serotypes have different spatial structures, capsid protein sequences and tissue specificities. Hence, the cell surface receptors that recognize and bind to the AAV are also different, which results in different cell types being transfected by different serotypes of AAV with varying infection efficiencies (Mohan et al., 2003; Burger et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2006) . We selected the AAV9 virus, which had a relatively wide tissue tropism, for constructing the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, as it would enable us provide a low dose of viral inoculum to achieve a desirable immunity and safety. In 2019, the FDA approved the recombinant AAV9 drug Zolgensma, produced by Novartis, for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in children, which demonstrated the safety of this vector. The viral shell of recombinant AAV9 (rAAV9) can be used as an adjuvant to promote the induction of the neutralizing antibody against the recombinant RBD protein. In addition, rAAV9 may infect mammals via a nasal spray (Demminger et al., 2020) . Nasal delivery of rAAV9 vaccine is not only convenient, but also provide protection to the nasal and lung mucosa.",
