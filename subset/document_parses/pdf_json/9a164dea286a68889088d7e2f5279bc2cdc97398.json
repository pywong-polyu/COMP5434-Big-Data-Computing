Among emerging wearable technologies, in-ear devices or hearables possess technical advantages for long-term monitoring, such as non-invasivity, unobtrusivity, good fixing, and reduced motion artifacts, as well as physiological advantages related to the proximity of the ear to the body trunk and the shared vasculature between the ear and the brain. The present scoping review was aimed at identifying and synthesizing the available evidence on the use and performance of in-ear monitoring of physiological parameters, with focus on applications in sport science, sport medicine, occupational medicine, and extreme environment settings. Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched to identify studies conducted in the last 10 years and addressing the measurement of three main physiological parameters (temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) in healthy subjects. Thirty-nine studies were identified, 24 performing temperature measurement, 12 studies on heart/pulse rate, and three studies on oxygen saturation. The collected evidence supports the premise of in-ear sensors as an innovative and unobtrusive way for physiological monitoring during daily-life and physical activity, but further research and technological advancement are necessary to ameliorate measurement accuracy especially in more challenging scenarios.",

Additional requirements may be needed to extend the use of these devices to settings with challenging environmental conditions. Since several physiological parameters are estimated by devices relying on photo-plethysmography (PPT, measurement of light absorbance/reflectance from the vascular bed) from different peripheral body areas, environmental conditions that seriously impact perfusion may compromise the reliability of measurements. To overcome these restrictions, the application of sensors on better-perfused areas has been proposed (Rosenberg and Pedersen, 1990; Clayton et al., 1991; Kyriacou, 2006; Budidha and Kyriacou, 2018) . However, application sites on the skin may experience functional difficulties, such as attachment problems and motion artifacts (Clayton et al., 1991; Budidha and Kyriacou, 2018) , while sites within body cavities (nasopharyngeal, gastro-intestinal, etc.) may limit general applicability due to the expertise required for application (semi-invasivity) and potential discomfort.",

Thanks to its close position to the central nervous system and major vasculature, it can provide better signal quality and more stability. The area is slightly influenced by the sympathetic nerve activity in conditions leading to low perfusion states, resulting in an adequate blood flow, higher quality of PPT signals, and reliable pulse rate (PR) and SpO 2 monitoring. The site provides good fixation and unobtrusivity, facilitating long-term monitoring in daily-life conditions, and it offers protection from challenging environmental conditions (low temperature, sunlight) for in-field applications in challenging conditions Kyriacou, 2014, 2015) .",

            "text": "The measurement of physiological parameters from the ear canal in proximity of the tympanic membrane (TM) is strictly related to the characteristic vasculature of this area. The basic aspects of ear anatomy and vasculature are schematized in Figure 1 . In terms of vasculature (Figure 1B) , the brain and the TM are both supplied by the basilar artery and the internal carotid artery (Benzinger and Taylor, 1963; McCarthy and Heusch, 2006) . The basilar artery supplies the TM via the internal auditory artery. The internal carotid artery provides blood to the TM via the artery of the pterygoid canal and the carotico-tympanic branch, which have anastomoses with a vascular circle formed by several branches of the external carotid artery, such as the anterior tympanic artery, posterior auricular artery, stylomastoid artery, and maxillary artery (Berkovitz, 2005; McCarthy and Heusch, 2006) . The anastomoses with branches of the internal carotid arteries are crucial for monitoring physiological parameters. The internal carotid arteries (one on each side of the head) are the main blood supply to the circle of Willis and to the brain, including crucial sites for T regulation like the hypothalamus. In-ear measurement of core T assumes that the TM is supplied by blood from the same sources that supply the brain, which guarantees thermal equilibrium between the two sites. The measurement of SpO 2 and PR mostly relies on the acquisition of PPT signals, whose quality is also related to blood supply. Ear vascularization can guarantee adequate flow even in pathophysiological situations, such as in accidentally hypothermic patients where even cerebral autoregulation is progressively lost (Paal et al., 2018; Gaasch et al., 2020) .",

In direct mode thermometers, the output T corresponds to the T of the sensor, which is thermally coupled to the measuring site (Ring et al., 2010) . Thermistor-based thermometers work in direct mode and utilize the intrinsic property of materials, such as metallic oxides, to change their electrical resistance as a function of T. Thermistor-based thermometers include a metallic probe, usually encapsulated in an impermeable material, such as a soft rubber earplug, an electronic circuitry to measure the resistance change and a microprocessor for calibration and data display (Chen, 2019) . Potential limitations of direct approaches may include a slow time response to reach thermal equilibrium with the measuring site, and difficulties in placing the sensor close to the desired body site. In indirect or adjust-mode thermometers, the output T is the result of a signal adjustment or conversion, based on clinical data and physiological and anatomical properties, which corrects for differences between the measuring and sensor sites. The use of signal processing tools to estimate T results in fast response time, but may reduce actual accuracy (Ring et al., 2010) . Infrared (IR) thermometers, the most widespread methodology to measure tympanic T, are adjusted-mode thermometers, based on the detection of the IR radiation emitted by the TM and its conversion to an electrical signal. IR tympanic thermometers (IRTT) are usually composed of a probe tip with lenses to focus the IR light, a sensing electronic module (thermopile or pyroelectric sensor) for signal transduction, and a microprocessor circuitry for data calibration and display (Chen, 2019) . Although standard requirements for IRTT recommend clinical accuracy of \u00b10.3 \u2022 C for target T in the range 33-42 \u2022 C at ambient temperatures of 16-33 \u2022 C (ISO 80601-2-56, 2017), actual accuracy in the clinical setting may be affected by several factors, related-but not limited-to patient variability (gender, age, thermoregulation, handedness), local phenomena (excessive cerumen, ear major infection or surgery, tissue cooling due to repeated measurements), operator's experience, device maintenance, and environmental conditions (humidity, temperature). The latter may particularly affect accuracy during in-field applications (Ring et al., 2010; Sund-Levander and Grodzinsky, 2013) .",

In optical techniques, a peripheral site with high vascular density is illuminated by a light source and the light reflected by the vascular bed (PPG signal) is measured by a photodetector (see Figure 2 ). The PPG signal is composed by a direct constant component, which includes absorption/reflectance due to arterial blood, venous blood, and capillaries, and by a pulsatile alternating component, which is synchronous with the heart beat and is representative of tissue perfusion (Foo et al., 2013) . The pulsatile component can be directly used to estimate PR. Devices for in-ear PR measurement include as principal elements one light emitting diode (LED) for light emission at a single wavelength (red, IR, or green), one photo-detector to measure the reflected light, and a microprocessor to control the LED and calculate PR values . PR measurements using red or IR light can be affected by IR rays in sunlight, preventing stable operation for outdoors applications, thus indoors or semiindoors usage is recommended. For outdoors PR measurement, a green light source is usually preferred, being less susceptibility to ambient light (Lemay et al., 2014; Parak, 2018) .",

The simplest but conventional approach to measure SpO 2 is to analyze the light of the two wavelengths reflected from the pulsatile added volume of the oxygenated arterial blood and, specifically, calculating the absorption rate given by the double ratio of the pulsatile and non-pulsatile components of red light to IR light reaching the photo-detector (Foo et al., 2013) .

Nevertheless, technical and physiological factors may interfere with optical measurements affecting accuracy. These factors include motion artifact from physical movement, misalignment/distance between the skin and the optical sensor, geometry of the sensor, variation in the intensity and spectrum of the light source, ambient light, variations in skin color/tone, size, and depth of the vascular area, poor tissue perfusion (Lemay et al., 2014; Parak, 2018; Bent et al., 2020) .

In sport science, the measurement of core T is critical when evaluating research questions related to heat production, such as heat acclimatization and body cooling, exercise intensity, and effect of different environmental conditions on physiological state and performance. Monitoring of core T can be used to guarantee intensity and safety during intense heat exercise and heat tolerance tests, and to prevent exertional heat stroke (American College of Sports Medicine et al., 2007) or unexpected cooling (Procter et al., 2018) . Indeed, a decrease in core T per se may significantly impair physiological functions even in a healthy subject and should be timely detected for proper triage (Danzl and Pozos, 1994; Paal et al., 2018) . On the other hand, core T is considered a pivotal parameter also in occupational medicine, for instance to identify subjects at risk of heat stress disorders (Nagano et al., 2010) . Although invasive measurements, such as those performed in the pulmonary artery or lower third of the esophagus, remain the gold standard for assessment of core T, these sites are not practical in many situations, including the described settings (Strapazzon et al., 2014) . The ear canal was proposed as a promising alternative site to measure core T, thanks to the functional relation between the TM and the hypothalamic central thermoreceptors via shared blood supply , the non-invasivity, the respect of basic hygiene standards, the relative independence from external environmental conditions, the wearability, and the fast monitoring response (Gunga et al., 2009; Strapazzon et al., 2014) .",

IR measurements were shown to display high correlation with oral and forehead measurements in resting individuals (p < 0.01) (Basak et al., 2013) . More variable results were obtained in the studies analyzing the effect of exercise in different environmental conditions (Gagnon et al., 2010; Bagley et al., 2011; Fogt et al., 2017; Harmanci et al., 2018; Mor\u00e1n-Navarro et al., 2019) , where microclimate changes in the ear canal and changes in blood flow to the skin are known to impact measurements (Patel et al., 1996; Jensen et al., 2000; Casa et al., 2005; Kistemaker et al., 2006) . Of note, tympanic measurements of T were not always compared to the \"gold standard\" site for core T (esophageal) (Strapazzon et al., 2014) . Tympanic probes were shown to display different performance-with respect to other T monitoring sites-when compared to ingestible sensors during rest, exercise, and recovery (also under wind conditions) with a bias ranging from \u22120.7 to 1.4 \u2022 C (p < 0.001) (Mor\u00e1n-Navarro et al., 2019). Tympanic devices reflected core T measured by gastrointestinal pills in 14 healthy subjects exercising in a hot, humid environment, although different IR tympanic thermometers displayed diverse response (limits of agreement varying from \u00b1 1.90 to \u00b1 2.15 \u2022 C), highlighting the need for appropriate selection and validation of single devices (Fogt et al., 2017) . Harmanci et al. demonstrated that tympanic T tracked lower values than ingestible sensors during the progress of exercise (p < 0.05) (Harmanci et al., 2018) . Bagley et al. observed that tympanic T was significantly lower than rectal T during both rest and exercise under cold experimental conditions (bias = \u22121.4 \u2022 C, p < 0.0005) (Bagley et al., 2011) . Gagnon and co-workers found that tympanic T increased at a rate similar to rectal T, but was consistently lower than esophageal T (p < 0.01) in healthy subjects exercising in a hot temperature-controlled chamber (Gagnon et al., 2010) .

These results were further expanded in two studies by Flouris and Cheung, who investigated tympanic T changes in healthy subjects performing exercise or entering hot and cold water tanks (Flouris and Cheung, 2010a,b) . Although delayed with respect to rectal, skin, and exhaled breath T, and different in absolute values (p < 0.05), tympanic T measurements displayed a significant agreement and correlation with other monitoring sites (coefficient of determination r 2 ranging from 0.20 to 0.96 with rectal T). Five studies analyzed the effects of cold environments on tympanic T measurements, in simulated conditions (Teunissen et al., 2011; Skaiaa et al., 2015; Strapazzon et al., 2015) and sport/competition settings (Bhangu and Parmar, 2010; Muth et al., 2010) , to investigate the device suitability for hypothermia prevention. Tympanic T, measured by a commercial tympanic thermistor sensor under different environmental conditions (i.e., ambient air with or without local/wind insulation; snow or icy water in ear canal) displayed significantly (p < 0.006) lower values than rectal T (bias ranging from \u22121.5/\u22123.2 \u2022 C at 5 min to \u22121.2/\u22122.0 \u2022 C at 10 min) (Skaiaa et al., 2015) . Similar results were obtained by Strapazzon et al. comparing a tympanic probe to an esophageal one. However, ear insulation was able to reduce bias by 52% (from 2.9 to 1.5 \u2022 C) in the ambient setting and by 82% (7.2-1.3 \u2022 C) in the low T setting (Strapazzon et al., 2015) . An inter-individual variability was observed in the degree of deviation of tympanic from esophageal T (Strapazzon et al., 2015) , which was consistent with variability in physiological factors (vascularization, conductivity, and tissue perfusion) and anatomical differences (length, width, shape) affecting probe placement. The impact of cold environmental conditions on tympanic T and the mitigating effect of insulating the ear thermistor from environmental changes were confirmed during a rest, exercise, and recovery protocol (Teunissen et al., 2011) . Of note, wind had an immediate cooling effect on tympanic T, which was not sufficiently counteracted by insulation (bias = \u22121.73 \u00b1 0.11 \u2022 C and \u22122.49 \u00b1 0.04 \u2022 C in covered and uncovered ear condition, respectively) (Teunissen et al., 2011) .",

To reduce the impact of individual ear morphology and environmental conditions, Chaglla et al. (2018) proposed a graphene-inked sensor, obtained from a commercial IR thermopile and fixed by a 3D-printed hook-type enclosure. The sensing device was developed to continuously measure T from the TM and to display it on a smartphone. It included a microcontroller processing unit and a Bluetooth module for wireless connectivity to a smartphone application and was powered with a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery (3.7 V) providing continuous operation for at least 4 h. The sensor reduced the influence of ambient T (mean bias = \u22120.36 \u2022 C), with respect to a reference commercial sensor (mean bias = \u22120.51 \u2022 C). Similar to these results, Ota et al. showed that a wearable IR sensor, combined with a hearing aid and inserted in a 3D-printed device, could provide a more reliable T estimation than a skin sensor (Ota et al., 2017) . Together with the sensor module the device included a Bluetooth transceiver (powered by a 3.7 V lithium battery) for wireless data transmission to a mobile application interface displaying T values in real time. This approach was further corroborated by results from Yamakoshi et al., who reported good correlation of T values measured by an in-ear customized molded IR sensor with values measured by a thermistor-based tympanic sensor (r 2 = 0.97, p < 0.01, bias = \u22120.01 \u2022 C) and by gastrointestinal pills (r 2 = 0.86, p < 0.001, bias = \u22120.27 \u2022 C) in subjects under hyperthermic conditions. The earpiece device, connected to a full-face helmet, sensor amplifier, and signal processor, was also preliminarily tested in-field on professional drivers during real racing conditions and displayed good technical functioning, although no comparison with core T were performed in this setting (Yamakoshi et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Five studies analyzed the potential of in-ear T measurements for occupational medicine for prevention of heat illness (Nagano et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Pryor et al., 2012; Keene et al., 2015; Nakada et al., 2017) . The studies reported controversial results. Nagano et al. showed that tympanic T, measured by a thermocouple probe with tight sealing in the ear canal, closely tracked both esophageal and rectal T with slight underestimation during simulated rest-work cycles at increasing environmental T (Nagano et al., 2010) . IR tympanic probes underestimated core T obtained by gastrointestinal pills in firefighters performing work in heat chambers (bias ranging from 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 \u2022 C to 1.0 \u00b1 0.8 \u2022 C when entering the chamber and following exercise) (Keene et al., 2015) and during exercise with thermal protective clothing in a warm room (Pryor et al., 2012) . By using a telemetry system consisting of an ear probe with IR sensor technology, a transmitter, and a wireless data receiver, Lee and co-workers showed an overall high level of agreement between tympanic and rectal T, both at rest and during exercise conditions, in healthy volunteers, although bias varied with clothing levels. Tympanic T was lower than rectal T in control conditions and when wearing a high-density polyethylene coverall, while it reached and exceeded rectal T for a polyvinyl chloride coverall at environmental T of 25 and 32 \u2022 C (Lee et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, given the slow response of rectal measurements, comparisons of tympanic and rectal T away from steady-state conditions should be interpreted with caution (Lee et al., 2000; Lim et al., 2008; Strapazzon et al., 2014) . Interestingly, by using a customized IR device, equipped with a silicon mold to fit into the ear and capable of measuring T at three different locations from the TM, Nakada et al. demonstrated that inner and outer T measurements along the ear canal could accurately estimate esophageal T under different physiological and environmental conditions simulating elevated ambient T (Nakada et al., 2017) .",

In sport science, measures of resting, exercise, and recovery HR are used as surrogate markers of fatigue, fitness, and endurance performance status, with implications for optimization of training loads and enhancement of performance (Buchheit, 2014; Schneider et al., 2018) . Thanks to the wide diffusion of PPG technology in wearable sensors, PR has become a readily available parameter and real-world PR values, acquired during daily-life activities, are gaining increasing importance (Poh and Kittler, 2012; Bunn et al., 2019) . However, acquisition of PPG signals and accuracy of PR values during physical activity and exercise modes in indoor or outdoor settings may be compromised by motion artifacts, noise, and reduced signal quality (Poh et al., 2010; Tomita, 2016) . The ear canal bears potential for HR/PR monitoring during exercise, since the head is less affected by motion artifacts, orthostatic pressure modulations, and low perfusion problems than other extremities.",

On the other hand, methods allowing to acquire an ECG, instead of a pulsatile signal, suggested the possibility to trace cardiac activity beyond HR estimation. After demonstrating in a simulation model the possibility to trace ECG from ear or head locations, von Rosenberg et al. showed in resting subjects that cardiac cycles extracted from ear-ECG correlated well with those extracted from Lead 1 ECG. Although better performance was obtained using the Lead 1 ECG to guide R-wave identification (r 2 = 0.92), good performance could be achieved also for the stand-alone device, where the microphone signal was used to guide wave identification (r 2 = 0.81) (von .",

Four studies evaluated the performance of commercial inear devices (Boudreaux et al., 2018; Higgins et al., 2018; Bunn et al., 2019; Passler et al., 2019) . Bunn et al. (2019) compared the performance of a commercial earbud system and a wrist-watch for PR monitoring with that of a chest strap used as benchmark. The earbud device, transmitting information via Bluetooth to a smartphone, demonstrated consistent performance throughout three exercise protocols (bias ranging from 0.8 to \u22123.6 bpm during treadmill/outdoor sessions and high-intensity session, respectively), with slightly reduced agreement with the benchmark during high-intensity exercise where it slightly underestimated PR. The earbud displayed higher performance than the wrist-watch in all exercise sessions but especially in the high-intensity session, where the wristwatch exhibited poor performance due to substantial arm motion. High agreement between a commercial wireless exercise earpiece (connected via Bluetooth with a smartphone) and a reference chest strap (r 2 = 0.94) was reported by Higgins et al. during maximal graded exercise on a treadmill (Higgins et al., 2018) . However, the authors pointed out occasional displacement problems of both devices when exercise intensity increased. Passler et al. compared the performance of two commercial in-ear PR trackers with a reference ECG at rest and during subject-specific stress tests on a cyclo-ergometer (Passler et al., 2019) . Both devices displayed accurate PR measurements in either condition (mean absolute percentage errors ranging from 2.5 to 3.2% for PR <90 bpm and from 1.3 to 1.4 for PR >100 bpm), despite a tendency to PR underestimation and exposure to motion artifacts. An extended comparison of eight commercial PR monitoring systems, including an in-ear device which transmitted real-time PR data via Bluetooth to a smartphone application, was performed by Boudreaux et al. during trials of graded cycling and standard resistance exercise at maximal load (Boudreaux et al., 2018) . The devices displayed different performance under different exercise conditions. Only the in-ear device and a chest-worn device displayed limited bias with respect to ECG data in both cycling and resistance exercise sessions, the in-ear device displaying the best performance during the resistance exercise (mean absolute percentage error of 6.24%). In all devices a greater underestimation of HR was observed as exercise intensity increased.",

Poh and Kittler (2012) developed the \"Heartphone system, \" embedding a reflective IR photosensor in a fullyintegrated unobtrusive wireless headset, powered by a rechargeable lithium polymer battery. The system architecture included a processing control unit with active filters to reduce electrical noise and motion artifacts, an analog-todigital converter, a PPG peak detection algorithm, and a communication system (either serial and wireless) to send PR values to a custom application on mobile devices or laptops. The device showed robust PR measurements under conditions of moderate motion, with high agreement with ECG-derived HR measurements when users were standing, cycling, or walking (bias ranging from \u22120.07 to 0.67 bpm), but lower performance was expected under vigorous exercise. Leboeuf et al. (2014) tested an earbud PPG sensor including an accelerometer. The earbud was designed to be pluggable via a detachable connector to a wireless \"medallion, \" which housed a microprocessor and a Bluetooth chipset, and granted several hours of measurement time. The device, tested during a treadmill exercise protocol including rest to peak performance steps, showed accurate PR monitoring throughout all activity levels with high correlation (r 2 = 0.98) and low bias (\u22120.2 \u00b1 4.4%) when compared with the benchmark ECG device. High performance in PR estimation also during extreme physical activity was obtained thanks to the capability of characterizing motion noise through the accelerometer and of attenuating motion artifacts from the optical signal in real-time. To provide a thorough characterization of the physiological state during exercise, the authors combined PR and contextual accelerometry values in a statistical model to estimate total energy expenditure and aerobic capacity. Total energy expenditure could be reliably estimated, while lower accuracy was observed for aerobic capacity.",

A filtering approach, based on dual PPG signal acquisition in both ears and asynchronous noise removal, was proposed by Tomita et al. and tested under various movement and exercise conditions (Tomita et al., 2018) . The approach demonstrated higher performance (bias within \u00b15 bpm in 95% of measurements) than accelerometer-based filtering, at the cost of doubling the number of sensors and signals to be acquired. Vogel et al. compared the performance of time-domain and frequency-domain algorithms in estimating PR from PPG signals acquired by an in-ear MORES sensor (Vogel et al., 2009) , connected with a small body box containing the signal acquisition and communication circuitry and granting hours of monitoring. The authors showed better performance of the frequency-domain method when working on either IR and red-light PPG signals, with the highest performance obtained using IR signals (bias of \u22120.59 \u00b1 1.33 bpm with respect to a finger sensor).",

            "text": "Introduction SpO 2 is the physiological parameter which tracks the amount of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood or transported oxygen bound to hemoglobin, as indirectly measured at suitable peripheral sites (i.e., finger, toe, forehead, and ear) by pulse oximetry. Since the brain, as well as the muscles, requires a constant oxygen supply to support the high metabolic rate production necessary to remain electrically active (Williams et al., 2019) , SpO 2 monitoring is of relevance to detect possible risk conditions not only in clinical settings, but also in physiological studies, sport science, and occupational medicine (Costello et al., 2020; Pham et al., 2020; Stensrud et al., 2020) . A reduction in oxygen availability, as experienced at high altitudes or in particular challenging situations, can have a detrimental effect on brain and muscles function, inducing performance decline and increasing the risk of errors and injuries (Hoiland et al., 2016) . The parameter is also crucial to evaluate adaptation processes and performance when exercising or training at altitude or in hyperbaric conditions (Chapman, 2013) . In high-risk environments for workers (firefighters or military personnel) and athletes, SpO 2 information may help to prevent injuries, such as exertional heat illness (Pham et al., 2020) . Advances in medical instrumentation and considerable improvements in optoelectronics have made pulse oximetry integrable in wearable devices (Foo et al., 2013) , opening the possibility of long-term oxygen monitoring in the mentioned settings. On the other hand, in the presence of local or systemic vasoconstriction during sport activities or cold environmental conditions, poor peripheral perfusion at the wrist, finger, and toe, may make these sites inappropriate to accurately estimate SpO 2 (Budidha and Kyriacou, 2018) . The ear canal may represent a more reliable site for the assessment of SpO 2 , since it is less subject to vasoconstriction and motion artifacts and it guarantees suitable blood flux and PPG signal quality (Budidha and Kyriacou, 2014) .",

            "text": "The three studies, which analyzed pulse oximetry measurements from the ear canal, are summarized in Table 4 . All the studies analyzed prototype devices (Venema et al., 2012; Kyriacou, 2014, 2018 ) that applied dual wavelength emission in reflection configuration. Performance was tested under various conditions. In two studies measurements were performed under challenging conditions inducing vasoconstriction, such as cold immersion test (Budidha and Kyriacou, 2014) and cold-exposure (Budidha and Kyriacou, 2018) , while in the third study the device was calibrated under hypoxic conditions (Venema et al., 2012) . The two studies performing vasoconstrictive maneuvers consistently showed that SpO 2 measurements performed in the ear canal were minimally affected by vasoconstriction, while reference measurements performed on the fingertip were significantly impaired by the reduced blood flow. In particular, the amplitude of both red and IR PPG waveforms underwent just minor changes (+2.5 and \u22121.2%, respectively) after ice water immersion of the right hand with respect to baseline recordings, while the amplitude of both right and left index finger PPG signals resulted almost halved (Budidha and Kyriacou, 2014) . Similar, in subjects undergoing artificially-induced hypothermia by means of cold exposure at 10 \u2022 C, the normalized pulse amplitude of red and IR light PPGs presented a maximal decrease of 13% for the ear sensor with respect to a drop of >80% for the finger sensor. The decrease in signal amplitude in the finger sensor resulted in measurement failure (i.e., SpO 2 < 90%) in one third of the subjects, while failure in ear measurement was obtained only in one subject out of 15 (Budidha and Kyriacou, 2018) . These results supported the reliability of PPG signal quality from the ear canal during vasoconstriction, but they did not provide information on the actual accuracy of the estimated SpO 2 values with respect to gold standard values. A single study examined this aspect and evaluated the performance of ear-in pulse oximeters in comparison with blood gas analysis under realistic clinical conditions with various levels of hypoxia (Venema et al., 2012) . Specifically, SpO 2 was measured by a PPG sensor embedded in an individually-customized ear mold for measurement in the ear canal, in healthy subjects wearing a breathing mask that regulated the blood oxygen level of the inspired air. During the tests blood was saturated in steps from 100% to 70-77% and blood samples from the radial artery were taken at each step to perform reference blood gas analysis. The study showed good correlation (r 2 = 0.96) between absorbance rates and corresponding reference SpO 2 values at the individual level (Venema et al., 2012) . However, the global calibration curve obtained from all measurements showed unacceptable accuracy, due to the presence of offsets between individual calibration curves. Intra-individual variability among calibration curves enabled the estimation of SpO 2 only in relative terms. Absolute reliable in-ear oxygen saturation measurements could be obtained in the study using an individual singlepoint calibration (i.e., performing an initial SpO 2 measurement with a reference device). Alternative compensation strategies may rely on the use of a third wavelength to compensate for the offset without the necessity of single-point calibration (Venema et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "The large set of research studies presented in this review proves the wide interest for hearables as suitable instruments for physiological parameters monitoring, potentially able to satisfy commercial and research-oriented markets. The data presented in this review suggest the capability of the devices to provide accurate measurements in multiple conditions, but point out the necessity of further improvements to guarantee reliability of measurements in more challenging scenarios, such as during intense exercise, under extreme climatic conditions, and/or dynamic conditions. These aspects are of primary importance to grant applicability in sport science and physiological research, as well as in emergency and occupational care. In general, a certain degree of variability in accuracy and performance was observed among studies. Although devices were often constructed based on similar principles, proprietary differences in technology and algorithms for signal processing may partially explain these differences. More importantly, heterogeneity in protocols (e.g., differences in the type, intensity, and duration of activities performed during the validation) and settings (e.g., simulation of extreme environments), as well as in the type of reference measures, were present among studies which may further hinder comparisons and a pooled evaluation of accuracy. Moreover, mismatch between requested standards and in-field accuracy may further explain differences among studies, which fosters further debate regarding the accuracy, validity, and reliability of in-ear measurements methods (Ring et al., 2010; Sund-Levander and Grodzinsky, 2013) . Increasing the accuracy of measurements may rely on the improvement of signal/data acquisition and device stability, potentially through the implementation of new materials, as exemplified by graphene-coated T sensors (Chaglla et al., 2018) . Probe development for T measurement should pursue personalization to adapt the device to the specific anatomy of each user (Muir et al., 2001; Venema et al., 2012; Ota et al., 2017) , allowing a better insulation from external conditions (Teunissen et al., 2011; Strapazzon et al., 2015) . For PPGbased measurements, accuracy may be improved by optimizing sensor design and wavelength [e.g., optimal LED-photodiode distance, shunt-light reduction (Buschmann and Huang, 2010) ], but also by developing suitable signal processing and advanced algorithms for noise removal (Poh et al., 2010; Poh and Kittler, 2012; Tomita et al., 2018) . Motion artifact removal and noise cancellation techniques are a central area of interest for the improvement of PPG-based monitoring devices for either PR and SpO 2 measurement, and adaptive noise cancellation using integrated accelerometers as reference is considered a promising technique (Poh et al., 2010) . Calibration issues and model optimization on larger populations under different conditions are relevant for obtaining reliable SpO 2 measurements (Venema et al., 2012) , as well as energy and metabolic parameters from PR values and accelerometric information (Leboeuf et al., 2014; Boudreaux et al., 2018) . The use of advanced post-processing algorithms, allowing the extraction of respiratory traces and HR variability parameters from in-ear signals, may further extend the set of monitored physiological parameters and should be analyzed in future studies (Poh and Kittler, 2012) . In addition, the possibility of measuring an ear-ECG instead of simply measuring a pulsatile signal may enable the identification and examination of heart conditions, such myocardial infarction or arrhythmias, which may be helpful for emergency medicine, sport medicine, and occupational medicine settings (von .",

            "text": "Further research is also needed to address limitations evidenced by the present review. The literature on in-ear SpO 2 measurements is sparse and focused on signal quality issues. Calibration needs to be further addressed and algorithms need optimization on large study groups in comparison with goldstandard references (Venema et al., 2012) . The growing demands for remote personal health monitoring for healthy geriatrics in residential homes (Foo et al., 2013) , further stimulated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, has promoted further research on in-ear SpO 2 measurement for long-term monitoring. Recent data about a full in-ear SpO 2 monitor, tested in resting subjects during a sequence of normal breathing and breathholds (Davies et al., 2020) , showed good agreement between in-ear and finger measurements, with a root mean square error of 1.47% and just slight overestimation of SpO 2 by the ear device. Of note, the device showed a faster response to track saturation changes induced by the breath hold protocol than the finger sensor (Davies et al., 2020) . As concerns T, tympanic measurements have been shown to track body T and potentially brain T, but this assumption should be considered with caution. Despite the shared vasculature with carotid artery, branches of the external carotid artery could introduce variability associated to the size, origin, and therefore relative flow through each component artery . These aspects-together with biasing factors related to environmental conditions, operators training, in-ear local phenomena, and adequate maintenance of the probes-may represent further sources of variability (Bridges and Thomas, 2009; Ring et al., 2010; Sund-Levander and Grodzinsky, 2013) with impact on T measurements in different physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Thus, the actual reliability and range of validity of in-ear physiological parameters need further tests, especially in challenging environments and in real patients. As well, technical challenges in terms of power, cost, size, weight, functionality, and packaging needs further efforts in view of long-term applications and more challenging settings. Such efforts will be potentially rewarded, since in-ear technology is integrable with smart devices, and thus it may be packaged and sold with smartphones as audio earbuds in large volumes of units per year (Leboeuf et al., 2014) . Thanks to their unobstrusivity and comfort, hearables may reach a larger consumer audience, with potential benefit in the promotion of healthy lifestyles and preventive healthcare, and they may offer a novel non-invasive site for monitoring workers and patients in out-of-hospital settings.",
