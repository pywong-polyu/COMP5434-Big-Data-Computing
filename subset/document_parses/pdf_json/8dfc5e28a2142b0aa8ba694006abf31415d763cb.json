It is shown in [1] and the references therein that a number of interpolation and path planning problems can be incorporated into control problem and studied using control theory and optimization techniques on Hilbert spaces with efficient numerical spline-based schemes. Control splines give a richer class of smoothing curves relative to polynomial curves. They have been proved to be useful for trajectory planning in [2] , mobile robots in [3] , contour modelling of images in [4] , probability distribution estimation in [5] and so on. However, in many situations, it is not really crucial that we pass a trajectory through these points exactly, but rather that we go reasonably close to them, while minimizing the objective functional. Such approach is closely related to the idea of smoothing under fuzzy interpolation conditions.
