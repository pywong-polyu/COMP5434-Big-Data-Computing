However, he returned to the hospital on the fourth day of illness with persistent symptoms. He was hospitalized, with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. Computerized tomography scan of his abdomen-pelvis showed features of acute pyelonephritis, so his antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem and teicoplanin. Despite this, the patient's condition deteriorated. Laboratory investigations showed multisystem involvement: decreasing platelets, raised creatinine, and deranged liver panel. As Kathmandu was hit by dengue epidemic during the patient's hospitalization, on the seventh day of his illness, blood samples were sent for tropical fever investigation. All tests came out negative except for scrub typhus-IgM antibodies positive on rapid diagnostic test. The patient's symptoms subsided after 48 h of starting doxycycline and he became fully asymptomatic four days later. Fever did not recur even after discontinuing other IV antibiotics, favoring scrub typhus disease rather than systemic bacterial sepsis. Conclusions: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease of Nepal. Therefore, every unexplained fever cases (irrespective of clinical presentation) should be evaluated for potential Rickettsiosis. Moreover, for cases with acute pyelonephritis, atypical causative agents should be investigated, for example scrub typhus in this case.",

It is one of the emerging infectious diseases of Nepal [2] . Clinical manifestation of scrub typhus includes a painless papule called eschar representing localized cutaneous necrosis at the site of infecting chigger bite, followed by fever, generalized headache, diffuse myalgia, anorexia, generalized lymphadenopathy, and non-pruritic body rash. However, it can present with atypical signs and symptoms such as those of acute kidney injury, gastroenteritis, rarely pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatic dysfunction have been reported too, particularly in severe cases, with multisystem involvement [3] . Case fatality rate of scrub typhus is 6% for untreated and 1.4% for treated cases [1] . , [4] Therefore, a high degree of clinical suspicion is required for the diagnosis of scrub typhus which can be confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test or polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) being the gold standard test-a fourfold rise in IgM antibody titer is usually diagnostic of infection [5] . Unfortunately, in low-resource settings, it may take several weeks just to get the test results. Scrub typhus is commonly treated with doxycycline, a highly effective antibiotic given for 1 week.",
