            "text": "Introduction: Innovative interventions are needed to address the growing burden of breast cancer globally, especially among vulnerable patient populations. Given the success of Community Health Workers (CHWs) in addressing communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases, this scoping review will investigate the roles and impacts of CHWs in breast cancer screening programs. This paper also seeks to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of these programs, with particular attention paid to differences between CHW-led interventions in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). Methods: A scoping review was performed using six databases with dates ranging from 1978 to 2019. Comprehensive definitions and search terms were established for 'Community Health Workers' and 'breast cancer screening', and studies were extracted using the World Bank definition of LMIC. Screening and data extraction were protocolized using multiple independent reviewers. Chi-square test of independence was used for statistical analysis of the incidence of themes in HICs and LMICs. Results: Of the 1,551 papers screened, 33 were included based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study locations included the United States (n=27), Bangladesh (n=1), Peru (n=1), Malawi (n=2), Rwanda (n=1), and South Africa (n=1). Three primary roles for CHWs in breast cancer screening were identified: education (n=30), direct assistance or performance of breast cancer screening (n=7), and navigational services (n=6). In these roles, CHWs improved rates of breast cancer screening (n=23) and overall community member knowledge (n=21). Two studies performed cost-analyses of CHW-led interventions. Conclusion: This review extends our understanding of CHW effectiveness to breast cancer screening. It illustrates how CHW involvement in screening programs can have a significant impact in LMICs and HICs, and highlights the three CHW roles of education, direct performance of screening, and navigational services that emerge as useful pillars around which governments and NGOs can design effective programs in this area.",

The 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study highlights this disparity, demonstrating a correlation between the human development index (HDI) of a country and the breast cancer mortality-toincidence ratio, where the lowest ratio (and highest relative mortality) is associated with low HDI countries while higher ratios are found in very high HDI countries [7] . This disproportionate burden calls for more effective and scalable approaches to addressing the problem [6, 8] .",

Incidence and prevalence rates vary from country to country, but prevalence is higher in developed nations [3] . Recent years, however, have seen an upward trend in breast cancer prevalence regardless of a country's development status. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 50% of breast cancers now occur in the developing world [4, 5] . Irrespective of these trends, breast cancer imposes a disproportionate burden on developing countries groups than any other race or ethnicity [10] . Based on data from 2013 to 2017, the breast cancer death rate for American black women is 40% higher when compared to the rate for white women, despite black women having a lower overall incidence of breast cancer [11, 12] . While this discrepancy may be explained in part by the higher prevalence of triplenegative breast cancer among black women [13] , there are also larger social and systemic factors, such as delayed access to healthcare for both screening and treatment, that impact breast cancer survival [9] [10] [11] .",

Their beneficial role in LMICs has been documented in the context of cervical and breast cancer screening, where CHW educators and coordinators improved screening [17, 18] . It has also been documented in the US, where increased training and resources for CHWs improved mammography rates [19] . This backdrop spurred the WHO to develop guidelines focused on the optimization of CHW programs in diverse healthcare arenas [15] . The studies used by the WHO to create these guidelines demonstrated the positive benefits of CHW interventions on overall cancer screening rates and knowledge [15] . However, only one study mentioned in this report discussed the potential for CHW to address cancer screening in LMICs specifically, and it \"did not provide evidence of CHW capacity [20] .\" CHW effectiveness in these areas inspires the question of how CHW interventions can be leveraged in other contexts, such as that of breast cancer screening. Indeed, while reviews focused on CHWs within LMICs exist [18] , there is a lack of literature that comprehensively reviews the role of CHWs in breast cancer screening across both HICs and LMICs. Viewed through the lens of global healthcare during the concurrent pandemics of systemic racism and COVID-19, this insight is particularly timely to better understand creative, community-driven approaches to address health disparities for under-served populations and populations with limited access to high quality care.",

The majority of the studies that employed navigation were in the US, with the exception of one study in South Africa and another in Bangladesh. In the study by Hunt et al.

This included increased numbers of screening mammograms, screening appointments with providers, and CBEs. Four studies reported that CHWs increased cancer screening follow-up compliance. One of these studies out of Malawi reported an increase in compliance when CHWs were taught to perform CBEs specifically. In addition to screening rates, they found that there was an increase in community breast cancer knowledge overall, as CHWs educated their communities while performing CBEs [28] . Additionally, two studies reported breast cancer identification data; for example, Duggan et al. (2017) screened 13,500 women in Peru with CBEs performed by midwives and identified 321 women with breast abnormalities [31] . Each woman received fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion, of which 10 women were identified to have breast cancer. Additionally, the 2015 study by Chowdhury et al. in Bangladesh identified a case of stage III breast cancer in the CHW-led intervention group [32] . Of note, these publications demonstrating identification data were both in LMICs, which was significant when compared to HICs (HIC: 0%, LMIC: 33%, p-value: 0.028). Despite this, neither of these studies used a control, making it difficult to truly assess the impact of CHWs on these results.",

Cancer screening included breast, cervical, and colorectal, and results were not stratified based on type of cancer. In Schuster et al.

Lack of information and understanding of breast cancer have been identified as contributing to differences in timely follow-up for low-income, ethnically diverse women [36] , who report a greater need for information delivered in culturally appropriate formats [37] . CHWs were particularly effective as peer educators for their community members with over half of the studies demonstrating a significant increase in patients' understanding of breast cancer and the need for breast cancer screening. One posited reason for this success is that CHW-led interventions were likely to be linguistically and culturally concordant with the patient community. As community representatives and advocates, CHWs are able to make stronger connections and provide advice and information relevant to specific populations facing barriers in accessing healthcare [36, 37] . In 2015, Daly and Olopade argued that moving the needle for disparities in breast cancer starts with emphasis on rectifying the lack of education on and understanding of breast cancer genomics, genetic counseling and the BRCA genes [9, 38, 39] . CHWs integrated in breast cancer care may benefit from training focused on educating their patients on these topics, as this knowledge will equip communities with the knowledge to advocate for high quality precision-based care.",

Of the studies in LMICs, CBEs were the predominant form of screening, as compared to HICs where mammograms were primarily utilized. This review also found that CHWs were only used directly for screening in LMICs. These differences were all statistically significant and may indicate limited access to mammography services in LMICs. This serves as a call to action for investment in breast cancer diagnostic and treatment services in HICs and LMICs.

In multiple studies, CHWs proved to be a natural bridge between the community and the formal healthcare system, from providing mammography and primary care provider (PCP) referrals to a longer-term relationship with one participant from referral to diagnosis and treatment. In the study by Hunt et al. (2017) , CHWs were shown to be crucial members in establishing a breast cancer program in the community and helping women in the community understand the need for screening, while also assisting women in receiving the necessary healthcare services [29] . Additionally, having CHWs as both educators and navigators in this program provided greater continuity of care for these patients. Through the synergistic efforts of both successful education and navigational interventions, this study saw a significant increase in mammography services in a vulnerable patient population [29] . Having navigational assistance improves community outcomes and CHWs can help fulfill that need if there is a shortage of PNs. This service may be particularly beneficial in settings where CHWs function within or are derived from the formal health system, which this paper found predominantly in LMICs. Notably, as the COVID-19 pandemic has increased barriers to healthcare across the globe, telehealth has emerged as an innovative approach to narrowing gaps in accessing care. In the CHW context, there are significant opportunities for telehealth to play a role in synergistically improving access to education and screening, and particularly for navigational services. Future programs may be able to create multidisciplinary teams where CHWs focus on education and screening, while PNs fulfill the navigational responsibilities. When reimagining the landscape of breast cancer care, Daly and Olopade emphasize the importance of PNs and CHWs in helping patients overcome logistical barriers to accessing services, but also caution that they cannot operate in a vacuum and must come along with broader system-based changes that integrate these services.",

The feasibility of including CHWs in breast cancer screening can be considered in financial terms, as well as through a logistical lens. Two studies noted that the inclusion of CHWs in breast cancer screening projects added hundreds of dollars to the cost of their work. This figure is notable, as this increased cost could be prohibitive for programs with fewer financial resources. However, this sum should be considered within context, as the role of a CHW is not always a paid position around the globe and, therefore, should not discourage architects of breast cancer screening programs from including CHWs in their work. In addition, as both studies were performed in the US, the higher costs may not actually be representative of CHW program costs in LMICs and other HICs. While this study has demonstrated that CHW involvement in a wide variety of roles in breast cancer screening is possible, this idea should be weighed alongside the other demands that are placed on CHWs and the diverse gaps that they are called upon to fill within global health systems. Future research on how to prioritize or specialize CHW time and training related to breast cancer screening versus their other roles would be beneficial for overall CHW program design.",

            "text": "Notably, this review revealed that there is a limited pool of studies that have explored the use of CHWs in the context of breast cancer in LMICs. Of the 33 studies included, only six were conducted in LMICs. While this small sample size limits applicability, the six articles convincingly highlight CHWs effectiveness in these contexts. In all of the studies within LMICs, the use of CHWs in breast cancer screening was positively correlated with targeted outcomes [28, 31, 32, [41] [42] [43] . In addition, exogenous benefits were also reported. Pace et al. (2018) found a more than 10-fold increase in reports of CHWs engaging with community members about health concerns as a result of incorporating CBEs into their work [42] . This information suggests that immersive engagement with community members by CHWs about breast health leads to more conversations about general health. Additional research on the role of CHWs in providing breast cancer education, screening, recruitment for screening, and navigation in LMICs would greatly contribute to understanding how these interventions can be most effectively tailored to the needs of specific populations. A discussion of these ideas, however, would be incomplete without emphasizing the paucity of high-quality studies about CHWs and breast cancer screening, particularly in LMICs. The lack of rigorous data has significant implications for accurately assessing the impact of CHW activity in these settings. This study, therefore, underscores the necessity of investing in and conducting high quality studies on this topic in LMICs, which can inform evidence on the impact of this approach. For the studies performed in HICs, the majority focused on underserved populations with limited access to the formal healthcare system. While systemic and contextual differences exist, these populations share important characteristics with target populations for CHWs in LMICs, particularly with respect to disparities in accessing breast cancer screening. These similarities are reflected in the analysis conducted within this paper, which identified few statistically significant differences between study populations, CHW demographics, and the roles of CHWs across all included studies. The identified problems facing the populations in HICs -treatment delay, healthcare system involvement at advanced stages, and decreased levels of treatment -are largely the same risk factors that make CHWs uniquely suited to address similar health disparities in LMICs. Given these similarities, until further research investigates this topic in LMICs, it may be appropriate to extrapolate the data from communities in HICs experiencing health disparities. While these groups are not a perfect comparison, they can serve as an indirect guide for communities looking to utilize CHWs for breast cancer screening. More broadly, gaps in breast cancer literature and breast cancer care extend beyond LMICs, with a notable lack of focus on minority populations [44] . The COVID-19 pandemic has elucidated the systemic racism embedded in healthcare, and it is essential that we now face this inequity head on when addressing the glaring disparities in breast cancer health outcomes.",

            "text": "While our research demonstrates that CHWs are effective in diverse roles in breast cancer screening, the long-term impact of these roles is not clear. CHWs have been lauded as the answer to addressing health disparities in marginalized communities; however, our data does not indicate that these interventions significantly decreased morbidity or mortality from breast cancer in these communities. The primary driver of this limitation is likely due to a lack of follow-up from these studies and the significant prevalence of self-reported data within HICs, rather than an overall lack of long-term efficacy. Ultimately, further studies analyzing the long-term effects of CHW-led interventions, such as overall morbidity and mortality, are needed in the literature in order to adequately address this crucial outcome. Recommending specific interventions is challenging, given the broad scope of the CHW role within diverse contexts. Future investigators should focus on methods, such as the step wedge approach, that incorporate tracking of long-term outcomes to allow researchers to better isolate which interventions are making significant impacts on improving population health. Additionally, it is impossible to advocate for larger scale research targeting CHWs without championing broader delivery system reform within which these CHWs operate. Solutions proposed by Daly and Olopade include accountable care organizations (ACOs) targeted towards a specific patient population which is responsible for their care and health outcomes and an emphasis on precision medicine for all. Now more than ever, with healthcare systems pushed to their limits from the novel COVID-19 pandemic, communities need unique and creative solutions to address health disparities that are both equitable and social-justice oriented. First and foremost, to effectively improve breast cancer outcomes, CHW programs need an effective healthcare system behind them. Investment in CHW programs as a part of broader strengthening of global health systems is imperative to close the gap in patient outcomes. With the robust support of a wellestablished health infrastructure, CHWs can be advocates and leaders within the communities they represent, which are so often neglected by current healthcare systems. This focus on community-driven care amplifies the voices of those disparaged, which are often lowincome communities and communities of color. When CHWs are not only able to diagnose, but also help women access and navigate a system that offers the most appropriate and efficacious treatment available, we will be able to see meaningful improvements in breast cancer disparities and outcomes.",

It highlights how CHWs can and should be included in breast cancer screening programs, and how CHW involvement in such programs can improve breast cancer impacts in both LMICs and HICs. The current literature addresses multiple roles for CHWs in breast cancer screening. Trained CHWs can be effective educators, teaching the community about breast health and guidelines for proper breast cancer screening. CHWs can be effective members of a health care team dedicated to breast cancer screening, in which they perform CBEs or assist other medical providers in screening procedures. They can also successfully perform specific navigational roles, including assistance with scheduling screening appointments and with any necessary follow-up care. All these roles help to increase community members' knowledge of breast cancer screening and can improve rates of appropriate screening methods, such as CBEs and mammography rates. As a result, education, direct performance of screening, and navigational services emerge as useful pillars around which governments and NGOs can design effective programs that incorporate CHW-based breast cancer screening. We hope that in providing a culturally competent and ethical framework for CHWs to participate in this global conversation on breast cancer, more countries will be able to develop programs that utilize their expertise.",
