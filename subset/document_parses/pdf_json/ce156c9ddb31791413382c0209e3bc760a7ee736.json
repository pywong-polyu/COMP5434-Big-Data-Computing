Our study was to assess the predictive value of D-dimer for the severity, mortality and incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in COVID-19 patients. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched. The pooled diagnostic value (95% confidence interval [CI]) of D-dimer was evaluated with a bivariate mixed-effects binary regression modeling framework. Sensitivity analysis and meta regression were used to determine heterogeneity and test robustness. A Spearman rank correlation tested threshold effect caused by different cut offs and units in D-dimer reports. The pooled sensitivity of the prognostic performance of D-dimer for the severity, mortality and VTE in COVID-19 were 77% (95% CI: 73%-80%), 75% (95% CI: 65%-82%) and 90% (95% CI: 90%-90%) respectively, and the specificity were 71% (95% CI: 64%-77%), 83% (95% CI: 77%-87%) and 60% (95% CI: 60%-60%). D-dimer can predict severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 with moderate accuracy. It also shows high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for detecting COVID-19-related VTE events, indicating that it can be used to screen for patients with VTE.",

COVID-related mortality is largely associated with hypercoagulability and increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events, leading to thrombo-inflammation in severe conditions. 1 Therefore, coagulation biomarkers may indicate disease severity and mortality, and help determine patient triage, therapeutic strategies and prognosis supervision. D-dimer is the product of fibrin degradation, and plays a mechanistic role in thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19. 1 Several studies have correlated elevated D-dimer (prevalence up to 46.4%) with increased severity and adverse outcomes of COVID-19. [2] [3] [4] Patients with D-dimer >1000 ng/ml present a 20-fold higher mortality risk compared to those with lower D-dimer values. 3 Therefore, D-dimer is a potential screening tool for VTE in COVID-19 patients, and based on D-dimer elevation, adjusting therapeutic anticoagulant doses is more beneficial to the patients compared to prophylactic doses. 5 Thus, D-dimer levels should be monitored in COVID patients early after admission.",

In addition, D-dimer elevation is frequently observed in COVID-19 patients with severe disease, and correlates significantly with mortality. 2,3 Since D-dimer is the product of fibrin degradation, its presence can predict pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). 35 In fact, COVID-19 patients with VTE events (both in deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) also exhibit high D-dimer levels in circulation. The limited availability of duplex ultrasound or computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and ICU equipment for COVID-19 patients due to the present quarantine warrants a novel predictor of VTE events. A recent study on 191 COVID-19 patients reported that D-dimer levels greater than 1 mg/ml on admission correlate to 18-fold increase in mortality risk. 3 Furthermore, D-dimer >2600 ng/ml or more than 10 times higher than the upper limit of normal range calls for 4-extremity duplex ultrasound. 36 Although studies are increasingly focusing on the diagnostic performance of D-dimer for predicting the severity, mortality and VTE events in COVID-19, the results are ambiguous given the small study populations and heterogeneity between the studies. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic value of D-dimer in COVID-19 patients. D-dimer levels can distinguish severe COVID-19 patients with only moderate accuracy, as indicated by pooled sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 71% respectively, and AUC 77%. For predicting fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients, the pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 75%, 83% and 86% respectively, suggesting a moderate chance of omission, relatively low risk of misdiagnosis and relatively high diagnostic accuracy. Finally, D-dimer can diagnose COVID-19 related VTE with high sensitivity (90%), low specificity (60%) and acceptable accuracy (AUC 85%). The respective pooled DORs for the above-mentioned analysis were 8 (95% CI: 4-17), 14 (95% CI: 9-24) and 14 (95% CI: , indicating that D-dimer can distinguish between mild and severe, fatal and non-fatal, and VTE and VTE-free cases of COVID-19.",

Creel-Bulos et al 37 rendered a comprehensive observation of D-dimer trajectories and represented a highly predictive value of a rise in D-dimer (>2000 ng/ml) of any 24 hours within 10 days with 75% sensitivity and 74% specificity while baseline value was not associated with VTE. A Chinese study composed of 1114 patients 38 mentioned the meaningfulness of last D-dimer test before discharge or death in prognosing death using a cut off value of 2.025 mg/L rather than the first test at admission, the AUC of which was 0.909. Through meticulously reading of these articles, we have discovered the main source of inconsistency including age, comorbidity rates, mean duration of hospitalization, exclusion criteria for conditions that increases D-dimer levels (pregnancy, cancer or post trauma and surgery status), as well as timing of D-dimer measurement (initial, peak or ultimate value), etc. In addition, lack of association between D-dimer and mortality in the study of Creel-Bulos et al 37 indicates anticoagulation treatment may potentially lead to decreased death and misunderstanding prognosis value of D-dimer.

Second, patients with diabetes have higher D-dimer levels and a significant higher risk of adverse prognosis, as well as shorter survival duration, 39 all of which influence diagnostic sensitivity. Third, males are more likely to develop severe illness and succumb, which can be attributed to the presence of androgens and angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, along with a greater prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle choices like smoking, abuse alcohol and poor sleep. 40 Fourth, ethnicity can also affect diagnostic sensitivity and specificity due to the genetic predisposition to fatal comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc.) and thrombotic events. For instance, polymorphism of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) genes and variations in ACE2 expression levels correlate to more severe and fatal outcomes in African American and Hispanic populations. 41 Fifth, exclusion of pregnancy may reduce sensitivity by removing false positive results and exclusion of no D-dimer test results may increase specificity by removing false negative results. Sixth, recruiting only severe patients can increase the probability of death compared to a mixed cohort of severe and mild cases. Likewise, measuring D-dimer at its peak also increases the possibility of patients for progressing to severe or critical illness, thrombotic events and fatal outcomes. 42 Finally, high clinical prevalence of VTE may avoid the potential diagnostic omission of VTE events in COVID-19 patients.",

Thus far, serial coagulation indices screening focused on D-dimer changes before and after anticoagulant as risk stratification is suggested. Dynamic alterations of D-dimer could demonstrate progression and prognosis of COVID-19. During 10 consecutive days of monitoring, D-dimer in admission escalated in improved and deteriorated groups after treatment and then gradually decreased in improved groups but remained high and fluctuated with disease progression in poor ones. 44 Coincidentally, initial elevated levels of D-dimer in baseline diminished after anticoagulant therapy with LMWH in DVT-COVID-19 patients and continuously higher than non-DVT-COVID-19 patients, indicating changes of D-dimer present an improvement in hypercoagulable state as well as a stable biomarker for anticoagulant effect in COVID-19 therapy. 45 Recently, researchers found D-dimer levels could affect anticoagulant doses. Prophylactic dose of heparin has been revealed its efficacy and better prognosis among users with D-dimer >6 times the upper limit of normal value (ULN) by improving 28-day mortality than that of nonusers (32.8 vs 52.4%) while users with D-dimer 1 ULN of no benefit. 46 In comparison, another study unveiled improved survival rate in patients with D-dimer above 3000 ng/ ml who administrated an intermediate dose of heparin than prophylactic doses. 47 Besides, prophylactic and therapeutic use of apixaban and enoxaparin prophylaxis is more beneficial in patients with D-dimer >10 mg/ml than UFH therapy while patients with D-dimer <1 mg/ml appears no benefit. 48 Benefit for extended thromboprophylaxis in the post-hospital discharge period (14-30 days) is also pronounced among patients with enhanced D-dimer >2 ULN and recognized 3-fold risk for VTE. 49 VTE risk stratification using very elevation of D-dimer may recommend intermediate or higher dose LMFH or UFH regimens. 50 Therefore, sequential measurement and careful assessment of D-dimer during disease worsening in addition to anticoagulation treatment may assist physicians to construct dynamic intervention, tailored prophylaxis or therapeutic doses and extended prophylaxis paradigms after hospitalization. We should apply D-dimer cautiously for anticoagulation considering the post-hoc feature of these studies and deficiency of clinical indications, its utility in adjusting antithrombotic strategies needs for prospective randomized controlled trails testing.",

Although we conducted a meta-regression analysis to distinguish heterogeneity, much of it remains to be explained and reported. In addition, the funnel plots indicated publication bias in the predictive value of D-dimer for mortality, likely due to the fact that researchers would rather submit the favorable results, moreover, all the enrolled researches in our meta-analysis are published by September 1, 2020 which may also contribute to our publication bias. This publication bias may lead to overestimation of the pooled sensitivity and specificity. Data of race, comorbidities (respiratory failure, cardiovascular disease, smoking history, malignancy, previous VTE, etc.), pregnancy, recent surgery or trauma and anticoagulant treatment could not be retrieved, which may have led to missing values in meta-regression and omissions of covariates in the heterogeneity test. The test time, detection platform, cut offs and various units of D-dimer also potentially contributed to heterogeneity and bias. Availability of complete data on patient selection and exclusion, presence of comorbidities, treatment statistics of in-hospital COVID-19 patients, as well as the precise timing and method of D-dimer test would greatly reduce the bias in our estimates. In addition, although the existing heterogeneity can be partially explained by patient recruitment and methodological variance of individual studies, an exact conclusion cannot be drawn due to the lack of explanation for the remaining heterogeneity. Further studies with more comprehensive data can elucidate the diagnostic performance of D-dimer in COVID-19.",
