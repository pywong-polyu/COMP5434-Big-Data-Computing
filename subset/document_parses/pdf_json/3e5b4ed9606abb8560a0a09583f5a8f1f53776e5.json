This study attempts to predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of OLE against Listeria monocytogenes F2365 by utilizing the asymptotic deceleration point (PDA) in a logistic model (LM), namely MIC-PDA. The experimental data obtained from the inhibitory rate (IR) versus OLE concentration against L. monocytogenes were sufficiently fitted (R 2 = 0.88957). Five significant critical points were derived by taking the multi-order derivatives of the LM function: the inflection point (PI), the maximum acceleration point (PAM), the maximum deceleration point (PDM), the absolute acceleration point (PAA), and the asymptotic deceleration point (PDA). The PDA ([OLE] = 37.055 mg/mL) was employed to approximate the MIC-PDA. This MIC value was decreased by over 42% compared to the experimental MIC of 64.0 mg/mL, obtained using the conventional 2-fold dilution method (i.e., MIC-2fold). The accuracy of MIC-PDA was evaluated by an in vitro L. monocytogenes growth inhibition assay. Finally, the logistic modeling method was independently validated using our previously published inhibition data of OLE against the growths of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enteritidis. The MIC-PDA (for [OLE]) values were estimated to be 41.083 and 35.313 mg/mL, respectively, compared to the experimental value of 62.5 mg/mL. Taken together, MIC-PDA, as estimated from the logistic modeling, holds the potential to shorten the time and reduce cost when OLE is used as an antimicrobial in the food industry.",

MIC values are used to assess the susceptibilities of bacteria to a particular drug or an antimicrobial compound [2] . They are commonly obtained by 2-fold serial dilutions of the antimicrobial agent in broth and assayed using 96-well microtiter plates, i.e., the MIC-2fold, for example, in the case of olive leaf extract (OLE) against Listeria monocytogenes [3] , a major foodborne pathogen. However, the MIC-2fold method is usually time-consuming and costly. It tends to overestimate the MIC values [4, 5] , caused by the large value-span between the last two concentration points (at the higher end of the data range).",

            "text": "OLE is derived from the leaves of olive trees. It has been used in traditional medicine for its various health benefits due to its high content of phenolic compounds [6] . The potential application of OLE has been recently recognized as a natural antimicrobial agent [3, 7, 8] , either used as an additive in foods [9] or more commonly incorporated into food packaging, such as films [10] [11] [12] [13] to enhance food safety. The parameters that control the qualities of these antimicrobial films, such as thickness, density, etc., are closely correlated with the MIC value in the food packaging industry [14] , implying a higher MIC value would lead to a higher cost of the product. Most importantly, high OLE levels (> 20 mg/100 g) could cause strong bitterness and pungent perception in foods [15] . Masking agents, such as sugar or salt, are often added to mask these undesirable flavors, introducing unnecessarily elevated amounts of sugar or sodium. Extensive research has established a probable link between over-consumption of sugar and sodium and increased risk in cardiometabolic disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, fatty liver, obesity, and dental caries [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, a higher OLE level resulted from a greater MIC (than necessary) would cause adverse nutritional and health effects. Consequently, finding a practical and reasonable MIC value is critical for the viable and broad applications of OLE to be realized and expanded in the food industry.",

[3, 8] , the inhibitory rate (IR) for OLE against L. monocytogenes resembled a sigmoidal growth trend as the OLE concentration increased, closely following a logistic model (LM) [19] rather than an exponential correlation. Although the logistic function and its variants have found uses to address microbial growth dynamics in a habitat of finite resources in food [20, 21] , referred to as the Verhulst model, the significance of its derivatives remains to be examined and exploited by the microbiology community. They (the logistic function and its derivatives) have been utilized in other research fields, including the mathematical characterization and understanding of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Italy [22] . They have also been applied to evaluate the callus growth kinetics and the accumulation of secondary metabolites of Bletilla striata, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant [23] , and simulate the growth of Centrolobium tomentosum fruits in Brazil for economic reasons [24] . Five meaningful critical points associated with growth kinetics have been reported for LM function: the absolute acceleration point (PAA), the maximum acceleration point (PAM), the inflection point (PI), the maximum deceleration point (PDM), and the asymptotic deceleration point (PDA) [25, 26] . These mathematically derived critical points separate the LM (0 \ufffd x < 1) into several phases and can be applied to describe the stages of varying biological significance (differential growth rate, acceleration, and deceleration) [26] . Among these points, the PDA can be of particular relevance and holds the potential to be used to evaluate the level to which the bacterial growth reaches sufficiently close to the asymptote (LM generally has an upper horizontal asymptote), so that the following experimental data points can be ignored [24, 25] .",

In addition, the data approached a sigmoidal-shaped curve rather than a linear correlation, suggesting that the distribution of IR versus OLE concentration in the inhibitory activities against L. monocytogenes resembled a logistic function. Subsequently, a logistic regression procedure was employed to fit the experimental data to depict and predict the critical points and phases of the inhibitory process. The \u03b2 and \u03b3 values in Eq 2 were estimated to be -1.9366 and 0.11413, respectively, by the logistic regression routine in Origin software. The resulting R 2 (correlation of determination) value was 0.88957, indicating a reasonably close fit [29] between the experimental data and the logistic model (LM) used. This established mathematical relationship makes it possible to estimate the OLE concentration reliably against L. monocytogenes at a desired IR value and vice versa.

The second-order derivative (y 00 , Fig 1C) returned the critical point PI (x 0 , y 0 ), i.e., the inflection point, corresponding to the OLE concentration (16.968 mg/mL) at half (50.000%) of the total IR. PI signifies the most rapid IR increase at this OLE concentration. After the inflection point, the rising rate of IR declines, approaching the limiting value. PAM (Fig 1D) , the maximum acceleration, and PDM, the maximum deceleration at increasing OLE concentration, were obtained by taking the third-order derivative of Eq (2) (y 000 , Fig 1D) . Their determination revealed that the IR rose rapidly before the PAM value (in the 1 st phase), increased gradually from PAM to PI (same as (x 0 , y 0 )) (the 2 nd phase), then declined quickly to PDM (the 3 rd phase). The fourth-order derivative (y 0000 , Fig 1E) identified, once again, the inflection point (PI, the 4 th phase), the absolute acceleration point (PAA, also fell in the 1st phase), and the asymptotic deceleration point (PDA) formed the 5th phase. The significance of PDA implied that the IR became increasingly insensitive to the growing OLE concentration (x !1) after this point. The OLE concentration was estimated to be 37.055 mg/mL at the asymptotic deceleration point (PDA), and an IR value of 90.825% was obtained (Eq 7).

We attributed this discrepancy to the experimental errors introduced in the dilutions of OLE and propagated in subsequent assays. Additionally, possible variations in the OD 600 measurements resulted in an over-estimation of IR (> 100%).

The two-fold dilution inhibition assay method appeared to overestimate the MIC in all three bacterial growth scenarios. The logistic modeling reasonably estimated the MIC values for all bacterial strains whose inhibition behavior by OLE followed a logistic function. The logistic modeling (Eq 2) of the data for E. coli O157:H7 and S. Enteritidis was performed by assuming a complete inhibition (\u03b1 = 100.00%), contrasting our previously experimentally determined IR of 95% for E. coli O157:H7 [3] compared to 100% for S. Enteritidis and L. monocytogenes. Indeed, all derived MIC-PDA, PI (x 0 ), PAM (x), and PAA (x) values ( Table 2) were higher for E. coli O157:H7 than those for S. Enteritidis and L. monocytogenes.

Taking multi-order derivatives of the logistic function (accomplished by the commercial software package, Origin) yielded four meaningful critical points, i.e., PI, PAM, PDM, and PAD, and five phases. The asymptotic deceleration point (PAD) proved to be of particular significance as it (MIC-PDA) approximated the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of OLE and agreed reasonably well with the MIC value obtained from the experimental inhibition assays. This work demonstrated combined approaches to yield MIC, i.e., estimation by taking the derivatives of a logistic function fitted with the inhibition data and direct determination by inhibition essays. We further independently validated the modeling method by applying the logistic function (Eq 2) to previously published data of OLE against two Gram-negative bacterial strains, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enteritidis. The resulting PDA-derived MIC values (MIC-PDA), 41.083 and 35.313, respectively, were significantly lower than those experimental MIC values, 62.5 mg/mL, similar to the case of OLE inhibition of L. monocytogenes studied in this work. Moreover, the LM results supported the observation that OLE was less effective against E. coli O157:H7 than S. enteritidis and L. monocytogenes. This logistic modeling procedure may be of particular interest in those cases when the observed variables follow a logistic relationship and help understand the biological events involved. ",
