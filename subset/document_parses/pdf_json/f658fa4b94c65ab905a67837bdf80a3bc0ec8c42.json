During the COVID-19 pandemic, the welfare state played a fundamental role, but neoliberalism restrained the ability of governments to respond to crises through budgetary action (Andrew et al., 2020) . A strong government is needed during this crisis with the capacity to adapt and learn, align public services and citizen needs; govern resilient production systems; and manage data and digital platforms (Mazzucato & Kattel, 2020) . Ansell et al. (2020) identify COVID-19 as a game-changer for public administration management and leadership styles, with the public sector facing simple and complex problems characterized by a surprising emergence of multiple, highly unpredictable and uncertain events. These problems call for robust governance solutions that are sufficiently adaptable, agile and pragmatic to achieve a particular goal or function in the face of continuous disruption. Sancino et al. (2020) state that individuals and organizations were affected disproportionately by the impact of COVID-19, both for the better (e.g. higher profits for technology companies) and for the worse (e.g. higher mortality rates in minority ethnic populations). The authors argue that new management solutions empower politicians and public managers to take more equitable decisions by analysing the effects of public decisions and public services on those experiencing them in order to visualize trade-offs in shared values and co-create more efficient and effective strategies.",

Countries with all three-a competent state apparatus, a government trusted and supported by its citizens, and effective leaders-have performed well with limited the damage caused by the pandemic. Conversely, countries with dysfunctional states, polarized societies, or weak and ineffective leaders performed poorly, leaving their citizens and economies vulnerable. However, Domingues (2020) states that while the virological facts of COVID-19 are the same worldwide, responses across countries differ due to their particular culture, leadership, and attitude toward both individual responsibility and the collective good. China, in an extremely authoritarian way, and the European Union, more democratically and liberally, have mounted somewhat effective responses (Domingues, 2020) .

While politicians, policymakers, and public managers in many countries have strived for NPM-like ways to make government bureaucracies less expensive and more flexible (Ott & Boonyarak, 2001) , the approach has been justified by some researchers (e.g. Greve, 2015) , others moderately criticize it (e.g. Dunn & Miller, 2007) , while others have largely rejected it (e.g. Farazmand, 2017a) .",

The dominance of NPM principles is evident in the current Brazilian context of re-democratization and post-privatization (Peci et al., 2008) . However, political interests reduce the effectiveness of public policy reforms (McNulty & Guerra Garcia, 2019) , In Colombia, governance reforms based on NPM principles need to focus more on public responsibility rather than solely on business-oriented targets. Rodriguez (2019) notes that political instability, corruption, government trust, the rule of law, and nascent democracy complicate the definition and practice of governance in Latin America. Common to all these countries is that governance is not sufficiently collaborative and innovative in designing democratically responsible solutions to complex twenty-first-century problems. Their governance still depends on highly hierarchical structures, and is rule-driven.",

Reduced monitoring seems to have encouraged (2021) armed groups and regional crime syndicates to further engage in unauthorised mining and land grabbing (Selibas, 2020) . The region has poor health services with no intensive care facilities. Indigenous communities in rural areas often have no access to essential services and must travel along rivers for several days to access medical centres. Many leave their villages for peri-urban areas, where they face additional difficulties such as food insecurity. Overcrowding, the loss of informal jobs and lack of access to clean water put them at greater risk of contracting COVID-19. Approximately 80% of the population in the area is poor, most people earn low and uncertain incomes and live in run-down settlements, often with no electricity, water, and sanitation access.

At the time of writing the fatality rates in Brazil among Indigenous people was 6.8% higher than both the national and regional North (5% and 4.5% respectively), while the Amazonian municipalities in neighboring Colombia and Venezuela registered the highest rates among national counts (Fellows et al., 2020) . The vulnerability of Indigenous communities was exacerbated by the several loggers, gold and mineral extractor companies invading their land and increasing risks for locals, with studies identifying a positive relationship between the most affected COVID-19 areas and unauthorized activities such as deforestation, logging, and mining (Fellows et al., 2020; APIB, 2021) . The UN Refugee Agency identified four Indigenous groups particularly affected by COVID-19 in Colombia, three of these groups live in the Amazon region (UNHCR, 2020) . Their remoteness and proximity to the Brazilian border made them more vulnerable to infection from poachers and unauthorised loggers. Here the COVID-19 mortality rate has been 50% higher than the rest of the country (JHU, 2021) . National and local governments made efforts to support education and health services in the region. However conflicts within local communities have increased mainly due to criminal activities but also as a result of poor decisions made by the government in terms of economic and infrastructural development, which favoured business interests over the well-being of Indigenous groups (Amador-Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2020; Ferrante & Fearnside, 2020; Montag et al., 2021) .",

For instance, in many villages of the Ucayali, while half of the population presented symptoms and most tested positive, the government failed to supply basic medicines such as paracetamol (Alberts, 2020) . In addition, the government decided to reopen mining, logging, industrial agriculture, oil activities in the region while several Indigenous communities tried to isolate themselves, exposing uncontacted tribes who had no previous immunity against even common infectious diseases to COVID-19 (Alberts, 2020) .

Neoliberal policies and successive governments' gross mismanagement have resulted in chronic under-investment in public services, particularly in healthcare, where austerity measures significantly undermind the provision of intensive care units (ICUs). At the beginning of the pandemic, Peru had only 1,656 ICU beds, fewer than Bogota, the capital of neighbouring Colombia, while having four times the population of Columbia (Kelly-Linden & Newey, 2021). The pre-pandemic availability of ventilators was also very limited with 1 per 100,000 people, a rate much lower than that of Brazil and Colombia (30 and 11 respectively; The Economist, 2020). For example, in Iquitos, the main regional hub, there were no ventilators. Since the early 2000s, successive governments tried to improve access to healthcare, especially in Indigenous areas, producing more than ten official policy reports on intercultural health, although very few of these have been implemented (Montag et al., 2021) .",

The Ministry of Health issued no specific regional guidelines nor assessed the capacity of the health system, or reinforced epidemiology surveillance, making it impossible to perform a rigorous analysis of the health needs of people in these regions. By June 2020, 773 cases from Indigenous communities were confirmed in Loreto and Ucayali, with per capita cases in these two areas twice the national average (Asociaci\u00f3n ProPur\u00fas, 2020). COVID-19 exposed the vulnerability of remote rural Indigenous communities, with about 60% of them deprived access to heath services (ECLAC et al., 2021) .",

The impact on the country's economy was devastating. Peru's GDP fell 30.2% in the second quarter of 2020, and many small businesses went bankrupt (Quigley, 2020) . The country recently experienced successive large protests which in November 2020, resulting in the removal of two presidents in one week. Elections in 2021 were won by a small margin by President Castillo, the left-wing candidate. Existing socio-economic inequalities exacerbated the severity of the crisis, with the result that one-third of the total population lives below the poverty threshold at the time of writing.",

While each country has unique core settings, deeply entrenched neoliberal policies and practices affected and misguided responses, have exacerbated the pre-existing inequalities. The effects of widespread neoliberal governance, combined with austerity and privatization programs, increased the vulnerability of Indigenous communities living in the region, which have been affected significantly by the pandemic. The Western Amazon region across Brazil, Colombia, and Peru has been worst affected due to inadequate health infrastructure and poor hygiene and sanitary conditions. The hardships in this region have been aggravated by its spatial remoteness, limited control and the probusiness and extractivist policies favoured by central governments. Unauthorised mining, land speculation, palm oil and cattle farming have been dominant features in the region. While governments allowed logging and mining businesses to operate during lockdowns, local residents and especially Indigenous people were forced to stay at home and refrain from their daily activities such as hunting or selling their products in local markets.",
