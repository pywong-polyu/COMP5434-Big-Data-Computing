Using age-standardized death rates, it attributes changes for Black, Hispanic, and White populations to various underlying causes of death and shows how these racial and ethnic patterns vary by age and sex. Hispanic individuals had the largest increase in mortality attributed to Covid-19, but Black individuals had the largest increase in all-cause mortality. Exceptionally large increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and external causes of death account for the adverse trend in all-cause mortality within the Black population. For the Black and White populations, percentage increases in all-cause mortality were similar for men and women and for ages 25-64 and 65+. Among the Hispanic population, however, percentage increases in mortality were greatest for working-aged men. Results are very similar when 2020 death rates are compared to those in 2019 and when they are compared to projected 2020 rates based on a time series extrapolation of death rates from 2015 to 2019.",

We start at age 25 because the number of deaths from Covid-19 in 2020 below age 25 was relatively small and the number of all-cause deaths below age 25 in 2020 was 2% below the average for 2015-19 (Rossen, 2020) .",

This paper focuses on the difference between the estimated 2020 ASDR by cause of death, sex, and race/ethnicity and their corresponding rates in 2019. We assume that the difference in agestandardized all-cause mortality rates between 2019 and 2020 reflect the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on mortality, aligning with previous descriptive work on excess mortality in 2020 (Ahmad & Anderson, 2021 ). An alternative approach used in several other studies is to fit a time series function to data on mortality in years prior to 2020 and use the predicted value of mortality in 2020 to compare to actual mortality in 2020 (Chen et al., 2021; Weinberger et al., 2020; . We employ one variant of the time series approach to investigate whether results are sensitive to the choice of 2019 data as the baseline for comparison.",

            "text": "For the entire United States, the number of deaths at ages 25+ rose by 18.9% between 2019 and 2020 [ Table 1 ]. After adjustment for the growth and aging of the population, the agestandardized death rate at ages 25+ rose by 17.0%. This percentage varied sharply among racial/ethnic groups. The death rate increased by only 12.7% among the White population, while it increased by 26.6% and 39.3% among the Black and Hispanic population, respectively. Table 1 shows that the ordering of mortality change among the groups depends on whether we focus on the absolute or the percentage change in the age-standardized death rate. Black individuals suffered the largest absolute increase in age-standardized mortality, 407 per 100,000 people followed by Hispanics whose death rate increased by 361/100,000, whereas the White rate increased by only 166/100,000. If we compare the percentage increases, the ranking of Hispanic and Black populations reverses because the larger absolute increase in death rates among Black individuals is superimposed upon a much higher Black death rate in 2019 [ Table   1 ]. We primarily feature the absolute change in mortality in this paper because it is the most direct measure of the change in the frequency of death per person. Figure 1 illustrates the contribution of both Covid-19 and causes other than Covid-19 to changes in mortality between 2019 and 2020. The Black population had the largest increase in death rates, as noted earlier, but the reason was not that Black individuals had the highest death rates from Covid-19. In fact, the Hispanic population aged 25+ saw the highest death rate from Covid-19 in 2020 (286/100,000), compared to 259/100,000 for the Black population and 122/100,000 for the White population [ Table 2 ].",

Apart from Covid-19 and the residual category, the three largest increases in mortality for Black and Hispanic individuals were from heart disease, diabetes, and external causes of death. These were three of the four largest increases among White populations as well, along with Alzheimer's disease. But the magnitude of the increases was markedly different; Black individuals saw by far the greatest increases for all three causes of death. In fact, Black individuals had a greater increase in mortality than both their White and Hispanic counterparts for every cause of death in Table 2 except malignant neoplasms, where mortality fell rather than rose. and other causes of death moved in opposite directions for the two groups. Greater increases for Black mortality relative to Hispanic mortality from heart disease, external causes, and diabetes more than offset the greater increase from Covid-19 in the Hispanic population.",

The all-cause ASDRs in 2019 for each race/ethnicity and standard age group were all within a 95% confidence interval of the expected 2020 ASDR based on the prior 5-year trend. The difference between 2019 death rates and predicted 2020 death rates was less than \u00bd of 1% for all racial/ethnic groups at ages 25+ and 65+ and between 0.8% and 1.2% at ages 25-64. A slightly higher ASDR predicted by prior 5-year trend for working-age populations across all race/ethnicities reflects increasing death rates in this age interval in recent years, a trend in part driven by a growing \"deaths of despair\" crisis (Elo et al., 2019) .",

The per capita infection rate was 143/10,000 for Hispanics, 107/10,000 for Blacks, and 46/10,000 for Whites. These ratios of Hispanic/White, Black/White, and Hispanic/Black infection rates are even higher than the respective ratios of Covid-19 mortality ( Table 2) , suggesting that infection rates are driving the mortality differentials. Other studies have also found that racial/ethnic differences in infection rates are far more important than differences in case-fatality levels in producing racial/ethnic differences in mortality (Benitez et al., 2020; Price-Haywood et al., 2020; Zelner et al., 2020) .",

These disruptions include those to health care systems and to personal networks of support. They would also affect the chances of detecting diseases. Fear of infection, loss of health insurance, reductions in visits to physicians and in elective procedures have been noted as indirect effects of the pandemic (Cantor et al., 2020; Dandona & Ghanim, 2021; Wessler et al., 2020) .

            "text": "Another explanation of the increased death rate from heart disease and diabetes in 2020 relates to the process by which underlying cause of death is assigned on death certificates. Heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's, another disease with elevated death rates in 2020, are chronic conditions. When a victim of one of these diseases contracts Covid-19 and dies, the person certifying underlying cause is faced with a choice of which entity to list as underlying cause. In some instances, the chronic condition is likely to be chosen. A recent county-level analysis found that areas with less access to primary care and health insurance and more at-home deaths had a higher fraction of 2020 \"excess deaths\" not assigned to COVID-19 (Stokes et al., 2021) . That was also true of areas with unusually high fractions of Black individuals. Lack of access to highquality health care may decrease the likelihood of COVID-19 testing and diagnosis. Some jurisdictions across the U.S., especially early in the pandemic, required a positive test result for a death to be assigned to COVID-19 and thus the absence of testing may have led to a death being assigned to a comorbid chronic condition such as diabetes or heart disease. Accurate cause of death assignment is also likely complicated by the large number of home deaths occurring during the pandemic, especially among racial/ethnic minority populations (Pathak et al., 2021) . When a death occurs at home, a medical certifier must deduce the cause of death based on medical history of the patient and/or interviews with family members. Deaths occurring at home are also more likely to be certified by a local coroner, who can lack medical training and has limited resources for performing post-mortem testing or autopsies (Stokes et al., 2021).",

In addition to the choice of modeling strategy, estimates may also be affected by the length of the time horizon used and the granularity of the time unit on the death series (Nepomuceno et al., 2021) . In the present study, results were not sensitive to the use of a linear modeling approach based on an extended time series, which may at least partially reflect our use of age standardization to account for changes in the population age structure. Uncertainties are likely greatest for external causes of death because deaths from drug overdose were already increasing rapidly in 2019 so that some of the growth in this category in 2020 may be a result of preexisting trends (Glei, 2021) .",

Since the most recent available data was limited to 13 selected causes of death, the construction of a residual category for all other causes was required for this study. Increases in this category comprised a small but not insignificant portion of all-cause ASDR increases (6.3% for Hispanic, 9 .7% for Black, and 13.9% for White populations). As more granular cause-specific data becomes available, future studies should expand on this analysis to incorporate a wider range of underlying causes. Additionally, other studies may include among deaths attributable to Covid-19 those deaths in which the term appears elsewhere on the death certificate or when other criteria are invoked (Gundlapalli, 2021; NCHS, 2020b ). As noted above, the number of Covid-19 deaths when including Covid-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate is 9.6% larger than .

Black/White differentials have indeed become exaggerated during the pandemic, both with respect to Covid-19 deaths themselves and to all-cause mortality. However, the Hispanic experience is not consistent with this claim. Despite having the lowest pre-pandemic mortality, Hispanic individuals suffered the largest increase in mortality from Covid-19. The explanation for high Hispanic Covid-19 mortality appears related to a high incidence of Covid-19, likely shaped by structural factors, such as higher participation in essential occupations with fewer workforce protections and denser living arrangements.",

Recent work suggests that the life expectancy drop in 2020 led to an elimination of progress made in the past decade to narrow the Black-White life expectancy gap and a near elimination of the Hispanic life expectancy advantage (Andrasfay & Goldman, 2021; Woolf et al., 2021).",

Hispanic communities have the lowest rate of health insurance coverage of any racial/ethnic group in the United States, with nearly 20% uninsured, compared to just 5% of the White population(Macias Gil et al., 2020). Additionally, language barriers, distrust and fear of healthcare institutions driven by broader anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy, and underlying financial hardship faced by Hispanic individuals, particularly those in the immigrant community, have all been linked to worse healthcare access and quality, potentially amplifying the impact of Covid incidence on mortality outcomes(Macias Gil et al., 2020;Riley et al., 2021;Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2020; Simon et al., 2021). These health care barriers, coupled with a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, likely worsen Covid-19 outcomes in the Hispanic community once infected(Kim & Hales, 2021;   Simon et al., 2021)",
