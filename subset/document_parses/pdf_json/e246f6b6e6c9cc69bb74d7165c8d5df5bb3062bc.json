            "text": "Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected the lives of people with disabilities (PWD). How the pandemic affects the employment of PWD and employers has yet to be determined. We aimed to investigate the employment consequences of the pandemic as experienced by PWD and employers. The research questions were: (1) What employment effects do PWD experience, and what business changes do employers encounter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) What challenges have PWD encountered during the pandemic?Methods Cross-sectional online surveys of 733 PWD and 67 employers in the Midwestern United States.Results Compared to non-disabled peers, PWD encountered more challenges in employment during the pandemic. We found high percentages of both employers and PWD experiencing employment changes and business shutdown during the pandemic. For PWD whose employment was not affected, 14.6% of the participants (n = 107) expected a loss of income and worried about the economic uncertainty of the pandemic. Unemployment for PWD is high due to illness or disability, being laid-off or furloughed, business reductions, and not feeling safe to work. However, only about 18.6% of unemployed PWD (n = 16) received pay or benefits for the time they were not working even though more than half filed for unemployment benefits.Conclusions The pandemic adversely affected employment of PWD as reported by workers and employers. Findings parallel the experience of the non-disabled workforce, but reveal vulnerabilities that reflect disability consequences and the need for job accommodations. Results reveal emergent needs for policy supports to reduce the disparities experienced by PWD in the workplace.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported over 240 million cases and nearly five million deaths globally as of the end of October 2021 [1] . In the United States (US), there are more than 45.5 million confirmed cases with more than seven hundred thousand deaths [2] . The COVID-19 pandemic also led to the highest unemployment rate since 1948 in the US due to mandatory shutdowns and voluntary business closures [3] . While the emergence of the pandemic and the economic recession affected all demographic groups, it placed significant burden on minority populations, including Blacks, Hispanics, and younger workers as reported in May 2021 by the US Congressional Research Service [4] . In April 2021, 9.4 million persons reported that they are unable to work because their employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic [5] . The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected small businesses, which are responsible for employing half of American workers; 43% of small businesses temporarily closed, and employment rates decreased by 40% [6] .",

For example, Emerson, Hatton [15] reported that people with intellectual disabilities were more likely to be exposed to non-standard employment conditions, including temporary contracted employment and part-time jobs, and experience job insecurity and economic inactivity than the general population. The authors also found that unstable employment and job insecurity were associated with poorer health conditions. Delman, Kovich [16] stressed that people with mental illness often experienced challenges accessing reasonable job accommodations and were not eligible for health insurance benefits. The employment picture for PWD was worse than their non-disabled peers during the economic regression from December 2007 to June 2010. McAlpine and Alang [17] reported that people with mental illness and physical disabilities experienced the biggest hits in employment during the Great Recession. PWD were more likely to be unemployed, experience poor living conditions, and use social welfare than their peers without disabilities [17] . Needed are investigations of the employment and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on PWD.",

Moreover, Hispanic PWD were more likely to experience decreased pay or have serious financial problems (X 2 = 6.06, p < .05). Pandemic effects on employment were not related to respondents' sex, race, or education level. Table 3 summarizes results from the employer survey; 67 employers or supervisors answered the survey from diverse industries, including health care and social services (34.0%, n = 18), education (9.4%, n = 5), and arts, entertainment and recreation (7.5%, n = 4). The majority of the employers represented medium or large businesses with more than 50 employees (73.6%, n = 39) and worked in the Midwest (84.9%, n = 45). Most of the respondents worked in human [35] . Table 4 presents the COVID-19 pandemic effects on respondents' businesses.

            "text": "This study provides important information about how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the employment status of PWD and businesses of employers mainly in the Midwestern United States. PWD encountered significant challenges obtaining or maintaining employment in a safe workplace during the pandemic-related economic recession. Overall, 97.0% and 24.8% of employers and PWD experienced employment changes and business shutdowns during the pandemic, respectively. For PWD whose employment was not affected, 14.6% expected a loss of income and were worried about their financial security. Nearly half (47.5%) of PWD were unemployed due to illness or disability, being laid-off, or not feeling safe to work. However, only 18.6% of unemployed PWD received pay or benefits for the time they are not working even though more than half filed for unemployment benefits. Perhaps PWD were ineligible for benefits because they had shorter or interrupted work histories. If so, government policies could reduce this disparity in unemployment benefits by considering the unique needs of PWD that limit full time employment. Some PWD are at a high risk of infection from COVID-19 due to compromised immune and respiratory systems. Social distancing caused disruptions in care for PWD who rely on home health or personal assistants [21] . Despite the significant effects of the pandemic on PWD, the Executive and Legislative branches of the federal government made no disability-specific policy changes. Labor policies established by the US Department of Labor and monitored by the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2020, such as the Family First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) program, offered financial support to Americans unable to work due to the pandemic [36] regardless of disability status. As people are getting vaccinated in the US and businesses are re-opening, employers will need to adhere to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act [37] . Well-designed and sustained labor along with public health policies were critical during the pandemic. Policies should also address PWD's needs for healthcare services, employment, transportation, smart technologies, and communication technology.",

For employees with cognitive or visual deficits, employers should provide reminders of protocols in relevant spaces (e.g., large poster above a sink for effective handwashing techniques) and mark boundaries for social distancing [38] . They should make special efforts to support employees who are deaf or hard-of-hearing in virtual work environments, including using quiet rooms, avoiding background noises, creating protocols to avoid crosschatter, and implementing visual text [39] .

At a minimum, employers should provide options for one-way aisles, Plexiglas barriers, non-latex gloves, gowns designed for wheelchair-users, and modified face masks with clear center panels for lipreaders and interpreters [38, 40] . The ADA also maintains that receiving accommodations does not preclude PWD from requesting additional protections for COVID-19-related concerns. In summary, it is critical to remain flexible and responsive to the needs of employees with disabilities, understanding that they may change with the emerging practices and guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Vocational rehabilitation counselors and occupational therapists are well positioned to work with employers and employees with disabilities in ensuring the at-home work environment accommodates employees. The need to support COVID-19 long haulers return to work is another role for rehabilitation counselors given their knowledge of the ADA [42, 43] . Since we are still learning about the longterm effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PWD [7, 8] , the scope of new opportunities for rehabilitation professionals is just being realized.",

We consulted with an advisory group composed of key stakeholders and conducted cognitive interviews with participants to validate the surveys before dissemination. However, this study has some limitations. First, the cross-sectional design does not capture the influences of COVID-19 on PWD's employment over time as the social, economic, and political situations changed rapidly during the pandemic. Longitudinal studies should investigate the long-term effects of the pandemic on PWD's employment. Second, inherent in the sampling approach, our participants were restricted to PWD with internet access, understood English, and lived primarily in the Midwest. This sampling strategy could limit the generalizability of the results. Future studies should explore regional and industry variations nationwide and translate the surveys into different languages to obtain perspectives from diverse populations.",
