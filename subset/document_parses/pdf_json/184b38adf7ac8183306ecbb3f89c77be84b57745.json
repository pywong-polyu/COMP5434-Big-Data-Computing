Psychophysical tests are crucial to determine the exact frequency, extent and clinical characteristics of these OTDs. The present study objectively evaluated the OTD for patients treated in the Dedicated COVID-19 Hospital (DCH) in Shahdol. This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted after IEC approval in DCH Shahdol for a period of four months among RT-PCR positive patients, and they were evaluated using validated chemosensitive psychophysical test during ENT consultation to identify OTD. The sample size was calculated as 92 considering prevalence (p) of OTD as 41.3% by applying formula: n = (Z 1-a/2 ) 2 9 p (1-p) / d 2 . The information pertaining to the subjects was kept anonymous and confidential. During data analysis, an association was significant for p value \\ 0.05. It was observed that 45.5% of subjects reported either loss of taste or smell. During objective evaluation, olfactory and taste dysfunction was observed among 42.4% of subjects (95/ 224). The Chi-square analysis reflected statistically significant difference (p \\ 0.05) between subjects with OTD and without OTD for the variables such as days from onset of symptoms to admission, and symptoms (fever, sore throat and shortness of breath). Taste and smell are among the important senses and in India they are mostly subjectively evaluated for COVID-19 induced OTD which results in underreporting of these symptoms. So, a gold standard objective evaluation should be taken into consideration to evaluate OTD.",

The identification and isolation of the pauci-symptomatic patients is crucial for breaking the virus chain of infection. Such health control measures will be crucial in the upcoming months to contain any new epidemic clusters. However, most of reports published so far do not evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the extent of chemosensory disorders in COVID-19 patients. Most of the studies are based on subjective self-evaluations of the patients, report of anamnestic data, or olfactory and gustatory questionnaire completion, without any objective test or direct medical examination [16] [17] [18] [19] . This can be explained by the emergency situation and the risk of infection while approaching these patients without proper personal protection equipment.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology mechanism of olfactory and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 is still unknown. The most likely mechanism is that SARS-CoV-2 targets the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors found on the sustentacular and basal cells of the nasal epithelium, including the olfactory epithelium. It is also postulated that the virus invades the central nervous system through the olfactory bulb [23, 24] . So, acquisition of objective data is fundamental to understand mechanisms of olfactory and taste loss in COVID-19 subjects and provide new insights into aspects of viral pathogenesis. The present study reflected that loss of taste and smell were among the early occurring symptoms in COVID-19 subjects, as 56.8% of subjects (58/ 102) reported loss of taste or smell occurring within the first 5 days of the clinical onset. Also, among 10.7% of study subjects (24/224), loss of taste and smell was among the first clinical manifestation of the COVID-19. Therefore, otorhinolaryngologists and head-neck surgeons should nowadays consider COVID-19 as a differential diagnosis of non-specific chemosensitive disorders. As reflected in present study that 7.1% of subjects (16/224) had loss of taste and smell that was sudden in onset (within 24 to 48 h) along with no nasal obstruction or rhinitis symptoms are very suspect clinical features of COVID-19. During the hospital stay, 53.9% (55/102) of subjects expressed that the they have recovered from the symptoms of loss of taste and smell, but when they were objectively evaluated it was observed that 70.9% (39/55) of subjects still had a residual degree of loss of taste and smell. Although more than half of the study subjects reported of being suffered from complete ageusia and anosmia (102/ [25, 26] . The statistical analysis of the differences in OTD between selected subpopulations, has revealed some interesting points which should be confirmed by studies with larger sample size and multicentric in nature.",

Symptoms such as fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, and days of onset of symptoms were significantly associated with OTD. Also, no significant association was found between the extent of the OTD and the severity of the COVID-19 and this evidence should be confirmed by studies with larger sample size, which may reveal the fascinating pathogenetic scenarios. However, considering that there is a correlation between the severity of the systemic clinical picture and viral load on RT-PCR, other local factors are likely to participate in causing the onset of OTD in COVID-19 patients, prospective studies with objective evaluation will be necessary to clarify the prognostic value of OTD [23] .",

Being hospital based study, the true prevalence of hypogeusia/ageusia and hyposmia/anosmia among the COVID-19 positive patient cannot be commented from the present study and the constraints which restricted authors to objectively evaluate the prevalence of loss of smell/taste at the level of community was explored from the pilot study being performed and it included factors such as being tribal area with lower literacy rate (below 50%), the questionnaire in the local language could not be sent over the social media platform (WhatsApp, Telegram); a lower response rate was observed due to fear to get admitted to hospital while collecting data telephonically or via home visits; and most importantly there was lack of trained field level health care workers to perform the objective tests for hypogeusia/ageusia and hyposmia/anosmia for home isolated COVID-19 patients.",

In India, generally the COVID-19 induced OTD is noted based on self-reporting without objective evaluation, which results in under reporting of these symptoms.
