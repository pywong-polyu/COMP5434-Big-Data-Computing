In this paper, we first analyze the limiting behavior of both measures as the number of test repetitions increases and derive the corresponding accuracy estimates and rates of convergence. To overcome possible limitations of IRP and IAP, we then introduce a one-parameter family of refined reliability measures, (k, s). Such measures characterize the consistency of the results of a dichotomous test in the absence of a gold standard as the threshold for a positive aggregate test result varies. Similar to IRP and IAP, we also derive corresponding accuracy estimates and rates of convergence for (k, s) as the number k of test repetitions increases.",

The estimation of both accuracy measures is straightforward when the true disease status is observable, for instance, through the availability of a gold standard (Yerushalmy 1947) . On the other hand, a gold standard may become unavailable due to a number of reasons such as cost constraints, practicability, disease prevalence, or even ethical grounds. As examples one can consider a definite diagnosis of such diseases as depression (Gelaye et al. 2014) , childhood pulmonary tuberculosis (Wang et al. 2017 ), Alzheimer's disease as well as myocardial infarction (Hui and Zhou 1988) , or the determination of the hydroxymethylation status of a given cytosine (Slynko and Benner 2019) .",

The limiting values from our analysis already appear in Eq. (5) of Akkerhuis et al. (2019) and were there taken to be equal to IRP(k) and IAP(k) for each finite value of k.

In many situations, however, it might be desirable to place the cut-off for the aggregate test result at a level different from the 50% level of the mode-based cut-off. For instance, the test might be designed in a way that leads to skewed outcomes, or one of the outcomes might have more serious consequences than the other. For example, one might wish to avoid false negatives in repeated rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing or to have a high degree of certainty of a positive result before engaging in invasive treatment. This leads us very naturally to a family of refined reliability measures (k, s), which allow for a flexible choice of the percentage at which the aggregate test result is interpreted as positive.",

Let us now consider the data presented in Table 1 of Chiang (1951) , with k = 5 repetitions of a given test. Using that data and the maximum likelihood estimation procedure described in that paper, we first estimate the parameters a and b in (4) and get\u00e2 = 0.0347 andb = 0.5837. Under the assumption that f (\u00b7) remains unchanged as the number k of test repetitions increases, we then calculate both measures IRP(k) and IAP(k) for increasing values of k, together with their limiting values (2) and (3); see Fig. 1 for an illustration. Later in this paper we will analyze the rates of convergence in (2) and (3). But before we start with that analysis, let us discuss possible limitations of the proposed reliability measures, IRP(k) and IAP(k). In particular, both measures assume that the test result can be derived symmetrically, based on the mode of the obtained k test outcomes. This approach is clearly not optimal when either a positive or a negative test result can carry significant consequences, e.g., when the positive test result may lead to further invasive tests or treatment such as biopsy, an X-ray or CT scan or even surgery. In such situations, a certain skewness of aggregate test results might be desirable. Thus we might want to place the cut-off for the aggregate test result at a level different from the 50% level of the mode-based cut-off. This leads us to a family of refined reliability measures (k, s) introduced in Sect. 3, with the percentages of the positive test results as the corresponding cut-off. Note that such refined measures also help to overcome the other limitation of the IRP(k) and IAP(k) measures, namely that those reliability measures are based on central tendency of the obtained test results and thus do not discriminate between two given sequences of test repetitions if those sequences have the same mode.",

To address test reliability, the knowledge of the true disease status of the patient is desired. In practice, that knowledge might become crucial, in particular, when there is no gold standard available. In such cases, the true disease status of the patient can be estimated by applying one or several imperfect reference tests as proposed in Alonzo and Pepe (1999) , Hui and Zhou (1988) , Hui and Walter (1980) , Pepe and Janes (2007) . In this paper we suggest a method for approaching the reliability of a new test that does not require any additional reference test. In the context of that method, the reliability is evaluated based on the results of test repetitions. In particular, we first analyze the reliability measures IRP and IAP as proposed in Akkerhuis et al. (2019) . Further, we introduce a one-parameter family of refined reliability measures (k, s) and investigate their limiting behavior as the number k of test repetitions increases.",
