[17] [18] [19] However, such tactile interventions have not been widely explored as a tool to reduce procedural anxiety in radiotherapy patients. It is postulated that SAT can provide a non-invasive intervention to combat procedural anxiety surrounding radiotherapy due to their ability to reproduce natural touch. 20 The following paper aims to investigate patient, carer and healthcare professional (HCP) views on the creation of a calming device using SAT to combat induced procedural anxiety. Patients were asked about what aspects of any SAT device they would find calming. Carers play a vital role in supporting their loved ones through difficult times, a view endorsed by a recent study (MacMillan survey), 21 which reported 74% of carers supported their loved ones by talking and listening to them. Therefore, we can assume they have insight on the impact of medical procedures on their loved ones and also have a role in the requirements of such a device. Finally, the views of HCPs as key stakeholders in any potential device were collected to ensure future clinical usability and translation. HCP views were collected in order to advise on professional requirements (eg, cleanability), as well as what they thought patients might appreciate about any calming SAT device. We intend to use the insights of the above groups to facilitate the future development of a design brief for an SAT prototype device to reduce procedural anxiety. This will ensure that the prototype device will be relevant and suitable for future clinical settings.",

This is consistent with the literature which suggests interruptions to their workload may contribute to medical errors. 27 Control of the device was a controversial topic. Patients expressed the desire to have control of the device, whereas HCPs were keen for patients not to have control. HCPs feared that patient control would lead to disruptions to the treatment session. Both groups agreed that allowing relatives some degree of control of the device would be good. Future iterations of the device need to provide the level of control required by the patients while addressing HCPs' concerns in relation to service delivery.

They were concerned patients may associate it with a blood pressure cuff, a device that can induce spike anxiety in certain patients. 35 On the other hand, the only patient requirement was to make the device look visually appealing using lights and colour. Aesthetic factors have been suggested as important considerations in the healthcare setting because they may influence whether patients will use the device. 36 HCPs often gave their views on device design from a professional standpoint, for example, by suggesting a design which can be applied to multiple different areas of the body. This would allow personalisation of the device so patients can use the device wherever they feel might be most comforting. Radiotherapy for head and neck cancer can be particularly anxiety-inducing due to the need for a close-fitting mask, 13 and it may be prudent to make sure any device design accommodates these patients.",

The use of convenience sampling may have resulted in a selection bias, leading to more homogeneous focus groups with under-representation or over-representation of particular cohorts. For example, all participants were selected from a single geographical area. Aside from sampling limitations, the collection of demographic data could have provided useful insight into the impact of ethnicity on design preferences for this device. The study also only considered adult participants; future studies may consider how the design of an SAT device might differ for children. Finally, a limitation of focus groups is that participants may not feel able or want to share their views, or that one or two people may dominate the discussion. We attempted to address these limitations by creating a relaxed environment and using experienced moderators.",

HCPs and patients agree on some features: a warm device which is flexible in where it can be used on the body (hence, accommodating patients no matter where they are receiving radiotherapy). Both agreed that relatives should have some control over the device. HCPs wanted to ensure the device can easily be cleaned while patients were keen for the vibration and pulsation sensations to be used to put them at ease. Areas where no consensus was reached could be further explored as well as including greater PPI in the form of a project advisory group.",
