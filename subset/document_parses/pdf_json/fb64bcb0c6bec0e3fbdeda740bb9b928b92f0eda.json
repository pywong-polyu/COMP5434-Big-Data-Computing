This gap is significant because artifacts are readily visible and provide valuable insight into understanding the perpetuation of norms through their manifestation in the work environment. Moreover, existing assessments focus on one layer only, either values/beliefs or underlying assumptions, resulting in only a partial picture of culture. In this tutorial-based paper, we demonstrate a grounded theory approach comprising content analysis, thematic analysis, and intensity scoring, to develop an unobtrusive method for coding artifacts seen in photos of office spaces. Unobtrusive methods reduce participant burden, which is critical because existing assessments of culture are time consuming and/or rely on numerous participants. We demonstrate how to use the photo coding method and wrap-up the tutorial by showing how artifact coding augments an existing qualitative culture assessment, emphasizing the added value of artifact assessment. We hope by providing an unobtrusive method to artifact coding, researchers will start assessing this important layer of culture to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of organizational culture.",

Most reported assessments of organizational culture use quantitative methods (i.e., self-report surveys; Jung et al., 2009) , which require aggregating the responses of a vast numbers of respondents, sometimes over long periods and occasionally involving more than one assessment event (e.g., Huhtala et al., 2016) . In contrast, less commonly used qualitative approaches to culture assessment rely heavily on organizational immersion (i.e., ethnography) and/or time intensive interviews or focus groups (Ostroff et al., 2013) . To date, we could find only one quantitative measure of artifacts (Bonavia, 2006) , with the remaining quantitative measures focused on assessing practices as indicators of values (Jung et al., 2009) . Nearly all qualitative approaches aim for assessing underlying assumptions and values or norms (e.g., Smollan & Sayers, 2009 ). Schein suggested that although artifacts do not explain why people behave the way they do in organizations, artifacts give valuable insight into the culture because they \"tell us about the values and basic assumptions\" (Schneider et al., 2013, p.380) , and how norms manifest themselves in the work environment, which facilitates the endurance of culture.",

Byrne, Kelly A. Cave, and Steven D. Raymer have contributed equally to this work. informants or respondents. Hence, recent efforts to improve the measurement of organizational culture have turned to unobtrusive methods (Reader et al., 2020) , such as textual analyses of existing databases, as a means for reducing the burden of extensive data collection on organizational members. Unobtrusive methods do not involve employees, providing a nonreactive approach that minimizes interruptions and lost productivity while data are collected (Reader et al., 2020) . Like other advances in culture measurement, unobtrusive methods do not replace all other existing culture assessments. Using only one assessment of culture still results in an incomplete picture, regardless of assessment method (Schein, 1990) . With all the assessment types noted above, data reflecting a broad range of shared group norms and attitudes are combined and analyzed to form the organizational level perspective of culture (Chatman & O'Reilly, 2016) .",

Since then, this framework is frequently used as a foundational model to define the construct and to support studies that establish the pervasiveness and embeddedness of culture within organizations by assessing at least one of the layers. For example, studies employing qualitative methods, such as ethnography and interviews, extract implicit and underlying assumptions and determine how those manifest themselves in policies that create or sustain organizational norms, such as ethical or unethical decision-making (Campbell & Goritz, 2014; Smollan & Sayers, 2009) . In contrast, quantitative methods for assessing culture are often aimed at changing the culture, such as efforts to improve organizational performance (Chatman & O'Reilly, 2016) . Existing quantitative measures like the Competing Values Framework (CVF; Cameron et al., 2006) and the Organizational Culture Profile (OCP; O'Reilly et al., 1991) , focus on assessing norms or values (Ghosh & Srivastava, 2014; Rousseau, 1990) , such as values for performance (van den Berg & Wilderom, 2004) or values associated with predefined cultures like clan or adhocracy (Cameron et al., 2006) .",

We speculate the lack of artifact measurement is mainly because of a limited use of visual methodologies, such as photographs, in the organizational sciences (Ray & Smith, 2012) , and secondarily due to the ambiguity for outsiders to the organization in deciphering what artifacts mean to organizational members (Schein, 1990) .",

            "text": "The use of photos in qualitative research is not new. Researchers use photos to document environments, interpret phenomena, extend theory, or supplement other qualitative methodologies, such as interviews (Dacin et al., 2010; Ray & Smith, 2012) , within several different disciplines, such as management, engineering, and agriculture. These photos mainly serve to provide a visual of what the field setting looks like or to document the field setting (e.g., archeological dig site). Originating in sociological research, photo elicitation, which refers to the presentation of a photo during an interview (Collier, 1967) , is a technique that uses photos to enrich the interview process. Photo elicitation may be one of the most popular uses of photos in research and has been used for many years across a variety of fields including physical education (e.g., Snyder & Kane, 1990) , tourism (Jenkins, 1999) , ethnic racial studies (Winddance, 2006) , and health sciences (J. Saunders et al., 2020) . The specific process involves the researcher providing the participant with photos during the interview, and then asking the participant to provide an interpretation of what they see in the photo. Hence, the photo itself is not the actual data -rather what the participant says about the photo and their reaction to the photo serves as the data for the research study. What is in the actual photo depends on the goal of the study. For example, Wilhoit Larson (2020) had participants take pictures of their own workspace and then, while sitting with the participants looking at the pictures, asked them to describe the decorations in the workspace and how they use the space shown in their photo. A similar approach called photovoice is a method by which participants take pictures and then discuss in groups what they meant to communicate through those photos (e.g., Sarrica & Brondi, 2020) . In both approaches, photo elicitation and photovoice, the data are what the participant says and not the photos themselves. A recent advancement in photo elicitation methodology is called grounded visual pattern analysis (GVPA; Shortt & Warren, 2019) . GVPA involves participants taking their own photos of their environment, but unlike Wilhoit Larson's process, participants provide either a written or verbal narrative around the content in those photos, without the presence of the researcher. In GVPA, researchers can conduct the analysis of the photos and accompanying narrative years after the photos and narrative are collected.",

However, Wong et al., (2011) took an approach to the use of photos as data that provided insight for our development of an unobtrusive culture assessment. Using a ruler and likesized published photos of various companies' chief executive officers (CEO), the authors measured the width to length ratio of the CEOs' faces and related the ratio to archival data of company performance. The authors proposed, based on evolutionary suppositions, that physical characteristics, in particular those indicating physical strength and an ability to dominate others (Haselhuhn et al., 2015) , influence leaders' effectiveness. The authors consistently found that CEOs whose faces were wider than long, indicating a more physically imposing leader, ran companies that achieved higher financial performance than those run by CEOs with a greater length to width ratio face structure. Wong et al. (2011) basically coded the image in the photo, which led ua to the idea of coding the contents of a workspace from a photo of that setting.",

Thus, researchers can investigate reflections or manifestations of culture (i.e., artifacts) in an unrestrictive manner and in their natural setting. Lastly, photos enable the researcher to capture data from a wide range of organizational perspectives.

For example, photos might include offices, meeting rooms, hallways (especially to capture if the hallway is decorated or not decorated), lunch rooms (if they exist), mail rooms (if they exist), furniture, walls, desks, uniforms (if present), non-work items (if present), etc. It is not known a priori which artifacts are more meaningful than others; however, because we suggest pairing photo coding with other methods of culture assessment, information about the culture gleaned from other assessments could inform the artifact sampling approach.",

Since there is subjectivity to the coding process, the multi-round consensus approach characteristic of qualitative methods is a way of dealing with subjectivity and adding rigor (reliability) to making sense of images and deriving meaningful labels (Salda\u00f1a, 2009) . By converging on similar interpretations of the data, the coders develop labels and categories with robustness and transferability (Potter & Levine-Donnerstein, 1999) . We employed established strategies for ensuring rigor throughout the entire research process (Morse et al., 2002) , including researcher responsiveness (challenging, openness, creativity of ideas), methodological coherence (alignment between research question, method, and analyses), and sampling adequacy (appropriate sample, achieve saturation: i.e., indicator for stopping data collection and/or analysis; indicates sufficient purposive sampling; B. Saunders et al., 2018) .",

Thus, we identified office artifacts based on three main characteristics: (1) form, the presence of purposeful or experienced design, architecture, or spatial arrangement; (2) function, the utility of objects for performing roles or contributing to the character of an office, and (3) social agency, the use of artifacts to reflect personality or individualization in an office setting. For instance, we identified a desk and its location (form), whether it had a computer and papers on it (function), and whether the items on the desk were neatly organized, and whether there were personal items (e.g., photos, decorations) or work-related items only on the desk (social agency).",

Thus, coders use thematic analysis to develop the 2 nd order code from these identified themes or patterns that emerge from the descriptions of the contents of the workspace. The overall coding process is iterative, requiring some flexibility with the generation and application of codes. The descriptions and themes of artifacts arise from observations, previous knowledge of norms and expectations, and inferences of the workplace settings. Coders should use caution in assigning descriptions and themes, treating each new workplace setting with a fresh perspective, and not artificially forcing meaning onto artifacts based on codes from a previous photo/setting. One method to maintain perspective of each setting is through the use of a special identifier for each artifact, which is an additional observation separate from the three tiers of coding from content analysis. Coders note why the artifact is important and describe its use. Coders then apply intensity scoring, described next, prior to determining and finalizing the 3 rd order codes. Chatman and O'Reilly (2016) proposed that norm strength, determined through culture assessment, should reflect not only the consensus or agreement of a norm, but the intensity or force with which the norm is held. An intensity score represents the degree to which cultural elements (artifacts, norms, and assumptions) are held, emphasized, or represented in an organization. When applied to norms, intensity is characterized by members' compliance and agreement towards perceived norms. Thus, the more intense a norm, the more the organization reinforces and perpetuates the norm; cultures with a low tolerance for norm violations would have high intensity scores. We extrapolated the concept of compliance, representing intensity by the degree to which an artifact compared with similar artifacts across office settings in the organization. Importantly, coders compare the artifacts based on their relationships with other artifacts in the same organization, given how loosely or tightly the artifact held to a certain standard or average across offices within the organization.",

Coders assign an intensity score on a 1 to 5 rating scale to each artifact. It is important for coders to agree on how the intensity scores reflect the artifacts. For example, for coding office spaces, our intensity decisions were based on usage of space (more usage equals higher intensity), the amount of objects (more objects/clutter equals higher intensity), and types of objects (strongly themed or fancy objects equals higher intensity). Alongside making comparisons with similar artifacts from other offices, we further delineated artifact intensity based on variance in uniqueness, or distraction, from the rest of the office environment. For instance, the less similar the artifact in one office compared to others would result in a score of 1 (lowest intensity), indicating a lack of norm strength or agreement of a norm. Similar to content analysis of photos, coders should determine intensity scores using a multi-round calibration method that allows for discussion and consensus on the scoring process for each artifact.",

In the vernacular of the qualitative method of content analysis, the broader categories are referred to as dimensions (Gioia et al., 2013) , which we refer to as 3 rd order codes. Names for 3 rd order codes emerge from patterns in the themes and how the broader category reflects the organizational members' lived experience of their work space.

The researcher only took pictures of workspaces relevant to faculty in each department because the focus of the project was on department culture. Offices were occupied by 18 females and 13 males, ranging in age from 30 to 61, who held various positions within faculty ranks including non-tenure track instructor, assistant professor, associate professor, and full professor. Given that organizational culture has a pervasive effect on all organizational members (Chatman & O'Reilly, 2016) , which means that any randomly selected office should have cultural artifacts that represent the whole, we chose to randomly photograph offices in each participating department. From a list of office numbers provided by each department office manager, the first author used a random number generator to select which offices to photograph, only taking photos with permission from the occupant who left the room during the photo session. Therefore, there were no photos of people working in the space. In nearly all cases, the researcher took more than one photo to capture the entire space and its contents, including walls, floors, behind doors, cabinets, and around desks. The first author then blurred all identifying objects, such as name plates or faces in framed photos, within the office photos before randomly numbering the photos. Figures 2 and 3 show examples of photos of two different offices. The second and third authors of the current study, who had no exposure to the offices or their occupants, conducted the content analysis. ",

We identified basic thematic elements of each artifact, which led to the emergence of four generalized artifact themes: office furniture, work supplies, decorations, and office structure/design. After assigning a generalized theme to each artifact, we added a short descriptor as a special identifier to the theme based on the 1 st order coding of the artifact. While the generalized themes allowed for grouping at the 2 nd order level, we used the special identifiers to help characterize each particular artifact within an assigned theme. This characterization is useful for maintaining the original context of the artifact, while also allowing for assignment to aggregate themes (see Table 1 ). For example, we described a piece of children's artwork based on its prominence and positioning within the office and placed it under the theme of decorations. As another example, office equipment such as the monitor, printer, and phone shown in Fig. 2 , which bore no unusual substantive qualities (e.g., standard equipment), was categorized under office supplies, given special identifiers related to the function (e.g., electronics, tools), and further aggregated under the dimension of common items.",

Alongside making comparisons with similar artifacts from other offices, we further delineated artifact intensity based on variance in uniqueness, or distraction, from the rest of the office environment. We determined where broader categories emerged based on comparing compared second order codes to one another. Intensity scores facilitated the final categorization of 2 nd order codes into nine 3 rd order codes, also known as aggregate dimensions. Table 2 shows the definitions for 3 rd order codes (i.e., dimensions). Table 2 lists the nine dimensions of culture identified from the artifacts. An example of how to interpret a dimension includes that in this organization's culture, collaboration is a norm manifested in the artifacts. Artifacts such as two or more visitor chairs in an office, and/or an extra table (not the main office desk) of smaller coffee-table size situated by the visitor chairs and not covered with papers, books, phone, or computer indicated occupants might visit or otherwise meet with people in their office. Nearly all offices had visitor chairs. The average intensity score for these artifacts was 4, which indicates meeting with people in one's office for a long enough time that chairs are required and a table for placing books, notes, laptop, or coffee mug is necessary, is an important norm.",

The coders were not aware at the time of the interview coding that the first author had taken photographs of offices or that a year later they would be asked to develop a coding method for photos. The same coders coded across the two efforts for a few reasons. First, Schein (1990) suggested that one potential problem with researchers studying the organizational artifacts who are external to the organization is that without understanding how to connect the artifacts to underlying assumptions, they are likely to make incorrect inferences from the artifacts. By engaging in the intensive and iterative interview coding process from the prior cultural assessment, the coders (and first author) became aware of and appreciated many of the underlying assumptions, perceptions, and values of the organization. This basic understanding of the culture thus allowed the coders to identify content within the photos as artifacts rather than simply as items in a room. As Pratt (2009) states, \"having someone else code your data does not necessarily make it valid\" (p. 859). He further adds it makes no sense for someone who knows nothing about the context of the organization to do the coding. Gaining the rich experiences with the data over time \"can and should change how you view the data\" (p. 859). Because the amount of time between projects was about a year, the coders did not remember the exact details of the interview coding, including codes, themes, or dimension names. Hence, their artifact coding was informed by knowledge of the organization but not dictated by previously identified labels.",

An example of a consistent dimension across both artifacts and interviews was individualism. Individualism refers to the extent to which an individual displayed personally meaningful actions, values, or objects (in the office space) that were not necessarily work related. In some cases, the choice was to not display anything personal, which is another form of individualism (intensity score of 1). While the interview data reflected how people talked about individualized behaviors indicating behavioral norms, the coded office photos validated this dimension through the personalization in the artifacts reflecting individualism. For instance, individualism in the interviews was represented by \"faculty are diverse\", \"people can be themselves\", \"faculty are very independent\", \"everyone is doing their own thing\", \"some people socialize\", and \"some people don't socialize much.\" Individualism in the artifacts was represented by family pictures and/or children's artwork, plants, paintings, microwaves, radios, quilts, or coat racks. These types of artifacts appeared in some offices, but not in others, showing the extent to which organizational members complied with this aspect of culture. Both interviews and artifacts that fell within the individualism dimension seemed consistent and conveyed the same message -individualism was okay, if not encouraged, in this culture. Other examples of shared or overlapping dimensions include collaboration and department politics. Collaboration refers to the degree to which people work with others. Within the interviews, collaboration was represented by \"connect with collaborators and mentors\", \"faculty like to work in groups\", and \"easy to make connections here.\" Within the artifacts, collaboration was represented by one or more comfortable guest chairs and at least one extra table (i.e., not an office desk, sometimes a coffee table) visibly not dedicated to continuous office work (e.g., lacked a computer, papers, and phone). The dimension of department politics refers to the display of hierarchy or authority. In the interviews, department politics was represented by statements like \"politics are significant in Table 4 Definitions of Aggregated Dimensions (3 rd order codes)",

Specifically, respondents reported that \"all faculty and staff have offices\" and \"people mostly work from the office, but also from home.\" Respondents claimed some people spent more time in the office compared to others, thus, amount of time in the office was dependent on the specific person. However, respondents conveyed a norm that people are \"frequently in the office.\" One respondent noted that it is \"easy to get a hold of people and track them down\" since offices are typically occupied. The workstyle dimension in the artifact data manifested in terms of the office furniture, office supplies, decorations, and office structure/design. For instance, the dimension was represented by paper or books on desks, organized or unorganized office desks and cabinets, number of filing cabinets or bookcases, number of monitors or computers, size of desks, and configuration of multiple desks (e.g., connected or facing one another). The artifact data seemed to illustrate (literally show) that people work in their offices, validating the interview statements. High intensity scoring (average 4.04) or artifacts for this dimension supported that \"people mostly work from the office\", indicating high compliance with this espoused norm.",

Organizational culture is a multi-layer construct representing a complex phenomenon, a socially constructed and shared conscious and subconscious that guides employees' behavior and attitudes. To understand fully how culture is deeply manifested and sustained requires assessing all its layers. While the interview dimensions we found provide a level of richness in understanding behavior within the organization and the values/norms that drive the behavior reflected in some of the artifacts, the dimensions extracted from the artifacts provide unique and complementary information that fills out the culture picture while also providing validity to the interview dimensions. Because artifacts are not constrained by researcher or reacted to by the respondent, and they occur in the field setting, they add validity to the overall culture assessment. In qualitative research, \"validity refers to whether the account of a phenomenon reflects the participants' lived experience\" (Eby et al., 2009, p. 224) . We contend coding artifacts substantially adds to an accurate account of employees' work experience. Additionally, because we use photos of the actual field setting, our approach maximizes ecological validity, hence contributing to external validity (Eby et al., 2009) .",

Photo coding applied to artifacts can enable researchers to explore a large range of potential artifacts within an organization without burdening organizational members beyond already intense culture assessments.

In such cases, the coding of artifacts would reveal the espoused values do not match the enacted values, a discovery not easily found with interviews alone. As Schein (1990) noted, \"If one has access to the organization one will note its artifacts readily but not know what they mean. Of most value in this process will be noting anomalies and things that seem different, upsetting, or difficult to understand\" (p. 112; italics in the original). Thus, a valuable contribution of assessing and coding artifacts alongside other assessments of culture is in identifying alignment and/or inconsistencies, bolstering the validity of the overall culture assessment.",

At senior levels of the organization, an office space, its layout, and use may represent multiple political factors with underlying power dynamics rife with meaning and symbolism.

For example, software exists for stitching together images to create a multidimensional view of the office space and one that allows the coder to explore the space interactively.",

Home offices or spaces that were once a spare bedroom or dining room but now serve as home offices are less likely to have company-related artifacts. Likewise, company office spaces modified with Plexiglas barriers and extra space to accommodate social distancing guidelines may no longer have artifacts that convey company culture, but instead convey the realities of public health concerns. Thus, an important question for researchers exploring culture is, given the disruption of the traditional office work environment due to the pandemic, do organizational culture artifacts still exist, and if so, what do they look like? What about in home offices? If artifact assessment within the home office is considered, researchers must also evaluate the ethics behind soliciting and evaluating photographs of home offices. For example, would photos of the home office violate worker privacy? Although employees may use their home offices to conduct paid work for an organization, these offices are still located within employees' private residencies. Though minimal, available research into privacy concerns with video conferencing suggest the ethics of working virtual due to the pandemic are not simple or resolved (e.g., Park, 2020).",

Organizations that hold high expectations for what constitutes a professional setting or professional appearance must now navigate level of desired control over employees' home office settings.

Unobtrusive methods, such as photographs of offices, do not involve employees, providing a nonreactive approach that minimizes interruptions and lost productivity while data are collected (Reader et al., 2020) . The method does not require numerous hours of respondents' time, is not restricted by surveys subject to common method bias (Podsakoff et al., 2012) , and does not force responses into a particular cultural framework (e.g., CVF, OCP). Our novel application of intensity scoring to photo coding provides nuances to otherwise generic artifact themes, allowing for richer data representation highlighting contextual elements of the office environment. Intensity scores of artifacts may allow for comparison across different departments or functional areas of an organization. Just as the importance of norms may fluctuate within an organization, the value and meaning drawn from artifacts can also fluctuate -a difference that may be discernible through intensity scoring.",
