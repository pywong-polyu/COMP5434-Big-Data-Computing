As countries relax lockdowns and other more stringent physical distancing measures, combining the isolation of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of contacts identified through fine-scale tracing is likely to play a major role in many national strategies for targeted SARS-CoV-2 control 11 . Modelling studies suggest that app-based tracing can be highly effective as a containment strategy if uptake is high (~80% of smartphone users) and that very large numbers of individuals could potentially be quarantined. However, these results, along with those more generally regarding COVID-19 transmission, rely primarily on simulating or assuming the structure of fine-scale social networks, and this may not accurately capture the effect of contact-based interventions 12 .

Further still, social systems may be simulated as networks that can be parameterised according to assumptions regarding different contexts (for example, with different simulated networks for households, schools and workplaces), or using estimated contact rates of different age groups 14 . However, much less is known about how different types of real-world social behaviour and the hidden structure found in real-life networks may affect both patterns of disease transmission and efficacy of contact tracing under different scenarios 15, 16 .

Temporal information is incorporated by weighting the edges using the temporal contact information, instead of using a dynamic network within the dynamic model, as this would require contact data over a much longer period. In the primary analysis, we weighted the edges as the number of unique days a dyad was observed together (but see Supplementary   Information for other temporal definitions). Therefore, the weight score indicates the propensity for each dyad to engage in a social contact event on any given day, whereby 0 = no contact, 1 = 'weak links' observed on the minority of days (one third), 2 = 'moderate links' observed on the majority of days (two thirds), and 3 = 'strong links' observed on all days.

In all scenarios, the tracing and quarantining of contacts resulted in fewer cases than case isolation alone, with the tracing of secondary contacts leading to fewer cases than primary tracing.

Further work is required to determine exactly what kinds of physical distancing measures would enable effective outbreak control alongside contact tracing.Network structure can have substantial effects on epidemic model predictions 27,28 , and our null network modelling approach shows that this is important when considering SARS-CoV-2 spread and the effectiveness of control measures within real-world structures. Indeed, each null model maintained the same number of people as the real network, and the same number and strength of social associations, but simply reordered the connections between individuals. This reordering alone changed in the emerging predictions, thus highlighting the importance of the fine-scale arrangement of social connections. Specifically, null models that randomised the order of social connections, and those that incorporated information on the distribution of ties between individuals, appeared to match the real network predictions best. On the other hand, the lattice and clustered networks both underestimated outbreak size, and substantially overestimated the effectiveness of tracing. These results demonstrate that the use of network-based simulations of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics requires caution, as even if such models had precise information on the number of individuals and amount of social interactions occurring within a system, the assumed architecture of the social network structure alone can shape predictions for both the extent of spread and the usefulness of control strategies. Furthermore, through providing insight into how changes to network structure influences contagion dynamics, the null network simulation approach gives some indication of how this contagion and associated control strategies may operate in different social environments. For instance, different social structures may arise when considering particular social settings (e.g. workplaces, commuting), some of which may be closer to the extreme random edge null networks generated here, while others may represent the lattice or clustered null networks. Considering this structure will lead to improved predictions of outbreak dynamics.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF17": {"text": "Li, Y. et al.
