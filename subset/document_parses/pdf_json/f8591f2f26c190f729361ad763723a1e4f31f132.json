These may be associated with unique and yet poorly characterized severe immune-related adverse events. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to pose a global health crisis, and its clinical characterization is yet to be defined. The presentation in children has been generally mild and/or atypical (4) . According to the COVID-19 in Pediatric Cancer Global Registry Data, almost half of the 924 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in 41 countries had a cancer diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 5.7% were stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients (5) . Overall, 42.3% of reported patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis and approximately 5% experienced critical disease, defined as the presence of organ dysfunction or death due to COVID-19 (5) .",

Repeat respiratory PCR and NP testing for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and a computed tomography (CT) chest showed bilateral multifocal pneumonia and suggestion of a reverse halo sign. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were negative (the patient had ongoing B cell aplasia, consistent with CAR therapy response).

A SARS-CoV-2 test result was not obtained from this BAL. He required oxygen supplementation with high flow nasal cannula and bilevel positive airway pressure for progressive dyspnea/hypoxemia. Repeat CT chest on day +117 showed significant improvement of bilateral lung opacities but now with new opacities within the left upper lobe. Lung biopsy showed interstitial pneumonitis.

As depicted in Figure 3 , differentiation of immunerelated adverse events, such as CRS, ICANS, and COVID-19 infection versus associated multi-inflammatory syndrome remain a challenge. Multi-disciplinary assessments may facilitate optimized treatment decisions in challenging cases. In a meta-analysis of 11 studies that included 3,442 respiratory samples, the reported SARS-CoV-2 detection rate was 54% (95% CI: 41-67%) for NP swabs, 43% (95% CI: 34-52%) for oropharyngeal swabs and 71% (95% CI: 61-80%) for sputum. The rate of detection was highest when performed between 0 and 7 days from the onset of symptoms and declined with time. For NP sampling, the estimated percentage positive was 80% (95% CI: 66-91%), 59% (95% CI: 53-64%) and 36% (95% CI: 18-57%) at 0-7 days, 8-14 days, and >14 days after symptom onset, respectively (13, 14). Therefore, children and cancer immunotherapy patients with atypical presentations or mild initial presentations may escape SARS-CoV-2 detection based on delayed presentation for testing. Higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection and viral loads have been observed in lower respiratory samples, such as BAL fluid and endotracheal aspirates, possibly due to the higher density of the SARS-CoV-2 viral receptor, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor (15) (16) (17) . For patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 who test negative for SARS-CoV-2 using upper respiratory tract specimens, the World Health Organization recommends retesting using lower respiratory samples (18) . Patient 1 was tested 14 days after initial presentation of mild, atypical symptoms and repeated negative NP testing along with his initial clinical improvement could have been falsely reassuring. It is possible that this patient's B-cell aplasia and therefore insufficient production of protective antibodies may have contributed to the delayed clearance of this virus or reinfection (19) . The benefit of convalescent plasma in this scenario remains to be determined. Immune related adverse events (irAEs) following cancer immunotherapy and MIS (C/A) may have overlapping clinical symptoms with increased inflammatory biomarkers that may play an important role in morbidity and mortality and needs further controlled studies. Common irAEs include rash, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, thyroid abnormalities and pneumonitis. Multi-organ dysfunction may also occur post-SCT among patients with SOS, endotheliopathies, and infection. While pulmonary findings are thought to be less common in MIS (C/A), it is important to note that CT findings of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, non-specific interstitial pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchiolitis, pleural effusions, and reverse halo sign, may also be seen with immune-related pulmonary toxicity. The reverse halo sign appears as a central ground-glass opacity surrounded by a denser region of consolidation and is distinct from the halo sign associated with pulmonary hemorrhage typically seen in angioinvasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients (20) . Abnormal T2 hyperintensities and mental status changes may be seen in ICANS, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and perhaps, in MIS. Increased cardiac enzymes, myositis and arrhythmias, renal dysfunction, encephalitis, hypophysitis, and colitis similarly may be observed in both conditions.",

MIS (C/A) may result from immune mediated injury and hyper inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2. Aberrant immune responses after cancer immunotherapy or SARS-CoV-2 infection (and possibly after vaccination in the future) may be observed. Vigilant monitoring for novel cancer immunotherapy toxicity and SARS-CoV-2 clinical presentations, with reporting to health department and registries is important. Currently there are no universally accepted guidelines on the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS (C/A) with over 2,000 interventional studies for the treatment of COVID 19 registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Common recommendations for both COVID 19 and MIS (C/A) include a multidisciplinary team approach that includes the involvement of critical care, infectious disease, hematology, cardiology, rheumatology as well as immunology teams. Other recommendations include vigilant supportive care including fluid resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressors if hypotension is present, cardiac monitoring, and anti-coagulation. Treatment guidelines also include the use of antivirals such as remdesivir for patients who are in the acute phase of illness where the virus is actively replicating, corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory agents such as tocilizumab.",
