Effective management of such complications is of key clinical importance. In some infants with HPP, severe tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) contributes to respiratory difficulties. The objective of this study is to characterize the clinical features, investigations and management in these patients. Methods: We report a case series of five infants with perinatal HPP, with confirmed TBM, who were treated with asfotase alfa and observed for 3-7 years. Additionally, we reviewed respiratory function data in a subgroup of patients with perinatal and infantile HPP included in the clinical trials of asfotase alfa, who required high-pressure respiratory support (positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] \u22656 cm H 2 O and/or peak inspiratory pressure \u226518 cm H 2 O) during the studies. Results: The case series showed that TBM contributed significantly to respiratory morbidity, and prolonged respiratory support with high PEEP was required. However, TBM improved over time, allowing weaning of all patients from ventilator use. The review of clinical trial data included 20 patients and found a high degree of heterogeneity in PEEP requirements across the cohort; median PEEP was 8 cm H 2 O at any time and some patients presented with high PEEP (\u22658 cm H 2 O) over periods of more than 6 months.",

Perinatal HPP, which manifests in utero and is apparent at birth, is the most severe form of HPP, with severe skeletal hypomineralization characterized by respiratory failure due to gracile, thin, short ribs, small chest, hypoplastic lungs and vitamin B6-dependent seizures [2] . Infantile HPP, which is identified in patients before 6 months of age, is characterized by failure to thrive, hypercalcemia, short limbs, limb deformities with abnormal metaphyses, small thoraces with gracile, thin ribs, respiratory complications and vitamin B6-dependent seizures [2] . Patients with perinatal or infantile HPP and vitamin B6-dependent seizures have high morbidity and mortality in the first 5 years of life [3] ; prior to the availability of asfotase alfa (Stren-siq\u00ae), the only enzyme replacement therapy approved for the treatment of patients with perinatal/infantile-and juvenile-onset HPP, only 42% of infants with HPP survived their first year and only 27% survived to the age of 5 years, with death typically resulting from respiratory complications [2, [4] [5] [6] . While asfotase alfa has been shown to improve survival in patients with perinatal and infantile HPP substantially [4] , the characterization and management of respiratory complications in these patients remains key to their survival and to optimizing their treatment and clinical outcomes.",

Three patients were treated at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, UK, and two patients were treated at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, USA. Clinical suspicions of TBM in these five patients were raised following episodes of profound desaturations and bradycardia (especially on handling) and subsequent transient/episodic increases in ventilator requirements. Diagnosis of TBM was confirmed by direct laryngotracheobronchoscopy (DLTB) or flexible bronchoscopy. In this case series, respiratory support requirements were documented and defined as invasive ventilation (by continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or bilevel positive airway pressure support) via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy.

However, in our experience, infants without significant lung disease or TBM may typically require PEEP of 4-8 cm H 2 O. Of the 80 patients included in the asfotase alfa clinical trials, 39 required respiratory support at any time; 23 of these 39 (59%) patients required high-pressure respiratory support (PEEP \u22656 cm H 2 O and/or PIP \u226518 cm H 2 O) via any route, at any time (22 of these patients required respiratory support at baseline, and one patient did not have baseline respiratory support information). Three of these patients are included in the case series described above, and therefore not included in these additional analyses. Thus, results of an analysis of PEEP measurements (in line with the requirements of the case series patients) for 20 patients are presented here and in Supplemental Table 1 . The median PEEP at any time was 8 cm H 2 O, with a highest PEEP of 20 cm H 2 O. The median number of days of highpressure respiratory support for these patients during the studies was 176 (1-1065; the median number of days on study for these patients was 912.5 ), or 85.2% (9.3-100.0%) of the duration of respiratory support. Most of these 20 patients required high-pressure respiratory support across the entire period of their respiratory support. However, there was no correlation between the duration that those patients received ventilatory support and a PEEP requirement of \u22656 cm H 2 O (median PEEP \u03c4 = .15, P = .44; maximum PEEP \u03c4 = .09, P = .65). In this cohort, there were seven patients with even higher respiratory requirements for PEEP (\u22658 cm H 2 O) and four patients with both PEEP \u22658 cm H 2 O and PIP \u226520 cm H 2 O at any time. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in PEEP requirements across the cohort of included patients; however, six patients presented with consistently high PEEP values (\u22658 cm H 2 O) over periods of more than 6 months.",

More specifically, these patients required prolonged respiratory support with high PEEP in an intensive care unit setting and ongoing positive pressure to prevent collapse of airways. We typically increase PEEP in response to patient behaviors that cause us to suspect TBM. However, in many cases of severe TBM, the patient can overcome the distending pressure of even very high PEEP through coughing or the Valsalva maneuver. Heavy breathing may occur if a child is upset or crying. Their peak inspiratory flow rate rises, causing airflow to become more turbulent. It is the loss of laminar airflow that contributes to the softened airway collapsing. Other patients with severe TBM may have increased work of breathing at baseline during tidal breathing and will have improved work of breathing as PEEP is increased. Patients presenting with severe oxygen desaturation and decreased heart rate often respond to positive pressure bagging with 100% oxygen, with chest compressions also required on some occasions. Based on our findings, infants with perinatal HPP who have episodes of oxygen desaturation and/or changes in ventilator settings, especially increased PEEP, should be suspected of having TBM and investigated and managed accordingly.",

PEEP requirements were highly variable across the population, ranging up to 20 cm H 2 O, with 18% of patients (7/39) requiring PEEP of \u22658 cm H 2 O. It is possible that TBM contributed to the respiratory complications in some of these patients. It is important to note that factors other than TBM, such as chest deformity, restricted respiratory function, There is considerable variation in PEEP strategies employed in different pediatric intensive care units. Although bronchoscopy may inform decisions about initial respiratory requirements during quiet spontaneous respiration, these may be insufficient when a child is crying or coughing or has an intercurrent lower respiratory tract infection. Furthermore, the weaning of PEEP as symptoms improve is often empirical. Consequently, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about either the severity of TBM or the duration of treatment solely from PEEP data. However, these data do alert us to identifying children who appear to be dependent on externally applied pressure.",
