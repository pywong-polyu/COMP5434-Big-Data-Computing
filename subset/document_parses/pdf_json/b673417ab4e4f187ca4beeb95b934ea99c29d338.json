The current pandemic COVID-19 causes suspicious cases flocking into hospitals. The detection of COVID-19 by traditional reverse-transcription diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests is time-consuming and depends on the reliability of laboratory techniques. Several PCRbased rapid tests have been recently approved and only require less than 30 min. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been suggested as an alternative and reliable tool for the detection of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients in China [2] . However, the American College of Radiology recommended against the use of CT as a firstline test to diagnose COVID-19 on March 11, 2020 [3] . To validate this recommendation, we performed a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT in COVID-19.",

However, our results regarding low levels of specificity and likelihood ratio did not support the routine use of chest CT for COVID-19 screening in suspicious patients. Our results from Fagan's Nomogram analyses suggested very little diagnostic value of using chest CT as the primary tool for COVID-19. One shortcoming of using chest CT is that patients are exposed to unnecessary radiation. The other shortcoming is that CT-scanning may increase the risk of nosocomial infection due to potential contamination of the environment. Some limitations of our results should be mentioned. For example, whether radiologists were blind to other clinical data when interpreted CT or whether samples were adequately collected may influence the pooled results. Besides, we observed a high heterogeneity of both sensitivity and specificity as well as a wide range of specificity. The certainty of evidence, if graded, may be very low.",
