Working with a data set comprising around 20 billion 1-grams, we first compare each day's 1-gram and 2-gram usage frequencies to those of a year before, to create day-and week-scale timelines for Trump stories for 2016 through 2020. We measure Trump's narrative control, the extent to which stories have been about Trump or put forward by Trump. We then quantify story turbulence and collective chronopathy-the rate at which a population's stories for a subject seem to change over time. We show that 2017 was the most turbulent overall year for Trump. In 2020, story generation slowed dramatically during the first two major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, with rapid turnover returning first with the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd's murder and then later by events leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, including the storming of the US Capitol six days into 2021. Trump story turnover for 2 months during the COVID-19 pandemic was on par with that of 3 days in September 2017. Our methods may be applied to any well-discussed phenomenon, and have potential to enable the computational aspects of journalism, history, and biography.",

One emblematic challenge for remembering story timelines is presented by the 45th US president Donald J. Trump, our interest here. Stories revolving around Trump have been abundant and diverse in nature. Consider, for example, being able to remember and then order stories involving: North Korea, Charlottesville, kneeling in the National Football League, Confederate statues, family separation, Stormy Daniels, Space Force, and the possible purchase of Greenland.",

Days can seem like months (\"this week dragged on forever\") or might seem to be over in a flash (\"time flies\"). Story-wise, periods of time can also range from being narratively simple (\"it was the only story in town\") to complicated and hard to retell (\"everything happened all at once\"). At the population scale, major news stories may similarly arrive at slow and fast paces, and may be coherent or disconnected. As one example, * peter.dodds@uvm.edu within the space of around 15 minutes after 9 pm US Eastern Standard Time on March 11, 2020 , Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announced that they had tested positive for COVID-19, the National Basketball Association put its season on hold indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Trump gave an Oval Office Address during which the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped. And to help illustrate the potential disconnection of co-occurring stories within the realm of US politics, at the same time as the above events were unfolding, former US vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was appearing on the popular Fox TV show \"The Masked Singer\" performing Sir Mix-A-Lot's \"Baby Got Back\" in a bear costume.",

We measure story distance as the median rank-turbulence divergence (RTD) between the Zipf distributions of 1-grams used in Trump-matching tweets for each day of a month and \u03b4 days before (we use RTD parameter \u03b1=1/4). Lighter colors on the perceptually uniform color map correspond to higher levels of story turnover. Numbers indicate the slowest five months for each value of \u03b4. After the story turbulence of the 2016 election year and especially the first year of Trump's presidency, there has been a general slowing down in story turnover at all time scales (the 'plot thickens'). By September US of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had induced record slowing down of story turnover around Trump at time scales up to 91 days, the story being punctuated by and then combined with the Black Lives Matter protests in response to George Floyd's murder on May 25, 2020.

Wherever Zipf distributions can be derived, our methods will allow for the computational construction of n-gramanchored story timelines along with measures of story distance, turbulence, and chronopathy. For such extensions, we caution that the popularity of text must be incorporated in some fashion through measures of readership, shares, etc. We also observe that stronger variations in findings would potentially come from choosing different text sources rather than through reasonable adjustments of the methods of analysis we have laid out here.",

We measure story distance as the median rank-turbulence divergence (RTD) between the Zipf distributions of 1-grams used in Trump-matching tweets for each day of a month and \u03b4 days before (we use RTD parameter \u03b1=1/4). Lighter colors on the perceptually uniform color map correspond to higher levels of story turnover. Numbers indicate the slowest five months for each value of \u03b4. After the story turbulence of the 2016 election year and especially the first year of Trump's presidency, there has been a general slowing down in story turnover at all time scales (the 'plot thickens'). By September US of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had induced record slowing down of story turnover around Trump at time scales up to 91 days, the story being punctuated by and then combined with the Black Lives Matter protests in response to George Floyd's murder on May 25, 2020. B. Using an example anchor of April 2020 and \u03b4=14 days (white square in panel A), a plot of chronopathic equivalent values of \u03b4 across time. During Trump's presidency, the same story turnover occurred as fast as every 1.8 days in September 2017 and 1.7 days in October 2020. Because story turbulence is nonlinear, using a different anchor month and \u03b4 (i.e., selecting a different cell in the heatmap) potentially gives a different chronopathic equivalency plot. C. Anchor of 56 days in May 2020. D. Anchor of 182 days in August 2020. See the Online Appendices (compstorylab.org/trumpstoryturbulence/) for the most recent version of this figure.
