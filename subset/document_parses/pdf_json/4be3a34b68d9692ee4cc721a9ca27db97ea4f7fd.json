Thus, it is improper to indiscriminately deliver psychological crisis intervention services to hotline callers, disregarding whether their main concerns were COVID-19 related or not. In order to understand the impact of the pandemic on public mental health, we compare characteristics of psychological disturbances between the callers whose concerns were and were not COVID-19-related. These findings will be useful for the further development of more specific hotlinebased psychological crisis intervention model during public health emergency.",

During the pandemic, difficulties of financial problems (reduced work opportunities and income) were common, and persons aged 30 year or older (often responsible for earning money and supporting a family) were more sensitive to this situation and attributed it to the COVID-19 than the younger. Although family relationship problem is one of the most involved concerns in present and previous studies (10), relative less callers linked it with the pandemic, especially among people younger than 20 years old. Previous studies have reported that more than half of the BPSH callers report suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts (10) . During the current COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence of suicidal ideation among non-COVID-19 callers was comparable to previous studies, whereas that of COVID-19 callers was significantly lower than non-COVID-19 callers. Furthermore, the mental health problems of COVID-19 callers were less severe than that of non-COVID-19 callers. A survey on the mental health status of mainland Chinese general population in February, 2020, has shown that all were under widespread stress, with depression and anxiety in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (17) . Our results suggest that the mental health problems among COVID-19 callers might reflect a psychological reaction induced by the pandemic rather than clinical mental disorders. They may inform the effective allocation of mental health support during times of public health crises. These findings highlight the value of psychological support i.e., early public education on mental health, especially on how to cope with psychological stress induced by the pandemic in response to emergent public health crises. Specifically, hotlinebased interventions should focus on delivering brief psychoeducation about the common physical and mental reactions to stress, and encourage the teaching of healthy coping strategies, in the context of rapport and emotional support to reduce the stressful impact of the COVID-19. Given only 15% calls of the BPSH (608/4177, see the Figure 1 ) complained COVID-19 related problems, the findings also indicate that we should pay attention to non-COVID-19 callers and continue to provide high quality psychological interventions during times of public health crises.",

This may highlight discrepancy in the utilization of free and supportive resources based on socioeconomic status (SES). Our results suggest an urgent need to further publicize and promote the hotline as an immediate and convenient psychological service for those of relatively low SES. Such services seek to promote wellness and resilience, while preventing the onset of clinical disorders and, during public health emergencies, serve as a useful source of scientific knowledge for physical health. Public health campaigns might target this group to ensure equitable access and utilization.",

Previous studies reported that a large number of people were psychologically disturbed during the pandemic (1-4, 16, 17) , however, results in our study indicated that the severity of psychological problem (depression, suicidal ideation etc.) due to the pandemic was slight than what we have imagined, and the COVID-19 callers reported more financial or work related problems than non-COVID-19 callers. The findings implied that, to some extent, the psychological disturbance among COVID-19 callers might be a psychological reaction to the stressors induced by the pandemic, rather than clinical mental disorders. Psychological supports, coping strategies, and public education on the COVID-19 might be important psychological intervention methods during the pandemic.",

First, the present study recruited hotline callers in China only, which limits the generalization of our findings to other populations. Given that our results are limited in timeframe, and other countries may have experienced a more prolonged impact of the pandemic, it is not clear whether these findings would apply in countries outside of China. Second, previous studies have reported that the COVID-19 causes increased levels of depression and anxiety in the general public (2) (3) (4) 17) . Given that BPSH has historically focused on suicide prevention, our data protocols are mainly designed for depression and suicide risk and as such, neglect asking about anxiety. The present study did not collect data on anxiety, which appears especially relevant for a fear-inducing global pandemic. Third, the present study did not identify whether callers were confirmed cases, frontline healthcare workers, or other important sub-groups. This limits our exploration of the associations between characteristics and differences of the caller's personal identification and the psychological problems. Fourth, non-COVID-19 callers in this study likely experienced COVID-19 related stress, and we cannot completely disregard the potential impact of the COVID-19 on their presenting concerns. Finally, we relied on callers' self-reports, which may limit the accuracy of collected data; nevertheless, the anonymous nature of hotline may lead to increased honesty during such calls, in turn, it is difficult to describe the associations of caller's personal information and his/her primary concerns more clearly.",
