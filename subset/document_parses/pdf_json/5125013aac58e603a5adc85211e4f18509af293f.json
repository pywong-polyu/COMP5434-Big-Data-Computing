The limitation on air traffic is found to negatively affect the confirmed cases in China's megacities. However, such effect marginally recedes as the strength of limitation intensifies.

On the same day, the CAAC reminded all airline companies to keep close watch on the epidemic development in Hubei, and urged them to gradually reduce the number of flights arriving in or leaving airports in Hubei province (CAAC, 2020b) . In the flowing day, the CAAC declared the escalation of prevention measure and further urged airline companies to reduce the number of flights nationwide (CAAC, 2020c) . Currently, the transport administration proposes higher demand for entry and exit screening measures at the transport station, for the capability of trained crews to identify suspected signs of getting infected, and for the knowledge of ground crews to quarantine individual passengers on an aircraft.",

            "text": "Since decades before, the global transport network continues to expand in reach, speed of travel, and volume of passengers carried. The pathogens and their vectors can now travel in a farther and faster way, leading to the vector-borne pathogen importation (Tatem et al., 2006) . The most typical example is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with small fatalities (Skowronski et al., 2005) , but great speed and extent of proliferation. This variation suggests that the globalized economic activity and an ever-expanding traffic network can potentially spread infectious diseases (Tatem et al., 2006) . The spread of infectious diseases has become much more facilitated by air traffic. In the past, the Ebola was brought to the US and the UK through undiagnosed infected airline passengers aboard (Bogoch et al., 2015; Gulland, 2014) . A delayed influenza season was identified to be accompanied with the airline restriction subsequent to the 9-11 attack (Brownstein et al., 2006) . Insects-borne infectious diseases, such as West Nile virus and malaria, are substantially facilitated by intercontinental flights for infected mosquitos carried by aircrafts (Brown et al., 2012; Gratz, Steff en, & Cocksedge, 2012) . The spread of Zika virus to the American continent is found coincided with the upsurge of air travel to Brazil from countries suffering from epidemic in 2013 (Lowe et al., 2018) . The outbreak of H1N1 that spreads along international airlines in 2009 (Khan et al., 2009) , also highlighted the important role of human transportation in the global spread of infectious diseases (Nakata & R\u00f6st, 2015) . The transmission can occur not only aboard airplanes, but also at the destination and airports (Browne et al., 2016) , which can amplify influenza propagation (Browne et al., 2016) . A systematic review shows that the air transport speeds up the importation of community-acquired influenza to new areas (Catal\u00e0 et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010) and that in-flight transmission has occurred on multiple occasions (Baker et al., 2010; Foxwell et al., 2011) .",

The high crowd densities and enclosed spaces in public transport system provide prime conditions for personto-person transmission via inhalation of virus in aerosols and droplets (Gupta et al., 2012) . Between 1969 and 1999, 87 suspected cases of airport malaria, which is acquired through the bite of infected tropical Anopheline mosquitos, were recorded in the proximity of Paris, Brussels and London airports (Giacomini and Brumpt, 1989; Isaacson, 1989; Danis et al., 1996; Giacomini, 1998; Gratz et al., 2000) , although the geographical history of these infected individuals showed that they had never been exposed to the natural habitat of tropical Anopheline mosquito (Isaacson, 1989) . In addition to the high frequency of social contacts, the increase in global travel is another key determinant of epidemics. Aircrafts are believed to be directly responsible for the rapid expansion in the range of many plants and animals via inadvertent transport (Lounibos, 2002; Perrings et al., 2005) .",

In the 2009 H1N1 epidemic crisis, simulation research displays an additional decline in travel flows above the existing level would provide an additional benefit in slowing down the propagation of the H1N1 virus from the American continent to the rest of the world (Bajardi et al., 2011) . The restricted migration of population can mitigate the potential risk of infection in patchy environments, especially in the highly exposed migration process such as vehicle and transport stations (Denphedtnong et al., 2013) . The risk of infectious disease transmission through air traffic is not just owed to the post-flight facilitation of population mobility among megacities, but also to the inflight facilitation of virus transmission in the cabin of a single-aisle aircraft (Hertzberg et al., 2018) . Thus, a growing number of studies call for the enhancement of traffic control as the policy measure of interrupting novel coronavirus disease transmission (Lau et al., 2020; Yen et al., 2020) .",

In practice, the city effect and time effect serve as dummy variables (i.e., 0-1 variable). The value of 1 means the observation is corresponding to the specific city or date. For example, for the city of Wuhan, the dummy indicator \"Wuhan\" would take the value of 1, Table 1 The overview of the confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease and the limitation on air traffic (Jan. 23rd, 2020-Mar. 13th, 2020). and meanwhile, the other city-specific dummy indicators such as \"Beijing\" and \"Shanghai\" would take the value of 0. The main purpose of controlling the city effect and time effect is to control unobservable heterogeneity across cities and dates, as not all determinants can be controlled in practice (for data availability) and the omitted variables are almost inevitable. The omitted variables would be the components of unobservable heterogeneity across cities, and the control for city effect and time effect would alleviate this problem to some extent.

The impact of airline transport regulation on confirmed cases is found to be negative, yet marginally recedes as the strength of regulation intensifies. The findings of this study examine the airline transport regulation as a possible solution in the short term to containing the fast spreading. The examination of this short-term policy is important especially under the circumstance where it might take a very long time to develop a vaccine. The prior study has confirmed that an airline network which unveils the ubiquitous presence of connectivity patterns can be used as a prediction tool of epidemic risk (Colizza et al., 2006) . The pattern of annual inter-regional dissemination of influenza and pneumonia in the US is found to be associated with the domestic airline volume (Brownstein et al., 2006) . However, the actual use of airline transport regulation as the policy tool to contain the spread of a pandemic is very rare since its implementation would inevitably bring huge economic costs. Thus, the effectiveness of this policy lacks sufficient empirical evidence in the history. This finding also suggests that the mere reliance on the air traffic limitation policy would not have a long and lasting effect in containing the development of the pandemic. The policy effectiveness would marginally recede as the policy strength intensifies. It implies that the development of the pandemic may not be just determined by air traffic or even interregional population migration. Thus, comprehensive policies are needed to contain the epidemic development.",
