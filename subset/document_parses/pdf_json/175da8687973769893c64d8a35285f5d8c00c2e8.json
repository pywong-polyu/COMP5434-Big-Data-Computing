Consequently, there is more competition for the entry-level positions, most appropriate for young people. For some young people, the key issue may be finding employment that provides a good fit to their qualifications, skills and experience. For others it may be more fundamental-for example, attaining job security and escaping lowquality jobs or the \"low-pay, no-pay\" poverty trap circle (Shildrick et al. 2012) . The school to work transition, and transition into independent adulthood, for adults in the UK is therefore elongated, complex, fragmented and potentially reversible (Roberts 2007; Heinz 2009 ), and has led to a greater reliance on their parents, especially for financial support (Walther 2006; Swartz and O'Brien 2009 ). This is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that the number of young adults living with their parents has increased over the past two decades (ONS 2016a). Because of this economic situation we are seeing a decline in upward social mobility and an increase in downward social mobility for contemporary young people compared to previous generations (Bukodi et al. 2015) , and thus the economic climate has a potentially significant effect on the achievement of economic self-sufficiency.",

Does family matter in terms of investments, in terms of resources, or both? How does parenting style moderate the transmission process? How does the country context (welfare-state arrangements) moderate the transmission process? In our sample we have eleven families from the North East of England, and we have classified them according to two criteria. Firstly, to what extent they are economically self-sufficient and, secondly, whether they have the ambition to become so. The chapter will start with a discussion of this typology, to then move on to a more detailed description of the sample according to these classifications. Our analysis will be informed by the theoretical framework outlined in previous chapters focusing on transmission of values and capital and the mechanisms for it, but contextualised by contemporary conditions in the UK.",

Self-efficacy has been associated with positive work motivation and involvement (Lim and Loo 2003) , and although this goes slightly beyond the overall theme of the book it remains within the scope. Here we apply self-efficacy to the activities and ambition relating to becoming economically self-sufficient, such as developing a plan for applying for jobs and acting on it. We use this two way categorisation for two reasons; firstly in the economic context described above school to work transitions are prolonged and complex. Having a paid job does not necessarily mean you are economically self-sufficient, and not having a job does not mean you are not trying. Secondly, it is important to acknowledge that this age group is still in the transition from school to work where their current occupational situation is not necessarily telling for where they will end up. At this stage young people's values, attitudes and behaviours are still developing and breaking free from parental influence (Darling and Steinberg 1993) . Our attention to both the self-sufficiency status and the ambition to become so thus provides a youth sensitive analysis that focuses on the core idea of transmission of values that shape attitudes and behaviour rather than the (current) outcome of occupational status.",

Three young people are in education, all at university. Seven young people are in some form of employment: two in employment, two self-employed, two in family business and one in education and family business. One participant is currently unemployed. They were recruited through a range of routes; social media postings on local community groups, contact with local employment support charities and personal networks. The young people's interviews, and most parent and grandparent interviews, were conducted face to face either in the interviewee's home or at Newcastle University, some parent and grandparent interviews were conducted over the phone due to their geographical location. The interviews were conducted by Ph.D. students from Newcastle University, all of whom had previous experience of conducting semistructured biographical interviews and received the training that was developed by the CUPSESSE project.

The older generations became economically self-sufficient more quickly than the following generations. The grandparents had the least economic support from their family, while the young persons are often still dependent. The parent generation takes a medium position and they were less reliant on their parents than their children are on them. This pattern is fully in line with the societal trends of elongated and transitions into adulthood (Walther 2006) , the decline in upward social mobility in the UK (Bukodi et al. 2015) , and the changing role of the family in the neo-liberal welfare state. This fundamental intergenerational difference in economic reliance on the family across the generations seems to have affected the overall transmission of capital and values; we see substantially fewer instances of transmission from the grandparent to parent generation than from parent to young person. Economic dependence on the family seems to be a key facilitator to strengthen transmission of other aspects as well.",

One respondent is married; the other has a young daughter. While they both attended university, they come from less affluent backgrounds so there was less financial support available. They have relied comparatively little on their parents' support in order to become self-sufficient and showed a high degree of self-efficacy. In comparison with other groups, their families were larger with more siblings. While Chris' family has been intact throughout his life and remained in the North East of England, being the only boy in the family he was at times excluded from his sisters' activities.

Voluntary Dependents accept this financial support without questioning and do not display much intent to reduce the financial burden on their parents by, for example, finding a part-time job. They also do not display much concern with regard to their future economic self-sufficiency. Although career choice is an important issue in their lives, they focus more on intrinsic values, such as creative working or avoiding boredom in their job, rather than extrinsic values such as a high salary. Becoming economically self-sufficient is not the driving force behind their career choices but rather the more abstract notion of a fulfilled life. Voluntary dependents are all from a firmly middle-class background. They reported little family disruptions during their childhood and are the mostgeographically mobile group in the sample. The young persons but also the parents and grandparents have been moving throughout their lives for education and career.

However, they are still partially reliant on their families, which come from the lower middle class and middle class. Both young persons in employment have previously lived away from the family home, to attend university, but have \"boomeranged\" back home because their salary is not high enough to live entirely independently. Moving back home after living away for education, or boomeranging, is becoming a more common phenomena in the UK as a result of more unpredictable labour markets (Stone et al. 2014 ). The two respondents in family business also live at home and rely to a high degree on their parents to keep the businesses afloat. Unlike the Entrepreneurs or Ambitious, Gradual Progressors have not displayed a self-directed ambition to achieve economic self-sufficiency but rather made choices that appeared convenient and did not require much investment in terms of time or effort. Compared to the Voluntary Dependents, the Gradual Progressors are less mobile and still live in the North East although some of their family members have moved throughout their lives. In all these families, the grandparents played a greater role in their upbringing than in any other group, taking care of them while parents were at work. Some grandparents even moved to the North East to look after their grandchildren. Despite this good relationship, however, three of the four respondents in this category reported family disruptions.

In line with the family taking on provision of services, some grandparents had been very involved in the upbringing of the younger generation.

Voluntary Dependents stress the intrinsic value of education and learning, as well as the university experience. In these cases, education is perceived as cultural capital, it is something that distils certain values and is seen as an asset to a person's character. Although parents were concerned with their children's academic achievement, academic success was valued because of the opportunities it opens up for a fulfilling rather than lucrative career. There is a strong transmission of this value between generations, and we thus see a reproduction of cultural capital and class in these families, ensuring maintenance of the social status of the parental generation.",

Although none used financial incentives to encourage their children to study harder, they did support favourable behaviour through providing the financial support to reach a degree. Education was valued in the grandparent generation as well, but there was little evidence for this kind of mechanism, possibly because education was free and there was no need. We therefore see a transformation of economic capital from the parental generation into cultural capital in the younger generation. This transformation sets the Voluntary Dependents up for a smoother transition from school to work or adulthood, through sponsoring gap years to promote employability or helping with deposits for a house. As such, we see evidence that although authoritative parenting may promote academic achievement (further developed below), when there is economic capital in the family the link to economic self-sufficiency and self-efficacy is rather weak. I think they were worried about putting too much pressure on you and I did know people who didn't have the support that I did, who had to work a lot and I think that did put an awful lot of pressure on them. (in education, urban, male) Ambitious respondents also received financial support from their parents in order to achieve their academic goals, but there is a difference in the expected outcome. Cultural capital (valuing education) and economic capital (financial support) is more directly transformed into economic capital (to help you get a job). As such this group demonstrates even more clearly the investment in upward social mobility as outlined in the theoretical framework for this book. It may be the combination of this attitude to education and a strong transmission of the extrinsic work values that has given the Ambitious a stronger drive to become financially independent of their parents.",

As such we see a similar generational transfer of economic capital in these families, but we do not see the same transformation of economic to cultural capital and less of an investment in education as risk aversion.

It seems like the contemporary economic context of difficulties to enter the labour market, and find sustainable employment is contributing to the need for the family to act as a support system.

Independence was not only encouraged by the families of Entrepreneurs, but it was also necessary. In contrast to Swartz and O'Brien's (2009) suggestion that inequalities in resources at the parental level is reproduced at the child level, here we see that lack of money at the parental level has produced the most economically selfsufficient children. The family has not been able to step in to help, and this has driven the young respondents to take care of themselves. It is, however, worth noting that the Entrepreneurs are generally further on in their transition to adulthood than the other respondents, so economic independence might just be part of that process. In a similar vein, the presence of support among the Gradual Progressors is not necessarily hindering progression to economic self-sufficiency, but by taking away the immediate concern for how to sustain themselves at certain critical steps along the way the support is potentially delaying the process. This is not to say that economic self-sufficiency will not become a primary concern or reality later on in their transition to adulthood for the Gradual Progressors, but it is not, and need not be, their primary concern at the point of study. It is not only financial support which facilitates transmission and impacts on economic self-sufficiency but also non-financial support and parenting style, as will be discussed in the following section.",

While there was a lot of emotional support, there was little guidance and help with regard to career choices, an experience they share to a degree with Gradual Progressors. This pattern matches the parental expectations for their children and a focus on rather general, positive personality types instead of their children's achievements. Happiness and friendliness were given priority over economic capital, a trend that is visible across generations. Parents of the Gradual Progressors employed in family business also had a tendency to use authoritarian parenting. However, unlike Entrepreneurs and Ambitious the parents still expressed their praise for their children's achievements. While it was not directly acknowledged, the young people were granted lower levels of autonomy compared to the other Gradual Progressors. Clearer patterns of authoritarian parenting among these Gradual Progressors are also linked to greater involvement of grandparents in these families. Overall grandparents showed a greater tendency to authoritarian parenting, suggesting a generational shift in parenting practices, with the parent generation showing a less clear-cut authoritarian parenting style. In their interaction with grandchildren, the grandparents still rely on this authoritarian style, as the quote below illustrates. I used to look at their [her children's] books, and I do it with my grandson, the little one now, and he's funny, he said, 'granny, it's rather personal, you looking in my school books'. I said, 'well, that's just too bad [grandson's name], because I'm going to'. 'It's personal', and [I] said, 'don't speak to granny like that'; for being nosy, I got in trouble for being nosy, from your eleven year old grandson. I said, 'I'm just wanting to see how you're getting on at school'. (family business, urban, female-grandmother) Authoritative parenting was the least common parenting style in the sample, but was evident in families of Voluntary Dependents. The frequent references in interviews with Voluntary Dependents are striking, especially because it can be observed in the grandparent generation as well, who in the other groups tend to favour a more authoritarian style.",

(in education, urban, female-father) Despite emotional support and praise, behaviour linked to permissive parenting such as a lack of guidance, appear to have contributed to Gradual Progressors' lack of strategic career planning. While Voluntary Dependents may not be focused on economic self-sufficiency they do display plans for their futures, whereas the Gradual Progressors are more relaxed about their future career. Interestingly, this lack of guidance led to a strong focus on economic self-sufficiency among Entrepreneurs (see below). Gradual Progressors take the steps necessary to slowly transition into economic self-sufficiency but prefer to make safe choices instead of developing greater, more risky ambitions. The main difference seems to be that among Gradual Progressors the interviews have also revealed instances of behaviour associated with authoritarian parenting, such as a restriction of autonomy and a tendency to decide for their children. This appears to have stifled some of their career planning through restricting autonomy.",

Nevertheless, entrepreneurs were able to entertain themselves and discover interests of their own. The lack of structured, family influenced cultural activity matches the idea of independence and self-determination as opposed to a very strong family influence on career planning, giving them the confidence for starting their own businesses. Permissive parenting allowed them to explore their options independently with regard to their careers. These Entrepreneurs illustrate that a permissive, bordering on neglective parenting style, is compatible with economic self-sufficiency in the offspring. However, this success was also accompanied with some difficulties along the way, such as changes in degree courses. Again, a lack of guidance might have contributed to these difficulties. The lack of family support could have hindered their progression, but they managed on their own as they developed independence and self-efficacy. Thus, lack of family support should not itself be seen as an important key to economic self-sufficiency, but rather an environment more generally that encourages and supports independence seems to be the key element.",

One of the entrepreneurs commented on the lack of support and acknowledgement from her parents during her education, and that this acted almost as a driver for her to try and achieve more.

However, the extent and type of resources transmitted also clearly depended on the availability of such resources, cash and class, in the families.

However, autonomy throughout their lives appears to have contributed to their entrepreneurial spirit and a need for parental acknowledgement pushed them further in their endeavours. It seems like the environment accepting of failure and innovation nurtured an entrepreneurial spirit of self-efficacy as well as willingness to take risks.",

In contrast, the link between current economic self-sufficiency and parenting style is weaker, and it seems like the economic resources, or in other words the cash and class, of the family and the ability to support the transition from school to work or into adulthood has had a larger influence.",
