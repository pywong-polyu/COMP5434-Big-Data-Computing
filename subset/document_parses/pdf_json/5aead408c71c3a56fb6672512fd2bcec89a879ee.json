On the one hand, there was a consistent lymphopenia with an overrepresentation of non-functional T cells, with an increased percentage of naive Th cells (CD45RA+, CXCR3-, CCR4-, CCR6-, CCR10-) and persistently low frequency of markers associated with Th1, Th17, and Th1/Th17 memory-effector T cells compared to healthy donors. On the other hand, the most profound alteration affected the Th1 subset, which may explain the poor T cells responses and the persistent blood virus load. Finally, the decrease in Th1 cells may also explain the low frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that express the HLA-DR and CD38 activation markers observed in numerous patients who showed minimal or no lymphocyte activation response.

The cytokine storm is one of the main reasons for the development of ARDS and multi-organ failure (13) . In addition to cytokines, there are several inflammation and coagulation parameters that are elevated in these patients, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) D-dimer, and fibrinogen (12) .

Notably, when compared to day 1, we observed a significative reduction in PD-1+CD4+T cells and an increase of TFH. Although not statistically significant due to the low number of cases tested, we observed a noticeable recovery of T cells, CD4+ T cells, Th1, and Th1/Th17 cells ( Figure 2 ). FIGURE 1 | Gating strategies for the identification of Th subsets and the evaluation of T cell activation and exhaustion markers. (A) First a lymphocyte gate was defined based on high CD3 expression and low side-scatter (SSC) complexity. A minimum of 200,000 events/sample were collected in this gate. Second, the cells in the lymphocyte gate were divided into CD4+ and CD8-lymphocytes. Third, we analyzed the CD4+ lymphocytes for the expression of CD183, CD196, and CCR10 in order to identify Th1 (CD4+CD183+CD196-), Th1/Th17 (CD4+CD196+CD183+), and Th17 cells (CD4+CD183-CD196+CCR10-). A human regulatory T cell (Tregs) cocktail was used to identify regulatory T cell subsets defined as CD4+CD25brightCD127low. This gating strategy was applied to all controls, asymptomatic recovered donors, non-ICU hospitalized patients, and ICU hospitalized patients, as indicated in the figure. For the identification of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells we used antibodies against CD45RA, CD183, CD185, CD186, CD194, CD196, and CCR10, selecting those that were bright for CD45RA but negative for the rest of the mentioned markers, as shown in the top panel. The amount of each T cell subset was expressed as a percentage of total CD4+ cells.

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection produces an immune disorder promoted by lymphopenia that mainly affects T lymphocytes. So far, the lymphopenia has been the main finding that may explain the inadequate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, variations have been described in populations of memory, na\u00efve and effector T lymphocytes, as well as different markers of activation and exhaustion, both on CD4 and CD8 T (21) . In our study, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the Th cell component and CD8 T cells. In addition, we have analyzed the activation status and the appearance of T cell exhaustion markers. Our data reveal a profound impairment of T cell immunity, which can be explained by four different reasons: 1-important lymphopenia. 2-The highest proportion of cells in a nonfunctional effector state (na\u00efve T lymphocytes), suggesting a persistent hypoactivation of the immune system. 3-An important reduction in the proportion of Th1 cells. 4-An insufficient activation measured by the expression of HLA-DR and CD38, which in many cases was similar to that observed in the control group. Lymphopenia affects T lymphocytes, showing significant differences between non-ICU hospitalized patients and ICU hospitalized patients, compared to the asymptomatic recovered donors and healthy controls, with the lowest percentage of T lymphocytes in the ICU group. Lymphopenia affected mainly the populations of CD4 T lymphocytes, with a reduction in absolute numbers of the subpopulations Th1, Th2, Th17, Th1/Th17, Th22, TFH cells, and Tregs, highlighting an approximate 10% reduction in the proportion of Th1 cells. This decrease in the percentages of effector T lymphocytes can be explained by the higher frequency of na\u00efve cells, Th0 (CD45RA +, CXCR3-, CCR6-, CCR10-, CCR4-). This increase in na\u00efve T cells is observed in both the hospitalized patients and ICU patients, and has been referred to in other studies (22) . We believe that it can be explained by a regenerative process in response to lymphopenia. Alternatively, it could correspond to a block in the complete stimulation carried out by dendritic cells. In this sense, a dysfunctional activation of dendritic cells has recently been observed, which would result in apoptosis and depletion of T lymphocytes (23) .",

The studies have been postulated from cytopathic effects by the virus (24) , which have been questioned (25) , to metabolic disorders (26) . From an immunological point of view, the lymphopenia could depend on the possible dysfunctional activation of dendritic cells already mentioned (23) and the high concentration of cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10, which act as negative regulators of the proliferation and survival of T lymphocytes (27) . In this sense, we detected an inverse correlation between lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in COVID-19 patients. It is therefore very possible that this lymphopenia is caused by factors triggered during the exacerbation of the innate response. Hence the close association found between lymphopenia and the biochemical parameters analyzed ( Table 3) .",

            "text": "The low frequency of the cellular component Th1 is the main finding of this study and can negatively affect in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 at various levels. Th1 cells are of vital importance in the elimination of intracellular microorganisms such as mycobacteria and viruses. Its reduction, as we see in COVID-19 patients, can have serious consequences for the control of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its resolution. Th1 lymphocytes, through the production of the cytokines IL-2 and IFN-g, participate in the activation, proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and induction of cellular cytotoxicity of virus-infected cells (28) . Furthermore, unlike SARS patients, patients with COVID-19 also have elevated levels of Th2 cell-secreted cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-10), which inhibit the inflammatory Th1 responses (13) . The Th1 deficiency would lead to a decrease in the number of active CTLs and therefore a poor immune response to the viral infection. Other studies, some Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org November 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 596553 published during the evaluation of our work, show similar findings (29) (30) (31) . However, these studies are based on fewer cases and focus on IFN-g-producing cells, or na\u00efve/effectormemory cells. Furthermore, these studies, although interesting, do not distinguish between Th1 and Th1/Th17 cells and do not include a comprehensive analysis of additional functional Thsubtypes. Interestingly, a reduced Th1-type specific immune response (i.e., a lower proportion of IFN-g secreting cells) against different SARS-CoV-2 antigens was observed and was related with age/comorbidity (32) . Finally, data by Roncati and colleagues, suggest that the \"moonlighting protein\" CD26/DPP4 could explain the Th1 immune lockdown observed in severe cases of COVID-19 (33) . We show that there is a low activation (HLA-DR, CD38) of CD8 cells, which is probably also related to the deficiency in the Th1 population. Finally, the decrease in Th1 lymphocytes can affect the development of antibodies (34) . In this sense, it is known that human coronavirus infections occasionally fails to generate protective immunity due to a poor adaptive immune response (35) (36) (37) (38) . This may be due to an insufficient durability or magnitude of the T cell response as the production of neutralizing antibodies is dependent on the T cell response (39, 40) . In agreement, Grifoni and colleagues recently showed that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 correlated positively with the magnitude of the Th1 response (41) .",

Moreover, the percentages of HLA-DR+CD4+, PD-1+CD4+, and PD-1+CD8+ T cells were notably raised in the group of patients that died ( Table 5) .

(21) . These authors show that the immune response is quite diverse and thus, while a subgroup of patients had T cell activation characteristic of acute viral infection another subgroup had lymphocyte activation comparable to uninfected subjects. This lack of activation contrasts with that observed in the course of other viral infections, which is very prolonged and stable over time (43) (44) (45) . However, it should be noted that patients with a significant increase in HLA-DR exhibited a more aggressive disease course ( Figure 1B) . Interestingly, we found that COVID-19 patients with neutrophilia, lymphopenia and a more pronounced alteration in the biochemical parameters associated to inflammation had a higher percentage of CD4+ T cells with expression of activation markers HLA-DR and CD38. It is possible that the appearance of HLA-DR in patients with more intense lymphopenia could be due to an expression induced by inflammatory cytokines and is therefore not indicative of antigen-specific activation. It is therefore possible that the expression of HLA-DR is a consequence of dysregulated inflammation and the recruitment of inflammatory myeloid cells (21) and, hence its observation in the context of neutrophilia ( Table 2 ). The increased inflammatory state induces the generation of neutrophils through the production of G-CSF, the regulation of the expression of chemoattractants and the activity of neutrophils (46) . The positive relationship found between neutrophils and acute phase proteins can be explained too by the inflammatory state (47) . The production of acute phase proteins such as ferritin and CRP, in addition to affecting the balance between the pro and anticoagulative pathways (increasing the D-dimer) (48, 49) , can induce apoptosis in lymphocytes (13, 50) . The study of ROC curves showed that troponin I, CRP, D-dimer, and LDH concentrations at hospital admission can be used as predictors of death. Measuring lymphocytes, HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells, or PD-1+CD4+ T cells could also be useful for the prediction of a fatal outcome. Our results also indicate that an elevated SOFA score at hospital admission is associated with an unfavorable prognosis.",
