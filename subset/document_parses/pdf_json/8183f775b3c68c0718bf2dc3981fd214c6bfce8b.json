            "text": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, current health systems, businesses, school systems, and public service agencies are struggling to control the spread of the infection through stricter safety regulations, social distancing requirements, and more frequent COVID-19 testing. In addition to greater professional requirements, the current public health climate provides a host of challenges like those observed in previous pandemic literature. [1] [2] [3] Due to the speed and spread of the infection, it is expected that many health systems are struggling to cope with the resource scarcity and personnel demands of the current pandemic. 4, 5 This exponential demand in health worker personnel translates into higher stress levels and risks for frontline nurses currently working in hospital settings. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] For frontline nurses, this stress may increase with the number of infected patients, thereby raising their concerns about their health risks and the risk of spreading the infection to their loved ones. 4, 9, 10 Additionally, current frontline nurses must face long working hours amid reports of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilator shoratges, thereby making frontline nurses feel especially vulnerable to additional job demands. 9, 11 In such cases, nurses perceiving a high level of stress and anxiety may feel helpless, fatigued, depressed, and burned out. 4, 9, 10 Ultimately, these feelings might lead nurses to consider leaving their job or assessing their career choices. 4, 5, 8, [12] [13] [14] Turnover intention, then, provides the best proxy measurement of whether a frontline nurse plans to leave their current position. 4, 5, 8, [12] [13] [14] As Alabama is one of the poorest states, its capacity to respond to and treat patients infected with COVID-19 is limited compared to larger, wealthier states. 9, 13, 15 Nurses that are willing to work with acutely infectious patients in these settings may feel that their job presents a moral imperative, thereby reducing their turnover intention. 9, 13, 15, 16 This assumption would be consistent with much of the health administration literature regarding frontline nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, which finds that frontline nurses continue to exhibit high internal motivation while working with infectious patients. [16] [17] [18] However, other studies report nurses showing the desire to leave their current positions due to heightened feelings of fear and anxiety related to working during the pandemic. 10 Nurses are assumed to exhibit intrinsic motivations that compel them to work longer hours despite experiencing additional stress, such as higher patient treatment complexity, stricter safety regulations, and more significant occupational risks. 10, [19] [20] [21] [22] found that Alabama frontline nurses exhibited heightened feelings of stress and anxiety due to working with patients infected with COVID-19 11 and significant concerns about the increasing number of infected patients. 9 Previous research shows that higher stress and anxiety levels and feelings of burnout related to the current pandemic are contributing to higher levels of reported turnover intention in numerous hospital settings. 10, 19, 21, 23 This study will investigate if psychological anxiety resulting from perceived job demand and organizational resources contributes to increased turnover intention. This study will answer the following research questions:",

It is so incredibly said because everyone is so sad and scared for them, and the patient is usually weak since they are put on ventilators far too late. I just hold up an IPad or phone while they say goodbye to their loved one because they are more than likely not being taken off the ventilator once put on. Like, it makes me cry just thinking about it. This suggests that frontline nurses during this time may feel that their health systems are struggling to treat patients and that these gaps are worsening the emotional stress felt by nurses during a routine but crucial job function.

Further, they may also experience resource loss due to increasing job demand due to a lack of additional (or accessible) resources. Results from a previous study found that very few, if any, nurses in Alabama were currently using psychosocial support as a coping mechanism, thereby reducing the chances that such programs have of effectively reducing turnover intention. 9 As a result, additional research is needed to understand how nurses perceive stress related to a lack of psychological support. 16, 27, 28, 38 While the literature has already identified characteristics related to nursing turnover, few studies have engaged in research designed to investigate the implications of perceived shortages in organizational resources on turnover intention in health systems located in poor states. 10, [12] [13] [14] 39, 40 Additionally, more research is needed to investigate the perceived lack of organizational resources on current frontline nurse turnover intention in hospital settings. As a result, questions remain about the motives of turnover intention among individual staff and what stressors related to job demands and organizational resources correspond to turnover intention.",

[41] [42] [43] According to the theory, a significant physical and mental/emotional loss could result from continuous stress in the work environment and lead to different coping strategies. Further, the perception of resource loss and gaps in organizational support can worsen the effects of continuous stress in the work environment. [41] [42] [43] This study investigates if nurses are more likely to consider quitting their job due to the psychological anxiety and stress resulting from job demand and organizational resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Hobfoll (1989; , people seek different coping strategies when they work under a lack of emotional, psychological, and physical environment. [41] [42] [43] This study provides further context to the growing turnover intention literature by observing the state of Alabama in the United States. The state's health system reflects many of the communities in the Southeast region, given its reliance on a handful of major health systems and largely rural population. 9, 15 This study investigates to what degree turnover intention is a coping strategy resulting from the stressors from the nurses' job demand and lack of resources among nurses in Alabama. Figure 1 provides a model that describes the occupational stress leading to turnover intention due to both internal and external effects, which increase the perceived difficulty of performing nurse tasks. Job demands measure the stress and anxiety caused by job demands that directly impact nurse tasks' perceived difficulty. This domain includes patient acuity, task assignment, stress related to personal protective equipment (PPE), and personal health as a stress factor. 17, 29 Organizational resources measure the stress and anxiety caused by a perceived lack of resources in the work environment which indirectly impacts the perceived ease of nurse tasks. This domain includes PPE, psychosocial support, supervisor support, and compensation. 27, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Figure 1 reflects how nurses are ultimately seeking to balance the \"burden of prevailing circumstances\" related to personal and job external factors and the clinical status of patients. 12, 44, 45 It suggests that increases in stress and anxiety related to job demand and the stress and anxiety related to work environments will result in a desire to quit. 29, 41, 43, 46 Further, this model hypothesizes that perceptions of resources lost may also increase turnover intention by also increasing stress. 29, 42, 43, 46 ",

The nurses were invited to participate through social media platforms such as LinkedIn and share information about this study's purpose. This study shared an online link to a Qualtrics survey with currently employed frontline nurses along with a consent form. The largest factor in the design choice stemmed from a lack of willing health systems to provide access to many nurses. 12 Not only were health risk factors a cited issue but health systems are disincentivized from disclosing potentially sensitive information related to gaps in their organizational resources. As a result, this cross-sectional design was used as an efficient alternative to scarce researcher resources. 47 This study was approved by the Auburn University Institutional Review Board (IRB reference # is: 20-238 EX 2005) per the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were compensated for their time. This study's inclusion criteria specified only Alabama nurses working directly with COVID-19 patients within the last three months from the collection start date. Participants were notified about the aims of the project and the risks that might be associated with the survey study.

While nurses are educated to handle a wide range of patient complexity, the current pandemic brings more opportunities for them to become overwhelmed in dealing with the rapid deterioration of their patients. Nurses who report feeling overwhelmed by their patients' complexity of treatment also report lower job satisfaction. Three items were used to capture the perceived level of anxiety and stress caused by increased intensity, effort, or complexity in completing tasks for a patient. 9, 21 Patient Assignment Construct Due to the high demand for frontline nurses during a pandemic, high instances of nurses being asked, or required, to work with patients infected with COVID-19 can be expected. 19 Previous studies suggest that task autonomy, or the freedom of task assignment, is associated with job satisfaction, workload, and turnover intention among experienced nurses. Studies suggest that a lack of autonomy is associated with higher instances of turnover intention among nurses. 10, 12, 13, 39 Three items used captures the perceived level of anxiety and stress caused by a lack of autonomy.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 42 This study contributes to the literature by investigating the primary cause of psychological stressors faced by frontline nurses in Alabama and their behavioral outcomes resulting from stress due to turnover intention. This study proposed eight major construct causes of psychological anxiety and stress that nurses face as crucial predictors of turnover intention. The results presented by this study concur with the other tasks and show that job demands, and the lack of resources provided by the organization are causing anxiety and stress and forcing nurses to reassess their career choices. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 42 This study finds evidence that stress and anxiety caused by the current pandemic influence the perceived stress related to job demand and organizational resources of frontline nurses in Alabama. Following a discussion of notable factors of turnover intention, we provide suggestions on how these influences translate into individual and work-environment job factors that hospitals can address in future recruitment and stress management interventions.",

Regarding marital status, this measure may capture aspects related to perceived limited access to social support in addition to a perceived increase in potential risks in spreading the virus to an intimate partner. 11 These findings are consistent with studies investigating the effects of parental and marital status on the perception of workload and social support for nurses in hospital settings. 9, 29, 32, [53] [54] [55] ",

Patient acuity and personal risk are factors that were found to have been heightened in highly stressful environments. Both factors are also prevalent indicators to measure the perceived and output of intense workloads. 9, 12, 19, 21, 40, 52 These findings are consistent with the literature regarding the relationship between patient acuity and workload on stress, negative health outcomes, and feelings of burnout. 12, 19, 21, 40 Additionally, frontline nurses are not only scared of getting infected, 3, 9, 19, 36, 37 but they also experience heightened fears and anxiety from the risk of becoming asymptomatic carriers and unknowingly amplify the spread of the infection. 3, 9, 19, 36, 37 Patient assignment significantly affected the fear on personal health among nurses due to nurses' work environments in hospital settings. Task autonomy related to patient assignment can vary from relative flexibility to a complete lack of autonomy. 12, 19, 21, 40 In cases where nurses must work during a pandemic, the literature suggests it is difficult to avoid working or interacting with patients infected with COVID-19. 12, 19, 21, 40 Recent studies related to nurse stress find that many hospitals may be overestimating the resilience of nurse staff in keeping up with the demands of patient-centered care during the COVID-19 pandemic. 10, 22, 56 Due to their professional obligations to provide patients with the best treatment possible, many nurses may feel the emotional and mental stress of watching their patient's health quickly deteriorate due to worsening symptoms 9 or due to a lack of resources such as ventilators. 10, 20, 23, 57 Ethically, nurses may experience compassion fatigue or moral injury, as they must balance their perceived responsibility to safeguard patient welfare with the fear and anxiety of getting infected and amplifying the spread of the infection. 25, 57 These results are consistent with qualitative and empirical research that found many nurses feel they are being pushed beyond their limits. 12, 19, 21, 40 Frontline nurses during this time have limited team support due to the number of professionals allowed in the room with the patient, as well as time constraints related to the suggested time nurses can be in the rooms with patients. 9 Given the unique work environment many nurses face in current hospital settings, more qualitative research is needed to better understand the extent that supervisors can provide meaningful support. It remains unclear the extent that positive communication affects nurses that lack physical interaction with colleagues and supervisors. found that no frontline hospital nurse staff in Alabama reported seeking psychological treatment or counseling. 9 However, psychosocial support was found to reduce turnover intention significantly due to feelings of anxiety or stress. While many international studies suggest that psychosocial support is sufficiently provided to frontline nurses in hospital settings, this may not be the case in the United States. 3, 19, 36, 37 This study's findings suggest that frontline nurses need additional psychosocial support to overcome wanting to leave their position due to feelings of burnout.",

First, this study's findings suggest that less experienced nurses (five years or less) and senior nurses (over fifteen years) had significantly higher stress levels. Second, many hospitals are currently recruiting nurses using sign-on bonuses. While Knapp et al (2017) finds compensation to be impactful in positions of low income and high moral importance, the nursing profession was already a well-paid job that suffered from turnover before the pandemic. 16 As a result, nurse recruitment may need to focus less on financial incentives and more on targeting individuals who would view the position as a \"calling\" rather than a career. found that none of the nurses who were surveyed reported using psychological counseling. The authors suggest that access to psychosocial support may be limited or non-existent in Alabama hospitals. 9 This study finds that the stress and anxiety caused by a lack of perceived psychosocial support correspond to greater turnover intention. As a result, this study provides further evidence of what scholars have already known, that greater access to resources is needed to reduce the impact of nurse stress on organizational outcomes. While this design cannot test the extent to which access plays a part in the perceived stress of resource shortages, the results suggest that nurses desire greater access.",

This study's unique relationships and patterns provide evidence to help formulate causal models for turnover intention. These insights must be tested with a more extensive and more diverse range of nurses to test the implications properly. Ideally, this test would include comparative data for discussing differences between nurses among different levels of hospital management (nurse, head nurse, and nurse manager) within other hospital units to identify differences in specialty and within different hospital types (public, nonprofit, private). The limited data on private hospitals requires that scholarship provides alternatives to direct observational comparisons.",
