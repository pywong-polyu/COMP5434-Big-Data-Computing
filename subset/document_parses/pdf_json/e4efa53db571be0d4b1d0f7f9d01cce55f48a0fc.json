Marked by the so far unstoppable outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the year will also be remembered for the newly adopted wealth of vocabulary. 'Social and physical distancing', 'shielding', 'testing', 'vaccine wars', 'self-isolating', 'pandemic', 'quarantine', 'lockdowns and curfews', 'covidiots', 'herd immunity' and 'key workers' are few examples. Although the usage of these expressions within the current circumstances is new, no one can claim that the threat of a serious disease developing into a pandemic was not envisioned, even in the recent past. In fact, what is rather interesting is that this has not taken place much earlier, considering that the last global pandemic which humankind had to face took place over a hundred years ago (the 1918 influenza pandemic known as the Spanish flu) and noting that during the past few decades we have had to deal with the outbreak of a number of troubling diseases such as Ebola, SARS-CoV and H1N1 which all had the potential to become pandemics as well.",

Higher levels of intellectual property rights (IPRs), lack of innovation and R&D for treatment in certain diseases and technologies, and our inability to learn from previous experiences have made the current situation extremely difficult and potentially untenable at least in the short term. These factors have led to higher prices of medicines and lack of affordability and accessibility to treatment hence making a larger segment of society more susceptible to the current virus, and as a result placing additional constraints on governments and individuals alike. In addition, it is acknowledged that the farreaching measures taken to combat the pandemic will have a massive impact on human rights and the implementation of the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 1 As such, radical thinking is needed in order to deal with these unprecedented circumstances before it is too late.",

Even worse within the context of the current pandemic, it is established that those who have a serious premedical condition are more vulnerable. A recent study by the Lancet found that one in five people worldwide are vulnerable to severe COVID-19 due to chronic health conditions (Clark et al. 2020) .

In early July 2020, it was announced that the US had secured almost all of Gilead Sciences' projected production of remdesivir for the next three months. The US Health and Human Services (HHS) stated in a press release that it secured 100% of Gilead's projected production for July (94,200 treatment courses), 90% of production in August (174,900 treatment courses), and 90% of production in September (232,800 treatment courses), in addition to an allocation for clinical trials. 9 Although the motives of the US administration behind such a decision are clear, the moral and ethical questions which are raised in this regard are also very evident. How are other countries supposed to access remdesivir, particularly in the absence of the availability of the treatment and in the situation of lack of licensing by the rightsholders? As Maybarduk explains, 'The countries that are not covered by Gilead's license would have to buy from Gilead, but they can't buy from Gilead because the United States and Europe have bought up the entirety of Gilead's supply,' (Vijay 2020) Gilead will have only 15,300 treatment courses available for countries outside the EU and US to access from August to September (Rizvi 2020) .",

The Agreement dictates that patent protection is awarded to all types of inventions including those related to pharmaceutical patents. Although many policymakers in developed countries were convinced that TRIPS would put an end for the 'ratching up' of IP protection levels globally, the outcome was to the contrary. Within less than a decade from the birth of the TRIPS Agreement, the proliferation of free trade (FTAs) and bilateral investment (BITs) agreements containing heavy IP obligations which go beyond those prescribed under the TRIPS Agreement became the norm.

As such, the TRIPS Agreement adopts a 'minimum standards' of protection approach, which means that all WTO member states will have to provide the minimum ceilings of protection as prescribed under the TRIPS Agreement under their national laws, while at the same time are free to raise the levels above those if they deemed so in accordance with their national priorities and development stages and subject to respecting the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) and National Treatment (NT) principles. This approach provided member states with a reasonable policy space and flexibility in some respect about how to incorporate and define the 'minimum standards' under their national legislations and legal regimes. were granted an extended transition period exempting them from protecting intellectual property as stated under the WTO's TRIPS Agreement. This is in recognition of their special developmental needs and the balance that should be put in place prior to the introduction of intellectual property protection under their national law. More recently, several extensions of the transition period were provided by the TRIPS Council. 11 This means LDCs can choose not to provide legal protection for pharmaceutical patents and clinical trial data before 2033. The decision also keeps open the option for further extensions beyond that date. 12 A number of low-income countries-Uganda, Cambodia and Rwanda for example-have already ben-efited from this flexibility hence ended up using the full transition period granted to them. \u2022 Compulsory licensing It allows the state to authorize a third party to exploit patented inventions, generally against a specific remuneration to be paid to the patent holder subject to meeting several conditions (Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement). The aim of compulsory licensing authorization is to limit anti-competitive behaviour and facilitate the transfer of technology. 13 This tool has proven its effectiveness in a number of cases in terms of dealing with national health priorities by reducing prices of medicines substantially where a national production capability exist. For instance, the Ecuadorian Institute of Intellectual Property (IEPI) reported that between 2013 to 2017 it issued ten compulsory licences for various medications including antiretroviral drugs. 14 According to health officials in Ecuador, the compulsory licenses granted between 2013 and 2014, generated the potential for savings of 23% to 99% (Correa and Vel\u00e1squez 2019 ber 2015. 12 In 2019, Uganda notified the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) that it is exercising its right as a leastdeveloped country by stating that pharmaceutical inventions are not eligible for patent protection in the country ('t Hoen 2019). 13 The special compulsory licensing system in the amended TRIPS Agreement, and the earlier 2003 waiver decision, (sometimes called the 'Paragraph 6 System' because it refers to paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration) only deals with compulsory licences to produce medicines expressly for export purposes. 14 The issued compulsory license were for three ARV medicines namely Ritonavir + Lopinavir and Lamivudine + Abacavir, for Etoricoxib (Arcoxia \u00ae for the treatment of diseases with acute pains); Mycophenolate Sodium (MYFORTIC) used in the treatment of reception of kidney transplants; sunitinib, an anticancer drug used for the treatment of carcinoma renal cells (CRC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs); and finally Certolizumab, used to counteract rheumatoid arthritis.",

            "text": "hepatitis C medicine Sofosbuvir. It is believed that this compulsory license has enabled a cheaper treatment cost to be between RM 1000 to RM 1200 (US$ 240-US$ 285) for 12 weeks course, compared to RM 300,000 (approx. US$ 72,000) which was the cost of treatment with the patented version prior to issuance of the license (Ling 2019). \u2022 Parallel importation This flexibility grants countries the option to obtain patented products when they are lawfully available in a foreign market at a lower price, thus enabling countries to shop for cheaper patented products. 15 For example, Kenya has actively and effectively used parallel importation to improve access to antiretroviral medications. 16 \u2022 Exceptions to patents rights Article 30 of TRIPS provides that members 'may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties'. 17 However, the above provision does not define the scope of the permissible exceptions thus awarding member countries some considerable discretion to operate. Examples of these exceptions include the Bolar exception, 18 personal use and the research and experimental use exceptions. \u2022 Standards of patentability Under TRIPS, patent protection must be granted for products and processes which are new, involve an inventive step and are industrially applicable. 19 These are not defined and can be interpreted and applied by member states in accordance with their national legal regimes. For example, TRIPS does not require countries to protect the patenting of new uses of known products, including pharmaceutical drugs. This flexibility therefore allows member countries the pos-sibility of rejecting the patentability of these new uses for lack of novelty, inventive step or industrial applicability. The case of India provides some valuable insights regarding this approach whereby strict patentability criteria aimed towards limiting the number of frivolous or secondary pharmaceutical patents granted are applied (Chatterjee 2013 ). This has the effect of limiting patent abuse cases by not granting of low-quality patents (antievergreening strategy). 20 Egypt is also applying similar vigorous examination practises. The country is home to the highest rate of hepatitis C infections in the world. A couple of years ago the Egyptian's Patent Office rejected one of Sofosbuvir patent applications through resorting to strict patentability criteria. This allowed a local generic manufacturer to produce the drug for less than US$ 200 per twelve-week treatment. \u2022 Other procedural flexibilities Another identified policy tool used by low-income and high-income countries to improve the quality of granted patents and limits 'evergreening' is pre-grant and post-grant patent oppositions, in addition to patent revocation proceedings. Such proceedings enable interested parties to bring claims before the patent office on the basis that a particular patent does not meet local requirements. Opposition procedures have been applied usefully and efficiently in several countries. 21 This is an important procedure due to the fact that it is believed that current estimates suggest that at least 27% of current patents would be found invalid by US courts due to low quality (Miller 2012) .",

An example of this controversial aspect was demonstrated in the Philip Morris Asia versus Australia 24 case whereby the Australian Federal Government passed the Tobacco Plain Packaging (TPP) Act in 2011 requiring restrictions on the use of advertisements of tobacco and the increase of the size of the graphic health warnings on the front face of the pack from 30 to 75% based on public health considerations. This decision was challenged by the tobacco industry alleging that the measures amounts to expropriation and interferes with their trademarks rights in Australia and breaches international IP-investment-and trade law under the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between Hong Kong and Australia (HK-AUS BIT). They unsuccessfully demanded the suspension of the measures and compensation amounting to billions of dollars 25 Other flaws of the ISDS system include the lack of consistency in decision making and huge costs. There is now growing evidence that the threat of using these ISDS procedure is enough to obligate countries to change their policies. 26 The effect of these TRIPS-Plus standards has been acknowledged by many in recent times resulting in even higher medicines prices and longer monopoly term all at the expense of patients and citizens particularly in low-income countries.

This is the case specially since those 'vulnerable' segments of society are more susceptible to have severe COVID-19 infections or higher mortality rates.

Despite the fact that global calls for solidarity have been made by many including the United Nations, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank and the WTO in order to deal with the crisis, 27 we have also witnessed some resistance by IP holders aimed at protecting their proprietary rights. 28 In recognition of IP's ability to restrict the accessibility and production of certain medical and diagnostic products and goods, governments have taken several intellectual property-related measures in order to deal with the current situation and overcome the barriers created by the IP regime. 29 The need to urgently secure essential products including medicines, personal protective equipment, testing kits, CT scanners, and ventilators has been identified as a priority by many countries from the beginning of the pandemic leading some to even ban their exportation (Boykoff 2020) . Furthermore, several low-come and high-income countries have already taken concrete steps in order to facilitate access to medications and medical equipment through limiting or removing any intellectual property restrictions in this regard by issuing compulsory licenses and government use authorizations. For instance, on 17 March 2020 the Parliament of Chile adopted Resolution No. 896 declaring that the global coronavirus outbreak justifies the use of compulsory licensing to facilitate access to vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, devices, supplies, and other technologies useful for the surveillance, prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of the coronavirus in Chile (Syam 2020: 2-3) . Israel took similar measures by issuing a government use authorization under the Israeli patent law for the importation of generic lopinavir/ritonavir (owned by AbbVie) combination for the treatment of COVID-19 patients from an Indian generic company by a local company acting on behalf of the Israeli ministry of health because AbbVie was unable to provide sufficient supplies of lopinavir/ritonavir (Syam 2020: 3) . AbbVie has announced that it will not enforce its patent in light of the current pandemic. 30 The use of competition law has often been recognized as an important tool in the process of curtailing IP abuse. More recently, the European Commission (EC) launched a preliminary investigation on the abuse of the dominant position in the Dutch market by the Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company Roche, on account of its reported refusal to share the secret formula for producing a buffer solution that is necessary for use in testing kits for COVID-19. This has lead Roche to immediately announce that it will release the recipe for its lysis buffer if Dutch laboratories ask for it (Van Ark and Strop 2020) . The EC has also stated that during the pandemic it will continue to closely and actively monitor relevant market developments to detect instances of potential activities that may take advantage of the current situation to breach European Union competition law and policy, by either engaging in anti-competitive agreements or abusing their dominant position. 31 Moreover, on 23 March 2020, France enacted a new law No. 2020-290 which introduced one (Art. L.3131-15) to the country's public health law allowing the French Prime Minister to order the seizure of all goods and services necessary to fight against sanitary disaster; to temporarily control the prices of products; and to take any measures necessary to make relevant medicines available to patients (Syam 2020: 3) .",

It demands a serious breakout from the prevailing traditional way of thinking which dictated our approach in dealing with international economic and trading relations since the 1950s. We must start to critically question the existing policies and their failure and proactively seek a new and more inclusive approach in dealing with these trade and health issues.

Of course, it should be made clear that the current regime is not the only reason for our challenges and other factors should also be equally dealt with including inadequate R&D levels, procurement policies, tax reform, judicial reform and so forth. Calls for the need of a reformed patent regime are not new. However, the systemic conflict between strengthened patent protection and public health needs and challenges is rising and this explains why some of the high-income countries are often the first to initiate restrictions and impose limitations on the intellectual property regime during public health crises, such as the one we are currently facing.",

The rise of TRIPS-Plus standards through various agreements and arrangements have had grave repercussions on the needy everywhere and is likely to get worse unless something serious is done about it. A fundamental aspect of this would be to remind ourselves about the public goods nature of health care provision and the need to make decisions departing from this perspective, not business or political considerations. Including TRIPS-Plus standards in new agreements should no longer be allowed, while previously agreed TRIPS-Plus provisions will need to be abolished. Concurrently, governments, health activists and policy makers should start the debate about reforming the TRIPS Agreement and the impact of the patent regime on access to medicines and public health.",

The IP regime cannot continue to be used as the main mechanism to compensate innovators but should also be supplemented by other tools. Targeted government funding programmes, prizes schemes, shared pooling arrangements and reward strategies should gain more recognition in this process (Suleman et al. 2020) . As importantly, is the need to make available and declare all new vaccines and treatment to COVID-19 as a global public good. Emerging calls such as the one made by Costa Rica in March 2020 for the creation of a global pooling mechanism in order to facilitate access to and use of intellectual property, trade-secret know-how, regulatory data, and other proprietary data for technologies that are useful for the detection, prevention, control, and treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic must be given the attention they deserve, if the world is serious about accelerating R&D. 33 Finally, transparency in drug pricing is pivotal to ensure that fair compensation is granted to those who invest in finding medical solutions to diseases, and affordable drug prices are applied so that patients can afford them. The 2019 World Health Assembly's resolution supporting greater public disclosure of prices for medicines and other health products is a crucial step in the right direction (Fletcher 2019) .",
