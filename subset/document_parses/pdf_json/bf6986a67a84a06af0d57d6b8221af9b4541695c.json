In adults, COVID-19 causes severe lung involvement with acute respiratory failure and multiorgan failure, typically seen during second week of illness when viral titres are declining and markers of inflammation are rising, labelled as cytokine storm [2] [3] [4] . Initial reports from COVID-19 pandemic hinted that children were less severely affected by SARS-CoV2 infection than adults [5, 6] .

Majority of children with MIS-C, unlike typical KD presented with shock requiring ionotropic support [10] . Few reports described a presentation similar to that of toxic shock syndrome and secondary MAS/HLH [8, 10] . A study of 44 children from Columbia, USA has described gastrointestinal symptoms in 84% of patients meeting MIS-C criteria. KD-like features were present in 50% of patients. They also reported neurological manifestations in 30% [11] . Another study from Asia, India has shown KD-like presentation in 36% and gastrointestinal presentation in 42%.

In our MIS-C cohort, four patients of Kawasaki-like disease were treated with IVIG along with steroids and all of them had good response to therapy. Steroids were used in 80% of MIS-C children however outcome was dependent on severity of illness at presentation. Almost 90% of our children required Paediatric ICU support and 65% required ventilatory support. In most other studies also, it was noted that children with MIS-C were critically ill and were managed in Paediatric ICU [28] and ventilation/intubation was required [12, 14, 15] . As found in our study, finding of severe form of the disease and a high number of MIS-C has also been shown in a multinational study in Latin American children in contrast to studies from China, Europe and North America [29] .",
