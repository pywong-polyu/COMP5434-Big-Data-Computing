More recently, transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been added to the repertoire of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2 detection [3] . Despite their high sensitivity, NAATs are associated with drawbacks that limit their use for communitybased testing strategies, including the need for laboratory-processing, high cost, and long turnaround from sampling to results release. Furthermore, there is cumulative evidence indicating that the period of NAAT positivity in infected individuals largely exceeds the time window in which infectious viral particles can be isolated from the respiratory tract, raising doubts about the epidemiological meaning of a NAAT positive result [4] .",

Overall, Ag-RDTs have lower sensitivity than NAATs; however, clinical validation studies have consistently reported increasing sensitivities in specimens with higher viral loads. These findings, along with the growing body of evidence on the lack of infectivity of cases with low viral load [6] [7] [8] [9] and the potential long-tail of positivity when using highly sensitive methods such as PCR, suggest that frequent testing with Ag-RDTs-even those with low sensitivity-may be more effective than less frequent testing with RT-qPCR or TMA for mass screening campaigns to improve SARS-CoV-2 control [9, 10] . 6 The performance parameters of Ag-RDTs are mostly based on testing respiratory specimens from clinically suspected cases [11] [12] [13] [14] and contacts after exposure to a positive case [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first head-to-head comparison of Ag-RDT in asymptomatic screenings, an intended use proposed by various authors [5, 10, 17, 23] . On the other hand, our study was limited by the small number of specimens with Ct <30, a threshold deemed of interest for the use of Ag-RDT in screenings of the general population. In our sample, specimens below this threshold accounted for 30%; however, other authors have reported proportions of nearly 60% in random screenings of the general population [23] . Of note, we used specimens in transport medium. This approach is convenient for mass screening strategies in which individuals with positive Ag-RDT results may need further diagnostic confirmation by PCR. However, only one manufacturer (i.e., the Roche assay) provided instructions on how to process samples collected in virus transport medium. The consistency of our results across assays, particularly regarding negative results, suggests that the use of this media had a little or negligible impact on test performance. Finally, it is worth mentioning that all nasopharyngeal swabs in our analysis were collected by trained healthcare professionals. According to a recent report of lateral flow viral antigen detection devices, the positivity rate might be lower in screenings performed by nontrained people [9] .",

Two commercial, widely available assays can be used for SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing to achieve sensitivity in specimens with a Ct<30 and specificity of at least 80% and 96%, respectively. While these tests may overlook SARS-CoV-2 infection with low viral loads, they accurately detect individuals with high viral loads and, therefore, at higher risk of transmission. Our findings also support the idea that Ag-RDTs can be used for mass screening in low prevalence settings and accurately rule out a highly infectious case in such setting. In models according to population prevalence, all Ag-RDTs will have a NPV >99% and a PPV<50% at 1% prevalence. Our results, together with the cumulative evidence on the limited overlapping between PCR positivity and the presence of infectious viral particles in the respiratory tract, encourage the design of public health interventions for containing viral COVID-19 spread that shift from positivity testing to infectivity testing. The low cost and short turnaround time of Ag-RDTs, which ease frequent testing, are additional advantages over assays better suited for diagnostic use like NAATs. In low-income countries with limited laboratory resources, the trade-off between targeted PCR analyses and massive screenings with Ag-RDTs should be carefully considered. All samples were nasopharyngeal swabs collected from unexposed asymptomatic individuals during mass screening campaigns. Sensitivity and specificity results are presented with the 95% confidence interval. Bars show the 95% confidence interval of the estimated sensitivity.",

            "text": "part of the surveillance program for pandemic control in Catalonia (North-East Spain), the local government launched NAAT-based systematic screenings in areas at high risk of an outbreak. The University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol processed nasopharyngeal specimens collected in a healthcare area in North-East Spain (i.e., Metropolit\u00e0 Nord) with a catchment population of ~1,400,000 people. These samples enabled us to assess the Ag-RDTs in line with The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) target product profile for lateral flow assays that directly detect antigens of SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays [21], which recommends at least 100 known negative samples and 100 known positive samples with a documented RT-PCR result. In this study, we used samples collected between December 2020 and January 2021 (i.e., during the third wave of the epidemic in Spain) with RT-qPCR results available (i.e., data on cycle threshold [Ct]) to perform a head-to-head assessment of five Ag-RDTs. Samples with invalid results in any of the assessed Ag-RDTs were excluded from the analysis. 7 All samples used in this analysis had been collected in the setting of a public health surveillance program, and data were handled according to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union and the local regulatory framework regarding data protection. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (Badalona, Spain). Procedures Samples consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs collected by health care workers during mass testing of unexposed asymptomatic individuals living in areas at high risk of an outbreak. Swab specimens were placed into sterile tubes containing viral transport media (DeltaSwab Virus, Deltalab; or UTM Universal Transport Medium, Copan). The reference test (i.e., RT-qPCR) was performed on fresh samples stored at 2 -8 \u00baC for up to 24 hours; samples were then stored up to 12h at 2-8 \u00baC until their use for the five Ag-RDTs. RNA for RT-qPCR tests were extracted from fresh samples using the viral RNA/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation kit for the Microlab Starlet or Nimbus platforms (Hamilton, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification was conducted according to the recommendations of the 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR Diagnostic Panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (REF), using the Allplex\u2122 2019-nCoV assay (Seegene, South Korea) on the CFX96 (Bio-Rad, USA) in line with manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, a 25 \u03bcL PCR reaction mix was prepared that contained 8 \u03bcL of each sample's nucleic acids, 2019-nCoV positive and negative controls, 5 \u03bcL of 2019-nCoV MOM (primer and probe mix) and 2 \u03bcL of real-time one-step Enzyme. Thermal cycling was performed at the following conditions: 20 min at 50 \u00baC for reverse transcription, followed by 15 min at 95\u00b0C, and then 45 cycles of 15 sec at 94\u00b0C and 30 sec at 58\u00b0C. An RT-qPCR was considered positive according to the manufacturer's instructions [22]. Index tests included the following Ag-RDTs: PanBio TM COVID-19 Ag Rapid test (Abbott), CLINITEST\u00ae Rapid COVID-19 Antigen Test (Siemens), SARS-CoV-the specifications of each test. All Ag-RDT determinations were performed in parallel by two blinded technicians, who used approximately 100 \u03bcL of 1:2 mix of each kit buffer and the sample previously homogenized. Samples were applied directly to the test cassette and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature before reading results at the naked eye, according to the manufacturer instructions (i.e., the presence of any test line (T), no matter how faint, indicates a positive result).",
