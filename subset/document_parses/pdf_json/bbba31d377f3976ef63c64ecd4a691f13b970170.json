Seven of the 20 counties (with 18% of the total population) do not have organised cancer care facilities, and oncology patients in these counties are forced to travel to other counties daily to receive appropriate oncology treatment [6] [7] [8] . That could interrupt the continuity of oncology care and increase the risk of inadequate and delayed care during the COVID-19 pandemic and ultimately lead to poorer treatment outcomes [9, 10] .",

First, this study did not include patients who did not present at health facilities as planned during the survey period. These patients may not have presented due to objective reasons (issues with transportation due to lockdown, distance from the place of treatment, unable to arrange an escort) or subjective reasons such as pandemic fear. The research was conducted only in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Croatia, and due to the pandemic of an unknown virus, as well as due to lockdown, the reactions of patients could have been more intense. Although the study included patients from all counties in Croatia, this study did not include the oncology centre of Split-Dalmatia County, where 11% of the population lives [8] and which had the most unfavourable epidemiological situation in Croatia in terms of the number of people infected and the number of deaths.",
