However, members of US Black and Hispanic communities, already disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 virus, may be less willing to receive the vaccine. We conducted a broad, representative survey of US adults (N = 1,950) in order to better understand vaccine beliefs and explore opportunities to increase vaccine acceptance among these groups. The survey results suggested that Black and Hispanic individuals were less willing than Whites to receive the vaccine. US Blacks and Hispanics also planned to delay receiving the COVID-19 vaccine for a longer time period than Whites, potentially further increasing the risk of contracting COVID-19 within populations that are already experiencing high disease prevalence. Black respondents were less likely to want the COVID-19 vaccine at all compared with Whites and Hispanics, and mistrust of the vaccine among Black respondents was significantly higher than other racial/ethnic groups. Encouragingly, many Black and Hispanic respondents reported that COVID-19 vaccine endorsements from same-race medical professionals would increase their willingness to receive it. These respondents said they would also be motivated by receiving more information on the experiences of vaccine study participants who are of their own race and ethnicity. The results have implications for improved messaging of culturally-tailored communications to help reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.",

Black and Hispanic Americans have experienced particularly high rates of morbidity and mortality [1, 2] . At the time of this writing, approximately fifty thousand Black Americans and seventy thousand Hispanic Americans have died from the virus. Black and Hispanic Americans are also more likely to suffer from pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease, which exacerbate the effects of COVID-19 infection [3] . The unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these groups is likely also contributed to by a variety of social factors that have increased disease transmission within minority communities and reduced their ability to receive adequate healthcare [3] . Further compounding these issues, the COVID-19 pandemic has acutely impacted Black and Hispanic Americans economically. Black and Hispanic workers have experienced pandemic-related layoffs and job losses to a greater degree than those in many other racial and ethnic groups [4] . Research also indicates that Hispanics in particular are postponing health services, which may only make COVID-19's longer-term impact worse [5] .",

Unethical medical incidents such as the Tuskegee experiments in 1932-1972, where Black men infected with syphilis were purposely denied treatment and eugenics laws that were disproportionately applied to people of color have left a long-lasting impact on ethnic minority populations, often diminishing their trust in the healthcare establishment [7, 8] . This lingering distrust may contribute to vaccine hesitancy. Improved understanding of COVID-19 perceptions among Black and Hispanic Americans is needed to slow the infection rate and achieve herd immunity. Anderson et al. [9] noted that the vaccination levels required to achieve COVID-19 herd immunity may be up to 90%, making it necessary to achieve near-universal levels of vaccine acceptance. However, Dong et al. [10] hypothesized that vaccination of 60% of the population may be sufficient. Randolph and Barriero [11] noted that herd immunity thresholds can vary widely within populations and are non-uniformly distributed, implying that a single standard for herd immunity may be an oversimplification.",

In their review, Spencer, Trondsen-Pawlowski and Thomas [13] reported the incidence of serious adverse advents from vaccinations is generally very small, especially when considered in light of the vaccines' disease prevention benefits. Still, some studies have found that people of color may be more reluctant than Whites to vaccinate themselves and their children against diseases such as influenza. Black parents and patients have been shown to have higher concern about factors such as vaccine-related side effects [14] . These concerns resulted in lower influenza vaccination rates: during the 2019-2020 flu season, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that just 38% of Hispanic individuals and 41% of Black individuals received an influenza vaccine, compared to over half of non-Hispanic Whites. CDC data also indicate that Black and Hispanic Americans were especially likely to contract the flu, possibly due to vaccine reluctance compounded by the health impact of other social and economic inequities [15] . The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health, stating that vaccine hesitancy is a major factor driving the resurgence of measles [16] . Notably, the spread of misinformation, often through the media, may be a contributor to vaccine hesitancy in a variety of groups [17] [18] [19] .",

Novel and dangerous SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, making the pursuit of herd immunity through wide-scale, global vaccination an urgent imperative. Breaking the chain of disease transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is critical. Anderson et al. [20] discussed the impact of child vaccination programs and observed that beyond the direct effect on the children who are vaccinated, child vaccination also provides substantial indirect community protection. By blocking transmission, vaccinated people of all ages prevent exposure to unvaccinated members of their communities. Anderson et al. [20] further noted that when new childhood vaccines are implemented, disease incidence significantly declines throughout the entire population, even among those who are unable to receive the vaccines themselves.",

Consent to participate was obtained after respondents were given sufficient information about the survey and asked if they wanted to complete an anonymous survey. In order to protect subject privacy, no names or identifiers were collected from survey respondents. Respondents were recruited from across the United States. A broad, national sample of US respondents was collected with demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity and household income) approximating percentages from the United States Census, and data was further weighted to represent the US population more precisely. Population values were developed using data from the 2019 US Census American Community Survey [24] . Population percentages were calculated for the matrixed percentage values for age range, gender, race/ ethnicity, household income range and Census region, and were compared to the same matrixed percentage values within the survey sample. Survey responses within each Age range \ufffd Gender \ufffd Race/ethnicity \ufffd income range \ufffd Census region cell were upweighted or downweighted so that the resulting percentages, shown in Table 1 , reflected the population distribution present in the American Community Survey results. Most cell weights differed negligibly from 1.0. Respondents gave their consent prior to starting the survey. Prior to the beginning of the survey, respondents were asked to indicate their age.

Non- Hispanic Blacks had a survey sample N = 235, with a mean age of 44.5 years (SD = 16.6 years). Hispanics of any race accounted for N = 304 respondents with a mean age of 39.0 years (SD = 14.8 years). The survey dataset also included N = 32 Asians (mean age = 44.8 years, SD = 16.3 years) and N = 130 respondents who classified themselves as \"Other,\" or another race/ethnicity (mean age = 39.6 years, SD = 14.6 years). Approximately half (49.3%) of survey respondents identified as male and the remaining 50.7% identified as female. No respondents identified their gender as non-binary, although this option was offered as a response to the gender identification question. Overall self-reported median annual household income in 2019 was $51.6K, and in 2020 was lower, at $48.0K. People self-identifying as Asian reported the highest median incomes in both 2019 and 2020 ($67.4K and $65.5K, respectively) and those in the Other category reported the lowest median incomes (2019 median = $35.3K and 2020 median = $32.5K, see Table 1 ). In terms of household composition, 30.5% overall reported living in a household with one or more children under age 18, 49.7% reported living only with other adults, and 19.8% reported living alone. When asked to describe the location of their homes, 32.2% said it was urban, 45.2% said it was suburban and 22.6% said it was rural. Non-Hispanic Whites were most likely to report living in a suburb (45.1%) or a rural area (26.7%). Black, Hispanic and Asian respondents were less likely to be rural or suburban than Whites, and more likely to live in an urban area (see Table 1 ). When asked if they are willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, fewer than 40% of respondents overall indicated they would \"definitely\" be willing to receive it. More than 20% said they would \"probably not\" or \"definitely not\" receive it. Race/ethnicity was significantly associated with likelihood to receive the vaccine (\u03c7 2 = 104.32, df = 16, n = 1950, p < .05). As shown in Table 2 , approximately half as many Black respondents as compared with Whites stated that they would definitely be willing to receive the vaccine (22.6% for Blacks vs. 43.6% for Whites, p<0.05). Similarly, about 20% of Blacks stated they would definitely not receive the vaccine compared with 12.7% of Whites (p<0.05). A meaningful proportion of Hispanics (14.8%) stated that they would definitely not be willing to receive the vaccine, although this was not significantly different from White respondents. H1 was partially confirmed. There was a significant relationship between when respondents planned to receive the vaccine and their race/ethnicity (\u03c7 2 = 129.84, df = 28, n = 1950, p < .05). When asked how long they planned to wait before receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, Blacks and Hispanics were significantly less likely than Whites to state that they wanted to get vaccinated immediately (20.1% for Blacks, 28.2% for Hispanics and 38.5% for Whites, both comparisons p<0.05, see Table 3 ). Black and Hispanic respondents were also significantly more likely than Whites to indicate that they planned to wait for over a year to get the vaccine (9.8% for Blacks, 8.2% for Hispanics and 5.1% for Whites, both comparisons p<0.05).

Our results indicate that Black respondents were significantly more likely to believe that the vaccine is dangerous, more harmful than getting COVID-19, going to cause people to catch COVID-19, unsafe, and not worth the risk. They were also less likely to believe that the vaccine would be effective. Historical explanations for this lack of trust, such as the Tuskegee experiments, could be one factor, especially given the greater strength of overall findings among Black respondents. Katz et al. [26] suggested that more extensive vaccine information and multimodal patient support may help counteract HPV vaccine hesitancy driven by mistrust; similar approaches should be tested for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.",

            "text": "Due to these disparities, having medical professionals from Hispanic and Black communities discuss the vaccine may be particularly important. Sandra Lindsay, a Black medical professional, was the first person in the United States to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. She acknowledged the Black community's greater medical mistrust due to historical incidents like the Tuskegee experiments, and cited it as the primary reason she wanted to receive the vaccine publicly: \"That was the goal today. . . Not to be the first one to take the vaccine, but to inspire people who look like me, who are skeptical in general about taking vaccines [29] .\" The second person in the US to receive the vaccine, Dr. Yves Duroseau, was also Black and noted the importance of personally illustrating the vaccine's safety [29] . As the COVID-19 vaccine becomes more widely available to the general public, frequent salient examples of Black and Hispanic medical professionals receiving the vaccine and discussing its benefits could significantly reduce vaccine hesitancy among people of color. Furthermore, Paterson et al. [30] observed that healthcare providers are among the most trusted sources of vaccine information. Given this, healthcare providers' own vaccine status and attitudes are particularly important so that they can accurately inform their patients. However, healthcare worker COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy itself is a potential challenge. Lucia, Kelekar and Afonso [31] found that nearly a quarter of medical students were reluctant to receive the vaccine upon regulatory approval [also see 32, 33] . Paterson et al. [30] noted that making vaccination for healthcare providers convenient and inexpensive, as well as increased training about vaccines and patient communication strategies, can increase vaccine compliance among patients. Given the influential role that Black and Hispanic medical professionals play in encouraging vaccine uptake among Black and Hispanic patients, it is critically important to make it as easy as possible for them to receive the vaccine. US Blacks and Hispanics in this study were significantly more likely than Whites to state that more testing of the vaccine on their racial/ethnic group is needed. Researchers, too, have noted the challenge of achieving adequate representation of Black and Hispanic patients in medical research [e.g., 34, 35] . Our results suggest that the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines among minority study participants should be further highlighted. Promoting the dissemination of accurate research information, including the experiences of minority vaccine recipients, could demonstrate the positive effects of the vaccine in these groups, encouraging them to see the vaccine as safe and effective and increasing vaccination uptake.",

Increased media coverage and representation of Hispanic and Black medical professionals endorsing vaccines and discussing infectious diseases may foster greater trust among Hispanic and Black individuals and encourage them to see vaccines as more trustworthy, safe, and effective. In addition, media could be used to describe past, current, and future vaccine clinical trials and the successful experiences among Black and Hispanic study participants. Our results also suggest that improved, culturally tailored messaging and communication tools to get such messages across could help to improve vaccination rates within minority communities. As the Black American and Hispanic American communities are culturally distinct and each contain a variety of ethnic groups, it is important to develop comprehensive communications that take the diversity of these communities into account. Culturally competent approaches are necessary when developing the most successful methods to increase vaccine acceptance among minority groups. These are important areas for future research.",

            "text": "The current study is not without limitations. The study was conducted at a single point in time, soon after COVID-19 vaccines became widely available. COVID-19 vaccine-related attitudes are likely to continue to evolve as more people receive the vaccine and share their personal experiences within their social groups; this factor alone may result in increased trust and vaccine uptake. However, the opposite result may also occur: rare incidents of vaccine side effects may be seen as newsworthy and attract attention through media and informal word-ofmouth, worsening vaccine-related fear and hesitation. During the time this survey was conducted, the vaccines that had received Emergency Use Authorization were the mRNA vaccines formulated by Pfizer-Biontech and Moderna. As additional vaccines become widely available vaccine perceptions may change. Additional research may further analyze vaccine attitudes and beliefs as the pandemic evolves and new vaccines are available. In addition, as the pandemic continues, new viral variants and mutations may impact attitudes towards vaccination. Further research should include questions assessing opinions towards vaccination in the context of viral variants, which may be more or less dangerous than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

Given the observed racial/ethnic differences in median income, it is reasonable to ask whether any race/ethnicity effects observed in the analysis may actually be driven by these confounding factors. Further examination of these effects is an opportunity for future research. More extensive research is also needed to examine the mechanisms of vaccine hesitancy among people of color and how their vaccine-related concerns can be overcome. An emerging issue regarding COVID-19 vaccination is that of incomplete treatment: since the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses administered about three to four weeks apart in order to be maximally effective, receiving both doses during the recommended timeframe is of pivotal importance. Culturally-relevant vaccine communications and administration practices are needed to help achieve this, especially among higherdisease-incidence populations such as US Blacks and Hispanics. Future research could be done using mixed methods study, so that nuanced differences between distinct cultural groups can be explored further. Future studies can also further assess whether promoting the spread of accurate study data that shows the positive effects of the vaccine in Black and Hispanic individuals will reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Future research could expand on this finding and use experimental methods to test different variations of health communications in communities of color to examine which more effectively diminish vaccine hesitancy.
