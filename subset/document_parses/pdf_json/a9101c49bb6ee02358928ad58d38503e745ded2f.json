Here we catalog and document numerous antipatterns in financial ML operations (MLOps). Some antipatterns are due to technical errors, while others are due to not having sufficient knowledge of the surrounding context in which ML results are used. By providing a common vocabulary to discuss these situations, our intent is that antipatterns will support better documentation of issues, rapid communication between stakeholders, and faster resolution of problems. In addition to cataloging antipatterns, we describe solutions, best practices, and future directions toward MLOps maturity.",

In deploying these pipelines, we have encountered several recurring antipatterns [5] that we wish to document in this paper. Just as design patterns codify best software engineering practices, antipatterns provide a vocabulary to describe defective practices and methodologies. Antipatterns often turn out to be commonly utilized approaches that are actually bad, in the sense that the consequences outweigh any benefits. Using antipatterns to desribe what is happening helps ML teams get past any blamestorming and arrive at a refactored solution more quickly. While we do not provide a completed formal antipattern taxonomy, our intent here is to support better documentation of issues, rapid communication between stakeholders, and faster resolution of problems.",

In particular, our study recognizes the role of multiple stakeholders (beyond ML developers) who play crucial roles in the success of ML systems.",

Such 'fails' happen for many reasons, e.g., unique patterns in trading, supply and demand imbalances, speediness of given securities, operational hiccups, or credit events. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which led to an increase in settlement fails, the Treasury Market Practices Group (TPMG) in our organization recommended daily penalty charges on fails to promote better market functioning. The failed-to party generally requests and recoups the TPMG fails charge from the non-delivering counterparty. After broad industry adoption, according to the Federal Reserve, the prevailing rate of settlement fails has fallen considerably.",

We have developed a machine learning service that uses intraday metrics and other signals as early indicators of liquidity issues in specific sets of bonds to forecast settlement failures by 1:30pm daily NY time. The service also takes into account elements like the velocity of trading in a given security across different time horizons, the volume of bonds circulating, a bond's scarcity, the number of trades settled every hour and any operational issues, such as higherthan-normal cancellation rates. Fig. 1b showcases the daily failure rate dynamics (per hour) and characterizes the complexity of the task that the aforementioned machine learning service is modeling. The resulting predictions help our clients, including bond dealers, to monitor their intraday positions much more closely, manage down their liquidity buffers for more effective regulatory capital treatment, and offset their risks of failed settlements. Through this and other ML services we have gained significant insight into MLOps issues that we aim to showcase here.",

Leakage can happen sometimes unintentionally when feature selection is driven by model validation or test performance or due to the presence of (typically unavailable) features highly correlated with the label.

Ensemble models like random forest classifiers and gradient boosting machines also have additional parameters governing the number of estimators (trees) to include in the model. Another popular classifier, the support-vector machine which is a maximum margin classifier requires the specification of hyper-parameters that govern the type of kernel used (polynomial, radial-basis-function, linear etc.) as well as the penalty for mis-classification which in-turn governs the margin of the decision boundary learned.

Demonstrated on churn (i.e., Attrition) detection application using the LIME [32] framework. the context of deep learning models, this area of research is termed neural architecture search [11] . Hyper-parameter optimization, has been conducted in multiple ways, however thus far a combination of manual tuning of hyper-parameters with grid-search approaches have proven to be the most effective [15, 20, 21] in searching over the space of hyper-parameters. In [2] , the authors propose that random search (within a manually assigned range) of the hyperparameter space yields a computationally cheap and an equivalent if not superior alternative to grid search based hyper-parameter optimization. Yet other approaches pose the hyper-parameter search as a Bayesian optimization problem [17, 36] over the search space.

The figures therein yield an analysis of the hyper-parameter optimization process characterizing the relative importance of each hyper-parameter employed in the learning pipeline.

In [24] , the authors state that many years of claimed superiority in empirical performance in the field of language modeling is actually faulty and showcase that the well-known stacked LSTM architecture (with appropriate hyperparameter tuning) outperforms other more recent and more sophisticated architectures. In [26] , the authors highlight a flaw in many previous research works (in the context of Bayesian deep learning) wherein a well established baseline (Monte Carlo dropout) when run to completion (i.e., when learning is not cut-off preemptively by setting it to terminate after a specified number of iterations), achieves similar or superior results compared to the very same models which showcased superior results when introduced. The authors thereby motivate the need for identical experimental pipelines for comparison and evaluation of ML models. In [35] , authors conduct an extensive comparative analysis of the supposed state-of-the-art word embedding models with a 'simple-word-embedding-model' (SWEM) and find that the SWEM model yields performance comparable or superior to previously claimed (and more complicated) state-of-the-art models. In our financial analytics context, we have found the KISS principle to encourage developers to try simple models first and to conduct an exhaustive comparison of models before advocating for specific methodologies. Recent benchmark pipelines like the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks [30, 38] are potential ways to address the PEST antipattern.",

The measure of traction is calculated somewhat informally without formal 3rd-party review or validation. While not a problem at first, if the data science team continues this practice long enough, while building confidence in their results, they never validate them and cannot compare unvalidated results against other methods. To avoid this antipattern, testing and evaluation data should be sampled independently, and for a robust performance analysis, should be kept hidden until model development is complete and must be used only for final valuation. In practice, it is not uncommon for model developers to have access to the final test set and by repeated testing against this known test set, modify their model accordingly to improve performance on the known test set. This practice called HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) has been detailed by Gencoglu et al. [13] . This leads to implicit data leakage. Cawley et. al.

ML pipelines predominantly adopt a 'set & forget' mentality to model training and inference. However, it is quite often the case that the statistical properties of the target variable that the learning model is trying to predict change over time (concept drift [40] ). Decision support systems governed by data-driven models are required to effectively handle concept drift and yield accurate decisions. The primary technique to handle concept drift is learning rule sets using techniques based on decision trees and other similar interpretable tree-based approaches. Domingos et al. [10] proposed a model based on Hoeffding trees. Klienberg et al. [18] , propose sliding window and instance weighting methods to maintain the learning model consistent with the most recent (albeit drifted) data. Various other approaches based on rule sets, Bayesian modeling have been developed for detection and adaptation of concept drift, details can be found in [12, 23, 39] . An example of model drift adaptation can be seen in Chakraborty et al. [7] for forecasting protest events. This work provides a use case wherein changes in surrogates can be used to detect change points in the target series with lower delay than just using the target's history.",

This exhaustive state representation of the ML decision pipeline in Fig. 5c allows us to explicitly add high penalties to such states allowing the ML, notification and intervention models to be trained cognizant of such penalties, essentially allowing fine-grained control of the learning and decision process.

(a) Heightened market volatility during March and April from COVID-19, when traders switched to working remotely, led to difficulties for firms in making sure everything was running smoothly. The larger volume of securities settlements in that period contributed to a higher number of fails.
