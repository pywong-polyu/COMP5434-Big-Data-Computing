Deficiencies in one or more micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin A compromise the physical and cognitive capacity of millions of people. Overall, it has been estimated that micronutrient deficiencies account for about 7.3% of the global burden of disease, and iron and vitamin A deficiency rank among the 15 leading causes of the global disease burden [3] , contributing to the deaths of over one million children annually [1] . The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 42 percent of children less than 5 years of age and 40 percent of pregnant women worldwide are anemic [4] ; pregnant women with severe anemia are twice as likely to die during or shortly after pregnancy than non-anemic women, and for their children, micronutrient deficiencies in utero can lead to low birth weight and brain and spinal defects [5] .",

In 2008 and 2012, the Copenhagen Consensus ranked food fortification as one of the most cost-effective development priorities [9, 10] . While mandatory food fortification has been used as a strategy to prevent micronutrient deficiencies in high-income countries (HIC)-dating as far back as the 1920s in Europe and North America when the first salt was iodized-it is still less common in LMICs where food systems are not delivering nutritionally adequate diets due the production and consumption of just a few major starchy food crops (maize, rice, wheat) with low micronutrient content and/or bioavailability (phytate). In the past two decades, food fortification has become increasingly popular in LMICs for several reasons, including rapid urbanization and increasing household purchasing power, leading to a greater proportion of the population relying on processed foods [11, 12] .",

In LMICs, the evidence is still being established, but research, including a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of large-scale food fortification (LSFF) programs, confirmed the impact of fortification on nutritional outcomes including reductions in vitamin A deficiency, iodine deficiency, anemia, and iron deficiency among women and children; declines in goiter and neural tube defects (NTDs) among children; and improved serum folate among women of reproductive age [13] . However, certain fortification approaches, such as iron fortification of staple foods like flour, provided mixed results. For example, Field et al. (2020) found that fortifying wheat flour with iron had little or no effect on anemia [14] and had little to no impact on iron deficiency compared to unfortified wheat flour; and that the addition of other micronutrients also had little impact on iron deficiency and hemoglobin concentrations compared to wheat flour alone [15] . Similarly, Pachon et al. (2015) found limited evidence to support the reduction of anemia with large-scale flour fortification [16] . In contrast, Barkley et al. (2015) found that among countries with national flour programs, there was a 2.4% reduction in the (odds) of anemia for non-pregnant women in each year of fortification in comparison to the previous year [17] .",

These families often rely on subsistence farming and can grow, consume and sell their own fortified crops. Additionally, when targeted correctly, biofortification can enable food systems to deliver more nutritious foods cost-effectively [25] . In northern Mozambique, a 2019 study [26] found that the introduction of orange sweet potatoes (OSP) to farmers increased vitamin A intake among women of reproductive age and children, and improved vitamin A intake (with long-term impacts on vitamin A intake). Nutrient poor diets based on staple crops (tubers and cereals) typically lead to multiple micronutrient deficiencies, but biofortification can increase a crop's nutritional value using traditional breeding and agronomic biofortification techniques. However, biofortification via genetic engineering-which allows for simultaneous introduction of multiple micronutrients in a single crop-could support increased levels of multiple micronutrients in a single food crop and high-level accumulation of micronutrients [27] .",

The study consisted of four population-based surveys conducted over a fouryear period, and it measured dietary intake and hemoglobin levels. The findings showed an unexpected increase in anemia among children. Despite the average intake of fortified flour detected by the study amounting to 100 g per day, the poor diets quality of children with low bioavailability of iron compromised the benefits of fortified flour [41] .",

To ensure success in food fortification, the micronutrients' Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) must be established. The WHO proposed a methodology for calculating and defining the safe upper limit in the Guidelines on Food Fortification with Micronutrients, which vary depending on the local context. However, challenges can arise in case of large consumption of the fortified food among the same population and utilization of multiple food vehicles [41] . In Guatemala it was shown that the consumption of wheat flour fortified with acid folic varied massively among people from different socioeconomic status (women from wealthy groups consumed 15 times more than women from no wealthy groups) rising concerns on the safe limits [43] . In Cameroon, the consumption of multiple Vitamin A fortified vehicles such as sugar or wheat flour with edible oil resulted in a possible excess of UL among children.

The authors identified engagement with Small and Medium Enterprise as a bottleneck to expanding food fortification programs, as well as their low technological and economic capacity; lack of regulations and food laws were also cited as barriers [47] . For example, despite mandatory salt iodization in the Philippines, more than two-thirds of the salt is imported and not fortified due to low production capacity. Furthermore, the national production of salt is carried out by producers without a license, thereby avoiding any official controls; and the absence of high-quality laboratories prevent control and monitoring to assess the quality of fortified food [55] .

Together with partners like Sight and Life, Rwanda has developed mandatory food fortification standards and have supported the process of passing new food fortification regulations making it mandatory for all locally and imported food products among the five food staples. Currently, some food processors like African Improved Foods, MINIMEX, and SOSOMA have introduced in the market fortified flours and some imported edible oils from neighboring countries are also fortified.",

For example, through the Rwanda National Fortification Alliance, members identified VAT taxation as one of their biggest challenges, and key stakeholder groups such as the private sector, CSOs and NGOs supported discussions with the Ministry of Finance to reduce or wave VAT taxes on fortified flour as a key fortification incentive.",

Studies on the fortification of foods have shown positive results not only in the control and prevention of micronutrient deficiencies among vulnerable populations, especially women and children, but also along social, economic and environmental dimensions. Sight and Life projects offer successful examples to address micronutrient deficiencies through fortification from several LMICs and emphasize the importance of multidimensional partnerships in addressing the many challenges of food fortification strategies. This paper aimed to demonstrate advantages and disadvantages of food fortification strategies, as well as to provide some key examples of ways in which different programs in LMICs have systematically addressed the issues identified, demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.",
