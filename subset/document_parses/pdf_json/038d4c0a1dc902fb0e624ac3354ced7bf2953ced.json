            "text": "Institution-based-cross sectional study design was employed and multi stage sampling technique was utilized to select 634 study participants. The data were collected using Kobo collect survey tool through interviewer administered questionnaire. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 25. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factor associated with risk perception and behavioral response. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was computed to determine the level of significance; in multivariable analysis, variables with a P value less than 0.05 with 95% confidence interval were considered as statistically significant. Results: About 79.1% and 75.1% of the teachers had high risk perception and good protective behavior, respectively. Having children ((AOR=1.84, 95% CI: 1.15-2.94), COVID-19 update (AOR=3.7, 95% CI: 1.66-8.59) and good protective behavior (AOR= 1.98, 95% CI: 1.18-3.34) were associated with high risk perception. On the other hand, educational status (AOR=9.42, 95% CI: 4.94-17.96) and availability of personal protective equipment (AOR=5.85, 95CI:2.27-15.02) were associated with good protective behavior. Conclusion: Although majority of the teachers had good protective behavior, some protective measures were not frequently adopted. There were few individuals who had low risk perception; this could be a potential cause for the occurrence of school outbreak. Therefore, the stakeholder should provide adequate resource and training on COVID-19 to enhance their risk perception and to promote adoption of protective methods.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious illness which was first identified in Wuhan China. It is a new disease and no effective treatment is found. 1 The WHO declared it as pandemic on 11 th march 2020. 2 In Ethiopia, the first case was reported on March 13, 2020, and since then the number of cases were gradually increasing and have reached 405,745 including 6911 deaths till December 31, 2021. 3 The common way of transmission of COVID-19 from person to person is through respiratory transmission and contact with infected surfaces. People with older age and those who have other medical illness are vulnerable to develop serious sign and symptoms. 4 Majority of infected individuals may have no symptoms or mild, however few individuals may develop serious illness which may include acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute myocardial injury. 5, 6 The major concern is that asymptomatic and mildly affected patients might remain undiagnosed and yet most easily keep spreading the virus. 7 Previously no vaccine or treatment was obtained to prevent the virus. 8 On March 2021 WHO approved COVID-19 vaccine campaign launched in Africa for high risk frontline health professionals. 9 Being vaccinated does not mean that it full protects against the disease; research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission. The other challenge is the new strain of coronal virus is spreading worldwide. The best way to prevent the condition is avoiding exposure. 8 Schools could be a site for community transmission of infectious disease outbreak. During initial phase of the outbreak, some countries have taken the drastic measure to shut down schools. 10 As teachers have a significant higher number of social interactions than other professions, they are vulnerable for contracting the virus. 11 A previous research report showed that educational workers were infected with COVID-19 and one in four teachers have a higher risk of Covid-19 infection. 10 During reopening of schools the COVID-19 prevention measures should be adopted for returning staff and students with strict limitations on the number of staff and students. A study conducted in England showed that the reopening of preschools and primarily following the easing of national lock down was associated with total of 198 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The staff to staff transmission was high. 12 A similar study conducted in Israel reported that after the reopening of schools ten days after reopening the first major school outbreak emerged in high schools. Overall, 153 students and 25 staff members were confirmed as COVID-19-positive. 13 A previous research reported that people may have risk perception to a threat if they believe that they are personally susceptible to develop the condition against which protection is required; perceive the condition as severe; perceive the preventive action as effective to reduce the threat; and believe they are capable to perform the preventive action. 14, 15 A survey conducted in Iraqi reported that only 6.9% of academic staff and students perceived their risk of getting infection of COVID-19 highly likely, and 4% and 5.7% of respondents perceived their risk of getting severe illness and risk of death as highly likely, respectively. 16 Previous research reported that a number of factors were associated with risk perception like age, 17 gender, 18 protective behavior, [19] [20] [21] and Comorbidities. 22 Assessing risk factors might be essential for targeting high risk individuals and for planning intervention to control the pandemic.",

Risk perception has encouraged teachers to take stronger safety precautions. Similarly, the odds of high risk perception among teachers who had children were nearly two times than its counterpart. This might be as the teachers are in contact with dozen of students, they could be vulnerable for contracting the disease. As the disease is highly infectious, they may fear of infecting their children when they return home. Those who had updated information on COVID-19 were more likely to have high risk perception than those who did not have update information. This can be explained by getting updated information related with COVID-19, for instance, number of new infected cases, number of death and the occurrence of new strain of corona virus may help teachers to be more cautious and enhances adopting COVID-19 protective measures.",

The reason for this could be people who are in highest educational level are more likely to read articles, newspaper and follow social media for getting information about COVID-19. Understanding the prevention methods of COVID-19 may enhance adoption of prevention practice of COVID-19. However, due to cross sectional nature of the study, we cannot confirm the temporal relationship between educational status and prevention practice. The odds of good protective behavior among teachers who said there is available PPE were more likely to have good protective behavior than no available PPE. The preventive measure for COVID 19 infections require personal protective equipment (PPE) for protection from infections. 32 If there is protective equipment, peoples are more likely adopting protective measures. Moreover, this study showed that majority (96%) of teachers mentioned that there is available PPE at schools. The reason for this could be at time of data collection the schools were well prepared themselves, like provision of face masks and sanitizer, for reopening of schools which were closed for long time.

Similarly, a study conducted among academic staff and student in Iraqi showed highest perceived threat level to COVID-19 in comparison to other medical illness. 16 Moreover, this finding is also supported by a study conducted in southwest Ethiopia. 19 A higher level of severity perception of SARS was also reported in Europe. 36 This implies that the respondents might have getting adequate information on severity and infectivity of COVID-19, which made the teachers consider the virus more threatening than any other disease. In addition scientific uncertainty in scientific understanding of the virus may also contribute for high perceived severity and vulnerability to COVID-19. Even though the COVID-19 vaccine was not introduced in Ethiopia at the time of data collection the respondents were asked their willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Accordingly, about 41.3% of them were not interested to take a vaccine. This indicates that there is a need to create awareness on vague information about the vaccine before starting vaccine provision for school teachers. In Ethiopia through the COVAX initiative the COVID-19 vaccine provision was launched on 13 marches 2021 for high risk frontline health professionals at Eka Kotebe COVID-19 Hospital. Ethiopia aims to vaccinate 20% of the population by the end of 2021. 37",

In this study although most of the teachers had high risk perception, 248 (39.1%) of them had minimal rate of that the students may contract the corona virus and 198 (31.2%) of the participants said that worry about the family members to contract the corona virus is none. The reason for this could be the teachers might be worried about themselves rather than their families and students. Underestimating this risk perception may lead to risky behavior. Concerning self-efficacy, the mean score was found to be 2.82+0.51. Of the respondents, 146 (23%) of them had minima rate of perception to control infection with COVID-19. Only 5.7% had high perception to control COVID-19. It is comparable with a study reported by Shimelis Girma et.al.",
