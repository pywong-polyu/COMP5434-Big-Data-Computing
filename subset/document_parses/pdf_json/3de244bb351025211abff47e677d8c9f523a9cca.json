Around 47% of the patients showed residual aberration on pulmonary CT with a median CT score of 0 (interquartile range (IQR) of 0-2) at 1 year after discharge, with ground-glass opacity (GGO) with reticular pattern as the major radiologic pattern. Patients with residual radiological abnormalities were older (p = 0.01), with higher rate in current smokers (p = 0.04), higher rate in hypertensives (p = 0.05), lower SaO 2 (p = 0.004), and higher prevalence of secondary bacterial infections during acute phase (p = 0.02). Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that age was a risk factor associated with residual radiological abnormalities (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15, p = 0.02). Pulmonary functions of total lung capacity (p = 0.008) and residual volume (p < 0.001) were reduced in patients with residual CT abnormalities and were negatively correlated with CT scores.",

A total of 86 consecutively discharged COVID-19 patients were invited to this follow-up study, and 45 patients were excluded due to the lack of interest or limitation attributed to the patient geographical location (Fig.  1) . The chest CT scans of the patients were followed up at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after hospital discharge. The COVID-19 patients were categorized based on the disease severity according to Chinese clinical guidance for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (7th edition) [11] . Briefly, patients could be categorized into four levels of severity: mild, ordinary, severe, and critical illness. Mild illness was defined as mild clinical symptoms without signs of pneumonia on radiologic imaging. Ordinary illness was defined as symptoms of fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiologic manifestation of pneumonia. Severe illness included patients who meet one of the following criteria: respiratory rate \u2265 30 bpm, arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) \u2264 93% at rest, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 )/ oxygen absorption concentration (FiO 2 ) \u2264 300mmhg, and over 50% lesion progression on chest radiograph within 24-48 h. Critical illness cases are those who meet any of the following criteria: respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation required, occurrence of shock, and complicated with other organ failure requiring intensive care. To simplify the analysis process, mild and ordinary cases were combined as mild group, and severe and critical illness cases were combined as severe group in this study. The ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (IIT2020-137).

Specifically, the extent of consolidation peaked (40.2%) at the 3rd week after onset of symptoms and decreased thereafter. Pure GGO or GGO with reticular pattern were the most common abnormal patterns since onset of symptoms until 12 months after hospital discharge. The ratio of lung zones with normal CT findings increased from Table S1 ). By the end of 1-year followup, only 13.0% of the lung zones had signs of GGO with reticular pattern, as well as 8.1% with pure GGO (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). The comparison of dynamic changes in CT scores at various time points between mild and severe patients is plotted in Fig. 4A . At 1 year after discharge, the median score of residual abnormalities was significantly lower in the mild group (median 0, IQR 0-1) compared to the severe group (median 1.5; IQR 1-6) (p = 0.03). The CT scores of severe patients peaked early after illness onset and maintained at high levels for several weeks before a slow decline. For mild patients, the radiographic abnormalities gradually reached its peak at the 3rd week after illness onset. And the peak score was lower than that in the severe group (p = 0.002). CT scores of the severe group were higher than those of the mild group for all the time-points except for the first week during the observation period (p < 0.05, Fig. 4A ). Both the mild and severe groups showed slow recovery during the early recovery phases (from the 3rd week to the 6th week after illness onset). Higher prevalence of consolidation was observed in the severe group during acute phase than that in the mild group (Fig. 4B, C, Table S1 ). For the patients with mild illness during acute phase, the ratio of lung zones with normal CT findings increased from 35.6% at 1 month, to 57.2% at 3 months, 66% at 6 months, and 78.8% at 1 year after hospital discharge (Fig. 4B, Table S1 ). Similar increasing trend of normal scans could also be noted in the severe group, i.e.,11.1% at 1 month, 28.3% at 3 months, 34.4% at 6 months, and 42.2% at 1 year (Fig. 4B, Table S1 ).",

Our results indicated substantial recovery on chest CTs occurred at 1 year after discharge with a median CT score of 0 and 65.4% of the lung zones as normal. Tang et al. reported a case of 55-year-old woman returned to normal lung parenchyma by the time of 1 year after illness onset [14] . The serial CTs in our cohort also provided the longitudinal lung changes in COVID-19 patients in the early and late convalescent periods. The recovery rate was much slower during the early convalescent phase (within 1 month after discharge) than late convalescent phase (from 1 month to 1 year after discharge). A slow decline of CT scores has been documented in early convalescence of COVID-19 patients (within 30 days after illness onset) previously [15] . The possible reason of slow recovery might be related to corticosteroid use. Most patients in our cohort underwent corticosteroid treatment which was weaned off and stopped in the first month after discharge. Whether the use of corticosteroid could lead to delay of the recovery on CT scans needs to be verified in future studies with larger sample size. In the previous 15-year follow-up study with serial CT scans in SARS infected patients, lesion absorption and recovery occurred to a greater extent within the first 12 months after infection, and then remained stable in the following 15 years [16] . Thus, how long the residual opacities would persist after COVID-19 warrants further research with longer followup in the future.",

Since the observation of substantial fibrotic consequences following infection of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [18] [19] [20] , concern has been raised about the prevalence and persistence of lung fibrosis after COVID-19. Based on previous data, lung fibrotic-like changes (the presence of traction bronchiectasis, parenchymal bands, and honeycombing) were observed in 35% of the patients who recovered from severe COVID-19 at 6 months after illness onset [10] . In this study, GGO with reticular pattern was observed in 31% of the lung zones in severe patients at 6 months, which is comparable with [21] . Wang et al. found that the mass of pulmonary involvement of older patients (> 45 years) was significantly more severe and peaked later than that of younger patients (\u2264 45 years) [22] . At 3 months after discharge, age was associated with the presence of GGO [8] . In the previous 6month follow-up study, old age (> 50 years old) was identified as the independent risk factor of fibrotic-like changes after SARS-CoV-2 infection [10] . The severity and outcome of COVID-19 is closely associated with the age of patients [23, 24] . Why the aged COVID-19 patients tend to be sicker and recover slower is not yet known. The potential molecular mechanisms might include epigenetic dysregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and hyperactivation of NOD-like receptor protein 3 as a trigger of cytokine storms in aged people [25] . Also, age-related differences regarding COVID-19 disease severity is suggested to be related to negative associations with CD8+ T cell count and positive associations with inflammatory responses and liver damage [26] . Another possible explanation is the increased incidence of comorbidities with age, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes [27] . These comorbidity diseases and the corresponding medications would influence the illness process. Further studies with larger sample size are warranted to stratify the effect of comorbidities.",

There was a considerable proportion (22-56% across different severity scales) of COVID-19 patients that had a pulmonary diffusion abnormality 6 months after symptom onset [29] . Our results demonstrated that only 7.3% of the patients showed DLCO below 80% at the time of 1 year after discharge, which suggests good recovery of diffusion capacity from 6 months to 12 months. The pulmonary restriction abnormality has also been noted in early convalescence [28] . At the time of 6 months after symptom onset, decreased RV was observed in patients between scale 3 (not requiring supplemental oxygen) and scale 5-6 (requiring HFNC and mechanical ventilation) [29] . In our study, the value of TLC and RV in participants with CT residual lesions was much less than that of participants without residual lesions. Furthermore, significant negative correlations were observed between residual opacities and PFTs of TLC and RV (Fig. 5) . Taken together, it was proposed that considerable impairment of lung volume, especially in patients with CT abnormalities. The results here are consistent with histological features of SARS-CoV-1 cases, which include diffuse alveolar damage in the early phase of the disease and dense septal and alveolar fibrosis in the later course of disease [30] . However, since the level of TLC and RV in both groups (with or without residual CT opacities) was generally normal, the reductions might have no clinical implications.",

Firstly, the baseline CT scans prior to the illness onset is unavailable; thus, it is difficult to compare the results before and after the illness. However, the proportion of patients with chronic respiratory in this study is fairly low, so it should be acceptable to assume that the baseline CT scans for majority of patients would be normal. Secondly, the sample size in our study is relatively small, and our findings including the identified risk factors should be confirmed by observations conducted at multiple centers and with larger sample sizes. Thirdly, subtle residual radiological opacities were observed in patients at 1-year follow-up. When the remaining radiological abnormalities completely resolve needs to be investigated in further studies. Finally, deep learning-based image processing software are showing great potential in quantitatively analyzing chest CT images [31] , which could be used in further studies to provide more quantitative data (such as effective lung volume, lesion volume).",
