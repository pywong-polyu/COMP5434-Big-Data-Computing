Beside the ever-increasing need for high capacity radio links, reliability and latency constraints challenge the mobile network supply. While for example the millimeterwave spectrum and THz-bands offer a vast amount of radio resources, their applicability is limited due to delicate radio channel conditions and signal propagation characteristics. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) as part of smart radio environments (SREs) of future ITS infrastructure promise improved radio link qualities by means of purposeful cultivation of passive reflections. With this, obstructed mmWave or THz beams can be guided around obstacles through RIS reflection paths to improve the otherwise limited coverage. In this article, application use cases of RIS-enhanced vehicular communications are proposed. Beside static deployments of RISs at exterior walls of buildings, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) could provide reflection capabilities on demand, while future vehicles could -in a visionary approach -consist of meta-material allowing for their opportunistic utilization within an enriched SRE. Results of a case study based on our multi-scale mobility and network simulation model clearly highlight the potential of RIS deployment for hybrid vehicular communication scenarios. Path loss and outage percentages can be reduced considerably.",

While the strategic deployment of RIS in urban environments can enhance network coverage and facilitate vehicleto-vehicle (V2V) communications, a more flexible exploitation of the RIS potential lies in extending their mobility. By embedding RISs on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which offer higher degrees of freedom regarding position and trajectory, a more flexible and responsive network provisioning can be realized. Reacting more timely to sudden situations or events such as accidents and traffic jams would also become possible. In addition, ubiquitous RIS deployments in a smart radio environment (SRE) would allow for a controlled but opportunistic utilization of RIS reflected communication paths. It is assumed opportunistic, since in contrast to the operation of a UAV dedicated to offer a RIS reflection occasion, most of the vehicles may follow their objectives to deliver goods or person and thus their mounted RISs are only available by chance.",

Among the various prospective use cases mentioned in this article, a smart infrastructure is believed to enable comprehensive network coverage. Thus, it facilitates the omnipresence of wireless systems with the aid of controllable wireless signal propagation. In addition, applications like multi-sensory holographic teleportation, autonomous cyber-physical systems, and intelligent industrial automation put high requirements on the performance of subsequent mobile networks. To meet these challenges, smart radio environments enabled by the RIS technology are envisioned as one of the key drivers for 6G and beyond. Especially wireless communication at the mmWave and THz bands, which suffer from limited distances and sparse coverage, can be improved by controlled reflections. The RISs are particularly suitable, because their reflection gain strongly depends on the dimension in relation to the wavelength of the radio signal. Consequently, shorter wavelengths as in case of these bands allow for a higher gain per RIS area and thus a more efficient surface size utilization or in turn, a smaller required surface size compared to the conventional sub 6 GHz bands for example.",

This especially applies for wireless communications at the mmWave and THz bands, where shorter wavelengths allow for reduced size requirements of RIS installations. However, vehicular communications comes with various challenges, which could be met by utilizing the RIS technology as indicated in Figure 2 . The utilization of mmWave and THz bands is heavily based on directional antennas, primarily with an electrically steerable main lobe (e.g. through a phased array). Due to the directional propagation of these signals, the beams need to track mobile users. For this reason, the beam management is a crucial challenge of current 5G networks operating in the so-called frequency range 2 (FR2), which is the mmWave domain. With RISs, the available coverage area is extended, while beam management methods may still be applicable to the reflection beams. This allows for persisting with mobile network supply even during LOS blockages. Nevertheless, the vehicular mobility still involves more complexity than the so-called fixed wireless access (FWA) like for broadband provisioning of stationary network subscribers. For a proper alignment of the reflection direction, a precise estimation of the channel state information (CSI) may be required and could be supported geometry-based computations utilizing location and map information. In spite of that, also the volatile V2V links may benefit from the reliable and predictable disposability of static RIS installations dedicated to the purpose of enhanced coverage or network availability.",

The mobility in the three-dimensional space allows for a high flexibility and adaptability to varying requirements. For example, in case of a traffic accident, a UAV with a mounted RIS could increase the network capacity at the crash site. This may allow for forwarding comprehensive and detailed situation information and preparation of the rescue forces. In addition, such a UAV may supply a RISenhanced coverage to intercept network load peaks for a cluster of vehicles within a traffic congestion. Thus, dynamic cluster hovering constitutes another challenge of a dynamic coverage enhancement by means of dedicated RIS-UAVs. The dynamic placement of RISs may even accelerate the exploration of locations, which are best suited for a fixed and permanent deployment. In this way, machine learning is applicable not only to optimize the UAV trajectory, but also to derive recommendations for static RIS installations [10, 16] .",

Although the RIS deployment is conducted in an arbitrary manner, works like [10] propose sophisticated solutions for an automated placement.",

This RIS has a fixed downtilt of 30\u00b0a nd aligns horizontally towards the base station by applying an angle of yaw to the sample quadrotor UAV accordingly.

            "text": "During the joint mobility and network simulation, the path loss is evaluated according to the LOS condition and current geometry between transmitter, RIS, and receiver. The underlying deterministic and geometry-based channel and propagation loss models thus provide new path loss values after a position update of any vehicle. Figure 6 depicts an excerpt of a time series of the experienced path loss for three different deployment strategies. Without any RIS (red line), the link performance is quite deteriorated at the predominant absence of LOS conditions. A LOS path is only sporadically available and rather transient due to the high blockage probability. However, the introduction of static RISs (dashed green line) mitigates the path loss by selecting a RIS reflection path in case of NLOS conditions. The additional utilization of a RIS mounted on a UAV mitigates the path loss even more significantly. It leads to a more consistent time response compared to the static RISs and drastically reduces the experienced path loss. With an assumed link budget of 142 dB according to [7] , the RIS-enhanced coverage is able to avoid outages as subsequently analyzed in more detail. In addition, the green and blue areas illustrate the performance gain in terms of the product of path loss and time when utilizing static RISs and a RIS-UAV, respectively. This means, that the size of this area measures the advantage of the associated RIS deployment. As the next step, the overall coverage of a RIS-enhanced base station is statistically analyzed in Figure 7 . The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) illustrates the statistical distribution of the experienced path loss levels for different RIS deployment strategies. Initially, the central base station placement appears questionable when not using any RIS, since it only covers 26 % of the whole track. However, the successive introduction of statically deployed RISs improves the path loss to meet the link budget requirements. A comprehensive coverage is achievable by deploying seven static RISs. Nevertheless, the amount of added RISs can be balanced to cater for a distinct coverage level and path loss distribution. Finally, with additional support by a private RIS mounted on a UAV, the path loss is again significantly improved as also seen before. Albeit such a UAV can only supply a single vehicle or a cluster of vehicles within the same area. According to [11] , the reduced path loss with the UAV-RIS is realizable due to a shorter distance to either the transmitter or receiver. In contrast to varying distances to the static RISs, the UAV is able to mostly keep the mounted RIS at a short distance.",

In spite of that, utilizing static RISs at the turns and the UAV-RIS lead again to improved propagation conditions as evaluated in Figure 8 . Since the predominant LOS condition leads to the same path loss measurements regardless of the RIS strategy as already observed in Figure 6 , Figure 8 focuses on the path loss under NLOS conditions, which are especially predominant at street corners. In general, the introduction of a RIS at a LOS obstructing street corner causes a mitigated path loss. However, a large number of RIS would be required to cover all occurring blockages during the track. In case of the deployment of only some static RISs, the path loss distribution partially still exceeds 140 dB. This is not the case for the UAV-RIS. When utilizing both the static and the UAV-RIS, an overall reduced path loss with a condensed spread limited to a maximum of 120 dB can be In general, the short distance between the vehicles lead to substantially lower path losses than in the base station scenario. However, the successive allocation of static RISs improve the experienced path loss during turns, where the LOS is obstructed by buildings at the street corner. Again, the combined utilization of both the static RISs and the dynamic RIS-UAV leads to notable improvements with a maximum path loss of 120 dB. seen as blue or rightmost violin of Figure 8 . This further reduction can again be explained by the distance dependency of the path loss model: While the UAV-RIS may have a low mean distance to the vehicle, the static RISs on buildings and light poles have a reduced altitude compared to the UAV and thus they may also have an even lower minimum distance when the vehicle is passing by.",

While a static deployment has only a limited range for coverage or path loss enhancement, the RIS-UAV is able to continuously supply reflection occasions dedicated to a single vehicle (or a local cluster of vehicles). Even V2V communications may profit from the RIS technology, since the path loss degrades under NLOS conditions, which are especially present at street corners. The combination of static and dynamic RISs turns out to join the advantages of both deployment strategies: On the one hand, a static RIS is dedicated to a certain street canyon or cross road and is thus able to drastically improve the experienced path loss but only at a limited area. On the other hand, the dynamic RIS, which is intentionally brought close to the vehicle by an UAV, can supply improved coverage anywhere but maybe with some restrictions due to no-fly zones or a constrained minimum altitude and its power consumption. As discussed earlier, future vehicular environments may even utilize reconfigurable intelligent surfaces in an opportunistic manner, whenever the direct paths degrades and a suited RIS mounted on a UAV or bus is intentionally or by chance in reach.",
