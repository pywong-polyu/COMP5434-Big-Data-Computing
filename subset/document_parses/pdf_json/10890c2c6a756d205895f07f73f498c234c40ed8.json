However, some individuals with pre-existing conditions, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients, were excluded from the original anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines developmental trials and, therefore, uncertainties remain, regarding their safety and efficacy in this specific patient population. Nevertheless, international societies have published recommendations for the vaccination of these patients. (5, 6) Regarding efficacy, some studies have shown that IBD patients may have a sub-optimal response to vaccination. Patients taking anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs are considered to have a decreased immune response to other vaccines, such as those administered for influenza and viral hepatitis. (7, 8) Two recent studies have raised a concern that infliximab-treated patients may have lower seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies and lower seroconversion rates either after infection or after the first dose of the vaccine, when compared to vedolizumab-treated patients. (9, 10) Few studies have investigated potential causal relationship between anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration and disease flare-up in IBD patients, although some reassurance can A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Manuscript Doi: 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac010 be found in the extrapolation of data from the administration of other vaccines to IBD patients.

Data from vaccine side-effects in the general population demonstrate that diarrhoea occurs in approximately 10% of the people who receive the vaccine and therefore, may be confused with exacerbation of the disease (2, 3, 16) .",

Nevertheless, almost 9% of the patients rescheduled their infusion. The reason for this was not clarified. A possible explanation could be that this was done as a preventive measure to be able to determine, if any symptoms were due to vaccination or secondary to infusion reactions. Our study has strengths and limitations. This is the largest study presenting data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IBD patients from different geographic locations, treated with different drug regimens. Our results are reassuring, with local and systemic AEs being very similar to those reported in the general population. Moreover, through this study, we were able to evaluate patients' concerns and vaccination adherence. Our major limitation relies on the fact that, being designed to be answered by patients, disease related features and disease activity were self-reported, which may have introduced some reporting bias.
