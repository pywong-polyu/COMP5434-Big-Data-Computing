The unavailability of vaccines for COVID-19 has rendered rapid testing of the population instrumental in order to contain the exponential rise in cases of infection. Shortage of RT-PCR test kits and delays in obtaining test results calls for alternative methods of rapid and reliable diagnosis. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based solution using chest X-rays which can help in rapid triaging of COVID-19 patients. The proposed solution uses image enhancement, image segmentation, and employs a modified stacked ensemble model consisting of four CNN base-learners along with Naive Bayes as meta-learner to classify chest X-rays into three classes viz. COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. An effective pruning strategy as introduced in the proposed framework results in increased model performance, generalizability, and decreased model complexity. We incorporate explainability in our article by using Grad-CAM visualization in order to establish trust in the medical AI system. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple state-ofthe-art GAN architectures and their ability to generate realistic synthetic samples of COVID-19 chest X-rays to deal with limited numbers of training samples. The proposed solution significantly outperforms existing methods, with 98.67% accuracy, 0.98 Kappa score, and F-1 scores of 100, 98, and 98 for COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia classes, respectively, on standard datasets. The proposed solution can be used as one element of patient evaluation along with goldstandard clinical and laboratory testing.",

Airborne transmission of this virus can occur during the medical procedures that result in the generation of aerosols. Fomite transmission may also happen due to touching of surfaces or objects contaminated with this virus [88] . The ease of transmission of the virus along with the high density of the population in many countries forced nations to shut down industries and restrict the movement of people. Countries follow WHO guidelines of rigorous tracking, contact tracing, rapid diagnosis, and immediate isolation of cases. These approaches face roadblocks due to the gradual reopening of economic activities, wherein social distancing norms are getting eased while testing kits are still in short supply. The incubation period of COVID-19 virus is 5-6 days on average and can be as long as 14-21 days in some cases. This makes the whole process of testing more complicated since one can infect many before they become ill [4, 38, 46, 51, 81, 93] . Modelling study by [32] estimates that many cases are asymptotic and up to 44% of transmission may have already happened before the symptoms appear in the infected person. Thereby, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for timely referral of the patients to quarantine, rapid incubation of serious cases in specialized hospitals, and containment of the spread of this disease. [95] have demonstrated that the proportion of nosocomial infection in patients affected with SARS-Cov-2 is 44% highlighting the need for testing facilities to be located outside of hospitals. This helps prevent overburdening of hospital resources and reduces the risk of nosocomial transmission to other patients and healthcare warriors.",

Widespread accessibility to testing is critical; however, the high cost of COVID-19 diagnostic tests is a constraint, especially in countries with private health and testing centres. Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR is the gold standard for COVID-19 testing. Serological testing or antibody testing has also been used in certain settings though it is fairly unreliable. RT-PCR testing is a timeconsuming process and is currently available in limited supply which is leading to a lower number of people getting tested daily [2, 8] . The test may take up to 2 days to produce results [56] . In this duration, if the resources for isolation of suspected patients are unavailable, they may spread the virus to others, resulting in the proliferation of the virus.",

Chest X-rays are less-resource intensive and are associated with lower radiation dose which helps to repeat the test sequentially for monitoring disease progression. The fact that portable devices can be used at the point of care can help minimize the risk of infection while travelling for getting tested. Patients with a high risk of disease progression and associated comorbidities can greatly benefit from this one element of patient evaluation before the final result of RT -PCR is available to the doctors. The triage, allocation, and reallocation of medical resources can be greatly helped by an early warning system which can be achieved through X-ray imaging. It is important to reiterate that chest radiography is not an alternative to clinical testing but an element of patient evaluation that must be corroborated by further tests.",

Considering the success and potential of AI and deep learning in the medical imaging field, many computer scientists are exploring the possibility of automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. However, any deep learning-based solution needs sufficient training data to produce generalizable results. The research community has therefore been pooling a lot of data to enhance the knowledge bank which we use for the purpose of this study. Motivated by the recent progress made by the scientific community, we propose to explore the use of chest X-rays for the detection of COVID-19 in this article. It is understood that in any automated disease discovery framework, it is pertinent to have quality images to train the model. We thereby propose to preprocess the image by using noise attenuation and contrast enhancement along with image transformation methods. To remove unwanted annotations, image segmentation has been employed in this work. Generative adversarial networks have been used to create some realistic artificial images to deal with the need for large training data samples. One of the main challenges in the effective use of any deep learning-based solution in the medical context is the black-box nature of such models due to which medical practitioners do not completely understand the logic of a particular machine prediction. To create trust in the medical fraternity, we propose to use an explainable AI technique called Grad-CAM in this article [74] .",

            "text": "Due to the unexpected rise of coronavirus, there exists a humongous bridge between the existing and the required medical infrastructure, with shortages of essential equipments like PPE kits and lack of qualified doctors and nurses [71] . Over the years, the usage of deep learning methodologies in the medical domain has grown immensely. Evaluation of images by a human expert is tedious, expensive, time-consuming, impractical in many large settings, and introduces inter-observer variability. This has necessitated increased usage of deep learning methods to gain the statistical power for drawing conclusions across a whole patient population bereft of the aforementioned modalities. The development of appropriate algorithms has therefore become a major research focus in medical AI with the potential to deliver objective, reproducible, and scalable approaches to medical imaging tasks. A plethora of computer aided diagnostic systems have come up over the past few years, especially in the detection of multiple chest pathologies using chest X-rays. These work are centred on using convolutional neural networks around the detection of many diseases such as pneumonia, right pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, abnormal mediastinum, pulmonary edema, tuberculosis, etc [5, 6, 36, 70] . Chest radiography can potentially be the first-line imaging modality used for patients with suspected COVID-19 [91] . Chest radiography is a fast and relatively inexpensive imaging modality that is available in many resource-constrained healthcare settings. However, one of the biggest bottlenecks faced is the need for expert radiologists to interpret the radiography images, which may not be available in every setting. Research studies have proven that COVID-19 causes abnormalities that are visible in the chest X-rays and CT images, in the form of ground-glass opacities [41, 43] . The existence of X-Ray laboratories across the globe coupled with reliable computation-based methodologies can potentially ease the pressure on the front-line COVID-19 warriors. [3] evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks including MobileNet-v2, VGG-19, Inception, Xception and Inception ResNet-v2 for the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-rays. The work by [84] proposes a SqueezeNetbased architecture tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayes optimization along with the validation phase. [87] have proposed a deep convolutional neural network design named COVID-Net using a lightweight residual projectionexpansion projection-extension design pattern. The work by [63] proposes a patch-based convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of trainable parameters along with statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the chest X-rays.",

The second stage then finds the presence of COVID-19 caused pneumonia or generic viral pneumonia. The authors used VGG-16 architecture along with transfer learning for this task. The research article [60] aims to build a deep transfer learning-based method for the detection of COVID-19 using Xception which is derived from the standard Inception network architecture. The study from [61] evaluates the effect of five pre-trained CNNs (ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) for the detection of COVID-19 infected patients from chest X-rays. Authors in [94] propose a combination of anomaly detection, shared feature extractor, and confidence prediction modules called the confidence aware anomaly detection (CAAD) model involving the use of EfficientNet [79] . Through progressive resizing of input images and network fine-tuning, the study in [22] involves the use of pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture for the screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays called COVID-ResNet. The study from [1] introduces a deep CNN method called DeTraC for the identification of COVID-19 from chest radiographs. DeTraC stands for Decompose, Transfer, and Compose and involves a class decomposition method to handle irregularities in data. Authors in [53] present a deep learning procedure to identify patients with COVID-19 using chest X-rays. Their approach involves a pre-trained variation of CheXNet [70] for disease identification. The research article from [27] involves a variation of the CheXNet [70] deep learning model to build COVID-CXNet which is then used to detect COVID-19-based pneumonia from chest radiographs. The study from [83] introduces an AI framework for the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-rays which used a standard version of the Inception-V3 network architecture pre-trained on ImageNet [21] dataset. The study also introduces attention maps to validate detected regions of interest in chest radiographs.",

The majority of these studies have solely focused on either proposing a new deep learning architecture which is a slight modification of the existing one or exploring the feasibility of standard stateof-the-art architectures for COVID-19 detection. The proposed framework in this paper makes several new contributions to the existing literature. We explore various hypothesis testing to justify decisions taken during CNN model training for the classification task without holding any assumptions which most studies fail to incorporate into their work. This study additionally uses U-Net-based segmentation and the proposed pruned ensemble framework to reduce computational cost and model complexity. In most of the COVID-19 research articles, the emphasis is fundamentally on improving model performance whereas our article endeavors to improve performance while holding the computational expense to the base. This research also addresses the issue of explainability by incorporating Grad-CAM visualization which instills confidence in the medical practitioners to adopt the model in a clinical setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the novel studies that evaluate the usefulness of GANs for the task of image augmentation to improve the model performance for the detection of COVID-19.",

CLAHE acts as an alternative which divides the image into smaller blocks called ''tiles'' and each of these tiles are histogram equalized to confine the spread of intensity values to that particular region using the general histogram equalization formula: Fig. 2 The proposed pipeline works as follows: the input images (chest X-rays) are passed through the preprocessing stage followed by segmentation. These images are then fed simultaneously into multiple base learners to generate class probabilities which are then passed into the meta-learner to predict final class labels belonging to one of three classes: COVID-19 (C), Normal (N), and Pneumonia (P)",

To prevent this, contrast limiting is applied. If any histogram bin is above the specified contrast limit, those pixels are clipped and distributed uniformly to other bins. The clipLimit threshold for contrast limiting is tested for different values during experimentation and has been empirically set at 2.0 owing to its improved performance as observed through manual inspection of sample images. Post equalization, bilinear interpolation is applied to remove possible artifacts at the tile borders.

Averaging of similar pixels from different images should give p \u00bc p 0 which is the true value of the pixel. But, there is sometimes only one noisy image and no more of its kind. Therefore, instead of seeking similar pixels from different images, we consider a small window in the image and use a fixed sliding window across the image to look for similar patches in the same picture. It is highly probable that a similar patch is found in a small neighbourhood around it. So, we take a pixel and a small window, scan the image for similar windows, average all the windows, and substitute the normal pixel with the average. Although it consumes more time than other blurring techniques, its results are very promising as verified through manual inspection of image samples [49] .

Moreover, there are multiple instances of possible erroneous visual indicators outside the region of interest, ROI such as markings and annotations on the chest X-rays. Thus, it is essential to select relevant image area, in this case, the left and right lung areas as ROI which contain vital information for diagnosis. Detection of ROI reduces the required computational cost by extracting the features from a smaller part of the image. To capture the ROI by excluding insignificant regions of the image, we have deployed a U-Net architecture, which has consistently shown promising results in biomedical image segmentation tasks [72] .",

At each step during downsampling, the number of feature channels is multiplied by 2. Each step in the expansive path involves the upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2 \u00c2 2 convolution that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3 \u00c2 3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU. In the final layer, a 1 \u00c2 1 convolution is used to map every 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes which, in this case, is 3. The network consists of 23 convolutional layers in total.",

By freezing the base-learner weight updates, these models then use the hold-out set train meta as input to predict class scores C i . These class scores C i are then pushed onto the stack S at each iteration. Post training of all base-learners and generation of stack S, each meta-learner m i belonging to the set of all metalearners M is trained using the stack S as input to make the final output label predictions. The meta-learner uses the set of predictions from base-learners and conditionally weighs each prediction, potentially resulting in better performance [82] . The meta-learner models are thus effectively trained on this holdout set train meta to avoid overfitting.

After finalizing the meta-learner META best and starting with all the N base-learners, we use a pruning approach as shown Algorithm 1 to remove redundant base-learners resulting in increased model performance, generalizability, and decreased model complexity. We first iterate through the set of base-learners b i , by removing the class scores C i corresponding to b i from the stack S. We then evaluate the performance of the meta-learner on the test data using the updated stack S and push the obtained accuracy to stack A. Argmax function is used to obtain the model Remove b i , whose removal corresponds to the best performance. If the removal of Remove b i leads to similar or better performance, we update the best accuracy ACC best and subsequently remove the base-learner from the set of all baselearners B. In case of identical performance between more than one base-learner, we break the tie by removing the base-learner with a higher model complexity to ensure faster model deployment. At the end of each removal cycle, if removing any particular base-learner results in a similar or better performance, we repeat this process again on the updated set B now without the redundant base-learner. This is repeated until the outer while loop returns a 'null' value, signifying that the removal of any more base-learners will not result in improved performance. Thus, we are able to prune the set of all base-learners to the selected few for better generalizability and also lower ensemble model complexity for faster real-time model deployment.",
