Many companies around the world are currently making efforts to develop the vaccine to combat COVID-19. This review outlines key strategies for generating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, along with the mechanism of action, advantages, and potential limitations of each vaccine.

            "text": "From the beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) , the world faced a major health crisis. After months of fighting the disease, medical supplies are often scarce, hospitals are overwhelmed, and medical staff are exhausted. The high prevalence and severe clinical impact of COVID-19 have forced governments around the world to take strict measures, including quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, to prevent the spread of the virus and to tackle pandemic [1] . However, the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 is still high, especially because of the constant mutations in the viral structure of SARS-CoV-2. The rate of mortality and severity of COVID-19 is higher in elderly persons, and patients with immunodeficiency diseases, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [2] . As of 20th December 2021, COVID-19 has already caused 273,900,334 confirmed cases globally, including 5,351,812 deaths, reported to WHO [3] . Given the urgent need to manage and treat COVID-19 patients, a variety of treatment options from antiviral agents, repurposed drugs, and protease inhibitors to convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trials [4] . Nevertheless, no licensed and effective treatment for this disease has been found. In the challenging situation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of approved therapeutic protocol, it seems vaccination can be the best approach to controlling the disease. Generally, vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions that modern medicine offers to prevent the large-scale spread of infectious diseases economically [5] . The impact of scientific advances is quite evident in COVID-19 vaccine development, as in this case the common required time for the effective vaccine has been reduced from more than a decade to about a year. However, leverage from what has been learned from prior infectious disease outbreaks; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), along with research from recent years characterizing next-generation and high-tech vaccine platforms helped to accelerate the process and shorten the development timeline [6] .",

Of these, at least six COVID-19 vaccine trials have reported very promising provisional results and a total of 8,387,658,165 vaccine doses have been administered [7] . In this context, a variety of platform technologies have been employed by various research groups to make notable advances in developing vaccines in a short time. These vaccine platforms are ranging from virus-based (live attenuated and inactivated) and protein-based (subunit and virus-like particle) to novel gene-based and nano-based strategies. In this review, the principles and design considerations in COVID-19 vaccine development, including antigen selection, the routes and regimens of vaccination, and various vaccine platforms are discussed. We address the importance of nanotechnology to design COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Finally, we discuss advantages, disadvantages, and challenges regarding each COVID-19 vaccine platform.",

Because vaccination is probably the most effective way to overcome the pandemic, attempts to develop safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been ignited in several countries. Before using a vaccine in a larger population, its safety and efficacy must be fully determined. Ineffective vaccines not only cannot protect against the virus but can also cause diseases through antibodydependent boosting or other mechanisms [8] . Before vaccine development, the collection of important information, including target antigen detection, immunization pathway, vaccine platform, correlated-immune protection, animal models, scalability, production capability, outbreak estimating, and target population must be clearly defined [9] . To date, more than 200 candidates for the COVID-19 vaccine are being developed in various stages of trials and the number is continuing to grow [10] . This diversity of vaccine candidates faces a wide range of challenges from producing, manufacturing, storing to injecting them into vulnerable individuals in the short term. Choosing the right type of vaccine, carrier or vector, adjuvant, excipients, dosage form, and route of administration can be a solution to overcome these challenges and also have a direct impact on the effectiveness of the vaccine against COVID-19 [10] .",

However, unlike the S protein, M and E proteins have never been explored as vaccine targets alone against COVID-19 due to their poorly immunogenic for humoral responses [15] . Because of the uncertainly role of these non-neutralizing antibodies, as well as inadequately neutralizing antibodies in antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) disease, the addition of other structural (N) and/or non-structural proteins as vaccine antigens may contribute to a more balanced response relating humoral and T cell-mediated immunity [15] . The inclusion of highly expressed proteins (e.g., N protein) or highly conserved functional proteins that have a key role in the life cycle of virus (e.g., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) in a vaccine design can ensure that all emerging variant strains are targeted.",

In addition, milder patients of COVID-19 have more number tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) in the respiratory tract than patients with severe patients [14, 16] . Evidence shows that the induction of such lung TRM cells depends on the vaccination route. The most common parenteral routes include subcutaneous (SC), intradermal (ID), and intramuscular (IM); while common mucosal routes are non-invasive oral and nasal.

The principles of this method include injecting the inactivated virus into the host, which induces an immune response and then promotes a strong immunity against the virus. In a pandemic scenario, inactivated viruses can be produced and scaled up quickly using well-established infrastructure and techniques ( Fig. 2 ) [14] . Contrasting their live attenuated counterparts, inactivated viral vaccines have few safety issues, and they convey a large range of native viral antigens, including surface antigens with conserved epitope conformations that can stimulate conformation-dependent responses to antibodies [24] . Because completely inactive viruses do not replicate, adjuvants and repeated administration are needed to stimulate the immune system and the full efficiency of these vaccines. Additionally, inactivated viral vaccines are poor inducers of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that are likely to be needed for a successful COVID-19 vaccine, as are protein subunit vaccines. Such safety issues can be avoided by the use of TH1 cellskewing modified alum or other adjuvants like CpG [25] .

To achieve scaling up, a suspension expression system cultured in a bioreactor may be used to replace the adherent cells grown in cell stacks [10] . The size of the filter pores is important, if the size of the pores of the chosen filter is small, virus particles will stick to the cell membrane, cell debris, and/or impurities of the host cell, and if the selected filter is large pore size, it will lead to insufficient removal of process-related impurities. Successful impurity removal, high recovery efficiency maintenance, and cost reduction for each dose depend on the optimization of the downstream process such as centrifugation, DNA digestion, size exclusion chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and tangential flow filtration methods [28] . Removal of residual host cell DNA and host cell proteins is another dilemma of the suspension virus construction process because DNA and proteins may adhere tightly to viral particles and be destroyed by chromatographic processes [28] .

Therefore, these vaccines often require not only an adjuvant in the formulation but also repeated administration to establish immune memory. Besides, protein vaccines are not appropriate for respiratory mucosal vaccination. Similar to inactivated viral vaccines, unmodified alum as an adjuvant inhibits the immune response that is undesirable for host defense and may play a role in ADE of disease [29] .

These multimeric structures can directly stimulate the immune system via imitating the 3D structure of native viruses. VLPs are good options for vaccine production due to the lack of infectious genetic material as well as functional proteins for virus entry. Compared to attenuated viruses, Viruslike particles are safer and more effective and have higher immunogenicity. Moreover, VLPs have outstanding adjuvant characteristics, and are able to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. Considering these features, several commercial vaccines have been developed based on the VLPs platform [14] . In the case of coronaviruses, VLPs are formed when the viral proteins (S, E, and M with or without N) are co-expressed in eukaryotic producing cells. This results in active budding from the producer cells of VLPs that are structurally similar to the infectious virus but are non-infectious due to the lack of a viral genome. VLPs are capable to bind and enter into cells presenting ACE2 by the S protein on their surface in the same way as the parent virus [30] . Contrasting subunit vaccines, the S protein array on the VLPs surface crosslinks to the receptor of B cells and activates these cells directly, but VLPs often usually require an adjuvant and multiple doses, like inactivated and subunit viral vaccines. Nevertheless, the technology of VLPs is well established, the biology and safety of coronavirus VLPs are well known, and their large-scale construction is relatively simple [31] .",

            "text": "Compared to other vaccine approaches, the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are more attractive due to their low cost and rapid manufacturing process. The use of nanotechnology boosts the delivery of mRNA vaccines via the ID or IM route. In this light, antigen-encoding mRNA that coated with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), as a stable lipid bilayer, can be effectively transferred in vivo into the host cells, which is an advantage over recombinant protein subunit vaccine platform [8] . After uptake into cells, mRNA prompts the expression of viral antigen in target cells, which in turn induces the adaptive immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies against the target antigen (Fig. 2) . The mRNA vaccines are non-infectious and are synthesized without microbial molecules by in vitro transcription. These beneficial properties distinguish mRNA vaccines in terms of protection, effectiveness, and anti-vector immunity issues from live attenuated viral vaccines, inactivated viral vaccines, recombinant viralvectored vaccines, and protein subunit vaccines. Therefore, these features enable rapid and inexpensive manufacturing and repeat vaccination. Another advantage of the RNA vaccine platform is likely induction of protective immunity by using a lower dose because, in self-replicating RNA vaccines, more vaccine antigen is expressed per cell [26] . However, there are concerns regarding the instability of delivering naked RNA, along with the size of the delivered molecules [32, 33] . RNA vaccines may also be associated with adverse effects, considering their strong immune capacity. RNA vaccines can lead to autoimmune disorders through the induction of the development of type I IFNs. In addition, because RNA vaccines contain a non-human polynucleotide, an unwanted immune response may be triggered, leading to extreme immune reactions and adverse effects [20] .",

This has led to the development of artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) that by introducing the pathogen-associated antigen to the adaptive immune cells contribute to the antiviral immune response. aAPCs bypass the need to harvest patient dendritic cells. These vaccines are lentivirally modified APCs that express the proteins of the virus and subsequently activate T cells and induce an immune response against the virus [43] .

These types of NPs can improve vaccine performance, immunization, and targeted delivery. VLNPs play a role with greater vaccine efficacy, rapid proteolytic inhibition of antigens, increased antigen uptake, antigen release control, and non-toxicity [61] . These NPs are composed of capsids, which are structural and non-infectious proteins of viruses, and have been modified for use in nanotechnology. VLNPs can be produced from productive infections of host material or by recombinant protein expression and self-assembly [62] . One of the main properties of VLNPs is that they can contain additional proteins synthesized from multiple antigens [63, 64] and have a protective function against viruses and heterologous antigens [65] . VLNPs can accommodate the additional proteins expression or the endogenous expression of multiple antigens as carriers on their surface [66] . Also, these NPs with high surface energy cause severe adhesion of biological molecules. These actions are similar to the effect of the virus on stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies for eliminating the infection [67, 68] . Thus, VLNPs have special value in vaccine production. Peptide-based NPs are also being studied in the vaccine to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 [69] . Antibody production and inhibition of coronavirus function have been observed in self-assembled peptide NPs using the SARS-CoV-1 S protein [69] . In a study on VLNPs in mice, the MERS-CoV S protein NPs vaccine with the adjuvant combination of the matrix protein (M1) shown efficacy in inhibiting the MERS-CoV replication in the lungs of mice. The high titer of neutralizing antibody against S protein indicates a protective state against the virus in mice [70] . Thus, designed VLNPs with the S protein can be effective not only against the MERS-CoV but also against the SARS-CoV-2 because both viruses use the same mechanism of entry into host cells and cause infection [71] .",

Therefore, conjugated AuNPs with a type of coronavirus called transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been used to assess immunity in mice and rabbits [73] . The results showed that immunization against TGEV was performed by significantly increasing the antibody titer, increasing the concentration of IFN-\u03b3, tenfold expansion of T cells, and macrophage respiratory activity. The researchers also developed the anti-MERS-CoV vaccine by combining ferritin-based NP assembly mediated by RNA. They concluded that CD4 + T cell expression is induced and eventually led to IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 expression. Therefore, gold-based NPs can be a good option for preparing a vaccine against coronavirus [74] . In one study in SARS-CoVinfected mice, AuNPs and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists with recombinant S protein were evaluated [75] .

Finally, NPs play an essential role in antigen delivery as antigen carriers due to their efficient cell targeting and controlled release properties [92] . However, NPs-based vaccines have some limitations. One of the major limitations of the use of NPs in the design of the vaccines is their cellular toxicity and the need for an adjuvant to make the vaccine more effective [93] . Also, the size, shape, charge, and surface area of NPs have a significant effect on vaccine performance [93, 94] . Other disadvantages of the coronavirus NPs-based vaccines include the need for multiple doses, delayed immune response, and side effects [95] .",

A metaanalysis study investigated 87 publications with safety data from clinical trials and post-authorization researches of 19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on 6 different platforms [98] . Obtained results from this analysis showed that inactivated vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, and DNA vaccines have significantly lower rates of local and systemic reactions compared with RNA vaccines, non-replicating vector vaccines, and granular vaccines. Pain at the injection site was the most frequent solicited local reaction, and fatigue and headache were the most frequent systemic reactions. The frequency of reported serious vaccine-related side effects was lower than 0.1% and balanced between recipients [98] . In a meta-analysis study from 25 randomized clinical trials, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 vaccines were investigated to better assess their efficacy and adverse effects [99] . The study included 58,889 cases and 46,638 controls who received the COVID-19 vaccine or a placebo, respectively. The highest efficacy was related to adenovirus-vectored and mRNA-based COVID19 vaccines after the first and second doses. The mRNA-based vaccines indicated higher adverse effects in reactogenicity, including site pain, swelling, redness, fever, headache, fatigue, induration, vomiting, myalgia, chills, and pruritus. Severe harmful side effects such as anaphylactic shock and allergic reactions were not significant for these vaccines. Compared to other vaccines, adenovirus vector vaccines are associated with increased diarrhea and arthralgia. As well, one case of anaphylactic shock was reported for this vaccine [99] . Various cases of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis were reported as rare events of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, leading to the temporary discontinuation of the vaccine's use in several countries and the introduction of age-specific rollout in other countries/regions vaccination. Although, so far, the data is too limited and anecdotal to provide clear causal evidence [100] . In like manner, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine was temporarily suspended by the FDA in April 2021, because many people showed rare blood-related problems due to thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome, causing cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [99] .",

From the earliest days of the recent pandemic, researchers have focused on finding a way to treat, prevent, and overcome COVID-19 using a variety of computational and experimental techniques. In this situation, along with trying to find effective treatments for COVID-19, vaccination is the best way to control the disease. In the light of coronaVac development, different approaches from nucleic acids and protein subunits to virus-like nanoparticles have been used. None of the designed COVID-19 vaccines provide 100% protection. This is why, even with vaccination, there is a chance of infection, but it is probably asymptomatic or very mild, and the chances of serious illness and death are actually very low. In cases of pandemics such as COVID-19, in addition to the common criteria for successful vaccine development, including safety, efficacy, and duration of safety, rapid manufacturing of a vaccine with a very high production capacity, distributing, and administering the vaccine to the vulnerable population are other important challenges. Another bottleneck in the process of vaccine development against COVID-19 is constant mutational changes of the SARS-CoV-2 structure. At the time of writing, Lambda variant SARS-CoV-2 has emerged with increased infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies elucidate by COVID-19 vaccines. Hence, despite the increasing speed of immunization against COVID-19 worldwide, the immune escape variant has raised concerns about the efficacy of the vaccine. Therefore, universities and companies involved with the development of new vaccines should be accompanied by strict genomic and proteomic monitoring to rapidly identify mutations and analyze their effects on the transmission rate, severity of pathogenicity, and immune escape for better COVID-19 vaccine development and pandemic management.",
