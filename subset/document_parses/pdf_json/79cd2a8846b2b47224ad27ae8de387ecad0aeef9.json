In many parts of the world, in both cities and rural areas, people have been forced to stay home weeks. They have only been allowed to leave home for fundamental needs such as food and health needs, and most started to work from home. In this period, very few people, including essential workers, had to leave their homes. Avoiding social contact is proven to be the best method to reduce the spread of the novel Coronavirus. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, people are adapting their behavior to this new reality, and it may change the type of public events people perform and how people go to these activities. Consumer behaviors have been altered during the pandemic. While people try to avoid gatherings, they also stayed away from mass transport modes and turned to private modes of transportation more --private cars, private taxis and bike-sharing systems; even walking became more popular. In this study, we attempt to analyze how the use of bicycling has changed --pre-and post-pandemic --using open data sources and investigating how socio-economics characteristics affect this change. The results showed that average income, average education level, and total population are the most crucial variables for the Pandemic to Transition period and the Transition to the Normalization period.",

At this point, people might prefer alternative travel modes that comply with social distancing guidelines (6) . Certain features of transportation methodology will undergo augmentation, altering what we approach as norms to differ. The majority will prefer to ride a personal car, motorcycle, or bike in such cases. Because bikes are the most affordable option while providing the highest safety regarding social distancing measures due to less interaction with people, bike usage will be preferred by many people as an alternative to public transportation. This protects them from possible contamination and reassures an opinion of safety amongst people. Walking to nearby places is also a valid option; despite that, this might not apply safely to specific regions. For instance, walking in a more closed-in area in a crowded city or neighborhood still carries a great deal of risk of contamination, however in a more deserted community, walking should be the most efficient and safe way of travel.",

Another research study revealed that usage of bicycle-sharing systems in Beijing (China) increased by 150% from February 10th to March 4th, 2020 (7) . Furthermore, short-distance riding increased as well as long-distance travel increased. According to some bike-sharing companies' data, the share of long-distance cycling usage (more than 3 km) increased nearly twice in comparison to ridership during the same period of last year (8) . In England, some bike stores report facing increased demand. Manager of Broadribb Cycles says that sales increased from around 20 -30 bikes a day to 50 bikes a day (9) . Furthermore, cycling usage rate has seen a 200% increase, while car use roughly decreases by 40% in Manchester, England (10) .",

For example, a study about New York City's Citibike usage during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the bike-sharing system is much more resilient than urban transportation systems to disruptive events. The results indicated a 70% bike ridership drop versus 90% transit ridership drop, respectively. It also found that the average duration of Citibike travels significantly increased during the pandemic (11) . Another study, a survey performed to inquire about behavioral changes in terms of bike usage in Sydney, Australia, revealed an increase in the willingness of bike usage for both hygiene and enjoyment reasons (12) . In a Budapest, Hungary, case, modal share change during the COVID-19 pandemic period investigated. That study found that there are positive trends in the growing popularity of cycling as the share of public transport decreases (13) . These recently published studies in the literature illustrate the importance of cycling and quantify the resilient nature of cycling as well as its preference over traditional public transit modes. Such a dramatic increase in cycling captured the attention of some state governments. For instance, Greater Manchester (England) announced that emergency funds will be allocated to promote walking and cycling to build a more resilient and stronger region, where the data shows that cycling increased 42% in Greater Manchester compared to the pre-lockdown period (14; 15) .",

I am not just talking about road cyclists, but also people on cruiser bikes, mountain bikes, etc. It is actually good to see so many people out riding with their kids, spouses, etc.\" (16) . Park, Kim and Lee (17) is another study, which emphasizes the health impacts of bicycle use during the COVID-19. Besides the physical health concerns, also the psychological health impacts of bike use during the COVID-19 is also inquired. Additionally, a difference in differences (DID) analysis is performed in Seoul, South Korea, for pre-and post-strict social distancing periods. The results show that average bike-sharing system usage among commuters and weekend users increased during social distancing period of 2020 (17) . In an Oslo, Norway case, it is found that the recreational activities increased and cyclists appeared on trailways and in green areas much more than before the COVID-19 pandemic period (18) .",

This study aims to reveal the relationship between bicycle usage and socioeconomic factors by comparing data collected before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses continuously collected bicycle count data from fixed locations in the greater Denver metropolitan area before and after the pandemic to quantify the change in non-motorized traffic volumes. Therefore, bicycle catchment distances are taken as the radius by centering four bike count stations (19) , and the socioeconomic data within these catchment areas are collected (20) .

Even though the education level has a negative correlation during Normalization, the situation is the opposite for the transition period that is the bicycle usage rate in the transition period increases in parallel with the education level. Meaning that educated people are more sensitive about the pandemic, and they avoid crowded places where the risk of the rate of contamination is higher Figure 6 shows that there is a general decrease in bicycle usage as the age increases except for the normalization period.

Table 2 summarizes the proportion of variance explained matrices of the PLSR for Pre-Pandemic-to-Pandemic, Pandemic-to-Transition, and Transition-to-Normalization period, respectively. For all three periods, the 3rd latent factor has the least X variance value. This latent factor can also make the prediction model to overfit. A well-fitting model would have similar and high X and Y variance values. Additionally, as the Y variance value increases, for a new sample of dependent values, the latent factor becomes more powerful in terms of explaining the variation. The more a latent factor can explain the variance of independent variables, the observed values of the set of Male/Female Ratio independent variables are reflected even better. Latent factor 1, for all three periods, have the highest X variance and Y variance and, therefore, is more powerful for the developed model. According to the adjusted R-square values, the Transition-to-Normalization period is the best-fitted period for this model, and the Pre-Pandemic-to-Pandemic period is the worst-fitted period for this model.

Three different study periods were created to understand the shift from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic levels. A machine learning tool, PLSR, was deployed to explain the underlying contributing factors to bikedemand. Initial results showed that average income, average education level, and total population are the most crucial variables for the Pandemic-to-Transition period and the Transition-to-Normalization period. Average income and average education level parameters have a positive influence on the dependent variable, whereas the total population variable has a negative impact. This analysis has also shown the location-based impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bicycle demand. While some stations experience an increased demand during the selected periods, others saw a decrease in bicycle usage.",

It will investigate the locationbased impact on commuting needs and the long-term impacts of the virus as opposed to the limited duration used in this study.",
