The recognition of macro domains with various ligands is important for a variety of biological functions involved in NAD metabolism, including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, maintenance of genomic stability, and response to viral infection. Nevertheless, how the macro domain binds to moieties with such structural obstacles using a simple cleft remains a puzzle. We systematically investigated the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) macro domain for its ligand selectivity and binding properties by structural and biophysical approaches. Of interest, NAD, which is considered not to interact with macro domains, was co-crystallized with the MERS-CoV macro domain. Further studies at physiological temperature revealed that NAD has similar binding ability with ADPR because of the accommodation of the thermal-tunable binding pocket. This study provides the biochemical and structural bases of the detailed ligandbinding mode of the MERS-CoV macro domain. In addition, our observation of enhanced binding affinity of the MERS-CoV macro domain to NAD at physiological temperature highlights the need for further study to reveal the biological functions.",

The cellular pool of free NAD is balanced between synthesis and degradation. The metabolic product, nicotinic acid mononucleotide, can be recycled for NAD synthesis. Adenine nucleotides, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP), are the side products of the NAD metabolism pathway 2 . NAD-consuming enzymes such as poly-ADP-ribosyl polymerases, also called Diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTDs), use NAD as a group donor. ARTDs produce PAR by polymerizing the ADPR moieties and releasing the nicotinamide groups from NAD. PAR, as one of NAD metabolites, constructs the backbone of ADP-ribosylation, a kind of reversible chemical modification into protein 3 , DNA 4 , and RNA 5 .",

            "text": "ADP-ribosylation has been suspected of having a dual proantiviral role in regulating the virulence of diverse viral families. Several viruses requiring ARTD activity for efficient replication have been discovered by using an ARTD1 inhibitor such as vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus, JC virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, activation of ADP-ribosylation by viral infection often resulted in apoptosis of the host cell, considered a host immune defense [10] [11] [12] . The first discovered antiviral ADP-ribosylation enzyme was ARTD13, which was found to bind viral RNA, inhibit viral replication, induce transcription of viral defensing interferons, activate proteasome degradation, and promote apoptosis 10, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Also, the antiviral effects of mono-ADP-ribosylation enzymes have been reported 17 . By transcriptome and protein interactome analyses, several mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, diphtheria toxinlike enzymes (ARTD 10, 12, 14) were also found to inhibit viral replication 18, 19 . Positive feedback loops of the expression of these three ARTDs are activated by interferons (IFNs) during infection with the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) 18, 20 . Human sirtuins are NAD-dependent deacylases/mono-ADP ribosyltransferases. By siRNA knockdown and sirtuins inhibitors, all sirtuins were found to have broad-range antiviral properties for both DNA and RNA viruses 21 . In addition, ARTD11 was found upregulated after virus infection and thus promoted IFN-I antiviral response by mono-ADP-ribosylating ubiquitin E3 ligase 22 . So viruses might have developed mechanisms to regulate the ADP-ribosylation-related conflict between viral replication and host immunity.",

Attention to the function of the macro domain in viral replication has been growing. The ADPR binding and ADPR hydrolase activities of the macro domain from various viruses have been investigated with viral replication 5, 25, 26 . In addition, increasing interest has been given to NAD metabolism during immune responses, thereby indicating that its modulation is relevant to host-pathogen interactions 27, 28 . To what extent viral macro domains interfere in the host immunity by fluctuating the balance of the pool of NAD metabolites by interactions with its ligands still needs to be investigated 10, 17, 24, 29 .",

Proteins in ORF1a are related to viral replication of MERS-CoV, and polymorphism in ORF1a is considered to influence cross-host transmission and evolution of this virus 31 . The MERS-CoV macro domain is considered to possess the enzyme activity of ADPR-1\"monophosphatase 33, 34 , similar to several viral macro domains 35, 36 . Some studies indicated that the viral macro domains could also catalyze ADPR modifications, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV229E), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and VEEV 25, [37] [38] [39] . Mutagenesis analyses of several viral macro domains suggested the role of viral defense toward host cellular immunity because the mutated macro domain reduced viral titers in cultured host cells [39] [40] [41] [42] . In addition, the N1040A mutation of the nsp3 macro domain from SARS-CoV and HCoV229E showed increased sensitivity of antiviral IFN from host cells 43 . However, the critical piece of the puzzle for the molecular function of viral macro domains is still missing.",

The snapshot of the ADPR-complex structure threw light on the interaction between the MERS-CoV macro domain and single free ADPR. However, how the MERS-CoV macro domain interacts with NAD metabolites and ADPR moieties buried inside PAR is still unclear. In addition, some viral macro domains possess RNA-binding ability 25, 47 . The existence of NAD-capping RNA has been discovered in prokaryotes, yeast, and eukaryotes [48] [49] [50] [51] .

The MERS-CoV macro domain showed enhanced thermal stability, as evidenced by the shift of melting temperature (Tm) from 41.5\u00b0C for the apo form to 49.0, 46.5, 43.0, 44.5, and 42.5\u00b0C, on binding with 100-fold concentrations of ADPR, NAD, ATP, ADP, and AMP, respectively (Fig. 1B) . The thermal shifts with the increasing concentrations of NAD metabolites were also tested ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). In addition, the thermal melting profiles of the MERS-CoV macro domain monitored at 220 nm using circular dichroism (CD) were greatly affected by the presence of these NAD metabolites. The melting temperature of the MERS-CoV macro domain (Tm \u223c42\u00b0C) was shifted around 1-7\u00b0C (Fig. 1C) .

Of note, some macro domains were investigated for interactions with ADPR, ATP, ADP, or AMP but not NAD 29, 45, 54, 55 . To clarify the role of certain residues in ligand recognition, protein crystals of the MERS-CoV macro domain were soaked with NAD, ATP, ADP, and AMP for detailed observation (Supplementary Fig. S3 ) and refined to a resolution of 1.68 \u00c5, 2.47 \u00c5, 1.50 \u00c5, and 1.71 \u00c5, respectively ( Table 2 ). The crystal structures of protein complexes were almost identical, but two main structural divergences appeared between two loops (distinguished loop 1, \u03b23-\u03b12 ( 43 HGGGI 47 ) and distinguished loop 2, \u03b26-\u03b15 ( 126 SAGIF 130 )) of the ligand-binding sites ( Fig. 2A) . As expected, these two loops presented a closer conformation of binding pocket than other metabolites upon ADPR binding. The binding pocket upon NAD or ATP binding was more like an open state due to an extra nicotinamide or a phosphate group replacement of the distal ribose. However, the ADP-bound macro domain presented a closed state like the ADPR-bound form, and the AMP-bound form was an open state (Fig. 2B) .

The similarity between the coordination of ADPR and NAD inside the MERS-CoV macro domain binding pocket extended to the pyrophosphate group (Fig. 3A, B ). In the ADPR complex, residues at region3, A36, N38, and H43, formed hydrophobic interactions with the distal ribose of ADPR. Therefore, the side-chain amide of N38 at region3 in the NAD complex connected to the 3\u2033hydroxyl group of NAD instead. Furthermore, the distal ribose of ADPR configured a T-shaped stacking with F130. Moreover, the distal ribose of NAD was slightly anchored, and the nicotinamide pointed out of the binding pocket ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary  Fig. S3B ). Because of the lack of distal ribose, ATP, ADP, and AMP did not connect with residues, including N38, K42, H43, G44, and G45 ( Fig. 3C-E) .",

To describe the open and closed conformations of the binding pocket, we measured the distance between distinguished loops 1 and 2 (distance between the backbone amide nitrogen of G46 and C\u03b4 of I129). The distances for the ADPR-complex and ADP-complex forms as a closed state were 3.58 \u00c5 and 4.13 \u00c5, respectively. However, NAD-complex, ATPcomplex, and AMP-complex forms presented open pockets with a distance of 7.40 \u00c5, 6.53 \u00c5, and 7.43 \u00c5, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Although these three molecules all make a macro domain present an open state, the AMP-complex had a distinct loop2 conformation, and more water molecules occupied on the binding pocket from ATP and NAD bound forms. 56 was used as an initial reference for the assignment after NAD metabolite titration. Because a slow-exchange effect indicating high-affinity binding was immediately detected upon ADPR titration ( Supplementary  Fig. S6A ), the triple resonance backbone assignment of the ADPR-complex MERS-CoV macro domain was completed to further confirm this. Otherwise, perturbations of ATP, ADP, and AMP upon the MERS-CoV macro domain were in fast-exchange and could be traced by peak migration. Surprisingly, only a few residues presented CSPs upon NAD titration toward the MERS-CoV macro domain ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The chemical shift changes were then mapped onto the surface of corresponding structures. Residues of the MERS-CoV macro domain near the adenine group exhibited CSPs in all the complex structures ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ). Except for NAD, the residues surrounding the binding site presenting significant CSPs were consistent with the observation in crystal structures (Fig. 4A) . ITC measurements confirmed a 1:1 stoichiometry of protein and ligand binding. The NMR titration data show a slow-exchange process between apo and the ADPR-bound macro domain ( Supplementary Fig. S6A) , with a relatively strong dissociation constant Kd (3.67 \u00b1 2.03 \u03bcM) obtained by ITC measurement. At 298 K, the thermodynamic profile of ADPR binding, with favorable enthalpy and unfavorable entropy, suggested the formation of a complex via hydrogen bonds mainly and a loss of conformational freedom associated with binding 46 . However, the bindings of other NAD metabolites showed less favorable enthalpy and opposite entropy contribution, resulting in a 30-fold to \u2265100-fold decrease in the binding constant (Table 3: indicates that NAD exhibits the weakest interaction among the five NAD metabolites at 298 K. The ITC results of the five NAD metabolites were consistent with the observation by NMR (Supplementary Fig. S7 ).",

Because we observed the unexpected phenomenon of little binding for NAD in the isothermal experiments at 298 K (both NMR and ITC methods). We then checked the effect of continuous temperature change on protein by CD. The sigmoidal thermal denaturation profiles of the macro domain with various NAD metabolites reflected a cooperative protein unfolding pathway. In the presence of AMP, ADP, and ATP, the MERS-CoV macro domain showed a slight loss of CD signal before reaching the Tm value, which suggests a compact losing but still folding structure (Fig. 1C) , whereas the binding of ADPR seemed to stabilize the MERS-CoV macro domain through a conformational change because of a flat CD signal line before the Tm value (Fig. 1C, green) . The MERS-CoV macro domain showed a significant Tm increase in the presence of NAD (Fig. 1B, C) ; however, the curve of the macro domain with NAD presented a gentle slope but similar Tm values as the protein with ADPR (Fig. 1C) . This phenomenon indicated that the increase in temperature might enhance the binding affinity of NAD due to a conformational change of the MERS-CoV macro domain (Fig. 4) .",

            "text": "To test the hypothesis, NMR CSP and ITC experiments performed at 298 K were re-executed at physiological human body temperature (308 K). The results showed almost no chemical shift perturbation of the macro domain with the addition of AMP or ADP, and a fast-exchange on the NMR timescale of the protein with ATP titration ( Supplementary  Fig. S6B ). The largest CSPs occurred, while undergoing chemical exchange between the free and ADPR-bound MERS-CoV macro domains, in the slow exchange regime at 308 K. Strikingly, the macro domain titrated with NAD showed a similar CSP pattern as ADPR in a slow-exchange NMR timescale at 308 K ( Supplementary Fig. S7B ), which indicates that the binding behavior of NAD is as strong as ADPR. In other words, the MERS-CoV macro domain is bound to both ADPR and NAD well at physiological temperature. ITC analyses also provided consistent evidence for the binding ability of these metabolites toward the MERS-CoV macro domain at physiological temperature ( Supplementary Fig. S8 S8B ). Moreover, this fact emphasizes the key role of distal ribose for recognizing and binding both ADPR and NAD. At 308 K, the MERS-CoV macro domain showed significant chemical shift changes and attenuated peaks of residues at the ligand-binding cleft on titrating with ADPR or NAD (Fig. 5) . The cross-peaks of some residues for three regions around the binding site were then further investigated (region 1: G19 and D20; region 2: G44, A127, and G131; and region 3: V94) ( Supplementary  Fig. S5 ). G44 was the most sensitive residue toward ADPR titration (Fig. 5A ). Sigmoid plots were fitted from the function of the relative decrease in peak intensity and the ADPR concentration, thus indicating an induced-fit binding mode of the macro domain for ADPR. On ITC measurement at 308 K, the thermodynamic profiles of the MERS-CoV macro domain upon ADPR titration showed a slight decrease in affinity (~26.92 \u03bcM) with lower favorable enthalpy (\u221218.05 \u00b1 18.45 KJ/mol) and favorable entropy (\u22129.30 \u00b1 17.61 J/mol K) contribution, comparing with the ADPR titration at 298 K. The ADPR titration results might reflect a dynamic system at 308 K. Intuitively, much less hydrogen bonding network existed at higher temperatures, although the ADPR-complexed protein persisted in the cooperatively folded state. Unexpectedly, the thermodynamic profiles of NAD showed a similar disassociation constant (~54.34 \u03bcM) but less favorable enthalpy (\u22122.73 \u00b1 3.66 KJ/mol) and more favorable entropy (\u221222.59 \u00b1 3.77 J/mol K) contribution as compared with ADPR ( Table 3 ). Peaks of these residues were consistently perturbed during the addition of ATP at 308 K. Of note, the direction of chemical shift changes of G44 and G131, located in region 2, changed during the ATP titration (Fig. 5A) , thus indicating a two-step binding for the accommodation of the terminal \u03b3-phosphate group.",

The de-mono-ADP-ribosylation (de-MAR) activity of the chikungunya virus, Hepatitis E virus, and SARS-CoV-1 has been estimated before 25, 37, 38 . Whether temperature influencing the MERS-CoV macro domain enzyme function, the de-MAR activity was examined at room temperature (298 K) and human body temperature (308 K). Various amounts of MERS-CoV macro domain (from 2.5 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM) were incubated with autoMARylated human ARTD10 catalytic domain (HsARTD10-CatD) at different temperature. The result showed that the mono-ADP-ribosylation (MAR) signals were decreased with the increase of the macro domain (Fig. 6A, B) . And there was a more significant decrease of the MAR signals at 308 K rather than 298 K. Whether NAD or ADPR inhibited the deMAR function via competitive mode, the deMAR reactions were incubated with NAD or ADPR with various concentration (0.5-2.0 mM) (Fig. 6C, D) . While the NAD was presenting, the MAR signals reduced more, and the signal decreases were more dramatic at 308 K than tested groups at 298 K. The MAR signal reducing levels between 308 and 298 K correlated to the NAD binding affinity at the condition of two different temperature (298 K, Kd >1000 \u03bcM; 308 K, Kd~54.34 \u03bcM; Table 3 ). Furthermore, with the presence of ADPR, the MAR signals reduced fewer, suggesting that the ADPR as an in vitro deMAR competitors. Moreover, the ADPR competition ability was more robust at 298 K, which correlated to the ADPR biding ability at different temperature (298 K, Kd~3.67 \u03bcM; 308 K, Kd~26.92 \u03bcM; Table 3 ).",

At 308 K, the macro domain showed a significant fluctuation with distinguished loop 1 ( Supplementary Fig. S11A , blue box), and I129 showed a pop-up signal (blue arrow) when the temperature was enhanced. Because of the conformational change of the distinguished loops as well as the flipping of K42, H43, I129, and F130 away from the binding site at 308 K, the thermal-induced flexibility of distinguished loops 1 and 2 yielded sufficient space for entry of NAD ( Supplementary Fig. S11B, C) . For detecting the exposure of protein hydrophobic core, we used the fluorescence probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS). ANS fluorescence spectra with signal enhancement at 308 K indicated that the MERS-CoV macro domain exhibited a more open conformation at 308 K than 298 K, which is consistent with the results of MD simulation (Supplementary Fig. S11D ).

The overlapped structures with various ligands revealed that open loops become closed, because of the induced-fitness of contacting with adenosine and pyrophosphate groups. Residues at region 1 could recognize adenine groups of all ligands with the carboxylic group of D20, which was reported as a critical residue for ADPR binding on the conserved position of other macro domains (Supplementary Fig. S1) 35, 46 . In addition, residues at region 2 and 3 formed hydrogen bonds with the distal ribose of ADPR, which configured a stable T-shaped-like stacking with F130. Indeed, the binding affinity evaluated by both ITC and NMR titration assay in 298 K also showed a significant increase by ADPR with an additional distal ribose as compared with ADP. The fast and slow exchange effects were observed in ADP-perturbed and ADPR-perturbed experiments, respectively. By contrast, the terminal \u03b3-phosphate group in ATP could not compromise the binding pocket for distal ribose and was led to point out the binding site ( Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3C ). On the whole, the triple glycine residues at distinguished loop 1 and Ser-Ala-Gly at distinguished loop 2 presented a tunable binding pocket with appropriate conformational flexibility for different ligand interactions. ITC experiments and NMR titrations revealed that the MERS-CoV macro domain could interact with ADPR, ADP, AMP, and ATP, but the affinity to NAD was extremely weak at 298 K. Binding sites in the ADP-bound, AMP-bound, and ATPbound structures of the MERS-CoV macro domain contained fewer hydrogen bonds connecting with ligands than those in ADPR-bound structures, which suggests that the MERS-CoV macro domain possesses sequential interactions with NAD metabolites (Supplementary Fig. S4) . Also, the relatively higher Bfactor of loops around the binding site than other regions in these complex structures suggests that different ligand-binding properties may result from structural flexibility within the MERS-CoV macro domain (Fig. 7A, B) . Recently, the macro domain of Mayaro virus also was found to bind with these adenosine-like nucleotides but not NAD by ITC and NMR approaches at 293 K 47 .",

Tm measurement of the MERS-CoV macro domain based on a continuous heating process by CD showed a temperaturedependent signal decrease in the region before Tm value. The pattern of CD curves indicates the structure of the MERS-CoV macro domain can be slightly tuned for ligand binding with increasing temperature. Therefore, we measured the binding affinities of the macro domain with NAD metabolites at physiological 308 K. The Kd value decreased for NAD binding to the macro domain at a higher temperature.

Remarkably, residues G45 and I129 are highly conserved in viral macro domains (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). NMR relaxation experiments ( Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. S10 ) and MD simulation ( Supplementary  Fig. S11 ) provided evidence showing adequate flexibility of the binding pocket to accommodate ADPR-derived molecules. Finally, we identified the best-matched ligand-induced fitness at distinguished loops 1 and 2 of the MERS-CoV macro domain (the closed state of binding pocket introduced by the rotation of I129). Indeed, besides the flexibility of protein, we should consider the flexibility of ligand NAD. In the NAD-complexed crystal structure, the distal ribose of NAD was anchored, leading the nicotinamide pointed out of the binding pocket ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3B ). Although the NAD-soaking pretreatment before collecting x-ray diffraction data was at the same temperature (room temperature at NSRRC), the soaking time was extended to 5 h. So that we successfully captured the NAD-bound snapshot in the x-ray crystal structure. Our data indicate that the MERS-CoV macro domain adopts a two-step binding strategy to interact with ligands, even NAD, at physiological human body temperature: recognizing the ligand by using a tunable pocket and grabbing the ligand by an induced-fit mechanism. These ligandinduced motions give the protein a tunable binding pocket to fit ligands, a single-free ADPR, and ligand with an extra chemical structure than ADPR, for example, NAD or even PAR and ADPribosylated residues.",

A susceptive ADPR modification cleavage model of the macro domain from VEEV was previously reported 25 . The strong dynamic pattern found in NAD binding the MERS-CoV macro domain (Fig. 7C ) might be associated with the possible enzyme activity but needs more evidence. Our study found that the MERS-CoV macro domain binding to ADPR and NAD (as the important co-factor of ARTDs and sirtuins) by its tunable binding site at physiological temperature. The more NAD presenting, the more the MAR signals were reduced, and the signal decreases were more dramatic at 308 K than tested groups at 298 K. Furthermore, the more ADPR, the MAR signals reduced fewer. (Fig. 6D) . The results indicated the ADPR is a competitor of the MERS-CoV macro domain as a deMAR enzyme. However, we could not conclude the NAD as an inducer of the MERS-CoV macro domain during the deMAR reaction, because the tested reaction system including HsARTD10-CatD, biotin-NAD, MERS-CoV macro domain, and NAD was stopped at the same time. To further reveal the possible inducer role of NAD, one shell creates a more precise reaction control. Nevertheless, this discovery might suggest a possible biological function of the viral macro domain is competing for NAD metabolites or blocking ADP-ribosylation signaling.",

            "text": "Also, we found the mobile distinguished-loops 1 and 2 at region2 of the MERS-CoV macro domain critically regulated the interaction with ADPR or NAD. This finding suggests that MERS-CoV evades host immunity by its macro domain to bind ADPR, PAR, ADP-ribosylated proteins, or NAD. Sirtuins followed a sequential binding mechanism: binding to a substrate before the co-factor NAD. Also, the NAD binding affinities of many sirtuins are extremely weak in the absence of acetylated substrates [58] [59] [60] . NAD depletion during viral infections also supports this aspect 12, 61 . Recently, a sirtuin activator, resveratrol [62] [63] [64] , was found to inhibit the replication of MERS-CoV 65 . The MERS-CoV macro domain could hijack cellular NAD and silence the antiviral function of sirtuins; however, the resveratrol could awake sirtuins. We need more in vivo evidence about the competitions of NAD by viral macro domains to block the antiviral properties of human proteins. Crosstalk between ARTDs and sirtuins has been reported: the activation of sirtuins might result in ARTD deacetylation, which would inhibit the activity of ARTDs 66 . Optimistically, the mentioned conflict between ADP-ribosylation and viral replication is undeniable. Macro domains are highly conserved among many positivestrand RNA viruses, which threaten global health ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). During the revision of this paper, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV 2 appeared. Many researchers are working hard about the COVID-19, to increase the success possibility of human, we think it worthwhile to develop a pan-viral drug base for the inhibition of viral macro domains.",

This research is the first investigation of the ligand-binding ability of a macro domain under human body temperature. Our data indicate a ligand-binding mechanism with division and cooperation of residues near the cleft of the binding site. This binding site could be classified as three regions: region 1, near the adenine group of the ligand; region 2, constituted by distinguished loops 1 and 2 with a critical role in ligand binding; and region 3, near the distal ribose of the ligand. Region 1 plays a role of ligand recognition. Flexibility enhancement of loops at region 2 resulted in a mobile binding site that allowed a larger ADPR-like ligand, such as NAD. The open/closed form of the distinguished loops-controlled ligand-in and ligand-out. Hydrogen bond formation between region 3 and the distal ribose was the final step to complete the ligand-induced fit mechanism. Our study provides new insights into the ligand binding mechanism of the MERS-CoV macro domain and also to what extent viral macro domains interfere in the host immunity by fluctuating the balance of the pool of NAD metabolites by interaction with its ligands.",
