However, having CEPHaccredited programs did not push institutions to the most restrictive modalities. COVID-19 cases in county, enrollment, and political affiliation of the state governor were also found to influence instructional modality selection. While any ecological study has certain limitations, this study demonstrates that college and university fall plans appear to have been influenced by the presence of CEPH-accredited schools and programs of public health, and/or the input of their faculty. The influence of relevant faculty expertise on institutional decision-making can help inform college and university responses to future crises.",

What began in the spring semester with abrupt disruptions, led to the realization that the COVID-19 crisis would continue into the fall. Over the summer, virtually every college and university engaged in dialogue and strategic planning to formulate their response. In the U.S., this was reflected in a wide range of governance patterns informed by varying influences and controls. While the shared governance methodology provides structure through which leadership may meet its educational responsibilities, the COVID-19 crisis presented a new and formidable challengeinserting public health as a primary focus in higher education's collective decision-making model (Laforge, 2020) .",

This has led to an increased reliance on tuition dollars and other revenue-generating activities, such as residence halls and university events (Nadworny, 2020) , at a time when there were fewer students available to pay tuition (Current Term Enrollment Estimates, 2020) . Indeed, colleges and universities which were more dependent on revenue from auxiliary services provided to on-campus students were more likely to open for inperson instruction (Klinenberg & Startz, 2021) . Amid these economic threats related to decreased enrollment, as well as the global pandemic's damaging effect on national, state, and local economies, there was backlash from students and families who were angry for being charged the same or more for online learning in lieu of in-person courses in the spring (Anderson, 2020) .",

Organizational theory stresses the strong pressures organizations face to conform to emergent norms -i.e., become isomorphic (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983 ) -and to otherwise be bound to the dominant \"institutional logic\" in an industry (Thornton et al., 2012) . Additionally, organizational decision making is conditioned by the feedback received from stakeholders, as well as the resources/knowledge available to seek solutions to problems (Greve, 2003) . Previous explorations of fall reopening plans have concluded that colleges and universities were influenced by state and local politics as much, if not more than, institutional characteristics (Collier et al., 2021; Felson & Adamczyk, 2021) . This offers insight into decision-making processes of institutions, given their collective limitations of time to design a reopening plan and knowledge about how to operate under a pandemic. Given these competing forces, it was unclear whether public health would have a meaningful voice in campus responses to COVID-",

Much of the uncertainty of the fall semester has given way to the consequences of instructional modality decisions. Studies have linked the return of students to campus to COVID-19 surges both on campus (Harris, 2020) and in the surrounding community (Leidner, 2021) .

Violations of the parallel lines (proportional odds) assumption were checked by comparing the results from the ordered logistic model to those of the five underlying binary logistic models. Based on the results of these tests, we modeled the COVID-19 rate using restricted cubic splines and included results of the underlying binary models as well as the ordered logistic model.

CEPH-accreditation was not as influential on the decision to employ Fully-online+. The presence of a CEPH-accredited program increased the odds of adopting a Fully-online+ by 5.4% and decreased the odds (by 5.8%) of selecting the most restrictive instructional method, Fully-online-closed. The presence of a CEPH-accredited school or program did not show an effect on universities' decision to forgo fully in-person instruction. Figure 2 shows the relationship between COVID-19 county incidence rate and the odds of choosing various levels of instructional modalities. At the median COVID-19 rate (approximately 1,500 cases), the odds of being at a higher lever on the modality restriction scale were 141.6% higher than they would be in the absence of COVID-19 cases. However, the odds varied across the DV scale, with a median infection rate leading to a 64.0% higher odds of having Any restriction; a 106.9% higher odds of being Hybrid+, a 102.7% higher odds of being Primarily-online+, a 295.7% higher odds of being Fully-online+, and a 338.2% higher odds of being Fully-online-closed.

After the rate of new cases surpassed 2,500 cases per 100,000 county population, the influence of incident rate on modality choice steadily declined for all restriction levels besides the decision to adopt a Primarily-online+ plan (though it is important to note that 92.4% of all schools were in counties with fewer than 3,000 cases per 100,000 population).",

Perhaps the closest indicator of a right/wrong decision would be whether institutions were forced to alter operational plans midsemester due to increased disease burden of COVID-19 or otherwise, but this is a focus for future research. Similarly, another factor to consider in future research, and related to institutional decision-making, is the background education and professional expertise (e.g. health sciences) of college and university leadership within each institution. It is still unclear as to whether the presence of public health faculty translated to their active participation in the decision-making processes, or if having a CEPH-accredited school or program merely contributed to an increased awareness and sensitivity to public health issues within and affecting the institution.
