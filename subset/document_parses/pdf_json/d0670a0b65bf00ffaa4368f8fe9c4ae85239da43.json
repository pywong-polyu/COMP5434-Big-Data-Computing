However, a bottleneck remains due to a lack of techniques for detecting and sorting environmental microorganisms with vast diversity and abundance. Here, we developed a fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) pipeline for high-throughput screening of PETdegrading microorganisms or enzymes (PETases). The pipeline comprises three steps: generation and incubation of droplets encapsulating single cells, picoinjection of fluorescein dibenzoate (FDBz) as the fluorogenic probe, and screening of droplets to obtain PET-degrading cells. We characterized critical factors associated with this method, including specificity and sensitivity for discriminating PETase from other enzymes. We then optimized its performance and compatibility with environmental samples. The system was used to screen a wastewater sample from a PET textile mill. We successfully obtained PET-degrading species from nine different genera. Moreover, two putative PETases from isolates Kineococcus endophyticus Un-5 and Staphylococcus epidermidis Un-C2-8 were genetically derived, heterologously expressed, and preliminarily validated for PET-degrading activities. We speculate that the FADS pipeline can be widely adopted to discover new PET-degrading microorganisms and enzymes in various environments and may be utilized in the directed evolution of PETases using synthetic biology.",

            "text": "Synthetic plastics have become an indispensable part of modern life. The problem of plastic pollution is intensifying, especially after the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic broke out 1 . Due to its excellent chemical durability and thermal properties, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become the primary thermoplastic resin for making bottles and fibers 2 . The control, recycling, and treatment of PET wastes is a great challenge. As a result, significant interests have arisen in unveiling the biodegradation of PET by microorganisms to tackle the problems caused by PET wastes 3 . Only a few microbial PET-degrading enzymes (PETases) have been reported, including cutinase-like enzymes from Thermobifida 4-5 and lipases or esterases from Candida antarctica 6 and Yarrowia lipolytica 7 . A PETase derived from Ideonella sakaiensis has been found that degrades PET into mono (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA) 3, 8 . DuraPETase 9 , EXO-PETase 10 , and leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) 11 were recently developed by structure-based protein engineering to improve catalytic activity and thermostability. Despite all these breakthroughs, we expect that much more microbial PETases have not yet been discovered based on the great genetic diversity and abundance of microorganisms in nature. However, discovering new PETases from environment is time-consuming and labor intensive 12 . It involves enrichment, screening, cultivation, enzyme expression, and activity validation. The screening of novel degrading microbes and enzymes remains a slow and complex process due to the inefficiency of current sorting techniques 5, [13] [14] . Traditional measurements for plastic biodegradation include plastic weight loss, changes in the mechanical properties or the chemical structure, and carbon dioxide emission, but these can take up to several months. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or absorbance assays have been developed for PET film hydrolysis 15 but have not yet been scaled up for highthroughput analysis of environmental microbial communities or largescale mutant libraries. It is still difficult to efficiently evaluate the activity of PETases due to the lack of rapid, specific, sensitive, and quantitative detecting and sorting methods. To overcome the bottleneck for the screening of functional microbes or enzymes, various high throughput screening techniques have been developed [16] [17] . Among them, microfluidic fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) was introduced to dramatically simplify the operations, improve sorting efficiency and flexibility, and reduce the cost of large library screening [18] [19] . FADS has been successfully applied to screen lipase/esterase 20 , DNA/XNA polymerase 21 , cellulase 22 , and NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases 23 by incorporating highly sensitive and specific fluorescent enzymatic assays 24 . In this work, we developed a FADS-based approach for expediting the search of PETases and then validated its performance by benchmark PETases. We used it to obtain PET-degrading microbes from the wastewater of a PET textile mill, and evaluated putative new PETases for PET-degrading activities. We envision that the FADS pipeline developed in this study can be widely applied to the discovery of PET-degrading microorganisms and enzymes.",

(ii) The droplets were re-injected into the picoinjection device to introduce picoliter fluorescein dibenzoate (FDBz) into each droplet and incubated at room temperature for a short time to allow the facilitate of FDBz. (iii) The droplets were re-injected into the sorting device for highthroughput sorting to obtain microbial species capable of decomposing FDBz (the fluorogenic probe for PETases). (iv) The positive droplets were then demulsified, and the positive species were isolated and identified on BHET agar plates.

            "text": "To develop a rapid, sensitive, and specific fluorogenic assay for droplet-based singlecell sorting of PETases, the following criteria have to be met: (a) structural similarity between the fluorogenic probe and PET polymer structure; (b) good sensitivity and specificity for fluorescence discrimination of PETases from other enzymes; and (c) low level of self-hydrolysis, leakage and cross-talk of the fluorogenic probe and its hydrolyzed products between droplets. Most microbial-oriented PETases catalyze the hydrolysis of ester bonds of PET next to the benzene rings (Fig. 1B) . In criteria (b), we selected FDBz as the candidate fluorogenic probe and evaluated its specificity and sensitivity for fluorescence detection of PETases in picoliter droplets. As previously reported, FDBz was not a highly reactive substrate of common lipases and cannot not be used to stain cancer cells or plant pollen cells 25 . However, FDBz has PET-like ester bonds linked with a benzene group and can likely be hydrolyzed by PETases to generate fluorescein monobenzoate (FMBz) and fluorescein (Fig. 1C) , which can be detected by fluorescence. We used benchmark PETase and lipase to test the specificity of FDBz in selective reaction with PET-degrading enzyme. We performed colorimetric assays, fluorometric analysis, and the droplet-based catalytic reaction of benchmark PETases using FDBz as the substrate. The colorimetric assays were performed in Eppendorf tubes by mixing 250 \u03bcM FDBz with various enzyme solutions separately including cutinase (10 \u03bcM, a positive PETase), lipase (10 \u03bcM, negative control), and Tris-HCl buffer (blank control). After two hours of incubation, only the tube with cutinase turned yellow and fluorescent, while the tubes with lipase and the control remained unchanged (see Fig.  S3 ). Next, quantitative fluorometric analyses were performed using the same reaction setting on a plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 523 nm. During a 2-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the fluorescence intensity of microwells with cutinase (green line) increased nearly 346.5-fold versus 19.9-fold increase with lipase (orange line); the blank control (grey line) remained flat during 2-h incubation indicating high specificity and substrate selectivity of cutinase-FDBz hydrolysis ( Fig. 2A) . We further studied the effect of cutinase concentration on FDBz hydrolysis. The results shows that the fitted dose-response curve agrees well with classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (R 2 =1) (Fig. 2B) .",

First, we used the FADS optical system to read positive or negative droplets incubated separately for 40 minutes at the same settings. The histogram showed that fluorescence intensities of positive droplets were in the range of 2.0\u00d710 6 to 8.5\u00d710 6 , and the fluorescence intensities of negative droplets were in a much lower range of 1.0\u00d710 4 to 5.0\u00d710 4 (Fig. S4) . The difference of fluorescence intensities allows absolute threshold setting to discriminate PETases from common lipases and a sorting throughput of 1000 droplets per second with sorting efficiency of close to 100% using our FADS system. Afterward, positive and negative droplets were mixed, and monolayer arrays of droplets were prepared for time-lapse fluorescence imaging to investigate the leakage and self-hydrolysis (Fig. 2C) . The ratio of fluorescence intensities of positive droplets against negative droplets decreased from 20.88 to 11.49 after 2-h co-incubation ( Fig. 2D ), but this is still sufficient for absolute discrimination of droplets. Overall, similar results were found in both bulk and droplet-based assays, proving that FDBz is qualified as a specific fluorogenic substrate of PETases in our FADS pipeline.",

We tried to extract and purify the enzymes heterologously expressed in BL21(DE3) but failed due to their low expression levels. PHB might impose inhibitory effect on the growth of BL21(DE3). Therefore, crude enzymes were used for the following enzymatic assays. As expected, crude S9_948 and PHB exhibited significant kinetic hydrolytic activity against FDBz versus the blank control (Fig. 5A) . Crude PHB and S9_948 also showed strong hydrolytic activities of 134.34\u00b132.91 U\u00b7L -1 and 265.79\u00b13.72 U\u00b7L -1 against p-NPB, respectively ( Fig. 5B) . Moreover, the SEM images reveal that both S9-948 and PHB can induce surface erosion to PET films after incubation for two weeks (Fig. 5C) . However, the HPLC results of the relevant supernatants showed that hydrolysis products including BHET, MHET, and TPA, are below the detection limits. This result suggests that the enzymes might have low thermostability during long-term incubation. In addition, the biodegradation of PET by Un-5 and Un-C2-8 might involves multiple enzymes and steps and S9_948 and PHB are potentially participating enzymes.

            "text": "In summary, we developed a complete FADS pipeline using FDBz as the fluorogenic probe for screening of single microbial cells at a large scale to advance the discovery of PET-degrading enzymes for biodegradation and sustainable recycling of PET. Because environmental microbes require longer incubation, we developed and optimized the pipeline to include long-term pre-incubation following microfluidic picoinjection of the fluorescence substrate FDBz. We then applied the system to screen an environmental sample from a PET textile mill and successfully obtained putative PET-degrading microbes belonging to nine different genera. Moreover, two putative PETases from environmental microbial strains K. endophyticus Un-5 and S. epidermidis Un-C2-8 were genetically derived, heterologously expressed, and preliminarily validated for their PET-degrading activity. Overall, the FADS pipeline opens possibilities for obtaining novel microorganisms and enzymes for PET biodegradation with superior throughput, sensitivity, and specificity. The FADS pipeline allows the directed evolution of PETases by random mutagenesis and screening. It also enables the screening of environmental microbes to recover novel enzymes that are not previously known or studied.",

This methodology may be extended to screen enzymes that degrade other synthetic plastics such as polyesters [29] [30] , polyethylene [31] [32] , and polycarbonate 33 with the further development of specific fluorogenic probes targeting various synthetic plastics. Nano/micro-scale polymer particles coupled with fluorogenic enzymatic activity sensors are preferred to mimic the crystalline structures of plastic polymers in future work.

Gastight glass syringes (Agilent, Reno, NV) were used for loading and infusing solutions into the devices by Syringe Pumps (Pump 11 PicoPlus, Harvard Apparatus, USA). Three devices, including the droplet maker, the picoinjector, and the droplet sorter were operated step-by-step as follows: (1) Droplet maker: microbial suspension samples were diluted to~7\u00d710 7 CFU/mL in YSV medium and infused into droplet maker device to generate single-cell encapsulating droplets (~4 pL) at a throughput of 2700 drops per second. The droplets were collected in a 20-cm long tubing and incubated for three days to produce PET-degrading enzymes by positive microbial species.

The genes encoding putative PET-degrading enzymes, including S9_948 and PHB from Kineococcus endophyticus Un-5 and Staphylococcus epidermidis Un-C2-8 were selected for molecular cloning and heterologous expression. A set of specific primers were designed for PCR amplification of the target genes (Table 1) using the following steps. An initialization step of 5 min at 94\u00b0C was used to activate the Taq polymerease. Next, a total 30 cycles of amplification were performed as follows: a DNA denaturation step of 10 s at 98\u00b0C, a primer annealing step of 10 s at 55\u00b0C, and a DNA extension step of 20 s at 72\u00b0C. Afterward, a final extension step was performed for 2 min at 72\u00b0C. The PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced for confirmation. Afterward, the target gene was connected to the expression vector pET-28a (Novagen) and transformed to Escherichia coli (E. Coli) BL21(DE3). The recombinant putative enzymes were expressed as N-terminal fusion to His-tag. The transformed BL21(DE3) was cultured at 37\u00b0C in 50-mL LB supplemented with 50 \u03bcg\u00b7mL -1 Kanamycin to reach an OD600 of 0.6.
