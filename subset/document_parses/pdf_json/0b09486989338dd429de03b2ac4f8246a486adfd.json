This epidemic has spread rapidly around the world, the virus is transmitted primarily through close contact between individuals, and often through respiratory droplets and droplets resulting from coughing, sneezing, or talking [1] . From this end, social distancing and reducing gatherings were recommended to reduce the chances of the virus being transmitted from an infected person to another healthy person [1] [2] [3] . The emergency departments (EDs) present great opportunities for the transmission of the virus, as it is possible that people with COVID-19 will be in contact with others due to the overcrowding ",

            "text": "Triage systems are applied in many countries worldwide. Table 1 shows the most common international systems used for classifying patients in EDs [35] . However, these systems are paper-based, applied on-site by the triage nurses, and the specified waiting time for some triage categories is not acceptable by patients and may worsen their condition. It is also challenging to adapt them to address different conditions such as the classification of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, several solutions have been suggested in the literature to address some of the issues in current ED triage systems. [42] There are several hospitals in Saudi Arabia adopting the CTAS system [43] There are several solutions found in the literature that have attempted to address issues in current ED triage systems. For example, the authors in [8] tried to improve the French ED triage system. They proposed a new classification method for ED patients called EP which combines categories defined by the two classification methods used in the French triage system, namely CCMU and GEMSA. They also designed a time-series forecasting model to predict the daily number of ED visits. The EP classification method was based on statistical tests that were performed on patient data collected from the Troy Hospital ED during the period from 2010 to 2014 along with the experience of the staff using CCMU and GEMSA classifications. As shown in Figure 2 , the EP classification method consists of eight categories created by grouping multiple categories defined by CCMU and GEMSA. The performance of their forecasting model was 91.08% for long-term predictions and 91.84% for short-term predictions. However, while the study aimed to predict the daily number of ED patients to help in managing the required resources, it did not address the treatment priority of patients or estimated waiting times.",

Furthermore, the authors in [44] introduced a framework named multi-sources healthcare architecture (MSHA) to enhance the scalability of advanced healthcare applications by adding tele-monitoring and remote triaging features. The framework adopts three sensors which monitor oxygen saturation (SpO2), electrocardiography (ECG) signals, and blood pressure. It also accepts text-based input from wireless body area network devices. It consists of three tiers, the first is for data collection, the second is for data preprocessing and patient prioritization processes to determine pathological conditions, while the third tier is for patient data management on a cloud database server. The patient triage level is determined based on medical guidelines and a multi-sources data fusion algorithm. Each patient will have a priority code (PC) ranging from 0 to 100 to describe the severity level of their health condition, where a higher PC indicates a more serious condition. The scheduling algorithm sorts patient requests into a queue based on the PC value. Requests with equal PC values are sorted in descending order based on each patient's waiting time.",

Patients are categorized into eight types based on their age, group, and priority. Patients will be prioritized in groups from 1 to 10 as shown in Figure 3 . Furthermore, the authors in [44] introduced a framework named multi-sources healthcare architecture (MSHA) to enhance the scalability of advanced healthcare applications by adding tele-monitoring and remote triaging features. The framework adopts three sensors which monitor oxygen saturation (SpO2), electrocardiography (ECG) signals, and blood pressure. It also accepts text-based input from wireless body area network devices. It consists of three tiers, the first is for data collection, the second is for data pre-processing and patient prioritization processes to determine pathological conditions, while the third tier is for patient data management on a cloud database server. The patient triage level is determined based on medical guidelines and a multi-sources data fusion algorithm. Each patient will have a priority code (PC) ranging from 0 to 100 to describe the severity level of their health condition, where a higher PC indicates a more serious condition. The scheduling algorithm sorts patient requests into a queue based on the PC value. Requests with equal PC values are sorted in descending order based on each patient's waiting time.",

The infection spreads quickly in all hospital clinics, and is not limited to emergency departments. For example, when COVID-19 spread in China, it was discovered that 77.5% of the infected workers were working in general clinics [53] . Several studies are concerned with providing solutions to classify and triage patients to reduce their exposure to medical practitioners or other patients in hospital clinics. The authors in [54] and [55] discussed the need to provide preventive measures and develop appropriate plans to prevent and protect against the spread of COVID-19 in the dermatology departments. In [56] , a structured remote triage system was implemented to counsel patients with neck and head cancer. The system calculates the patient's risk rate to determine the appropriate way to provide counseling, whether remote over the phone or at the clinic.",

The main problem with their study's validity was a lack of enough samples to cover the factors that were studied, such as the geographical distribution of the samples and the disease's subsequent course. However, their report covered the majority of the main symptoms that can be used to help select symptoms for COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as other studies. They primarily reported the prevalence of some of the COVID-19 symptoms listed in Table 3 . In terms of symptom frequency, we listed the percentage found in this study as well as other frequencies discussed in other studies [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . The authors in [82] show that the average rate of skin disease symptoms for confirmed COVID-19 patients varied among the studies they reviewed, where the initial studies were conducted in Wuhan, China, on a group of 1099 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported a lower rate of cases presenting symptoms of skin diseases as it was only 0.2%. While the maculopapular rash observed in 47% of Spanish COVID-19 cases were over 50% of those said cases, they presented severe levels of pruritus for around nine days. As previously stated, the authors reviewed several studies related to skin disease symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 patients, and they believe that the difference in ratios between studies is due to the lack of interest in conducting skin tests on patients, especially those who are outside of the EDs. The study also indicated that skin related symptoms of COVID-19 could be helpful in initial diagnosis, triaging confirmed cases, and determining the severity level.",

Another discovered finding is that few of the reviewed studies were primarily planned for general emergency departments [61, 64] . Table 8 summarizes the main findings from the proposed COVID-19 triage systems. Regarding the reported symptoms and classification criteria used with COVID-19 triaging systems, we discovered that the symptoms vary from source to source, owing to the fact that the disease itself is not well understood yet, of both old and new types that can manifest in the human body and cause a variety of clinical manifestations. According to Tables 3 and 4 , and Figure 11 , the variety and changeability of symptoms have a significant role in classifying patients. As a result, there is a need for a triage method that is adaptable in terms of implementing various interventions as well as different thresholds for making decisions on patient classification at EDs. Moreover, the majority of the patients' classification criteria are variable and subjective. The variations and subjectivity of the used parameters may be attributed to several factors, including the complexity of developing such triage systems based on available information about the pandemic, the level of risk in the countries and regions, the difficulty of implementing current scoring general triage systems, the volatility of pandemic situations, and rapid overhead on ED during the pandemic.",

The data should contain a variety of samples and symptoms related to the classification levels. It is worth noting that datasets can be used to design and validate the proposed ED scoring-based triage system, but the aid of medical professionals and experts is still quite necessary.

After preprocessing and filtering out records with missing or invalid values, the remaining samples were 177 samples. Table 11 shows the description of the used dataset where we considered the features that could be mapped to our study. The processed dataset holds 43 samples classified with Target of 1, Group 1, representing the recovered cases at the time of collecting the data. The rest of the samples, 134 samples, are classified as Target of 2, Group 2, representing the most critical cases that are either deceased or active at the time of collecting the data. Table 12 shows the general statistics of the two groups considering the features or symptoms that contribute to our study. Based on the statistical results presented in Table 12 , it is obvious that the most significant factors/symptoms impacting the classification of the studied samples are fever, cough, and shortage of breath symptoms. Thus, we have considered them as the main factors used in this study to decide on the severity level of COVID-19 cases. Considering the first group of samples, Group 1, it holds only 43 samples and thus we have excluded its statistics in this study. However, we relied on the second group, Group 2, which holds 134 samples representing only active or deceased cases. We believe that Group 2 is more suitable to decide about the most critical levels (Severe and Critical) due to the type of the samples in Group 2 (active and deceased cases) as well as its statistics showed that all the samples involve at least two of the three main factors. Table 13 shows the statistics for Group 2 considering how many factors out of the three main factors being involved in the samples (two factors or three factors). Based on the statistical results presented in Table 13 and the recommendations presented in Table 9 , we recommend that the severe level can involve two of the three main factors with a minimum accumulated score of eight points. On the other hand, the critical level can involve all the three main factors with a minimum accumulated score of 12 points. Finally, regarding the mild and moderate levels, we recommend using only one of the three main factors as an essential criterion, in addition to the other non-main factors, to assign moderate level. Thus, the moderate level will have an accumulated score of [4 to 7] . On the other hand, the mild level, the lowest level, can be determined based only on the non-main factors with a range of [1 to 3] as shown above in Table 10 .",

Therefore, overcrowding in emergency departments need to be reduced to control the outbreak. Different triage systems have been proposed to classify patients into different levels based on the severity of their health condition. In this paper, number of these systems are reviewed, and the taxonomy of patient classification approaches is provided. The severity of a patient's health condition can be determined by the pathological symptoms. Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive survey was conducted to determine the symptoms of COVID-19 that were found in the literature review. It was noted that there are many challenges that cannot be addressed in the proposed triaging systems. However, several parameters were identified such as waiting time, simplicity, reliability, validity, scalability, and adaptability, and were recommended while designing an e-Triage system for EDs. Moreover, we recommend the use of an electronic system to reduce overcrowding and overheads in EDs by remotely and electronically assessing patients' condition to either accept or reject their admission to the ED. Furthermore, we proposed a severity level classification approach of COVID-19 cases as a part of the recommended e-Triage system.",

Similarly, many external factors might interfere with applicability of such approaches; limited resources availability especially in rural areas, numbers of patients, and ED design play a major factor in the success or failure of e-triaging systems. Thus, there is a need to conduct a validation on the recommended scoring-based triage systems using real patient's data with enough samples considering the quality and statistics of the data. Moreover, there is always a need to update the findings on relevant symptoms for such outbreaks. Additionally, the symptoms themselves are highly variability from one another.
