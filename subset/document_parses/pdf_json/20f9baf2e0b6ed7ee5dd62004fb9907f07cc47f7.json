The impact on stock markets has been measured by applying the event study method, while the panel vector autoregressive model has been applied to measure the impact on economic activities. The stock index of each country, purchasing managers' index, COVID-19 variables, namely the number of lockdown days, restriction in internal movement, restriction in international travel, fiscal measure, and confirmed cases have been used. The study observes the serious negative impact of the pandemic on stock market returns. European stock markets are the worst sufferer compared to others. All pandemic variables have a negative impact on stock markets; moreover, lockdown days and restriction on movement have a negative impact on economic activities. This study considers such countries which significantly represent the world economy and are a serious victim of COVID-19 pandemic. The outcome-based recommendations will help governments, regulatory authority, and policymakers to combat the crisis in different dimensions.

It is estimated that if COVID-19 follows a similar pattern like global influenza, with a greater population and more accessible communication facilities, the current one could kill more than 80 million Dhar et al., 2020; Fernandes, 2020) . Thus, the current priority of the world is to restrict the spread as less as possible. In doing so, many countries of the world are going through strict lockdown procedures. The consequence of this attempt has, however, brought a robust grip to the economic wheel of the world. Many studies have already been completed to find out the overall impact of the COVID-19 on the globe. However, it is still too early to conclude the economic loss caused by the pandemic as the world is still going through the process. The size of the economic loss will depend on the severity and longevity of the disease and the corresponding policies of different countries. This section of the paper analyzes authentic sources that were written focusing on the effect of COVID-19 on the stock market and other economic activities in production and service sectors, and find out the gaps in that literature to help design further studies on this topic.",

In the history of the United States this is the highest number of jumps within the same period of trading days. Newspaper predictions connected 15 to 16 of this jumps to the COVID-19 pandemic. This jump frequency was 23 times greater than the average rate since 1900. The study concluded that the reason behind this abnormal movement was the result of policy response of the coronavirus pandemic such as lockdowns and production cuts that instigated tension among the shareholders (Baker et al., 2020) .",

In the same week, the S&P 500 index of the United States lost 5 trillion USD in wealth. Among the 5 trillion USD loss amount, the largest ten companies' loss accounts for 1.4 trillion USD in wealth. Like the Baker et al. (2000) study, this study also summarizes that the increasing number of lockdowns, travel restrictions, and monetary policies during the COVID-19 crisis directly influenced the opening, lowest, and highest prices of stock market indices in the United States (Ozili & Arun, 2020) . Again, analyzing the trend of US stock market, Fernandes (2020) showed that the S&P 500 index of the US stock market has fallen below 30% from its pick during March, 2020. Following the US stock market, Fernandes (2020) juxtaposed the stock markets of some of the other major economies of the world. He showed that the stock market performance of the United Kingdom and Germany were even worse than the performance of the US stock market. The year-to-date stock return decrease in the United Kingdom was 37% while for Germany, it was 33%. But, the two lowest performers in the global stock market were Brazil (\u221248%) and Columbia (\u221247%). The study, however, did not go in detail to find out the specific reasons behind the differences in the performance of the stock markets of the different countries. The same study also analyzed year-todate stock returns for different sectors. It showed that the worst performer was the Oil, Gas, and Coal sector with a 50% negative return. After the fuel sector, the second-highest damage was seen in the Travel and Leisure industry with a 40% negative return. Following them, the aerospace, mining, bank, and media sector have also been affected very severely and have a fall of more than 30% (Fernandes, 2020) . These stock market outcomes corroborate with the findings of the economic impact of COVID-19 on general markets, which has been discussed later on in this section.",

The study termed the response of the global stock market to the pandemic as \"dramatic.\" As proof to their claim, they brought the incidence of the US stock market's four times circuit breaker hitting mechanism within 10 days. Before this incident, the circuit breaker has triggered only once since its introduction in 1987.

The countries considered by this study were the 10 countries that had the highest number of infections on March 27, 2020, along with Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.

Specifically, the GDP of the developing countries will fall by 2.5%, while the industrial nations will experience a 1.8% decline in their GDP. The study also assets that if all the countries experience an equal amount of shock as China did, then the GDP fall will be two times more than the abovementioned predictions. By going through different literature extensively in order to see the impact of COVID-19 on economic activities of various sectors, it has been seen that four important causes bring the negative economic outcome to people's income-generating activities and consequently lead to GDP fall of the world (Dhar, 2020; Fernandes, 2020; Maliszewska et al., 2020; . First, as many countries are experiencing lockdown for quite a remarkable time, many people are working from home and many are entirely absent from their workplace. For the production sectors, the absence of workers is leading to labor shortage in their production. As labor supply is short, automatically to keep the balance of production procedure, the demand for capital is also decreasing. This ultimately is leading to a production cut, which is directly causing GDP to fall.",

One of the main reasons behind the reduction in import and export is the extra cost related to the border crossing of the products. Due to the spread of COVID-19, it is calculated that the transport and transections costs of cross border trade have increased by 25%. The additional costs are coming from the extra inspection time, shortened office hours and roadblocks, all of which are happening due to the coronavirus pandemic (Maliszewska et al., 2020) . Another reason behind the fall of net export is the inability to produce the exportable goods in the desired quantity due to shortage of imported raw materials. For example, car companies like GM Korea (Roberts, 2020) luxurious watch companies such as Swiss Watches are falling short of imported production components, thus cutting down their production. According to US institute of supply management, around 75% of the manufacturing companies have experienced disruption in their supply chain. This disruption in the supply chain is increasing the production cost of manufacturing companies (Fernandes, 2020) . As of February 29, 2020, the then five countries with the highest number of COVID-19 patients, Bahrain, China, Italy, South Korea, and Singapore, experienced more than 10% decline in both export and import during January and February this year (Ferrantino, Arvis, Constantinescu, Dairabayeva, Gillson, et al., 2020) .",

The stakeholders of the overall travel industry, such as airlines, cruise companies, hotels, casinos, travel agents, and tourist vehicles are going through their worst nightmare of the century. The most famous tourist spots of the world, such as the Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty, and Madam Tousou Wax Museum, are deserted; airlines industries are temporarily shutting down flights to many destinations and consequently firing a large number of staffs; casinos and hotels are constantly running out of customers. It is estimated that 90% of the activities of the hospitality and tourism industries have been cut short. However, the prior COVID-19 calculation was very optimistic. When in 2019, the revenue earned from the tourism and travel industry was 685.06 billion USD globally, the forecast for 2020 was 712 billion USD. Contrary to the forecast, the tragic pandemic has now reduced the expected income from this industry in 2020 to 447.4 billion USD only, which is around 35% lower than the 2019 revenue (\"Forecasted change in revenue,\" n.d.). Specially, countries that are highly dependent on tourism like Greece, Spain, Italy, India, and Japan are expected to experience a steep fall in their GDP this year. All the countries named above annually earn around 7.5% to 20% of their GDP from the tourism industry (Fernandes, 2020) .",

The sports sector is directly or indirectly connected to production industries, tourism, and hospitality industry as well as media and communication industry. From 2011 to 2018, the global value of the sports industry has seen a 45% rise (Hall, n.d.) . Thus, the cancelation of big sports events such as the Tokyo Olympic 2020, Euro 2020 and Copa America will bring a chain effect to many of its stakeholder sectors (Reuters, 2020). To begin with, there are three direct sources of income that are related to significant sports events: \"broadcasting (sales of media rights), commercial (sponsorship and advertising partnerships) and match day revenue (ticketing and hospitality)\" (Hall, n.d.) . Due to the cancellation of the big sports events, income generations from all three segments will be significantly hampered this year. Not only this, but also many other sectors such as the beverage industries, fast food and catering sectors, sports-related souvenir, jersey, and other item manufacturers, those targeted these regional and global sports events for their income generation will also go through countless economic loss this year (\"Coronavirus' economic impact,\" 2020). Some other stakeholders of the production chain of the sports industry, which have been discussed earlier in this section, the tourism and hospitality industry and the aviation industry, will add more to their revenue loss due to the termination of these big sports events. As most of the production and service sectors are going through shutdowns or shorter spells of working hours than before the COVID-19 period, one prominent sector that is suffering tremendously is the Gas and Oil sector. Due to the lack in demand of fuel, the price of crude oil has fallen more than 60% compared to the price of 2019. Similarly, the price of natural gas has become one-third of the price of last year (Global Data Energy, 2020).",

Table 7 gives an idea about the nature of selected variables. Average stock return in both estimation and post-event period are negative. Table 8 exhibits the correlations among the variables. It is observed that during post-event period, the stock return is negatively correlated with all the COVID-19 variables, whereas economic activities have a positive relation with a restriction on international movement and fiscal policy. Among the independent variables, there exists a positive relation. To verify the stationarity of the panel variables, ADF and PP Chi-square unit roots have been applied. Table 9 shows that all the variables found stationary at level except RIM. During pre-event period, return, EC and SDL found stationary at level, but rest of the variables found stationary at first level. Variables found stationary at first level have been converted with first difference. To check the cointegration among the variables, applied Kao residual cointegration test have been applied. Table 10 shows the cointegration test result. This test assumes the null hypothesis that, there is no cointegration among the variables. It is observed that p-values are less than 5% under both the periods, which means we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, test results confirm that there is no cointegration among the variables, and it allows to run the panel VAR model. Table 11 shows the estimates for return and EA under both situations. We have applied both fixed and random models, as shown in Table 10 . It is observed that there is no significant impact of any variable on the stock market and economic activities before the event day except CC under a fixed model. This result is quite natural. During the post-event period, it is seen that SDL and CC can significantly influence the stock return, whereas economic activities are significantly influenced by all the variables. More number of confirmed cases and prolonged lockdown tyrannized the stock investors. Different restrictions, conservative policies of the government, and increased number of positive patients literally handicapped the economic activities everywhere in the world. Due to long-term lockdown and stagnant economic activities, more than 26 million people lost their jobs only in the United States, triggering the unemployment rate as high as 4.4% (Lee, 2020) . This rate is increasing very fast in almost all countries in the world. Bartik et al. (2020) surveyed 5,800 small businesses and found that 43% of the business were temporarily closed and they laid off more than 40% of employees in February, 2020. Most of the businesses have failed to pay their fixed monthly expenses, which is on average $10,000.",

Right from Policymakers, businessmen, governments, regulatory authority to ordinary people are under enormous pressure to tackle the outbreak. Many countries have paid huge compensations in the form of lives and monetary values for not making quick decisions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The UK government was criticized for being slow in testing, announcing lockdown, and ensuring protective equipment (Presse, 2020) . Pisano et al. (2020) claimed that unlike China; Singapore, Taiwan, Italy, South Korea, and the United States was also very late to tackle the COVID-19 disease at the infantry state and did not prohibit free movement, business operations, and social meetings. India announced a countrywide lockdown after 2 months of detecting the first coronavirus patient on March 24, 2020. By that time, 5,000 people were positive and 150 lost their lives (Biswas, 2020) . When coronavirus first attacked Wuhan in China, stock investors thought it would leave shortly and the situation would improve. When the number of infections started to climb up, the ebb on their enthusiasm was noticed. After the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 as pandemic, financial market started to fall significantly all over the world. Being frightened, traders started to sell their shares, and investors daunted themselves from buying stocks. Shanghai Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq all started to bleed. Tokyo experienced the second attack when the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games was postponed up to a year (Rudden, 2020) . Using technology and human reading of newspaper articles, Baker, Bloom, Davis, Kost, Sammon and Viatyosin (2020) observed that no such infectious-disease outbreak was as alarming as COVID-19 since 1900. Within the blink of an eye, the coronavirus caused serious damage to the world. Countries have closed their boarders, stock markets have become red; people find security only by staying at home. Apart from physical and financial loss, people are now concern about their psychological well-being, which may go beyond the control if the situation persists further. ",

Necessary attentions should be given to keep psychological, physical, emotional, and moral conditions stable. Right after physical security, financial security becomes a huge concern for people. Leaders should make sure that people are not losing their jobs and dying of food crisis rather than dying from the corona. Companies should have a culture of reserving profits to survive during the crisis period. Companies, which have created a diverse and inclusive workplace for different groups of people around the world, should not come out of their vision in the name of layoff due to financial inefficiency. The financial inability of company should be well transparently communicated to the employees so that they can wait with patience and leaders can implement a survival payment strategy through rationalization. This will not only help employees and organization to survive during this crisis period but also work as a strong motivator to stay competitive in the future with higher records of achievements. Standing (2011) observed that the employees who were paid during the economic crisis of 2008-09, played a significant role in boosting aggregate demand for their products with the efficient allocation of the organizations' limited resources. Due to excess operating expenses and reduction in revenue, more than 50 percent of small businesses in the United States survive less than 5 years. To ensure financial stability and employees' welfare, organizations should have strong liquidity and solvency plan, easy access to capital, and engaging representatives of small businesses in state-level policy formulation (Monson, 2020) . Reeves et al. (2020) further recommended to update with genuine information regularly, take help from experts to forecast with greater accuracy, disseminate necessary information to the concerned people without delay, reducing bureaucratic procedure where senior management involvement is required, taking necessary precautions for next crisis and any sort of change using the learnings from this crisis.",

The event study showed that the pandemic affected all the countries severely especially European countries. With the decrease of mean return, the volatility of all the countries increased except for the United States and United Kingdom. Germany and Italy recorded the highest abnormal return on the event day while Singapore, France, and South Africa experienced the highest abnormal loss on the very next day of announcing the news of detecting first corona patients. Throughout the period, the positively affected countries are Italy, Spain, Germany, and India. Although abnormal returns were insignificant for most of the countries in the initial period, it became significant for many countries due to prolonged deadlock. The cumulative average abnormal return was found significant during the whole post-event period except on 16th day. No cointegration was found among the variables. The number of lockdown days and new corona patients significantly affect the stock price, whereas all the variables have a significant impact on the economic activities. Policymakers, governments, business organizations, researchers, scientists, and people at all levels are anxious and continuously trying to come up with quick and effective solutions to overcome both the health and financial catastrophe that has damaged the financial base and took away many valuable lives around the world. Business organizations decided to shut down their operations either in full or partially to save human lives resulting in accumulation of losses, a decrease in productivity, and an increase in layoff. Our findings-based recommendations will significantly benefit the concerned authority to frame appropriate policies to overcome the crisis. This study is based only on top 12 infected countries across four continents. In future, researchers may consider more countries and whole Covid-19 pandemic period to draw a better picture.",
