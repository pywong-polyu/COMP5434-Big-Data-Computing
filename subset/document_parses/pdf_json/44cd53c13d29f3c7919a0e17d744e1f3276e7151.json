            "text": "Albeit numbers of human WNV infections in 2020 were lower than in previous years, the geographic expansion of WNV has continued in Europe. The environmental and ecological drivers of WNV are complex and not known in detail, yet. Nevertheless, ambient temperature is known as one important determinant through its effect on mosquito reproduction rates and the extrinsic virus period in mosquitoes [9] . According to the monthly climate bulletins of the Copernicus Climate Change Service [10] , positive surface air anomalies were recorded in the southern regions of the Iberian Peninsula from July to August, as well as in north-west Europe from August to October. The temporospatial overlap with the WNV outbreaks might be a mere coincidence, but in the long term, the environmental conditions tend to become more favourable for WNV establishment and seasonal circulation in many European regions [9] . The European spread of another flavivirus, closely related to WNV, the Usutu virus (USUV), may be regarded as an example [11, 12] . The first cases of USUV-associated wild bird mortality events were described in Italy in 1996 and in Austria in 2001. Within two decades, USUV has spread all over Europe, except for the Baltic countries and Scandinavia, and in 2020, USUV emerged in the United Kingdom [13] . Although the ecology and epizootiology of USUV and WNV differ in several points (e.g. higher genetic diversity of USUV in Europe indicates various, recent introductions from Africa), the two viruses share mosquito vectors and avian hosts; therefore, the environmental and ecological conditions suitable for USUV may indicate the same for WNV (e.g. vector competences [14] ).",

Several further studies have been and are investigating the ecological and environmental drivers of WNV [16, 17] .

The risk and public health impact of human WNV infections in the different European countries clearly and significantly varies. In certain countries, surveillance of human WNV infections might be challenging or of low priority. The natural cycle of WNV involves avian hosts and mosquito vectors, while -besides humans -equids are also frequent, incidental hosts of the virus. Therefore, integrated animal-human WNV surveillance with systematic response and control measures e.g. for blood donation safety, vector control, awareness and information campaigns, might allow a more efficient utilisation of national resources and capacities. Animal WNV infections should be diagnosed timely and EU/EEA countries are encouraged to report infections via the Animal Disease Notification System of the European Commission. These data are visualised together with the TESSy data on human cases in ECDC's weekly updated maps on WNV infections in Europe [1] . The joint animal-human surveillance data can provide more accurate information on WNV activity within the transmission season than solely data from human infections. Joint efforts on WNV surveillance and control could be one of the good examples for a One Health approach towards zoonotic diseases.",
