This classification is the main determinant of a suitable inventory control policy of inventory classes. Therefore, a great deal of research is done on solving this problem. Usually, the problem of inventory classification is considered in a multi-criteria and uncertain environment. The proposed method in this paper inspired by the notion of heterogeneous decision-making problems in which decision-makers deal with different types of data. To this aim, a mathematical modeling-based approach is proposed considering different types of uncertainty in classification information. Demand information is considered to be stochastic due to its time-varying nature and cost information is considered to be fuzzy due to its cognitive ambiguity. A hybrid algorithm based on chance-constrained and possibilistic programming is proposed to solve the problems. Considering the stochastic nature of demand information, solving the proposed model using the hybrid algorithm, the classification of items to three classes of extremely important, class A, moderately important, class B, and relatively unimportant, class C, items are determined along with a minimum inventory level required to deal with the stochasticity of demands information. The proposed approach is applied to a case study of classifying 51 inventory items.

Usually, inventory is accounted for about 30% of a company's asset and inventory carrying costs are approximated between 20 and 25% of total inventory value (Lambert and Stock 1993; Stevenson 1999) . This magnitude of financial impacts made inventory control as an essential module of managerial decision making, both in practice and theory. The total expenditures of inventories holding are reduced through managing inventories, and subsequently, the profit of the company is raised. Inventory management systems can be considered in a spectrum from the simplest form of periodic manual control to advanced real-time computerized control. However, besides its importance, inventory management is a costly and time-consuming activity. Classic inventory management models are usually developed considering a single item, while practically; realworld systems contain several inventory items (Maiti et al. 2006) . Therefore, adapting suitable systems for inventory control of different items is a crucial problem. Organizations are able to apply a similar exact and advanced inventory management system for all of the inventory items. This scenario can assure a similar level of control, but its costs may not be justifiable for a set of items with lower impact and importance. Therefore, it seems reasonable to localize inventory management systems according to the role and importance of the items.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 259, "end": 283, "text": "(Lambert and Stock 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 284, "end": 299, "text": "Stevenson 1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 991, "end": 1010, "text": "(Maiti et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The next logical question that arises is which inventory management system to be used for which items.

In many decision-making (DM) problems, both qualitative and quantitative attributes are important. In these DM problems which precise calculation is almost unlikely, people's involvement is necessary to evaluate the attributes and assess the alternatives. In these situations, there may be different types of information such as fuzzy numbers, real numbers, and stochastic information. Heterogeneous DM methods can include multiple formats of information (Wan and Li 2013; Yu et al. 2018 ). In the inventory control framework, the behavior of demand along with time can be assessed with a probability distribution; while cost parameters ambiguity is often due to the lack of knowledge and does not behave stochastically. Therefore, as it is convenient, demands are taken into account as stochastic variables, while cost parameters are considered to be fuzzy numbers. This paper aims to combine them both in a singular model.

On the other hand, cost-related parameters are considered to be fuzzy information due to their cognitive uncertainty and lack of information, since usually in unstable markets, price behavior cannot be approximated by previous information. This heterogeneous formulation of the MCIC problem can be considered as the main novelty of this paper.

It has been shown that categorizing items by their common order cycle could result in a similar grouping (Chakravarty 1981) . Whybark (1986, 1987) are among the first researchers to consider other criteria as well. Subsequent to these authors, a significant number of MCDM methods have been used to deal with the MCIC problem. Ramanathan (2006) proposed a weighted linear optimization method for multi-criteria ABC classification. A weighted additive function is developed to aggregate the performance of an inventory item in various criteria and a particular score, called the optimum inventory score, is approximated for items. An optimization model is proposed to determine criteria weights, and it has to be considered that this model is subject to the constraint that the sum of weights for all the items must be less than or equal to one. Four criteria of average unit cost, annual dollar usage, critical factor, and lead time are considered. Ng (2007) presented a weighted linear optimization model for MCIC that evaluated a numeric score based on classification criteria. Optimum scores of inventory items could be handily acquired without a linear optimization. Tsai and Yeh (2008) developed an inventory classification algorithm applying particle swarm optimization (PSO). In this model, inventory items can be categorized based on a specific objective or multiple objectives. Also, this method specified the best number of inventory category, and the way items should be categorized. To specify the best composition of the parameters of the algorithm quantity, some experiments are employed. Four item properties are used for item classification: item setup cost, unit holding cost, demand per unit time, and supplier ordering cost. Chu et al. (2008) proposed an inventory control approach called ABC-fuzzy classification (ABC-FC). This method handles variables either with nominal or nonnominal characteristics. Also, the manager's expertise is gathered and implied in inventory classification. Annual demand, unit price, usage frequency, procurement lead time, current item status, the criticality of an inventory item, and severity of the impact of the inventory are considered to be classification criteria in their case study. Chen (2011) proposed a peer-estimation approach for MCIC. This method specified two common sets of importance degrees of criteria and the two resulting performance scores are aggregated in the most favorable and least favorable senses for each item. In this approach, the DEA cross-efficiency method is improved for solving MCDM problems. A separate model is being solved to specify the weight coefficients for this aggregation.

Annual dollar usage, limitation of warehouse space, average lot cost, and lead time are considered to be classification criteria in this study. Torabi et al.

The importance of criteria is computed through Shannon entropy. They solved an example using three criteria: annual dollar usage, average unit cost, and lead time. They also compared their result with Ng-model. Yang et al. (2017) developed a mixed-integer linear programming model by considering the non-stationary demand for inventory items. Demand is discretized in time horizon into several time periods, and it is supposed that the demand for an item is distributed normally.
