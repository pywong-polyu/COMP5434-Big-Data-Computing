In turn, more severe manifestations of COVID-19 develop when SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells in the distal lung including the small airways and alveoli [11] lined by small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) and alveolar type II (ATII) and type I (ATI) cells [12] . SAECs play an essential role in the structural integrity of the lung parenchyma and form a last line of defence of the alveoli against environmental insults. The expression and regulation of ACE2 in SAEC is not known, although recent publications suggest low levels of expression of ACE2 in the distal lung. However, IAV infection of primary human ATII cells increased ACE2 mRNA expression [13] , and the ACE2 gene expression is regulated by interferons (IFNs) [14] , a family of cytokines activated by multiple respiratory viruses. These findings suggest that IAV may increase the abundance of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human SAECs.",

The Human Research Protection Program at National Jewish Health deemed this research as nonhuman subject research. The lungs were perfused, lavaged and digested with elastase, as described previously [18] . Lungs were minced and cells of haematopoietic origin were depleted using anti-CD45-coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and magnetic-activated cell sorting [19] . The cell pellet obtained by centrifugation was resuspended in 1 mL cold PBS+dithiothreitol, centrifuged (225\u00d7g; 4\u00b0C; 5 min) and washed twice with cold PBS. The final cell pellet was resuspended in PBS with 0.04% bovine serum albumin for single-cell gene expression profiling with the 10X Genomics system. Sample capture, cDNA synthesis and library preparation were performed using protocols and reagents for 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 v3 kit [20] . Single-cell libraries were pooled for sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Reads were aligned to the hg19 genome assembly and processed according to the Drop-Seq Computational Protocol v2.0 (www.github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq). Initial processing of 10X scRNA-seq data, including cell demultiplexing, alignment to the human genome GRCh38 and unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based quantification was performed with Cell Ranger (version 3.0). To ensure that high-quality cells were used for downstream analysis, we removed cells with <100 genes detected and cells with >25% mitochondrial reads. Additionally, to remove possible doublets, we removed cells with >100 000 UMIs. For gene filtering, we removed lowly expressed genes (detected in fewer than four cells). Using the filtering described, we obtained a dataset consisting of 17 581 cells and 23 198 genes. Prior to clustering, we performed normalisation using SCTransform and integration of datasets from four whole lung samples using a mutual nearest neighbour based approach. Clustering analysis was performed on the top 30 principal components using the Louvain algorithm. Visualisation of single-cell expression profiles into a two-dimensional map was computed using the uniform manifold approximation and projection technique. Differential expression analysis between cell clusters was conducted on the count per million normalised count matrix using the FindMarkers function with default options. All the analyses were carried out with R Seurat package version 3.0.3.",

We first used the polyclonal antibody #AF933, which we validated using recombinant human ACE2 protein and cell lysates from HEK cells overexpressing human ACE2 (figure 3a). Compared to uninfected cells, where ACE2 exhibited an expected electrophoretic mobility of ~110 kDa, cell lysates of IAV-infected SAECs showed a minor but consistent shift (increase) in ACE2 electrophoretic mobility (figure 3b), together with an overall modest but significant decrease in ACE2 levels, measured by densitometry ( figure 3c ). This suggested post-translational changes in ACE2 that could include cleavage with intracellular loss of the protein. We then evaluated if there was any secretion of ACE2 at the apical surface of SAECs. Supernatants were obtained by collecting equal volumes of the media applied at the apical side of SAECs at the air-liquid interface at 48 h following IAV exposure. In the apical media from IAV-infected cells we noted a consistent presence of an ACE2 peptide with an electrophoretic mobility of ~90 kDa (figure 3d), suggesting the release of an ACE2 fragment from cells. Quantification by densitometry showed a significant increase in ACE2 in the apical supernatants of SAECs infected with IAV (figure 3e). In this experiment, we also investigated the effect of e-cigarette vape exposure, which may modify SAEC secretory function, and the antiviral responses of nasal epithelial cells [21, 27] . We did not detect a consistent effect of e-cigarettes on ACE2 on either IAV infected or noninfected cells, although in some e-cigarette-exposed cells we noted the release of ACE2 fragment in the apical media (figure 3b,d). As a complementary approach, we next tested a distinct polyclonal anti-ACE2 antibody and ACE2-overexpressig HEK cells as positive control and probed supernatants of SAECs submerged in media. We confirmed a dose effect of IAV on ACE2 protein fragments release by SAECs, even in culture conditions that precede full differentiation achieved at the air-liquid interface (figure 3f). The lower molecular weight of the ACE2 peptide found in supernatants compared to that in cell lysates indicate that ACE2 may undergo proteolytic cleavage and release from the plasma membrane in response to IAV infection of SAECs.",

Compared to uninfected cells, IAV infection upregulated ADAM17 in SAECs, as measured by RT-qPCR (figure 4b). TMPRSS2 was similarly associated with STAT1 in SAECs and was also significantly increased by IAV infection (3\u00d710 5 pfu\u00b7transwell \u22121 ) (figure 4c, d). Next, we investigated the effect of IAV infection on TMPRSS2 protein, which is synthesised as a zymogen that undergoes proteolytic autoactivation necessary for its serine protease function. IAV increased the abundance of both TMPRSS2 zymogen (54 kDa) and especially that of the lower molecular weight mature TMPRSS2 fragments of ~35 kDa and especially that of ~28 kDa (figure 4e,f).",

ACE2 is expressed in multiple lung cell types, including ATII cells, airway epithelial cells, macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts [11, 31] , but the baseline expression levels in these cells varies. In COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 first infects upper and large airway epithelial cells known to have higher expression of ACE2 [32, 33] . In the vast majority of exposed individuals, the infection remains limited to the upper airways, causing asymptomatic or mild respiratory disease. When SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in the distal airways and airspaces such as ATII cells, which have a low baseline ACE2 expression [32] , the disease has more severe manifestations, due to inflammation and injury of gas exchange areas of the lung. Therefore, infection with SARS-CoV-2 appears to parallel the levels of ACE2 expression [34] , although the expression of TMPRSS2 and other receptors are also likely to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity [33] .",

Although the donors were young males, our data corroborated published results that used a broader demographic. Additionally, the pattern of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS noted in whole-lung homogenates was recapitulated in SAECs in situ, showing that the study of these primary human cells in cultures is relevant. Moreover, the ACE2 expression in SAECs isolated from lungs of both male and female donors with a broad age range was consistent with that found in single-cell experiments. Prior to this report, airway epithelial cells isolated from small airways have been infrequently used to study the pathogenicity of respiratory viruses, most studies having relied on human bronchial epithelial cells from larger airways either differentiated at the air-liquid interface [23] or guided into forming organoids [35] . The fact that IAV increased ACE2 expression is not surprising, since viral infections can increase ACE2 mRNA transcription via transcription factors such as STAT1 as part of the IFN signalling response [14, 36] . The significant correlation we measured between STAT1 and ACE2 mRNA levels suggests that a similar IFN-induced response is likely to account for the increase in ACE2 in response to IAV infection of SAECs. The boosting effect of IAV infection on ACE2 expression in SAECs coupled with its potential to increases ACE2 in ATII [13] suggests that the influenza infection may be a risk factor for distal lung co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. The clinical implication of such events is that infection with SARS-CoV-2 of small-airway and alveolar epithelium causes respiratory compromise such as pneumonia and ARDS. Furthermore, insufficient or maladaptive repair of the viral-injured distal lung epithelium may contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or emphysema, feared chronic sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated serine protease with transmembrane, receptor class A, scavenger receptor and protease domains. Expressed at the surface of epithelial cells, including those in the lung [40] , TMPRSS2 has been known to increase the virulence of IAV infection by cleaving viral haemagglutinin [41, 42] . However, little is known about the regulation of TMPRSS2 by IAV itself. To our knowledge, we found for the first time that IAV infection increases both the transcription and protein levels of TMPRSS2. We noted the increase of multiple TMPRSS2 forms, corresponding to the N-glycosylated zymogen (~60 kDa), and the two mature forms (~32 kDa and ~28 kDa), typically generated from auto-activation of the protease [43] [44] [45] . Although we did not measure TMPRSS2 activity, these post-translational changes caused by IAV, with increases in mature peptides, may reflect proteolytic autoactivation of the TMPRSS2 zymogen. Alternatively, oxidative stress, which can accompany IAV infections, impacts TMPRSS2 localisation at the plasma membrane and may also cause post-translational modifications of disulfide bonds [46] . Given the uncontested role of TMPRSS2 in the pathogenicity of both IAV and SARS-CoV-2, our data implicates TMPRSS2 in the severity of lung co-infections with IAV and SARS-CoV-2.",

The shedding of ACE2 is mediated by the protease ADAM17 (TACE) [48, 49] ; although in Vero E6 cells this enhanced SARS-CoV uptake, and the role of ADAM17 in this function remains controversial [39, 45, 48, 50] . In turn, there is robust evidence that ACE2 cleavage from cell surface, by reducing its convertase activity, increases angiotensin II with subsequent increased vascular permeability and lung oedema [16] , and reconstitution of ACE2 by administration of full-length peptide reduces lung injury [16, 17, 30, 51] . ADAM17 is activated by inflammatory mediators at the surface of multiple cell types, including lung epithelial cells [52] . We found that concomitantly with upregulation of ADAM17 expression, IAV infection of SAECs decreases intracellular levels of ACE2, changes the electrophoretic mobility of intracellular ACE2 (suggesting that the remaining intracellular ACE2 is of a lower molecular weight) and induces the appearance of an ACE2 fragment in media applied apically to cells. A similar change in intracellular ACE2 was reported in a study following IAV infection of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-2Z and embryonic kidney cell line 293T. However, the shift was attributed to ACE2 cleavage by IAV proteases and proteasomal degradation, rather than shedding, as ACE2 was not detected in supernatants [53] . The marked increases in shedding of ACE2 from SAECs infected with IAV (at concentrations similar to those used by LIU et al. [53] ) suggests that IAV effects may be cell type-specific, although we did not exclude the possibility that IAV proteases are also implicated in the ACE2 post-translational changes in our study. Pre-exposure of cells to e-cigarette did not alter (augment) their response to IAV, although it tended to increase ACE2 fragment secretion into apical supernatant, suggesting either a maximal effect of IAV, or that longer exposure to e-cigarette vaping than utilised in this study may be needed induce ACE2.",

Given the predicted seasonality of respiratory viruses, there is concern about coincidental waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection with flu seasons [56] . Our study provides evidence that IAV infection may be a risk factor for enhanced infectivity of the human lower airways and for increased severity of lung disease induced by SARS-CoV-2 (schematic in figure 5 ). These findings may contribute to increased impetus to encourage influenza virus vaccination of those at high risk of COVID-19.",
