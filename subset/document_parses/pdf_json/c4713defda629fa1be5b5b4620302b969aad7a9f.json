Correlative analysis suggested that serum IL-17 was associated with clinical physiologic indicators among CAP patients. Logistic regression indicated that serum IL-17 was positively related to CAP severity scores. Additionally, the prognostic outcomes were tracked among CAP patients. The levels of IL-17 on admission were significantly increased in CAP patients with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive agent, death and longer hospitalization days. Logistic regression analyses revealed serum higher IL-17 on admission elevated the risks of vasoactive agent usage and longer hospital stays in CAP patients. The cut-off concentrations of serum IL-17 for death, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and \u2265 14 hospital stays were 86.80 ng/mL, 84.92 ng/mL, 84.92 ng/mL and 60.29 ng/mL respectively.",

[1] . CAP always causes immune system disorders, local and systemic higher inflammatory responses in patients [2] . CAP is consistently a leading cause of respiratory illness around the world [3, 4] . It disproportionately affects adults older than 60 years old or children younger than five years old. CAP has resulted in over 60,000 deaths annually and more than 10 billion dollars health care costs in United States [4] [5] [6] [7] . Patients with mild infections are less likely to seek medical attention and diagnosis. Therefore, the true incidence of CAP may be underestimated [8] . If the diagnosis and treatment were not conducted timely and properly, the rate of fatality will rise sharply [9] . Although validated pneumonia severity scores can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy, appropriate indicators as biomarkers for CAP may further assist with risk stratification. Therefore, a typical biomarker is imminently explored to improve early clinical diagnosis and decrease the complications. As we know, early detection of CAP is critical in improving prognosis for CAP patients.",

Finally, IL-17 produces a range of proinflammatory cytokines and induces inflammatory reaction in the bodies [12, 13] . Past works have indicated that IL-17 is highly expressed in rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis [14, 15] . IL-17 also has been shown to play central roles in the process of several lung diseases, including lung fibrosis, emphysema, acute lung injury and pulmonary hypertension [16] [17] [18] [19] . Moreover, in vitro research has confirmed that IL-17 overexpression or recombinant IL-17 administration elevates chemokines and evokes inflammatory reaction of lung [20, 21] .",

All CAP patients were eligible for this research. After obtaining informed consent from the patients, we gathered relevant demographic characteristics and clinical information. At the onset of CAP, CAP patients always showed specific symptoms and signs, primarily including fever, cough, expectoration, and even purulent sputum; with or without chest pain; chest tightness and dyspnea in CAP patients with affected multiple pulmonary lobes. All selected 239 CAP patients in this research must meet certain diagnostic standard: In accord with the clinical manifestations of pneumonia and consistent with chest CT scans, mainly including (1) chest radiograph suggesting either a new patchy infiltrate, leaf or segment consolidation, ground glass opacity or interstitial change; (2) at least one of the following signs: the presence of cough, sputum production and dyspnoea; core body temperature higher than 38.0 \u00b0C; auscultatory findings of abnormal breath sounds and rales; or the counts of white blood cell more than 10 \u00d7 10 9 L or less than 4 \u00d7 10 9 L; (3) occurred in the community, rather than in a hospital [22] . The inclusion criteria were as follows: pneumonia was occurred in the community or within a definite incubation period after hospitalization; these candidates were not admitted to the hospital for the last three months; not pregnant; no other pulmonary diseases, such as pulmonary malignant tumor, pulmonary tuberculosis or immunodeficiency [23, 24] ; no antibiotic treatment or intervention before hospitalization. Peripheral blood samples were collected and anticoagulated with EDTA within 24 h after hospitalization. Blood routine examination and biochemical detection were performed in all CAP patients. Then, the severity of pneumonia was evaluated using well-recognized CAP severity scores, including Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), CURB-65, CRB-65, SMART-COP and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II). Moreover, CAP patients were divided into mild patients and severe patients through CURXO score. Severe CAP is a group of patients who requires treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). Our research has obtained approval from Ethics Committee of Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (YX2021-085). Furthermore, written agreement consent from eligible patients or the patient's next of kin were obtained.",

The research mainly found that: (1) Serum IL-17 on admission was gradually risen in parallel with CAP severity scores; (2) IL-17 on admission was closely correlated with many clinicopathological features among CAP patients; (3) IL-17 on admission was positively correlated with CAP severity scores in CAP patients; (4) Serum higher IL-17 on admission elevated the risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, death and longer length of hospitalization among CAP patients during hospitalization. IL-17, one of robust pro-inflammatory cytokines, which takes part in the airway inflammation, is a central factor in the excessive activation of the body's defense system and the excessive inflammatory response [26] . The past studies demonstrated that IL-17 plays key roles in the progression of several lung diseases, including lung fibrosis, emphysema, acute lung injury and pulmonary hypertension [16] [17] [18] [19] . Serum IL-17 is increased in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and participates in the occurrence of pneumonia [27, 28] . Nevertheless, the role of IL-17 in CAP was ill-defined so far. Therefore, we tested the levels of serum IL-17 among CAP patients with different severity scores. In the current research, we discovered that the level of IL-17 was gradually increased in parallel with the CAP severity scores among CAP patients. In addition, logistic and linear regression analysis indicated that IL-17 was positively associated with CAP severity scores among CAP patients. These findings indicated that IL-17 is positively correlated with the severity of CAP patients. The previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that blood routine indices are obviously changed and the count of lymphocyte is dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients [29] [30] [31] . Therefore, the associations of serum IL-17 and blood routine indices were evaluated among CAP patients in this cohort study. There were remarkable positive correlations between IL-17 with WBC and neutrophil, inverse correlations between IL-17 with lymphocyte and eosinophil in CAP patients. Moreover, our studies found that multiple organ dysfunction syndromes are always associated with the process of CAP [32] [33] [34] . IL-17 was positively correlated with uric acid, urea nitrogen, ALT, AST, CKMB and LDH among CAP patients. It is widely known that the occurrence of CAP is due to the invasion of pathogens, inflammatory cytokines and toxic metabolite [35] . Exorbitant inflammation evokes a serious of expanded cascade reaction, leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes [9, 36] . Other research groups have revealed that cytokine storm is observed in COVID-19 patients and inflammation suppression alleviated the severity of COVID-19 [37, 38] . In our present research, IL-17 was also shown to be prominently and positively related with inflammatory cytokines in CAP patients. These findings revealed that serum IL-17 may involve in the process of CAP and may be regarded as a biomarker for diagnosis and therapy for CAP patients.",

A research based on Chinese population found that IL-17 gene polymorphism is correlated with the risk and prognosis among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [39] . Several researches revealed that higher circulatory IL-17 is associated with the poor prognosis in patients with glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma [40, 41] . So, the association of IL-17 and the prognosis was estimated in CAP patients. Our results reflected that IL-17 on admission was elevated in CAP patients with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive agent, death and longer hospital stays during hospitalization. Logistic regression analysis revealed that serum higher IL-17 on admission was positively associated with the adverse prognostic outcomes among CAP patients. These results showed that the level of serum IL-17 on admission may predict the prognostic outcomes of CAP patients.",

We found that IL-17 is gradually increased in parallel with the severity scores of CAP. Serum IL-17 is positively correlated with the severity and poor prognosis among CAP patients. The findings of this study indicated that IL-17 may be implicated in the pathophysiology processes of CAP. Therefore, it is likely that serum IL-17 may become an effective biomarker of diagnosis, prognosis and therapy for CAP patients in the future clinical works.",
