The resulting liver elastography analysis sample consisted of 7,923 persons (Supplemental Figure 1 ). Of these, 7,396 (93.6%) had complete liver elastography and 527 were considered by the NCHS to have a partial examination because of fasting < 3 hours (n=248), 1 to <10 valid measures obtained (n=99), or a stiffness IQR/median \u2265 30% (n=180) (Supplemental Table 1 ). Higher BMI, stiffness, and CAP of participants in the latter two groups suggested they had potentially more severe liver injury; consequently, as in our previous NHANES 2017-2018 analysis we included them in our current analysis to reflect the full range of U.S. representative population liver disease. 21 Analyses including fasting laboratory measures were conducted among morning examined fasted participants (n=3,576).",

We evaluated characteristics of participants with complete and partial liver elastography by comparing continuous factor means (standard deviations (SD)) using analysis of variance and categorical factor percentages using chi-square (\u03c7 2 ) tests or linear regression. Unadjusted relationships of fatty liver disease and fibrosis with demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and social characteristics were examined by comparing continuous factor means (SD) using t-tests and categorical factor percentages using chi-square (\u03c7 2 ) tests. Age-adjusted relationships were explored using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine relationships of fatty liver disease and fibrosis with participant characteristics after adjustment for all other factors in the model. Age, sex, and race-ethnicity were retained in models. A biological plausibility approach was followed to test anthropometric measures (BMI, BMI and waist-to-hip ratio, and waist circumference), metabolic factors (diabetes, total and HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and CAP (for liver stiffness models)), liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and GGT), lifestyle factors (alcohol use, smoking, physical activity, and diet), and social factors (education, income, and health insurance coverage) for inclusion in models. 28 For factors that were highly correlated, the measure that explained the greatest variance (R 2 ) was selected. Factors were retained in final models if p<0.10. Factors that were not normally distributed were expressed as deciles (10 th percentiles) for regression analyses using cut points shown in Supplemental Table   2 . P-values were two-sided, and P<0.05 indicated statistical significance. Sample weights accounted for unequal selection probabilities and nonresponse. Variance calculations accounted for survey design effects using Taylor series linearization. 29 SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN 11 (RTI, Research Triangle Park, NC) were used.",

In this representative U.S. population sample with transient elastography, the prevalence of fatty liver disease using a CAP cut point of >300 dB/m was high (28.8%) and requires scalable management approaches at a population level. [5] [6] The prevalence of fibrosis, defined as liver stiffness >8 kPa, was also high overall (10.4%), especially among persons with fatty liver disease (22.8%). Fatty liver disease prevalence estimates ranged from 35.1% using a cut point of 285 dB/m, to 47.8% with a cut point of 263 dB/m, to over half of the U.S. population (56.7%) using a cut point of 248 dB/m in analyses of NHANES 2017-2018. [18] [19] Prevalence of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis was even higher among some U.S. population groups, such as persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 30 The fibrosis prevalence estimated in the general U.S. population was higher compared with a Dutch population study that used the same liver stiffness cut point of 8.0 kPa (10.4% vs. 6.0%), despite the older age of the Dutch population sample (45 years and over). 9 Among European population-based studies using transient elastography for screening with cut points ranging from 7.9 kPa to 9.6 kPa, fibrosis prevalence varied from 2.4% to 7.5%. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] Among Asian population studies with cut points ranging from 5.9 kPa to 9.6 kPa, fibrosis prevalence varied from 2.0% to 14.3%. 31 This article is a US Government work.

Currently, there is insufficient awareness of the growing NAFLD burden among both the public and the health care providers caring for them. A recent global survey of physicians' knowledge about NAFLD found a significant knowledge gap for the identification, diagnosis, and management of NAFLD, especially among primary care providers who are often the first to see patients at risk for NAFLD. 42 To address this challenge, a Clinical Care Pathway has recently been developed by the American Gastroenterological Association to provide guidance on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of NAFLD. 6 We found associations with known fatty liver disease risk factors, including age, non-Hispanic Asian race-ethnicity, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, pre-diabetes and diabetes, total cholesterol, blood pressure, C-reactive protein and ALT, and inverse relationships with non-Hispanic black raceethnicity and HDL cholesterol. Fibrosis was associated with BMI, diabetes, blood pressure, AST, CAP, and total cholesterol (inverse). Lower cholesterol among persons with fibrosis was previously reported using earlier NHANES data. 13, 43 In the current analysis we also examined lifestyle factors and found that persons with fatty liver disease were less likely to meet physical activity guidelines, more likely to be sedentary for 12 or more hours a day, and self-reported a less healthy diet. Fatty liver disease prevalence was highest among persons with both a lower level of physically activity and a higher level of sedentary behavior. Associations with physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet were only partially explained after accounting for demographic, clinical, and other lifestyle factors. Similar associations were seen for fibrosis, though relationships with physical activity and sedentary behavior did not remain after for use under a CC0 license.",

Further analysis of persons who fasted revealed a stronger association of sedentary behavior with fatty liver disease and fibrosis suggesting that accounting for triglycerides and/or insulin may have augmented this relationship similar to an earlier CDC report that sedentary behavior was associated with higher insulin levels in the U.S. population. 44 The higher fatty liver disease and fibrosis prevalence among persons with detrimental lifestyle habits was seen across sex and race-ethnicity groups, although differences did not reach statistical significance among all groups due to heterogeneity and smaller sample sizes.

Further analysis of persons who fasted revealed a stronger association of income with fibrosis.A limitation of the use of transient elastography is the lack of universally accepted cut points for identifying hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in the general population. This limits the ability to compare fatty liver disease and fibrosis prevalence and associations across studies. We used previously reported and validated cut points for our analysis.26 Another limitation was the sole use of self-reported diet healthiness as a measure of diet quality because 24-hour dietary recall data have not yet been released for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 prepandemic survey cycle.",

Strengths include avoidance of ascertainment bias found in clinical studies of conveniently selected patients and ability to generalize results to U.S. population ethnic-racial groups that are differentially represented in most studies. Other benefits include the well-characterized sample and wealth of data available on potential fatty liver disease risk factors including socioeconomic status.In conclusion, fatty liver disease and fibrosis prevalence are high in the U.S. population and most persons are unaware of having liver disease. Fatty liver disease can progress to severe fibrosis with increased risk of liver-related complications and death.3,4 Consequently, a multi-pronged approach toward a unified public health response is needed, including risk stratification by primary care providers. Given that changes in lifestyle factors might positively influence the fatty liver disease burden, there is an urgent need for screening and fatty liver disease management in high-risk individuals using transient elastography or other noninvasive methods to intervene in disease progression.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is a funding collaborator with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through the United States Government Interagency Agreement (IAA) Number 15006 (also known as IAA# 164 at NCHS).Financial Support: The work was supported by a contract from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (HHSN275201700074U).for use under a CC0 license.",
