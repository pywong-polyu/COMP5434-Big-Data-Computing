Our response to the COVID-19 not only provides us with tools for confronting influenza; it also changes our sense of what is possible. The recognition of how dramatic policy responses to COVID-19 were and how widespread their general acceptance has been allowed us to imagine new and more sweeping responses to influenza. In fact, we not only can grasp how we can reduce its toll; this new knowledge entails new responsibilities to do so. We outline a range of potential interventions to alter social norms and to change structures to reduce influenza transmission, and consider ethical objections to our proposals.",

We will then turn to the on-going challenge of seasonal flu, describing the extent of the problem it poses before putting forward proposals, many inspired by responses to COVID-19, for addressing it. The proposals are of two broad types: changes in structures, especially structures within the power of government and other regulators, and changes in norms. By changes in structures, we have in mind changes to regulatory frameworks, taxation law, policies governing education and employment: for example, we advocate paid parental leave to allow for the care of sick children, incentives for vaccines, moving to online education when a school suffers an outbreak and so on. By changes in norms, we have in mind changes to social attitudes to illness and those who are ill; our central example is our attitude toward those who continue to work when ill.",

We will examine the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and influenza. The differences between them entail differences in the kinds of responses warranted. Unsurprisingly, some of these differences entail that more radical measures are justified in response to COVID-19 than to influenza. More surprisingly, in some cases, they have the opposite implication.",

We are forced to make assumptions about the virus and its properties, and these assumptions may be wrong. We still do not have a good idea of the infection fatality rate of the virus: the number of people who will die after contracting it. Initial figures were 0.66 per cent (Verity et al., 2020) , but more recently, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimated that it could be as low as 0.1 per cent. 1 Nor do we have any reliable estimate on the extent of morbidity doi:10.1093/phe/phab008 in survivors.

The magnitude of the benefits is difficult or impossible to measure, given the current state of knowledge and the magnitude of the costs are also unknown. The lockdowns have resulted in a recession that seems certain to be long-lasting and severe, and recessions themselves have significant effects on morbidity and mortality. The 2008 recession seems to have resulted in at least 10,000 extra suicides in Europe and North America (Reeves et al., 2014) and more than 250,000 extra cancerrelated deaths in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (Maruthappu et al., 2016) . On the other hand, there is evidence that during a recession, all-cause mortality tends to fall (Ballester et al., 2019) . The apparent conflict between these findings remains unresolved. Perhaps recessions result in a spike in mortality, but that spike is delayed. Moreover, little is known about the effects of a recession in the developed world on the developing world (Peeples, 2019) , though some forecasts have been dire (Ahmed, 2020) . Engaging in responsible assessment of interventions in the face of these unknowns is, to say the least, challenging.",

Even on the current lowest estimates of its infection fatality rate (0.1 per cent), it is roughly 10 times as bad as the flu. Rather than downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19, we want to emphasize the deadliness of influenza: its costs in mortality, morbidity and in social and economic terms.

But the burden of disease is significant in developed countries too. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the 2018-2019 flu season resulted in more than 34,000 deaths in the USA. This includes 136 children with confirmed diagnoses, but the CDC notes that influenza-related paediatric deaths are likely underreported (CDC, 2020b). The 2018-2019 flu season was rated as moderate.

It is possible that in the future influenza's toll will greatly outstrip COVID's. That depends, in important part, on the future trajectory of COVID. It may be eliminated through a vaccine or through the development of herd immunity. Or it may become endemic, like other coronaviruses. If it becomes endemic, its virulence may fall, again like other coronaviruses. There are possible futures in which the virus remains a significant killer, and others in which it kills few or none. In most of these scenarios, influenza will be a bigger killer than COVID over time. Of course, in all these scenarios, it will also continue to be a major economic and social burden-it is estimated to cost an average of $11.2 billion annually in the USA alone (Putri et al., 2018) .

If such bearers are aware that future harms can be confidently predicted and that there are actions available to them that can significantly reduce these harms (without entailing larger costs), then they have a prima facie responsibility to take these actions. This is a responsibility they can avoid only if others are better placed than they are to take these actions, or if those on whom the harms will fall deserve them. Neither of these escape clauses are available with regard to influenza. Governments, workplaces and individuals are now in a position to grasp the harms that stem from influenza and to take effective action to reduce them significantly. Consequently, the pandemic has transformed our responsibilities, including our responsibility to fight influenza. 2 Combatting seasonal flu (and other infectious disease) more effectively than in the past will require a change in social norms, as well as in economic and social structures. Below we outline some of the changes that might be warranted by the seriousness of the burden it represents. We caution that in the space available, we are unable to offer full defences of any specific proposal. We do not doubt that some will face significant objections we have not contemplated and that other proposals may prove to be better justified. We offer them as plausible suggestions and to spur further work on the topic.",

This may occur for multiple reasons. A central impetus stems from a rational assessment of the potential costs of taking time off. Self-employed people may simply go unpaid; those on zero-hour contracts risk losing their shifts permanently and those with apparently more stable employment risk being seen as unreliable (Kinman, 2019) .

Sick employees are less productive than healthy ones, so encouraging them to stay at home might not represent a large loss in workplace productivity. Moreover, those who are suffering from an infectious disease are at risk of spreading it, thereby lowering the productivity of those around them. They are also more likely to make mistakes or cause accidents, sometimes at an extremely high cost. For all these reasons, the costs of presenteeism to the workplace may be higher than the benefits of having sick employees come to work; perhaps much higher (Garrow, 2016) .

These additional costs provide incentives to governments and other regulators to encourage or mandate better protections for workers. These might take the form of guaranteed sick days and a requirement that they are taken, and protection against losing shifts or employment due to taking them. Government might go further, itself paying for sick days, directly or by payment or tax reduction to the employer. A number of governments around the world currently offer compensation for people who must self-isolate due to COVID-19 and who will thereby lose income.

It enables the employee to continue to feel productive and connected to the workplace and costs to their health may be zero or very close to it. Working from home also has positive externalities, such as a reduction in pressure on roads and emissions from car use. Extended use might have significant costs, such as a sense of isolation, but its occasional use for a short period does not pose these problems.",

A number of countries now require tobacco companies to sell cigarettes in packs with prominent and specific health warnings and confronting images of damaged organs and other health problems displayed.

Nudging much more widespread use of vaccines might change social norms by building on this appreciation in the context of influenza. At the time of writing, there are several very promising candidates for a vaccine against COVID-19, and the UK has given emergency approval to two of them. However, vaccine development is far more advanced for the flu than for COVID. Because the influenza virus (or more properly viruses) mutates from year to year, the vaccine must be continually updated and effectiveness is, on average, moderate (Castilla et al., 2016) . Moreover, the protective benefits of vaccines are smaller for some of the most vulnerable people (Henry et al., 2019) . Nevertheless, the vaccine already reduces the burden of the disease very significantly and wider usage would certainly have a large effect, but uptake remains low (Wang et al., 2018) , even among health professionals . Myths about vaccines are a significant barrier to uptake (Giubilini, 2019) , as is a lack of personal vulnerability. Conversely, a sense of responsibility to others is a significant predictor of uptake .",

'Costs' may refer to financial costs and the opportunity costs of expenditures; equally it may refer to losses of liberty or opportunities for self-cultivation. The same considerations apply to 'benefits'. Allowing for broad and ecumenical measures of costs and benefits ensures the need for judgment in weighing costs and benefits. What weight does one assign to the restriction in liberty represented by, say, mandatory mask-wearing? How does one weigh that restriction against the risk of the loss of a life; indeed, how does one go about measuring the cost of a lost life? Should all lives count the same, or should lost lives be weighted for age or quality of remaining years? These judgements are value judgements. We take it that the need for such judgements is inescapable, and that there can be reasonable disagreements about them. However, we also believe that some disagreements would be unreasonable: a clear-eyed appreciation of the facts about the diseases and possible responses provides us with guidance that sets the bounds for what kinds of responses are appropriate.",

As the figures, we quoted above clearly show, it is certainly a serious challenge: thousands of people die from the flu every year. But measures designed to prevent flu deaths must be sensitive to the costs. Lockdowns are unlikely to be justified in most flu seasons, for two reasons. One involves a contestable value judgment: lockdowns may be unjustified to combat flu because the restriction of liberties involved is a cost that is high Flu is very familiar and recessive in thinking May tend to cause an underestimation of the risks of flu relative to COVID (and absolutely) enough to outweigh the benefits. The second is more straightforwardly empirical: lockdowns have costs measured in terms of health (delayed visits to physicians, lack of exercise, mental health burden, increases in domestic violence), and the ill-health that results from a lockdown can be justified only if it saves more lives than it costs. 5 Because the flu has a high cost, in terms of ill-health and death, somewhat restrictive measures may be justifiable, but less restrictive than those justified by COVID-19. It is important to note, however, that mortality is not the only measure of severity. Both diseases are, obviously, unpleasant in their acute form, and the entailed suffering itself justifies measures to prevent and treat them. But COVID-19 is sometimes much more severe, even when it does not lead to long-term problems. More significantly, the phenomenon of 'long COVID'-experiencing a range of health problems long after the virus has cleared the body-is a very significant cost. Post-viral fatigue is also reported with influenza, but the effects seem to be longer-lasting and more severe with COVID. Moreover, there is evidence of damage to the heart, kidneys and other organs (CDC, 2020b). These costs themselves justify more restrictive or costlier responses to the disease than might be justifiable on the grounds of infection fatality rate alone.",

However, the degree to which riskiness limits the type of measure we can employ against influenza may be much smaller than these considerations suggest. First, because influenza has been around much longer than COVID-19, vaccines are less likely to have side-effects that escape detection during trials (for instance, because they arise from unexpected interactions with medications or rare phenotypes). Secondly, to the extent we aim to transfer responses from COVID-19 to influenza, we will be able to benefit from our experience with the former. In effect, the current pandemic will serve as a trial of measures we may be able to utilize in the future. Paradoxically, this fact may entail that some measures are easier to justify as a response to influenza than to the more severe COVID-19 (conversely some measures may be shown to be ineffective or to have unacceptable costs).",

The social engineering objection is an old one, dating back at least as far as conservative objections to Enlightenment proposals for social reform, and focuses on the unintended negative effects of centrally planned attempts to change society for the better (St\u00f8vring, 2014) . While it is tempting to reject this kind of objection as mere status quo bias (Bostrom and Ord, 2006) , to the extent to which it cautions us that all attempts at amelioration have unintended consequences, and it is likely that some of these consequences will be negative, it serves a salutary role. Similar to the 'Playing God' objection to radical biotechnology, it reminds us to proceed cautiously and seek the best inputs in designing interventions, and to be on the lookout for negative effects. We have attempted to be cautious in advocating specific proposals here, in light of the warning it provides. But we do not think any general objection from social engineering has any chance of success. Centrally planned projects for the amelioration of social ills have sometimes gone disastrously wrong: the shortages and waste that characterized the Soviet Union were probably at least partly due to rigid top-down control over the economy. But the history of public health features many successful examples of centrally planned and implemented interventions which together have done more to extend lifespans than have new developments in treatment. A famous example is the construction of the London sewers, in response to the threat of cholera. The works were mandated by an act of parliament, as were many later improvements in the treatment of sewage (Brewer and Pringle, 2015) . The inflexibilities of Soviet central planning need not and should not be replicated by planners.",

The worry, in brief, is that nudges threaten autonomy because they bypass rational deliberation. Rather than give us reasons, they take advantage of the fact that we are 'somewhat mindless, passive decision makers', as Thaler and Sunstein (2008: 37) themselves put it. They rely, allegedly, on our intuitive but unintelligent biases, not rational thought. Since autonomy consists in rational self-government, nudges threaten autonomy (Bovens, 2008; Saghai, 2013; Wilkinson, 2013) . We do not have space fully to respond to this concern here; instead, we point to a fuller discussion elsewhere (Levy, 2019) . In short, we believe the objection goes wrong at the outset: nudges rarely bypass rational cognition. Rather, they (or at any rate typical nudges, including all the nudges typically cited in the literature) work by giving agents genuine, though implicit, evidence in favour of acting as they are nudged. Paradigmatically, they function as implicit recommendations. Nudges typically work by making some option salient to us; for example, selecting a default on an insurance policy makes it salient to us. In doing so, they recommend it to us, and we respond rationally in being guided by that recommendation. As many epistemologists have emphasized, testimony is a good source of evidence for agents and they ought to modulate their beliefs in its light (Coady, 1992; Lackey and Sosa, 2006) .",

They must show that the ethical costs of these proposals (or others, should they prove ineffective or unduly costly) are sufficiently high to justify abandoning proposals that are literally lifesaving. The direct and indirect costs of influenza are so high, year on year, that any effective means of reducing them significantly has a great deal in its favour. Of course, there may be alternative means of securing the benefits our proposal aims at which are less ethically costly. We would welcome such proposals.",

It is worth stepping back from the pandemic and its immediate impact, however, to reflect on what we have learned from our response to it and how what we have learned can guide us in responding to the challenges we will confront when (as we hope and expect) the crisis it represents recedes. We have suggested that our response to COVID-19 provides guidance as to what is possible and advisable in response to other infectious diseases and in particular seasonal influenza. Influenza is not the killer that COVID is-not usually, in any case-but its annual toll is large, and its cumulative burden exceeds COVID-19. Addressing it is not as urgent as addressing COVID-19 (the cumulative toll is not paid at once, of course, so if we delay a year or two, we will still be able to reap most of the benefits) but it nevertheless extremely important.",

It shows us that truly dramatic interventions can be accepted by most people, if the need for them is explained, and therefore assures us that the less dramatic, but nevertheless significant, proposals we envisage are realistic. It also changes our sense of what our levers are. Moreover, we have argued that the new knowledge we have, of what kinds of interventions are possible and what their effects are likely to be, transforms our responsibilities. Once we know that we have the power to prevent significant harms, we acquire the responsibility to do so. This is a responsibility we can avoid only if others are better placed than we are to bear it, or if the harms will befall those who deserve them. While there are many individuals who escape responsibility in the first kind of waythose with few resources, for example, cannot reasonably be expected to alter their lives to help prevent flu-there are many others who cannot. Decision-makers in government and business cannot shirk their new responsibility to help prevent influenza, and most ordinary people have or will acquire a responsibility to play their part, once they are asked to and they are given the opportunity.",

We have suggested that some norm change and structural change should be carried out in and by workplaces, and workplaces are not open to democratic control. This is a particular instance of a much more general problem: the extent to which workplaces exercise sweeping and unaccountable control over their employees (Anderson, 2017) . We recognize this is a serious problem, but we take it neither to be specific to our proposals nor worsened by them. 7. When public resistance should lead to abandoning a policy and when politicians should attempt to implement it in the face of public resistance is a difficult issue. Support for capital punishment, at least as measured by surveys, remains high in many countries which have ended the practice; many ethicists would maintain that in this case politicians are right to resist public pressure. Nevertheless, there should be a presumption that the public settles policy. We suggest that proposals like those we outline might be implemented whether or not there is widespread public support for them, and consideration given to abandoning them if and when public support remains low.",

            "text": "The authors declare they have no conflicts of interest. Notes 1. See https://www.cebm.net/COVID-19/global-COVID-19-case-fatality-rates. The US Canters for Disease Control and Prevention estimates an infection fatality rate of 0.26 per cent (CDC, 2020a). 2. Of course, it might have changed our responsibilities with regard to many other things too. We might have new responsibilities to prevent the emergence of other infectious diseases, for example (perhaps by regulating wet markets), or to change working conditions to combat the inequalities that have become stark during the pandemic. We do not claim that combating influenza is the only or even the most urgent new responsibility to emerge from the crisis. 3. Technological changes-the internet-also lower the costs of self-isolation in other ways, relative to previous decades. The food, goods and entertainment delivery services the internet enables, as well as the new means for staying in touch with friends and families, ensure that measures that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago are now practicable. 4. A common brand of Australian cold medication uses this as its slogan. Interestingly, in 2008 a complaint was brought against this company on the grounds that its advertising encouraged consumers to continue to work and socialize while unwell. The Australian Advertising Standards Board dismissed the complaint, finding that the advertisement did not contravene 'prevailing community standards'. We suggest that that finding was correct, but illustrates the need for a change in the prevailing standards (see https://adstandards.com.au/sites/default/ files/reports/388-08.pdf for the judgment). 5. While we stand by the claim that this kind of judgment is more straightforwardly empirical, it's important to note that scientific values always themselves reflect values. Assessing the health costs of an intervention, for example, requires a careful calibration of evidential thresholds, and such calibration requires judgments about how to weigh false positives versus false negatives. These judgments are inescapably value judgments (Douglas, 2000) .",
