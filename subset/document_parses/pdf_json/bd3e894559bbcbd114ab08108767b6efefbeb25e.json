During training, all CTs for a given patient under conditions described above were included. For testing evaluation, one scan series per patient was considered.

Two classification models were developed for further evaluation (Fig. 1) , one utilizing the entire lung region with fixed input size (full 3D) and one utilizing average score of multiple regions within each lung at fixed image resolution (hybrid 3D).

Implementation of these AI efforts at new institutions are hampered by the tendency for AI to overfit to training populations, including technical bias from institutional-specific scanners to clinical population bias due to regional variation in the use and timing of CT. Therefore, this study was specifically designed to maximize the potential for generalizability. The hypothesis was that an algorithm trained from a highly diverse multinational dataset will maintain sufficient performance accuracy when applied to new centers, compared with algorithms trained and testing in only one center. To achieve this, COVID-19 CT scans were obtained from four hospitals across China, Italy, and Japan, where there was a wide variety in clinical timing and practice for CT acquisition. Such CT indications included screening-based settings (i.e., fever clinics), where patients underwent CT the same day as initial positive PCR (China), but also included advanced disease, such as inpatient hospitalization settings at physician's discretion (Italy). Furthermore, the inclusion of patients undergoing routine clinical CT scans for a variety of indications including acute care, trauma, oncology, and various inpatient settings was designed to expose the algorithm to diverse clinical presentations. Here we achieved 0.949 AUC in a testing population of 1337 patients resulting in 90.8% accuracy for classification of COVID-19 on chest CT. The use of CT scans for the purpose of diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia has been somewhat controversial 16 . In Hubei Province, China, CT scans were used extensively and at presentation, in an effort to quickly diagnose, isolate, and contain the spread of the outbreak. Multiple studies have reported a high degree of sensitivity for chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia 7, 9, 13, 14 . However, multiple radiology and thoracic professional associations in the US and the UK have recommended against using chest CT for screening or for the routine diagnosis of COVID-19, in part due to the potential for overlap with other high prevalence entities such as influenza pneumonia. In this study, the algorithm has a high specificity in such a setting of 93%. Sub-analysis within varying clinical indications for CT scanning demonstrated lower false positive rates in populations undergoing imaging for oncologic diagnosis and follow-up compared with acute and trauma care. Notably, this performance was consistent in the subgroup of RT-PCR confirmed influenza pneumonia, which included cases with H1N1. Thus, given the challenges in confidently distinguishing between COVID-19 associated pneumonia and other types of pneumonia, there may be a role for AI in CT-based diagnosis, characterization, or quantification of response. Performance was observed to be highest in patient cohorts from centers utilizing CT earlier in diagnostic pathway, while settings utilizing CT in cases with advanced pneumonia demonstrated poorer detection sensitivity. Further work regarding the diagnostic utility of this algorithm in the setting of early vs. advanced COVID-19 related pneumonia is warranted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 223, "end": 227, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 228, "end": 232, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 233, "end": 237, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 238, "end": 242, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2060, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2061, "end": 2063, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2064, "end": 2067, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We also sought to maximize the generalizability from a technical standpoint. To reduce the effect of body habitus and extra-thoracic pathology, a lung segmentation algorithm was used to localize to chest cavity and ensure the classification algorithm was focused on the lungs and excluded the presence of factors outside the patient (such as isolation bags around the patients in Hubei). All classification models were trained utilizing an aggressive augmentation scheme to minimize overfitting. While slice-based or hybrid 3D models demonstrated high validation accuracies, the simpler model utilizing single 3D volumes produced the most generalizable framework. Experiments testing the algorithm generalizability demonstrated 79.8% sensitivity could be achieved when the cohort of patients from Japan were excluded from training and only used in testing to evaluate model performance in an unseen domain. While the model performance exhibited a moderate decrease in sensitivity, it appeared to generalize well given the variabilities in CT acquisition and in clinical considerations across multination cohorts.

Model training was limited to patients with positive RT-PCR testing and COVID-19 related pneumonia on chest CT in order to differentiate between COVID-19 related disease and other pathologies. However, CT is often negative despite positive RT-PCR test 21 . Given that viral infectiousness can often predate symptoms, CT plus RT-PCR is likely a more accurate and sensitive strategy than either alone, although this is somewhat speculative 11 . Delayed RT-PCR or limitations in access or availability could also make CT testing more attractive for specific subsets of patients or in a resource constrained environment, such as persons under investigation for exposure history or contact tracing, triage for resource utilization, prognosis, or to assist with isolation compliance, although this is speculative. Finally, our AI algorithm aims to classify chest CT scans as positive vs. negative for COVID-19 pneumonia and in positively classified CT scans, it delivers a saliency map for visualization of AI-associated predictions. While useful for general visualization of AI output, this does not delineate COVID-19 burden, which may be more accurately depicted by segmentation algorithms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The test success metrics are highly dependent upon pretest background prevalence, and testing practices may vary according to exposure rates and phase of pandemic 22 . The prevalence in our constructed testing set was 24%, which may be representative of some outbreak dynamics at the time of writing. We were limited in truly evaluating the generalizability of this model to an independent population, as our positive and negative cases were derived from separate populations. It is also important to note the prevalence and testing conditions of COVID-19 positive patients varied by cohort. In Japan, the patients were a mixture of incidental Diamond Princess cruise ship exposures or community acquired COVID-19, with a diverse multinational population, but all were all PCR positive with CT lesions. In Italy, CT scans practice varied from acute care screening to mainly inpatients, or at the discretion of the treating physician, commonly later in the disease process. In Hubei Province, China, CT scans were routinely obtained on the same day as a positive RT-PCR in an acute setting/fever clinics during the initial outbreak period. RT-PCR was positive in all patients but was not a requisite for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at that time, which could be made with CT and exposure history during peak prevalence during the outbreak.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, an AI system derived from heterogeneous multinational training data delivers acceptable performance metrics for the classification of chest CT for COVID-19 infection.

Table 1 . The timing of CT scan acquisition in relation to onset of COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis varied and was highly dependent on regional/national standard of care.

Patients in the larger Milan cohort underwent CT in more of a screening-like setting at acute presentation with symptoms or exposure history at the point of care. The smaller Milan cohort of 15 patients were largely obtained in an inpatient setting. The most diverse cohort was in Japan, where patients had a mixture of incidental exposures or community acquired COVID-19.
