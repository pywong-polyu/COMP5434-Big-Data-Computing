Less attention has been paid to the work-related antecedents of depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. With regard to physician burnout, new risk factors for burnout may have emerged during the past decades as a consequence of changes in physicians' work environment and developments in technology.

However, the relative importance of these risk factors is unclear because previous studies have typically focused on a single or a few potential determinants of burnout among physicians. The present study addressed this gap in the literature by using dominance analysis to compare the relative importance of several work-related psychosocial factors to physician burnout in a large nationally representative sample of Finnish physicians. Whereas traditional regression techniques are not suitable for this purpose [12] , dominance analysis allows researchers to examine the contribution of multiple correlated predictors to an outcome [13, 14] . To provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential work-related psychosocial antecedents of burnout, we considered several job demands and resources that reflected both established, so-called challenge demands (e.g. time pressure) and newer risk factors, so-called hindrance demands (e.g. stress related to information systems) as well as lack of salient job resources (e.g. lacking social support) for burnout among physicians.",

            "text": "As an initial step, we calculated Cronbach alphas (measure of internal consistency that is used to estimate the reliability of a scale) for each variable and examined bivariate correlations between the variables. For the main analysis, dominance analysis [13, 14] was performed to examine the relative importance of psychosocial factors in predicting exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment (each outcome separately). The method can be used to determine which predictors are most important in terms of their proportional contribution to the explained variance in an outcome [13] . Whereas interpreting regression coefficients from a traditional multiple regression can lead to incorrect conclusions about predictor importance when the predictors are correlated (i.e. are multicollinear) [14] , dominance analysis is robust to multicollinearity. The method computes the change in variance explained (\u0394R 2 ) from adding a specific predictor to all possible subset regression models and then averages the \u0394R 2 across all subsets for each predictor. The approach does not involve any assumptions about the causal order of the predictors. The analyses and data visualizations were conducted in R Statistical Software version 3.6.1 using the packages yhat [20] and ggplot2 [21] .",

Overall, particularly time pressure and patient-related stress emerged as important predictors of physician burnout, accounting for around half of the total variance explained in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, respectively. A major strength of the study is that we examined the dimensions of burnout instead of the total burnout score or a binary variable for burnout caseness. Because the three dimensions are distinct constructs [2] , combining them to form an overall burnout score could obscure the associations of interest. Other strengths of the study are its relatively large sample size and the inclusion of several established and newer risk factors as potential predictors of physician burnout. However, several limitations need to be considered when interpreting the results. The study was based on cross-sectional data, which does not allow drawing causal inferences. The cross-sectional design is susceptible to reverse causality, meaning that having burnout symptoms could lead to perceptions of high job demands and low job resources. Because we used self-report measures, there is a possibility that common method variance inflated the observed associations. The data included only a few measures of job resources. For example, support was measured as a job demand (i.e. lack of support) rather than as a job resource due to the wording of the questionnaire. Furthermore, the reliability of the lack of support scale was low, below the conventional cut-off of 0.7 for Cronbach alpha. The use of complete case analysis may have introduced bias in the results.",

It is worth noting that as a result of accumulated evidence on the divergent and minor role of personal accomplishment in burnout [29] , in more recent burnout instruments, this dimension has been removed (e.g. Oldenburg Burnout Inventory) or replaced by more recognized burnout symptoms of cognitive and emotional impairment (e.g. Burnout Assessment Tool).",

Approximately 85% of the total variance explained in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization was accounted by various job demands, whereas the remaining 15% was accounted by (lack of) various job resources, such as poor job control and poor team climate. This suggests that reducing job demands may be a useful strategy to protect physicians from burnout. However, job demands are relatively inherent to the situation and workplace and, therefore, difficult to change. Job resources, in turn, represent more alterable job characteristics [30] . Therefore, in the shorter term, it might be useful to focus on enhancing various job resources (e.g. colleague and supervisor support) in physicians' work and in the longer term, also on building professional resources, such as skills and collaborative practices in meeting difficult patient situations. By increasing job resources, it would be possible to also mitigate the negative impacts of various job demands. ",
