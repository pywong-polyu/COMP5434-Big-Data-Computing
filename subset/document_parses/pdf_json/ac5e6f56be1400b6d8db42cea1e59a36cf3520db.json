The availability of genomic data in a public repository like GISAID 4 also provides wider access to the resources and enables researchers across the globe to address pertinent hypotheses.

The cluster potentially arose from a single outbreak followed by a rapid spread across the country.

After removal of low quality sequences, the dataset resulted in a total of 1377 genomes submitted from 16 institutions (including 275 out of our 303 genomes, Supplementary Data 2). The genomes isolated from India were found to be classified under 7 clusters (Figure 1). 6 of these clusters are known clades identified by Nextstrain: A1a, A2a, A3, B, B1, and B4. 17 The first and the major cluster encompassed 1143 (83%) of genomes which fell into the A2a clade.

A total of 149 genomes of the 160 genomes (93%) in the cluster shared the combination of variants. This unique combination of variants was shared by none of the other genomes which were assigned to any other clade.We further analysed the global datasets for identifying the genomes which displayed matches for all 4 variants which defined the Clade I/A3i. Our prospective search retrieved a total of 362 high-quality genomes(Supplementary Data 5). Of the retrieved genomes, the largest number of genomes originated from Singapore which had 219 genomes and constituted 53% of the high-quality genomes from Singapore. The other genomes originated from a number of countries including Malaysia, Australia, USA, Canada, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Philippines, Oman, Guam, and Saudi Arabia.

The nucleotide substitution rate suggests that the evolution of the I/A3i clade is largely determined by changes in the structural proteins -Nucleocapsid (N) and Membrane (M)genes, compared to the A2a, the globally predominant clade, which is determined by changes in the Spike (S) genes(Table 1).Estimating time to most recent common ancestor and age of the clusterThe date of the most recent ancestor for the dataset of all Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes, with WH1 genome sequence included, was computed using BEAST. The median tMRCA was found to be 10 December 2019 (95% HPD 24 November to 24 December), confirming the previous estimates of the origin of the epidemic in Wuhan city of China.19 tMRCA for the I/A3i clade, as well as the A2a clade, which constituted the majority of samples, was also computed. The clade A2a, which is the predominant clade in India had a tMRCA of 15 Jan 2020 (95% HPD Interval 25 Dec 2019 -2 Feb 2020), while the clade I/A3i had a tMRCA of 26 Jan 2020 (95% HPD Interval 1 Jan 2020 -15 Feb 2020).",

Three variants which define Clade I/A3i, C6312A, C13730T and C28311T resulted in amino acid changes with potentially deleterious functional consequences as predicted by SIFT and mapped to conserved genomic loci in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table 2). One of these variants, A97V in the RDRP protein (corresponds to A88V in ORF1b) is located in its NiRAN domain, which is suggested to be important in RNA binding and nucleotidylation activity.20 Both SIFT and PROVEAN analyses suggest that the effect of this mutation is deleterious in nature, however, as both Alanine and Valine are hydrophobic amino acids, the exact effect of the mutation needs to be experimentally validated. Of notable significance is the P13L variant (C28311T) in the Nucleocapsid protein which is required for the viral entry into the cells. The variant maps to the IDR domain of the N protein and SIFT predicts the variant to be deleterious, though the PROVEAN analysis categorized it as a neutral mutation.",

Considering all the genomic data available from India, the I/A3i clade is represented in 446 genomes (22%) and represented from 17 of the 20 states from which the genomes originated. The geographical distribution and the proportion of the Clade I/A3i isolates are depicted in Figure 3. The states of Delhi, Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have the highest proportions of this clade, followed by Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (Supplementary Data 6). Temporal shifts in the prevalent clades Following the initial outbreak of COVID19 in India, most of the samples collected in the months of March and April belonged to the I/A3i clade (Figure 4A). In fact, it was the predominant clade in almost all the states from where data was collected in March and April, with the exception of West Bengal and Gujarat. However, by late April and early May, a shift in the prevalent clade was observed. All states except Delhi showed an increased representation of the A2a clade (Figure 4B). Interestingly, in Gujarat, the most prominent clade remained A2a throughout the period of April to July, with meagre representation of I/A3i and B4 clades. Odisha is a mixed bag during the month of May, with almost equal representation of I/A3i, A2a, and B4 clades. However, recent samples collected from Odisha in the month of June all belonged to A2a clade. Further sample collection and sequencing is needed to assess this shift in the predominance of clades reliably.",
