Combined ectopic expression in human hepatoma cells impeded HCV uptake and cooperatively mediated transcriptional dysregulation of a noncanonical program of immunity genes. Murine hepatocyte expression of both factors was constitutive and not interferon inducible, while differences in liver expression and the ability to restrict HCV were observed between the murine orthologs and their human counterparts. Genetic ablation of endogenous Cd302 expression in human HCV entry factor transgenic mice increased hepatocyte permissiveness for an adapted HCV strain and dysregulated expression of metabolic process and host defense genes. These findings highlight human-mouse differences in liver-intrinsic antiviral immunity and facilitate the development of next-generation murine models for preclinical testing of HCV vaccine candidates.",

            "text": "This study aimed to identify restriction factors suppressing HCV replication in the murine liver. To this end, we screened a cDNA library generated from the liver of an interferon (IFN)-treated mouse. The library was packaged in lentiviral/VSV-glycoprotein-enveloped pseudoparticles and transduced into n4mBid cells (S0), followed by two rounds of selection (S2) with cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc, strain Jc1) (Fig. 1A) . The human n4mBid cell line is a genetically modified Huh-7.5 derivative with an HCV-triggered cell death phenotype: n4mBid cells are highly permissive for HCV but undergo apoptosis upon HCV replication due to NS3-4A protease-mediated cleavage of a modified Bid protein (13). Two rounds of selection with HCV were performed, and surviving cells were expanded after each round of selection. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiling of cell population S0, the initial n4mBid cell population after delivery of the cDNA library, and cell population S2, the population of cells after two consecutive challenges with HCV, revealed 1 to 2% of reads mapped to the mouse transcriptome ( fig. S1 ), representing the integrated cDNA library. The majority of these integrated genes were protein coding loci ( fig. S1 ). Infection with Renilla luciferase (R-luc) reporter HCV (genotype 2a, strain Jc1) revealed that S2 cells were 200-fold less permissive for HCV when compared to S0, while susceptibility for human coronavirus R-luc infection (strain 229E) remained unaffected (Fig. 1B) . To identify the determinants of this phenotype, comparative analyses of human cellular and lentivirally transduced mouse transcriptomes from S0 and S2 cell populations were performed. No depletion of known human HCV dependency factors was apparent ( fig. S1 ), while enrichment of mRNAs representing a subset of integrated murine genes was observed. Ten murine genes met our inclusion criteria for enrichment [S2 reads per kilobase per million bases mapped (RPKM) value >100, \u2212log 10 P > 5] (Fig. 1C , left) and were individually investigated via lentiviral overexpression and subsequent infection with firefly luciferase (F-luc) reporter HCV (strain Jc1) (Fig. 1C, right) . Subsequently, we focused on the two most potent HCV restrictors: murine Cd302 (also known as Dcl-1 and Clec13a) and Cr1l [complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1-like; also known as Crry]. Both were strongly enriched during HCV selection and abundantly expressed in the S2 population-in addition, their ectopic expression reduced HCV infection by greater than 50%.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects 71 million people worldwide, resulting in 400,000 deaths per year (1) . Despite major advances in antiviral treatment, no vaccine for HCV is available, and with ca. 1.75 million new infections in 2015, virus transmission rates remain high (2) . HCV can establish chronic infections in the human liver, causing progressive liver damage and leading to severe complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In general, viruses are usually well adapted to their host, and cross-species transmissions can be limited by host factor incompatibilities and restriction fac-tors (3) . Tropism and pathogenesis depend on exploitation of host factors supporting infection and evasion of cellular antiviral mechanisms (4, 5) . HCV naturally infects only humans, preventing studies of progressive immunopathogenesis or preclinical testing of novel therapeutics in an immunocompetent animal model. Recently, in attempts to address this problem, related viruses infecting diverse species have been repurposed as infection models for hepaciviruses (6) (7) (8) (9) in their natural hosts. However, these viruses are substantially divergent from their human-infecting counterpart, HCV, limiting their usefulness for clinical infection research. Previous work only either mCd302 or mCr1l was considerably greater than that observed for human NOS2, a described anti-HCV factor (14) . Combined mCd302/mCr1l expression enhanced the antiviral effect, suggesting that these proteins may act in concert, with RLU counts 200-fold reduced compared to the control cell line (Fig. 1D ). Next, we performed infections of murine restriction factor-expressing cell lines with a panel of R-luc reporter HCV chimeras, encoding core-NS2 from genotypes 1 to 7 and NS3-NS5B from strain JFH-1. These strains encompass the genetic and antigenic diversity apparent in the structural proteins from globally sampled HCV isolates. We observed varied but potent restriction of infection by all HCV genotypes (Fig. 1E ). In general, in agreement with genotype 2a infections, combined mCd302/mCr1l restriction was more potent than either factor alone. Infection of Huh-7.5 cells overexpressing mCd302 and mCr1l (individually or in combination) with nonreporter HCV (strain Jc1) revealed an identical restriction phenotype to that observed with reporter HCV (Fig. 1F) : A marked reduction of both intracellular viral RNA (vRNA, top) or secreted virions (bottom) was apparent at 72 hours post-infection (hpi) when compared to control cells. To confirm that mCd302 and mCr1l also restrict patientderived primary isolates, we ectopically expressed human SEC14L2 in Huh-7.5 cells, which was previously shown to facilitate the propagation of primary HCV isolates in tissue culture (15) . Huh-7.5-SEC14L2 cells supported infection with sera of patients infected with genetically diverse HCV subtypes (1a, 1b, and 3a), which could be suppressed with daclatasvir-an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A phosphoprotein. Combining ectopic SEC14L2 expression with either mCd302 or mCr1l, we observed that both murine factors restrict infection of Huh-7.5 cells with HCV patient isolates (Fig. 1G) .",

To investigate whether HCV infection was impeded at an early stage of the viral life cycle, we infected cells with lentiviral pseudoparticles decorated with HCV envelope proteins (HCVpps) from different strains (Con1 and UKN2B2.8) and compared them to HCVcc infections (Fig. 2B) . These data revealed an entry-specific effect only for mCd302 but not for mCr1l alone. However, entryspecific restriction of mCd302 was further enhanced by coexpression with mCr1l, indicating that both factors act cooperatively to impede HCVpp entry. The level of restriction on HCVpp entry was 10-to 20-fold less than that observed for HCVcc infection. This could be due to differences between authentic virions and HCVpps including differences in envelope glycoprotein membrane incorporation, envelope lipid composition, N-linked glycosylation, lipoprotein Cell lines ectopically expressing the indicated factors, with and without SEC14L2 coexpression, were infected with primary isolates of the indicated subtypes.

In this assay, Matrigel-polarized Huh-7.5 hepatoma cell organoids, which recapitulate the polarization of hepatocytes in vivo, were inoculated with purified, DiD-labeled HCV particles (16) . Organoids transduced with an EMPTY vector, mCd302, or mCr1l/ mCd302 were inoculated with DiD-HCV at 4\u00b0C; unbound particles were washed away; and cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C to enable real-time visualization of bound particle trafficking to the tight junction (Fig. 2C, top) . Organoids were fixed at multiple time points (minutes post temperature shift: mpts) and stained for ZO-1, a tight junction marker protein, DiD-HCV, and organoid nuclei. EMPTY vector cells showed a maximum colocalization of HCV with ZO-1 at 90 mpts consistent with previous data (16) . However, organoids expressing mCd302 or mCr1l/mCd302 displayed significantly lower colocalization at 0 and 90 mpts (Fig. 2C, bottom) . These data suggest a defect in trafficking to the tight junction, a crucial step in the HCV uptake process. Furthermore, while colocalization with control organoids drops off at 360 mpts, indicating that particles have internalized, DiD-HCV particles in mCr1l/mCd302 organoids maintained colocalization with ZO-1, suggesting a possible internalization defect. Together, these data imply that mCd302 and mCr1l mediate their anti-HCV effect, in part, by disrupting steps of the complex entry cascade.",

CHO-745 cells were used for the HCV attachment assay, because they lack endogenous expression of canonical HCV entry factors and are deficient in synthesis of proteoglycans due to a defect in xylosyltransferase activity, thus reducing nonspecific background binding. We used CHO-745 cells expressing the human HCV entry receptor SCARB1, which is known to bind virions directly, as a control (17) (18) (19) . HCV was incubated with cells, followed by washing, RNA extraction, and quantification cell-bound vRNA by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 2D, left) . Similar to cells expressing SCARB1, murine restriction factor expressingcells exhibited ~3-fold more surface-bound HCV RNA when compared to untransfected CHO-745 cells, suggesting that both mCd302 and mCr1l can directly bind HCV, comparable to the levels seen for the HCV entry factor SCARB1. Surface localization of ectopically expressed factors was confirmed by flow cytometry. While cell surface localization of murine factors in CHO-745 cells was lower than that observed for human SCARB2, surface detection was apparent for both Cd302 and Cr1l (Fig. 2D, right) .",

To determine the mCd302 domain(s) important for the observed anti-HCV restriction, we initially generated two mCd302 domain deletion constructs: \uf044CTLD and \uf044CPT. While deletion of the CTLD partially ablated the restriction phenotype, truncation of the CPT completely ablated the inhibition of HCV infection (Fig. 2E, left) . Expression and cell surface localization of the \uf044CPT mutant protein were largely unaffected ( fig. S3 ). In contrast, as the \uf061-mCd302 antibody binds to the CTLD, the ability to detect this mutant protein was lost ( fig. S3 ). Putative functional residues/ motifs in the mCd302 CPT include a single cysteine residue (C213), which could serve as a putative palmitoylation site; two tyrosine residues (Y209 and Y223), which could be phosphorylated and involved in downstream signaling; and an EEDE acidic patch (219 to 222), which could serve as an internalization motif. Mutation/deletion of any of these critical residues completely destroyed the HCV restriction phenotype of Cd302 (Fig. 2E, right) , while protein expression was unaffected ( fig. S3 ).

Likewise, mRNA levels of replication or assembly cofactor mRNAs PI4KA, PPIA, and APOE were also comparable ( fig. S4 ). Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each cell line (when compared to the EMPTY cell line that is highly permissive for HCV infection) showed that HCV-permissive mCd302\uf044CPT cell transcriptomes were comparable to EMPTY cells, with relatively few DEGs detected (Fig. 3B ). Of note, we observed increasing numbers of DEGs in mCr1l, mCd302, and mCr1l/mCd302 cells, respectively, suggesting an additive or cooperative effect of overexpressing both factors in parallel, with ~200 DEGs apparent in mCr1l/mCd302 cells (Fig. 3B ). To investigate whether these two proteins physically interact, we performed immunoprecipitations. Coimmunoprecipitation of mCr1l with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mCd302 confirmed the mCd302-mCr1l interaction, indicating that both factors might bind each other and act cooperatively to mediate their combined potent anti-HCV phenotype (Fig. 3C ). Stringent analyses of mCr1l-and mCd302-specific DEGs [false discovery rate (FDR) P <0.05, only transcripts with RPKM >1 included] revealed a program of dysregulated genes in mCd302 cells, which was further enhanced by coexpression with mCr1l (Fig. 3D ). Cells ectopically expressing mCd302\uf044CPT exhibited minimal DEGs, suggesting that mCr1l/mCd302-dependent transcriptional changes are dependent on the CPT of mCd302. In many cases, ectopic expression of mCr1l and mCd302 individually up-regulated the same target gene and concomitant expression of both mCr1l/mCd302 that further boosted expression of these targets (e.g., ACY3, ALPI, C19orf33, and TFF1), underpinning cooperativity between mCr1l and mCd302 in transcriptional regulation of cellular genes. The majority of mCr1l/ mCd302-specific DEGs (88 of 122) represented IFN-regulated genes (IRGs) (22) . These data indicate that overexpression of mCr1l/ mCd302 results in the dysregulation of a specific subset of antiviral genes, which likely contributes an intrinsic anti-HCV phenotype.",

Closer inspection revealed fixation of nine unique nonsynonymous mutations on the rat-mouse lineage, distributed throughout the protein but concentrated in cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 4F , right). Together, these data indicate a unique evolutionary trajectory for rat/murine Cd302, with the fixation of multiple mutations on the rat:mouse branch giving rise to the incongruence between organismal and Cd302 phylogenies. This likely represents the signature of selection in response to pressure from pathogens and/or the possible acquisition of a novel biological function (e.g., antiviral restriction) or interaction partner (e.g., mCr1l).

While hCD302 transcripts were readily detected at similar levels to that observed in mice, hCR1L transcripts were virtually undetectable or completely absent, comparable to brain-or lung-specific mRNAs (Fig. 5C ). Together, these data confirm constitutive expression of hCD302 mRNA in PHHs but the absence of hCR1L, suggesting that the combined potent and cooperative anti-HCV restriction provided by coexpression of both factors in mice is absent in the human liver. To test the human orthologs' ability to restrict HCV infection, we ectopically expressed hCD302 and hCR1L in Huh-7.5 cells followed by infection with R-luc reporter HCV. Comparable to mCd302, we observed a potent reduction of intracellular RLU accumulation over a 4-to 96-hour time course for hCD302 (Fig. 5D ). However, hCR1L mediated no effect on the ability of HCV to infect hepatoma cells. To determine whether expression of hCD302 in PHHs is modulated by the RIG-I or TLR3 sensing pathway, we treated PHHs with either IFN\uf0612a or polyI:C. Similar to mouse hepatocytes, we did not detect a dysregulation of hCD302 mRNA when compared to control genes, indicating that its expression is steady state and not regulated by either the RIG-I or TLR3 sensing pathways (Fig. 5E ). The inability of the human ortholog of CR1L to restrict HCV, combined with an absence of CR1L mRNA in PHHs, highlights the differences between human and mouse with respect to intrinsic liver defenses: The combined cooperative antiviral restriction provided by both factors is absent in humans. Nonetheless, hCD302 alone was able to restrict HCV infection, which warrants further investigation. C-type lectins make up a large superfamily of proteins with diverse functions. A unifying feature of this group of proteins is the CTLD fold, which is characterized by a double-loop structure that is stabilized by conserved disulfide bridges at the bases of these loops. The presence or absence of the so-called long loop region is used to divide CTLDs in two groups: Classical CTLDs (e.g., dendritic cellspecific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin: DC-SIGN) have a long loop region, which is absent in the more compact CTLDs (e.g., human CD44). The long loop region is involved in Ca 2+ -dependent carbohydrate binding and also in the binding of other ligands (25) . Recently, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the hCD302 extracellular domain was solved, showing that it comprises a canonical CTLD fold with a long loop region (Fig. 5F , right) (26) . Superposition of an mCd302 CTLD homology model onto the CTLD structure of hCD302 revealed a large number of surface residues conserved between mouse and human CTLDs (Fig. 5F, left) . This finding suggests conservation of ligand specificity between the mouse and human orthologs. In contrast, alignment of CPT regions highlights differences between human and mouse and may point to potential differences in downstream signaling between the species (Fig. 5F , bottom).",

Consequently, we generated humanized hOC hep mice, which conditionally express human CD81 and OCLN in hepatocytes (hOCLN +/\u2212 hCD81 +/\u2212 ). To examine the relevance of endogenous Cd302 and Cr1l expression for HCV restriction, we explored whether knockdown of mCd302 and mCr1l in plated primary hOC hep cells modulated the cellular response to infection and increased HCV permissiveness. To this end, we silenced mCd302 and mCr1l mRNA in plated hOC hep , followed by HCV infection (strain Jc1) and transcriptional profiling. The antiviral response to HCV infection was greater in plated hOC hep previously treated with mCd302 and mCr1l targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) when compared to hepatocytes transfected with control siRNAs (Fig. 6A) . We did not observe this trend in PMH from a WT mouse lacking the human entry factors, indicating an HCV entry-associated process. These data suggested that mCd302 and mCr1l silencing facilitates more efficient HCV entry into murine hepatocytes, resulting in a concomitant increase in the magnitude of the murine hepatocyte antiviral response. However, we did not observe subsequent viral replication in plated hOC hep . In contrast, siRNA targeting of ectopically expressed mCd302, mCr1l, or mCd302 and mCr1l in Huh-7.5 cells increased Jc1 replication (fig. S5 ). To overcome the observed block on HCV replication in murine hepatocytes, we compared fitness of parental HCV (strain Jc1) with an HCV population derived from Jc1 after 100 passages (p100pop) in Huh-7.5 cells, which exhibits enhanced replicative fitness and partial resistance to IFN (27) . Infection of mouse liver tumor (MLT) cells that ectopically express five human factors (CD81, SCARB1, CLDN1, OCLN, and APOE: 5H) coupled with blunted innate immune signaling due to ablation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) expression (MLT/ MAVS \u2212/\u2212 5H) (10) revealed significantly enhanced permissiveness to p100pop when compared to parental Jc1 (Fig. 6B) . Suppression of p100pop replication in MLT/MAVS \u2212/\u2212 5H was also demonstrated using teleprevir, an HCV NS3 protease inhibitor (Fig. 6B ). This enhanced replicative fitness was correlated with 14 nonsynonymous mutations with >50% population frequency distributed throughout the p100pop open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 6C) . Although p100pop exhibits enhanced replicative capacity in murine liver cells, this strain was susceptible to mCd302/mCr1l restriction, albeit to a lesser extent than parental Jc1 ( fig. S6 ).",

However, because of high intrinsic expression, targeted mRNAs encoding functional mCd302 and mCr1l were still detected. To overcome this limitation, we deleted Exon 1 of the mCd302 locus in hOC hep mice using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Comparative Western blotting of primary hepatocytes from hOC hep and hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice revealed complete ablation of functional Cd302 protein expression (Fig. 6D) . Unfortunately, mCr1l \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice were not viable due to an embryonically lethal phenotype (28) . To determine whether mCd302 deletion modulated the intrinsic murine hepatocyte transcriptome, we performed global RNA-seq profiling on primary hepatocytes isolated from hOC hep and hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice. These analyses revealed 289 significant DEGs in hepatocytes from hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to control hOC hep mice, confirming a role for mCd302 in the regulation of constitutive gene expression levels in murine hepatocytes. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses revealed significant and overlapping dysregulation of genes associated with cellular defense and the inflammatory response, in addition to modulation of gene expression associated with hepatocyte metabolic processing ( fig. S7, left) . Analogous to overexpression of mouse Cd302/Cr1l in human cell lines where antiviral genes were generally up-regulated, ablation of endogenous Cd302 expression in mouse hepatocytes resulted in down-regulation of a subset of genes involved in virus defense and the inflammatory response (e.g., Apobec1, Isg20, Oasl1, Ccl7, and Cxcl9) ( fig.

At 4 hpi, we detected higher levels of cell-associated HCV core protein in hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 hepatocytes when compared to hOC hep controls (Fig. 6E, left) . Cell-associated HCV core protein was reduced at 24 hpi likely due to vigorous IFN-dependent antiviral defenses. However, a significant difference was apparent between hepatocytes isolated from hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 and hOC hep mice, with two-to fourfold greater cell-associated core detected, which could be further enhanced by JAK/STAT inhibition (Fig. 6E, right) . These data suggested that ablation of endogenous Cd302 expression in humanized mouse hepatocytes increased infection by human-tropic HCV. Building on these data, we performed a time course comparison, infecting hepatocytes isolated from both hOC hep and hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice with either Jc1 or p100pop after JAK/STAT inhibition, and monitored de novo virus production at 24 to 144 hpi. No differences in virion release were observed between hepatocytes from hOC hep and hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with Jc1, with limited de novo HCV production detected (Fig. 6F,  left) . In contrast and despite differences observed between individual animals, de novo p100pop production was demonstrably increased in hepatocytes isolated from hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to parallel control hepatocytes from hOC hep mice at 48 to 144 hpi, with up to 50-fold greater mean virus production observed (Fig. 6F , right). To investigate whether this observation could be replicated in vivo, we performed intrasplenic inoculation of hOC hep or hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice with p100pop, with continued oral administration of ruxolitinib to suppress antiviral defenses mediated by JAK/STAT signaling (Fig. 6G ). Serum and liver vRNA were assessed at 72 and 120 hpi. No differences were observed in serum vRNA between hOC hep and hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice at either time point, indicating a potential block on virus release in the murine liver. In contrast, at 120 hpi, mean liver-resident vRNA was ca. 7-fold higher in hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to hOC hep animals, and only hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a significant increase of liver-resident virus load from 72 to 120 hpi (Fig. 6G ). In summary, these data confirm that Cd302 contributes to the species barrier limiting HCV infection of murine hepatocytes, both in vivo and ex vivo.",

Using cDNA library screening, we identified a lectin and a complement receptor, Cd302 and Cr1l, as previously unreported species barrier determinants contributing to HCV restriction in the murine liver. Our data demonstrate that mCd302 and mCr1l expression is constitutive in murine hepatocytes and not inducible by IFN: These factors mediate protection independently of the IFN system. We observed differences in liver expression and the ability to restrict HCV between the murine orthologs and their human counterparts. The unique evolutionary trajectory of mouse:rat Cd302, which is largely due to differences concentrated in the short cytoplasmic tail, coupled with the lack of an interaction partner (Cr1l) to amplify any potential signal in humans, suggests that murine Cd302 has acquired a unique or enhanced antiviral function when compared to its human ortholog. Rodents (similar to bats) have high population densities in the wild and consequently represent reservoirs for many pathogens. Therefore, it is possible that mice might have evolved novel or enhanced antiviral strategies to cope with these more frequent pathogen exposures when compared to humans. Despite the differences observed between humans and mice, human CD302 mRNA was also abundant in PHHs, and ectopic expression of human CD302 in hepatoma cells mediated an anti-HCV phenotype. Although outside the scope of this investigation, determining whether different allelic variants or differing hCD302 expression levels in the livers of HCV-infected patients is correlated with disease outcome (e.g., severity of liver disease or viral clearance versus persistence) is currently the subject of further investigation.",

Competition with virus binding to canonical entry factors may impede virus trafficking to tight junctions and, in turn, productive infection. In addition, ectopic expression of murine factors in human hepatoma cells resulted in the cooperative induction of a noncanonical transcriptional program. Moreover, modulation of the intrinsic murine hepatocyte transcriptome was observed upon Cas9 disruption of endogenous Cd302 expression. To further dissect these observations, we used ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) to compare gene expression changes observed between Huh-7.5 and Huh-7.5 [mCd302/mCr1l] cells with those observed between humanized hOC hep and hOC hep Cd302 \u2212/\u2212 PMHs. Modulation of mCd302 expression targeted common pathways in human and mouse liver cells: 16 significantly enriched canonical pathways were shared between both systems including four pathways associated with related nuclear receptors (NRs) (fig. S8A ). NRs are known to regulate transcriptional programs that control host metabolic processes including lipid metabolism. In addition, NRs have been implicated in host-virus interactions, modulating susceptibility to both DNA and RNA virus infections (29) . NRs have been shown to control both pro-and antiviral metabolic responses to HCV in PHHs (30) . The top hit in both the human and mouse systems represents an NR pathway \"LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of retinoid X receptor (RXR) function\" that influences downstream lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Detailed inspection of shared NR pathways identified significantly dysregulated molecules at multiple pathway stages and contained shared and distinct molecules in both systems ( fig. S8B ). Corresponding changes in gene expression for targeted pathways in both systems highlights opposing transcriptional dysregulation of gene subsets in these analogous in vitro and ex vivo systems ( fig. S8C ). Thus, in both human overexpression and in mouse knockout systems, gain or loss of Cd302 expression influences RXR\uf061 NR signaling: RXR\uf061-dependent genes and their roles in lipid and fatty acid metabolism likely contribute to the resulting antiviral state, as the HCV life cycle is tightly coupled to lipid and fatty acid metabolism.",

We demonstrate that p100pop, an HCV population that developed enhanced replication fitness and partial IFN resistance in human cells, also exhibits enhanced fitness in humanized mouse liver cell lines and in humanized PMHs when compared to its parent virus. The enhancement of HCV permissiveness mediated by ablation of Cd302 liver expression in mice was only detectable when infection experiments were performed using p100pop, pointing to additional uncharacterized barriers to efficient HCV propagation in the murine liver. These barriers could represent missing or incompatible human cofactors-or additional murine restriction factors targeting HCV. It is likely that the enhanced replication fitness and reduced IFN sensitivity of p100pop enables a partial overcoming of these additional replication blocks that is not achieved by nonadapted strains. Therefore, p100pop represents a good starting point for development of more robust HCV mouse models, and stepwise adaptation of HCV to complete its full replication cycle in murine hepatocytes may also be possible. However, for the purposes of HCV vaccine development, these adapted viruses should retain the key attributes of strains that infect humans, e.g., receptor usage and immunogenicity.",

While a role in regulating myeloid cell migration was previously reported, the functional importance of hepatocyte-expressed mCd302 remained elusive until now. Lectins expressed in myeloid cells play important roles in immune defenses (31) . They recognize pathogens via their CTLDs and trigger responses such as endocytosis, phagocytosis, and release of pro-or anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the complement system is essential for pathogen clearance. Here, we report an unexpected cooperation between a hepatocyte-expressed lectin and a complement receptor in mice. This work highlights convergence of lectin and complement systems for shaping liver intrinsic immunity and draws attention to a complex antiviral mechanism involving entry inhibition and metabolic reprogramming. Combining humanization of murine hepatocytes with ablation of a constitutively expressed antiviral defense system-the mCd302/mCr1l axis-and using an adapted HCV population with enhanced replication capacity in murine cells opens new avenues for the development of more robust HCV mouse models.

Using components from a SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech), mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and sizefractionated before ligation into the lentiviral vector pV1. Ligated fractions were electroporated into ElectroMAX DH5\uf061 (Invitrogen) cells according to the manufacturer's specifications, and resulting colonies were sequenced to ascertain the library quality. Ligated fractions that contained high percentages of diverse full-length mouse ORFs were pooled and electroporated before solid phase amplification in approximately 8 liters of medium. Before solid phase amplification, the MIILL contained 4 \u00d7 10 6 independent clones. After solid phase amplification, the pV1 MIILL was extracted from transformed bacteria using a Maxiprep protocol (Macherey Nagel), aliquoted, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. The library was packaged into VSV-G-enveloped psuedoparticles via three-plasmid transfection into 293T cells. VSV-G, HIV-1gag/pol, and pV1 MIILL plasmids were transfected in equimolar amounts using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and supernatants were harvested at 24 and 48 hours after sodium butyrate induction. Titers of MIILLpps were calculated via median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) limiting dilution onto HeLa-TZMbl cells. Cells were fixed and stained 72 hpi, and MIILLpps were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Permissiveness of different cell lines for MIILLpp transduction was determined via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using pV1 green fluorescent protein-containing pseudoparticles. We delivered our MIILL (one to two particles per cell) to highly permissive n4mBid hepatoma cells. These cells are modified Huh-7.5 cells, which undergo programmed cell death upon HCV replication (13) . Iterative rounds of selection were performed with WT HCV [Jc1: multiplicity of infection (MOI) 50], and surviving cells were expanded. Permissiveness to HCV/coronavirus (CoV) infection was assessed using R-luc reporter viruses.",
