            "text": "From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for diagnostic and screening tests has exceeded supply. Although the proportion of vaccinated people has increased in wealthier countries, breakthrough infections have occurred amid the emergence of new variants. Pooled-sample COVID-19 testing using saliva has been proposed as an efficient, inexpensive, and non-invasive method to allow larger-scale testing, especially in a screening setting. In this study, we aimed to evaluate pooled RT-qPCR saliva testing and to compare the results with individual tests. Employees of Philips Japan, Ltd. were recruited to participate in COVID-19 screening from October to December 2020. Asymptomatic individuals (n = 824) submitted self-collected saliva samples. Samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in both 10-sample pools and individual tests. We also surveyed participants regarding their thoughts and behaviors after the PCR screening project. Two of the 824 individuals were positive by RT-qPCR. In the pooled testing, one of these two had no measurable Ct value, but showed an amplification trend at the end of the PCR cycle. Both positive individuals developed cold-like symptoms, but neither required hospitalization. Of the 824 participants, 471 responded to our online questionnaire. Overall, while respondents agreed that PCR screening should be performed regularly, the majority were willing to undergo PCR testing only when it was provided for free or at low cost. In conclusion, pooled testing of saliva samples can support frequent large-scale screening that is rapid, efficient, and inexpensive.",

Although vaccination programs have progressed in many countries, daily infections and hospitalizations are still high globally [1, 2] . Moreover, breakthrough infections have been reported in fully vaccinated individuals, indicating that such people can still contract and transmit the virus [3] [4] [5] . One of the challenges in controlling this disease is that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs not only in symptomatic patients but also in asymptomatic carriers, including many who later develop symptoms (presymptomatic cases) [6] [7] [8] . Further, as community transmission continues, new variants are likely to emerge; when we drafted this manuscript, the highly transmissible Delta variant had replaced the majority of strains worldwide, but a newer variant Omicron has started replacing the Delta variant lately [9] .",

It has advantages over NPS samples: it is much less invasive and allows self-collection, making it more feasible for repeated, frequent testing; it minimizes the infection risk during sample collection; and has lower personnel and PPE costs [14] . Some studies that compared the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RT-qPCR tests between saliva and NPS samples have shown that sensitivity is higher using NPS [15] [16] [17] , while others show that saliva samples have a higher [14, 18, 19] or similar [20] [21] [22] sensitivity. Recent meta-analyses have shown that there is little difference in sensitivity between NPS and saliva samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid [23] [24] [25] . Although multiple studies have reported the presence of viral RNA in saliva samples from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [21, 26, 27] , the timing of sample collection seems to be important, because the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva declines after disease onset [18, 28, 29] , highlighting the importance of collecting samples during the early phase of disease. Thus, saliva sampling is not only easier, safer, and less expensive, but also a reliable option for COVID-19 testing.",

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a pooled-sample testing approach has been reported to save both cost and time when implemented on larger scales [30, 32, 33] . For pooled testing to be effective, certain baseline parameters should be considered: the prevalence or positivity rate within the community, sensitivity and specificity of the test, and the limits of detection. Multiple studies have published models and algorithms to calculate optimal pool sizes that depend on prevalence and cost reductions relative to individual tests [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Overall, sample pooling is most advantageous for populations with low prevalence, remaining more time-and cost-efficient than individual testing in populations with positivity rates up to around 30%; however, it offers no benefit when the positivity rate (prevalence) becomes higher [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] .",

A total of 824 volunteers who provided informed consent were enrolled in this study (information and consent forms are provided in S1 File). Eligible individuals included those who did not report fever above 37.5\u02daC or coughing, and had not been in close contact with COVID-19 patients during the two weeks preceding the test. Participants were instructed to collect 1-2 ml of saliva using a FastGene\u2122 Saliva Collection Kit (Nippon Genetics Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), at home, without restrictions on food timing or intake. Samples were collected at each branch office, kept at 4\u02daC, and sent to the LSI Medience Corporation Central Laboratory (Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan), where all PCR testing was performed within 24 h of receipt. For both test modes, samples were vortexed for 5 s and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 3 min. For pooled testing, equal volumes of saliva supernatant (20 \u03bcl each) from 10 subjects were pooled. When the number of samples in a pool was less than 10, phosphate buffered saline was added to bring the volume to 200 \u03bcl. Each individual or pooled 200-ul sample was mixed with 200 \u03bcl of lysis buffer and 20 \u03bcl of proteinase K solution for inactivation, followed by vortexing, heating for 10 min at 56\u02daC, and brief centrifugation. RNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC 48 Instrument and Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and eluted into a total volume of 50 \u03bcl. For RT-qPCR, 10 \u03bcl of RNA template was mixed with 40 \u03bcl of PCR Master Mix and amplified using a SARS-CoV-2 Detection Kit -Multi-(TOYOBO Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) targeting the N1 and N2 genes, as well as an IC. This detection kit was developed for research use, but was approved for clinical use by the Japanese government in August 2020. RT-qPCR was performed using the COBAS z480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics K.K., Tokyo, Japan). The kit protocol was followed: 42\u02daC for 5 min for RT; pre-denaturation at 95\u02daC for 10 s; and 45 cycles of 95\u02daC for 5 s and 60\u02daC for 30 s for amplification. Ct values were determined for N1, N2, and IC. Samples were considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 when either the N1 or N2 target was detected with a Ct < 40.",

In case 1, 10-sample pool testing detected the N1 signal (Ct = 33.71) but did not detect N2, while individual testing detected both N1 and N2 (Ct 33.84 and 35.82, respectively) ( Fig 1A,  Table 1 ). In case 2, neither N1 nor N2 signals were detected in pooled testing, whereas individual testing identified both N1 and N2 (Ct 31.81 and 33.24, respectively) ( Fig 1B, Table 2 ). In both cases, individual testing showed sigmoid amplification curves for N1 and N2 at Ct values between 30 and 35. In case 2, the 10-sample pool exhibited no Ct value, but showed a line of amplification towards the end of the cycle (red dotted box in Fig 1B) . However, neither of the cases had Ct values or showed any late amplification of N2 in pools.",

The positive rate in this cohort was similar to that observed in another cohort of healthy/asymptomatic individuals who underwent RT-qPCR screening before medical checkups at Keio University Hospital during the same period [39] . To compare and contrast our data with official public health surveillance data, we analyzed 1) total numbers of PCR tests and positive cases for suspicious individuals/already diagnosed patients during the same period from the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (https://covid19.mhlw.go.jp/en/) (S3 Table) ; and 2) monitoring initiatives targeting asymptomatic individuals in 14 prefectures (Hokkaido, Miyagi, Tochigi, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Aichi, Gifu, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Fukuoka, and Okinawa) run by the Office for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of Japan (https://corona.go.jp/monitoring/) (S4 Table) in early 2021. In the first case (S3 Table) , the mean positivity [(daily cases/tests) \u00d7 100] during the period was 13.3%, much higher than that in our cohort. This is probably because of the difference in the target populations; in the first case, PCR tests were performed for suspected individuals with symptoms or recent exposure or contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients. In the second (S4 Table) , we see regional and time frame heterogeneity in positive rates, but rates ranged from 0 to 1.34%, comparable to our results.",

            "text": "Because pooling samples will dilute the viral load of a positive sample and tend to produce higher Ct, detecting samples with lower viral loads has been a major challenge in pooling approaches. In our study, case two was not detected in a 10-sample pool. Consistent with our findings, previous studies showed similar Ct increases in pooled testing relative to individual testing, with variations in added values in pooled testing [15, 34, 55, 56] . Interestingly, some groups observed no Ct differences between pooled and individual RT-qPCR testing [57, 58] . More et al. reported that while individual positive samples with high viral load (Ct < 28) were consistently detected in pools of 5 or 10, there was a higher frequency of false negatives when samples with lower viral loads (Ct > 28) were pooled, especially in pools of 10. They showed that samples with individual Ct > 31 were not detected in pools of 10, whereas Ct values up to 33 could be detected in a pool of 5; they concluded that pooling up to five samples is more reliable for diagnostic purposes [59] . Praharaj et al. compared 5-and 10-sample pooling and showed that the former had higher concordance with individual testing and lower false-negative rates than the latter; they also showed that 10-sample pools had lower concordance with individual-sample testing, and higher false-negative rates at Ct > 30 [60] . Furthermore, Watkins et al. reported that sensitivity decreased with increasing pool size: pools of 5, 10, and 20 had reductions of 7.4, 11.1, and 14.8%, respectively [34] . In both of the positive cases in our study, Ct values in individual testing were higher than 30, and 10-sample pools failed to produce any Ct values in case two. Given the decrease in sensitivity in 10-sample pools, and with the two individual positive cases having high Ct values, it is probable that this case would have been undetected if we had not performed simultaneous individual testing.",

They first used criteria for positivity (Ct within 35 with a sigmoid curve) for 4-sample pools, but also included an additional class of 'probably positive' (Ct > 35 with non-sigmoid amplification curve, or increased amplification at the end of the reaction). Adding this lenient cut-off yielded 15.5% more true-positive samples. Their study highlighted the importance of catching late amplification to avoid missing positive samples. When carefully reviewing the PCR curves from pooled testing for case two, we observed late amplification patterns at the end of the reaction for N1, as described by Mohanty et al. [61] .",

Saliva can contain inhibitors that impair nucleic acid amplification [62, 63] . In addition to its molecular composition hindering RNA detection, saliva can be a challenging clinical sample because it varies across individuals in pH and viscosity, as well as being more susceptible to the effects of RNases [62] . Several protocols have been proposed to overcome these challenges, such as dilution, chemical pretreatment, heating, and treatment with proteinase K [63] . In our study, pooled sample testing exhibited less amplification inhibition than individual testing, suggesting that pooling may reduce saliva's inhibitory effects on PCR.",

When she underwent another RT-qPCR test at the local clinic, it was eight days after the onset of symptoms, at a relatively late phase of infection. We speculate that this is the reason the test was negative. Case two had no symptoms when he submitted his samples, but had attended a wedding reception three days before. It was very likely that he was infected at the wedding and was presymptomatic (in an incubation period) when he participated in the PCR screening. The RT-qPCR test detected infection before he started to manifest symptoms. This finding reinforces the usefulness and clinical applicability of PCR screening, for example, to detect infection in people who may be dismissed as having common cold or allergy symptoms.",
