Although the original data on systemic oxidative stress in COVID-19 patients have recently started to emerge, we are still far from a complete profile of changes in patients' redox homeostasis, similar to, e.g., well-defined changes in cytokines and chemokines production [5] . So far, data obtained in clinical settings suggest enormous consumption of exogenous antioxidants, since the levels of vitamin C are undetectable in patients admitted to intensive care [6] , while alpha tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations are also decreased [7] followed by disrupted endogenous thiol disulphide homeostasis in COVID-19 [8] [9] [10] . Data on lipid oxidation in COVID patients have been controversial, since increased plasma levels of isoprostanes F2 alpha, followed by decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, were shown in comparison with controls [11] .",

            "text": "Stratification of COVID-19 disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic or mild to moderate, severe or critical, has been well established over the course of the pandemic. Thus, patients with mild disease symptoms exhibit rapid recovery, while those with moderate to severe disease exhibit high mortality and poor prognosis [12] . It has been suggested that in addition to alterations of well-recognized immunological mechanisms, endothelial dysfunction induced by impaired hypoxia-related redox signaling also contributes to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity [13] . Still, previous evidence that severity and progression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may be related to the systemic changes in their redox profile is conflicting and requires further investigation [7, 9, 11, 14, 15] . Besides, the majority of clinical studies were designed to determine the level of redox biomarkers in COVID-19 patients at one point in time, without taking into account the time course of the oxidative damage during disease progression. In view of the fact that evaluation of systemic oxidative stress in humans relies on determination of byproducts reflecting oxidative damage of different macromolecules, it is important to assess both protein and DNA oxidative modifications, e.g., advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine , in addition to lipid damage. It is of particular interest to establish the link of these biomarkers with inflammatory parameters, indices of multiorgan impairment, as well as with severity and progression of pulmonary changes. Namely, the information on redox parameters in COVID-19 pneumonia patients may help us to better understand the natural course of COVID-19 and improve clinical decision making.",

A detailed insight into the genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences from the second wave of the epidemic in Serbia, taking place from June 2020, was reported in the recent study by Miljanovic et al. [17] . Patients were stratified according to hospitalization, comprising those who met the criteria for Stage 3 or higher (according to the COVID-19 National Guidelines, version 9) who were hospitalized (n = 42) and the remaining 16 outpatients.

Scans acquisition was conducted from the level of the thoracic entrance to the inferior level of the costophrenic angle, with the patient in a supine, arms raised, head forward position and with breath-holding manner during end inspiration. Unenhanced CT scans were obtained for all patients. The following parameters were used: tube voltage 120 kV with automatic tube current modulation, slice thickness 1.0 mm. All CT images were reviewed by two experienced radiologists with extensive experience in thoracic imaging on a diagnostic workstation (Vitrea extend-Vital, Canon, Tokyo, Japan) with multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) tools. All disagreements between them were resolved by consensus of acceptance by both radiologists. The images were viewed in the lung window settings (width, 1600 HU; level, 400 HU) and mediastinal (soft tissue) window settings of width, 380 HU; level, 40 HU.

As recently suggested by Polidori et al., the complexity of COVID-19 disease should not be regarded in line with the traditional medical paradigm 'one cause-one mechanism-one therapy' [13] . Indeed, apart from pneumonia and hypoxemia, biomolecular changes and multisystem impairment might represent a hallmark of the disease [13, 20, 21] . The association between inflammation and oxidative stress in infectious diseases is well established [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . In this line, several reviews have suggested that redox homeostasis misbalance plays a part in COVID-19 pathophysiology, progression and outcome [1, 2] . One of the significant underlying mechanisms in COVID-19 disease is the imbalance in redox homeostasis favoring pro-oxidant conditions, potentiated with inflammation-dependent oxidative stress [22, 27, 28] . The key non-enzymatic regulator of redox homeostasis is glutathione (GSH), which is, together with other thiol antioxidants, implicated in inflammation and host defense against infection [29] . Having in mind previous data which indicate that GSH deficiency in the alveolar fluid in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) augments lung cell injury caused by increased free radical production and inflammation, it seems reasonable that individual responsiveness to COVID-19 pneumonia might also be influenced by reduced GSH levels [9] . What is more, it has been proposed that GSH deficiency might be involved in both serious manifestations and even COVID-19 mortality [9] . In line with this finding are the results on erythrocyte GSH deficiency in COVID-19 patients when compared to controls [11] . On the contrary, there are data showing lack of any association between GSH levels and disease severity [14] .",

However, a recent study of Kalem et al. potentiated the role of thioldisulphide homeostasis as a novel indicator of intensity of oxidative stress [8] .

For that reason, it is of utmost importance not just to determine the level of oxidative stress parameters at one time point, but to evaluate their changes over time. Indeed, in our study, biomarkers of lipid, DNA and protein oxidative damage (MDA, 8-OHdG and AOPP, respectively) varied in three time points over a 14-day period. Namely, significant decrease was observed in MDA and AOPP levels in contrast to increase in 8-OHdG levels at the second time point (7 days upon admission). However, 14 days upon admission, a noticeable increase was observed both in MDA and AOPP levels. Advanced oxidation protein products comprise dityrosine, pentosidine and carbonyl-containing protein products. It is important to note that AOPP is a well-known biomarker of protein oxidative modifications which can be produced in the presence of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a main product of neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity as a part of the innate response to pulmonary viral infections [30, 31] . Namely, HOCl seems to contribute to multiorgan injury in COVID-19 by multiple mechanisms, such as competition with oxygen at heme binding sites, decrease in O 2 saturation, hemoglobin-heme iron oxidation, heme destruction and iron release [32] . Thus our results on increased levels of neutrophils in a time-dependent manner suggest that changes in AOPP levels might be useful in clinical management of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.",

Therefore, in our study, a comparative analysis of redox biomarkers and possible multiorgan impairment has been determined in both hospitalized and nonhospitalized individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia.
