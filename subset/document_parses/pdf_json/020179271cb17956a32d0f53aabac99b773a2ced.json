Given that the treatment guidelines emphasize early recognition, there is interest in developing biomarkers of sepsis, and most attention is focused on diagnostic biomarkers. While there is a need for ongoing discovery and development of diagnostic biomarkers for sepsis, this review will focus on less wellknown applications of sepsis biomarkers. Among patients with sepsis, the biomarkers can give information regarding the risk of poor outcome from sepsis, risk of sepsis-related organ dysfunction, and subgroups of patients with sepsis who share underlying biological features potentially amenable to targeted therapeutics. These types of biomarkers, beyond the traditional concept of diagnosis, address the important concepts of prognostic and predictive enrichment, which are key components of bringing the promise of precision medicine to the bedside of children with sepsis.",

In this context, the biomarker data can be useful in differentiating those with infection from those with a sterile source of systemic inflammation as the underlying cause of fever. Further, the biomarkers can also be useful in differentiating those with bacterial infection from those with a viral infection, as this would help in deciding whether or not to prescribe antibiotics. Procalcitonin, although imperfect, has emerged as a widely used biomarker to address these challenges in both the ambulatory and inpatient settings 2 . There are also emerging gene expression panels that show substantial promise in addressing these clinical challenges [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . These panels have the potential to capture the complexity of the human response to infection more accurately than single biomarker strategies, and therefore can have added value when compared with single biomarker strategies 13 .",

Figure 1 depicts the general approach for identifying the PERSEVERE biomarkers by leveraging the discovery potential of transcriptomics based on whole-blood-derived RNA. In a cohort of critically ill children with septic shock, complementary bioinformatics and machine learning approaches were employed to derive a list of candidate predictor genes for 28-day mortality 20,24 . From over 100 candidate genes, the list was further defined using two a priori criteria: (1) biological plausibility linking the candidate predictor gene and sepsis-related pathobiology and (2) the ability to measure the gene product (i.e., protein) in the blood compartment. Based on these criteria, 12 candidate biomarkers were selected for further evaluation ( Table 1) .",

False-positive patients had greater derangements of physiological variables and greater organ failure burden when compared with the true-negative patients 26 . This suggests that the false-positive subjects identified by PERSEVERE II were indeed at higher risk of mortality, but that risk was perhaps mitigated by clinical interventions. Related to this observation, in a preliminary investigation, the PERSEVERE biomarkers appeared to have utility for estimating the risk of poor functional and quality of life outcomes among children who survived the acute stage of sepsis and were discharged from the hospital 27 . Collectively, the accumulating evidence, including successful prospective validation in a highly heterogeneous cohort of patients, suggests that PERSEVERE II could have clinical utility as a prognostic enrichment tool. Interestingly, the PERSEVERE biomarkers also have utility for estimating the risk of mortality in mice subjected to experimental sepsis 26 . This suggests that the biological pathways to poor outcome from sepsis are conserved in experimental models, thus providing an opportunity to dissect the mechanistic and biological links between the PERSEVERE biomarkers and the pathways to poor outcome from sepsis.",

Of note, the models developed by these three independent groups yielded a combined total of 65 candidate predictor genes 28 . Among these, 11 overlapped with the genes identified in the initial discovery phase of the PERSEVERE biomarkers (Table 2) , thus adding a measure of internal validity among the various models.

The enrollment criteria captured patients in whom a blood culture was obtained as part of the workup for suspected infection. The PERSEVERE biomarkers were measured at the same time as the blood culture sample. Clinical deterioration was defined by a set of criteria to codify evolving organ failure requiring intensive care and was tracked up to 72 h from enrollment. This study showed that the PERSEVERE biomarkers were able to identify patients more likely to experience clinical deterioration (i.e., evolving organ dysfunction) with a sensitivity of 86% and a negative predictive value of 97%. This was a single-center study that requires validation, as well as expansion to patients being evaluated for infection who are not immunocompromised. For example, it could be productive to evaluate the PERSEVERE biomarkers among immune-competent children who are being evaluated in the ambulatory setting for possible infection. In this context, the PERSEVERE biomarkers could be evaluated for their ability to identify patients with a greater likelihood of clinical deterioration, therefore informing treatment and disposition decisions.",

The underlying premise of these efforts is that unbiased transcriptomic studies can reveal endotypes of sepsis based on coordinated gene expression patterns (i.e., biomarkers) shared among endotypes. The general approach involves unsupervised clustering algorithms based on commonalities of gene expression, agnostic to patient characteristics, clinical trajectory, and outcome. Ultimately, the goal is to leverage gene Fig. 2 The PERSEVERE II decision tree. All patients begin at the root node and are subsequently partitioned to daughter nodes using biomarker-based criteria as indicated at the top of each node. All biomarker data are shown as pg/ml, and platelet data are shown as the number of platelets (K/\u03bcl). Daughter nodes that can no longer be partitioned are called terminal nodes (TNs) and shown in red outline. The terminal nodes are used to assign a baseline mortality probability to a patient classified to a given terminal node. The baseline mortality probability (MP) corresponding to each terminal node is indicated in red font within each terminal node and is derived from the published PERSEVERE II model. These baseline mortality risks are used for the construction of the AUROC. For calculation of the diagnostic test characteristics, the mortality probability is dichotomized into those who are predicted to survive and those who are predicted to not survive by 28 days. Patients allocated to TN1, TN2, TN5, and TN8 (mortality risk 0.000-0.019) are classified as predicted survivors. Patients allocated to TN3, TN4, TN6, TN7, and TN9 are classified as predicted non-survivors (mortality risk 0.167-0.444). Table 2 .

            "text": "Heterogeneity of treatment effect among patients with sepsis is perhaps best exemplified when considering the role of adjunctive corticosteroids for patients with septic shock, which has been intensely debated since the 1960s 49 . Adjunctive corticosteroids are thought to have a potential therapeutic role in septic shock given their pluripotent effects on the cardiovascular system, inflammation, and immunity. Across multiple, large, randomized trials, adjunctive corticosteroids consistently reduce vasopressor requirements, but there has not been a consistently positive effect on patient survival [50] [51] [52] [53] . Recently, it has been suggested that gene expression-based endotyping could provide a means to better understand and manage the heterogeneity of treatment effect for adjunctive corticosteroids among patients with septic shock 54 .",

This study combined PERSEVERE-based mortality risk stratification with endotyping and reported that among endotype B patients with an intermediate to the high baseline risk of mortality, adjunctive corticosteroids were associated with a more than ten-fold reduction of risk for poor outcome. This study, albeit based on observational data, illustrates the concept of how prognostic enrichment (PERSEVERE) and predictive enrichment (endotyping) can potentially be combined to identify a subset of patients more likely to have a beneficial response to adjunctive corticosteroids. The concept is currently being tested prospectively among adults (NCT04280497) and children (NCT03401398) with septic shock. A major next step for implementing these strategies at the bedside is the development of rapid assay platforms that can generate clinically actionable information in a clinically relevant timeframe.",

While a great deal of validation and development work remains, biomarkers for prognostic and predictive enrichment hold the promise of bringing precision medicine to the bedside of children with sepsis.
