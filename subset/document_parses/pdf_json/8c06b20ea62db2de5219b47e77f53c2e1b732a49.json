Our analysis made pragmatic use of national-scale hospital data, but it is possible that a lack of specific data (for example, on which patients were enrolled and on potentially important confounders) may have meant that true impacts, especially at a local level, were not ultimately discernible.

The patient would be asked to take three readings per day following discharge, and call the service (or other available emergency services, if out of hours) immediately if a reading was less than 92%. The patient was also to be proactively contacted by phone every day, as if still part of a hospital-based ward round. By day 14 on the CVW, or earlier where clinically appropriate, the patient would be discharged from the service, and the pulse oximeter returned for reuse. 14 However, the national roll out of CVW was not intended to supplant existing services, and nor was it intended to be entirely prescriptive. Our related study of a number of such services in England (both CVW and CO@h) demonstrated considerable variability in implementation models, including in patient eligibility criteria, onboarding processes and monitoring processes",

There has been little evidence that post-hospital discharge virtual wards (using pulse oximetry monitoring) have impacted lengths of stay or readmission rates of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The search strategy used to inform the existing evidence has been published previously by the authors in a systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL PLUS, EMBASE, TRIP, medRxiv and Web of Science for articles and preprints to February 2021, using combinations of the following terms: \"COVID-19 00 , \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 00 , \"2019-nCoV\", \"SARS-CoV-2 00 , \"Wuhan coronavirus\", \"virtual ward\", \"remote monitoring\", \"virtual monitoring\", \"home monitoring\", \"community monitoring\", \"early monitoring\", \"remote patient monitoring\", \"pre-hospital monitoring\", \"Covidom\", \"My m health\", \"GetWell Loop\", \"silent hypoxaemia\", \"pulse oximetry\". Papers were selected if they focussed on the remote monitoring of confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19.

A US study found a reduction in rates of ED presentation or readmission for a group of 225 patients enrolled onto a post-discharge monitoring program, 18 and two studies (from the Netherlands, and a case study from England) estimated reduced lengths of hospital stays, but with small patient cohorts and uncontrolled methods. 19, 6 Elsewhere, where outcomes have been reported, these have tended to focus on rates of patient escalation (including readmissions) in the absence of a comparator. Occasionally these are considered against a perceived optimal level (for example, a 10% conversion rate to admissions for ambulatory care pathways 2 ), or the reported performance of services elsewhere. [1] [2] [3] [4] 7, 20, 21 Data on which patients were enrolled to CVWs in England was not collected, but information was assembled on launch dates of CVW at each hospital trust. By late February 2021 the large majority of acute hospital trusts in England had a service available for use. Our analysis aimed to use patient-level admissions data to provide quantitative evidence of the impact of the service, to contribute to future development of post-discharge home monitoring programmes during the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond.",

Thus, our analysis includes 98\u00a22% of recorded inpatient stays of patients in England with a primary COVID-19 diagnosis, discharged alive. Table 3 also shows the characteristics of the patients split into two key analysis groups: patients discharged where no CVW was available (N = 81,174, 58\u00a21%), and those discharged where a CVW was available (N = 58,445, 41\u00a29%). These two sets of patients were well matched in terms of gender and comorbidities. Patients discharged where a CVW was available were more likely to be in the age range 50 to 64 and members of non-White ethnic groups, and less likely to be from the most deprived areas. As a consequence of the accelerated set up of CVW services from early January 2021 (Figure 1) , discharge dates of patients where a CVW was available tended to take place toward the end of the analysis period, with nearly 4 in 5 occurring on or after 4 January 2021 (compared to 2 in 5 of the discharges where a CVW was not available). Discharges of patients taking place where a CVW was available were more likely to be occurring in the context of higher levels of beds occupied by COVID-19 patients.",

We had no information about important clinical factors, for example: ICU admission, clinical readings (including oxygen saturation levels), and specific treatments received. The location to which patients were discharged (home, care home, and so on) was not known, and we also had no information about out-of-hospital deaths (and this during a period in which rates of out-of-hospital deaths had been persistently above long-term norms). 39 We extracted data only on patients discharged alive, and so the impact (if any) of COVID-19 patients who died during their hospital stay has not been accounted for. Our analyses have assumed that these potential confounders \u2212 which are likely to have been associated to a greater or lesser degree with eligibility for referral, and/or with risks of readmission and long stays \u2212 were well balanced between the two key groupings of patients after having adjusted for model factors. But the extent to which this is the case is not known. However, in terms of at least one of these missing factors, an analysis of a cohort of 419 COVID-19 patients managed on a post-discharge pathway suggests that out-of-hospital deaths may have been relatively rare (<0\u00a21%). 5 From our wider study of oximetry monitoring programmes in 28 sites, we had some information about the implementation of CVW services in a limited number of sites, including reports of numbers of patients monitored. 16 For seven hospital trust-based sites, we estimated a range of from 4% up to 65% of discharged COVID-19 patients may have been monitored on a CVW.

In such cases, patients enrolled onto a CVW would appear (from the point of view of the hospital data) to remain inpatients until the date of discharge from the virtual ward itself, and their lengths of stay would include a mix of days in hospital, and days at home. This plausibly might be a reason for an observed increase in lengths of stay. However, it is far from clear if this method of recording discharges has occurred to any significant degree. Recent guidance on virtual wards from the NHS in England suggests that this would not be the expected method of coding such activity (\"as this would affect length of stay and other reporting\") and that guidance to hospital trusts on coding virtual wards would be published in due course. 40 We found longer COVID-19 inpatient stays associated with implementation of COVID virtual wards; this was not expected for a service that aimed to support the early discharge of patients. One explanation might be that CVW eligibility criteria influenced hospitals' discharge decisions such that patients were kept in a bed for longer than they otherwise might have been. It is not clear whether local pre-hospital (CO@h) services starting at similar times might have affected admissions in such a way that patients were admitted sooner, and stayed for longer. The finding might in part also be a consequence of many CVW services launching during the falling (improving) edge of England's second COVID-19 wave, with longer lengths of stay being a consequence of improving bed capacity.",

Positive relationships between age and comorbidities and these outcomes have been observed elsewhere. 28, 32, 41, 42 Meanwhile, differences with respect to gender (in this study's case both outcomes were lower for females versus males) tend to have been absent. 29, 30, 32, 42 We found shorter lengths of stay and lower rates of readmissions for patients belonging to specific ethnic groups with respect to White patients (this was the case for patients belonging to Black ethnic groups for both outcomes, and also Asian, Mixed and 'Other' ethnic groups for length of stay). Evidence from elsewhere is mixed, but at least one US study found shorter lengths of stay for hospitalised non-White patient groups. 42 Ultimately, however, care is needed when interpreting findings for specific characteristics separate from the context of the other model variables; it is possible, for example that non-White ethnic groups (to give one example) may be acting as finescale markers of urban or more deprived areas (in addition to the model deprivation categories) and as markers of younger patients (within modelled age bands).",
