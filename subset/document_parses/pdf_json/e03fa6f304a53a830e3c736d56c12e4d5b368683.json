Hence, identifying new therapeutic targets encoding proteins that regulate microtubule assembly and function specifically in cancer cells is critical. In the present study, we identified a candidate gene that promotes tumor progression, ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1), a mitotic checkpoint regulator, on chromosome 20q through a bioinformatics approach using datasets of colorectal cancer (CRC), including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RAE1 was ubiquitously amplified and overexpressed in tumor cells. High expression of RAE1 in tumor tissues was positively associated with distant metastasis and was an independent poor prognostic factor in CRC. In vitro and in vivo analysis showed that RAE1 promoted tumor growth, inhibited apoptosis, and promoted cell cycle progression, possibly with a decreased proportion of multipolar spindle cells in CRC. Furthermore, RAE1 induced chemoresistance through its anti-apoptotic effect.",

Agents acting on microtubule-associated proteins interfere with their functions and, thus, can be highly effective in cancer treatment.

These data were based upon multiregional copy number analysis of tumor tissues in colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. 7, 8 Those findings suggest that amplification of Ch.20q is a fundamental and predominant event and that this region harbors driver genes that affect the tumorigenesis of CRC. The harbored genes could be promising targets to overcome therapeutic resistance conferred by CRC tumor heterogeneity. 6 We recently established a screening system using a bioinformatics approach with public datasets to identify candidate genes promoting tumor growth in CRC. Using this system, we identified eIF5-mimic protein 1 (5MP1), CRMP5-associated GTPase (CRAG), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), and DEAD-Box Helicase 56 (DDX56) on chromosome 7p, and general transcription factor 2I repeat domain-containing protein 1 (GTF2IRD1) on chromosome 7q as potential genes that accelerate tumor development in CRC.

RAE1 expression was higher in 13 different cancer tissues, as well as in CRC, compared to the expression levels in the respective non-cancerous tissues ( Figure 7A, B) . Furthermore, the high RAE1 expression group showed poor prognosis in various types of cancer ( Figure 7C ). These results indicate that RAE1 may be a common gene that facilitates tumor growth in various cancers. Figure S3 ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the function of RAE1 as a gene that facilitates tumor growth and as a prognostic biomarker of CRC. tumor tissues and normal tissues and a more significant effect on the survival of patients with CRC than these molecules. These findings suggest that RAE1 could be a more promising therapeutic target than these genes.",

We also demonstrated that RAE1 overexpression inhibited apoptosis by stabilizing spindle bipolarity in CRC cells. However, our results appeared to show small differences in apoptosis and cell cycle progression between RAE1 knockdown cells and control cells. Further study is required to clarify the other mechanisms for acceleration of tumor growth by RAE1.",

C, Western blot analysis for RAE1 and cleaved PARP in control cells or RAE1-overexpressing cells treated with 2 nmol/L drug (paclitaxel +) or no drug (paclitaxel \u2212). D, Sensitivity of RAE1-overexpressed cells to paclitaxel (left) or actinomycin D (right). Cell viability was measured by MTT assays in RAE1-overexpressing cells and control cells treated with the indicated final concentrations of paclitaxel or actinomycin D for 24 h. ***P < .005. E, MTT assay was used to assess the viability of RAE1-knockdown and control cells treated with the same final concentrations of paclitaxel for 24 h. ***P < .005",

Furthermore, we provide clinical and biological evidence that the mitotic checkpoint regulator RAE1 could be a therapeutic target to overcome therapeutic resistance of CRC. Recently, as a component of the nuclear pore complex, RAE1 has been reported to control MAPK signaling 45 and to interact with ORF6 in SARS-COV-2/COVID-19. 46,47 As a component of the nuclear pore complex, RAE1 may play several important roles in mRNA export and signaling activation, not only in cancer cells but also in normal cells and viruses.

A total of 102 patients with CRC who underwent surgical resection of a primary tumor at Kyushu University Beppu Hospital (or the affiliated hospitals) were enrolled in this study. Clinicopathological factors and clinical stage were classified using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition TNM staging system. All patients were treated in accordance with the Japanese Society of Cancer of the Colon and Rectum Guidelines for the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Therefore, RAE1 should be more intensely explored as a potential therapeutic target in various human cancers. This approach might overcome the therapeutic resistance conferred by tumor heterogeneity. In addition, amplification of RAE1 might be a feasible clinical molecular target for genomic medicines based on the precision medicine initiative.New therapeutic agents that target spindle-regulatory proteins, such as KIF11, AURKA, AURKB, and PLK1,[32][33][34] are being developed to inhibit the function of the mitotic spindle without affecting microtubule function in non-dividing cells. These agents are believed to induce cancer-specific antitumor activities without serious side effects. However, their efficacies have not been comparable to those of vinca alkaloids or paclitaxel in clinical studies.37 One possible explanation for this in vivo inefficiency is the complexity of human cancers attributable to intratumor heterogeneity.23,38 Interestingly, our comprehensive analysis using a dataset from TCGA showed that RAE1 had a larger fold change of mRNA expression level between",
