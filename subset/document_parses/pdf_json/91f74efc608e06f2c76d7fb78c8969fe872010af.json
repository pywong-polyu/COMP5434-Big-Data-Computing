            "text": "The worldwide incidence of cancer continues to rise, 1 and thanks to improvements in early diagnosis and treatment approaches, patients with cancer are living longer. 2 Despite this, there are an insufficient number of oncologists worldwide. 3 To avoid a future oncology shortage, there is a critical need for strategies and programs that encourage and support those entering medical practice to consider pursuing careers in oncology-related specialties. 4, 5 The choice of a medical specialty is a complex and dynamic process influenced by many factors, including the trainee's perception of each specialty and cultural and personal factors. Nevertheless, only a small number of trainees choose cancer specialties. [4] [5] [6] Studies have suggested that the primary experiences that influence a trainee's choice of specialty come from clinical rotations and research opportunities granted from summer rotations, regardless of medical school training. 6 It has also been shown that new oncologists are especially attracted to the holistic and multidisciplinary nature of the specialty and the depth and variety of human relationships developed during clinical practice. 7 Trainee participation in interest groups has been shown to promote consideration for careers in oncology. 6, 8 ASCO began sponsoring Oncology Student Interest Groups (OSIGs) in 2015. ASCO supports OSIGs by providing funding, mentoring, and networking opportunities to their members. Furthermore, OSIG members can submit abstracts to a dedicated forum for medical students and residents that takes place during the ASCO annual meeting. OSIG registration takes place annually between June and August and is required each year for both new and returning groups. 4 The groups usually operate with a multistudent leadership board made up of a leader and a variable number of officers. 4 Although most ASCO-sponsored OSIGs are in the United States, the development and maintenance of OSIGs worldwide can support the development and growth of the international oncology workforce. 9 In the United States, international medical graduates (IMGs) make up a significant component of the oncology workforce: 36.4% of active hematologist-oncologists are IMGs and 40.9% of hematology-oncology fellows are IMGs. 8, 10, 11 As such, evaluation of the impact of these interventions on the international student community is of interest both globally and in the United States.",

Uptake has been highest in the Americas (five countries: Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Brazil), with only a few OSIGs in Europe and Asia and no representation in Africa. There are currently no groups in the top five countries attending the ASCO annual meeting (United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Spain, and France). 14 The limited uptake in Europe and Asia may partly relate to closer relationship of trainee groups with oncology societies such as the European Society of Medical Oncology and the European Society of Oncology, both of which have medical student initiatives, and other efforts such as the British Oncology Network for Undergraduate Societies, which consists of a network of students and junior physicians 15 It is likely that many of the trainee needs are largely satisfied by these efforts. However, the existence of student groups organized and supported by different oncology societies with common goals, but with different insights into regional student needs, offers opportunities for global student exchange, networking, and collaboration in an increasingly connected world. Such opportunities also offer the potential to expose students to aspects of global cancer care early in their careers.",

Although we have not directly explored this, we postulate that language differences may pose a barrier that defuses student interest in applying to seek ASCO sponsorship, considering that the application needs to be completed in English. Creation of informational and application materials in Spanish and other major languages may remove that barrier and increase interest. Alternatively, offering non-Englishspeaking students with support during the application process through ASCO mentors and volunteers who speak the student's native languages may facilitate this process. Blogs, articles, and information sessions about OSIGs in ASCO channels have increased awareness and promoted the program. 9, 17, 18 Advertising the program through the ASCO international newsletter, social media, and organizations with global reach such as OncoAlert, eCancer, or the Hem-Onc Fellows network 19 offers the potential to reach more international trainee audiences.",

            "text": "The majority of the participating OSIG leaders reported interest in pursuing a future career in oncology. The process of choosing a specialty is complex and influenced by many factors including sex, potential salary, personal experiences, perceived lifestyle, and work-life balance, among others. 13, 20 The impact of oncology groups on medical students has previously been described. 8, 21 Members who regularly attended these interest group meetings were more attracted to oncology and oncology research than when they entered medical school. Different degrees of exposure and understanding to what each discipline entails may contribute to student interest. In Latin America, ASCO-sponsored OSIG members stated that having an OSIG in their medical school increased their interest in pursuing cancer-related specialties and facilitated networking. 8 Oncology education was a required part of the curriculum for most of the leaders. The leaders perceived having received an appropriate level of exposure to medical oncology during medical school. A 2019 survey among third-to fourth-year medical students in the United States reported that less than half of the students had oncology-oriented clinical rotations in their required clerkships. A previous study found that oncology education is often underemphasized and fragmented, with wide variability in content and structure between American medical schools. 12 However, the students who participated in oncology rotations reported having gained greater confidence in their knowledge of the basic science and diagnosis of cancer and awareness of cancer management complications. 22, 23 Our study has several limitations that need to be considered. First, we only surveyed the OSIG leaders and not their entire student body, which may not capture the totality of perceptions from each OSIG member. Second, although we promoted our study, the survey response rate was low, resulting in a relatively small sample size, which again may result in the findings not being an adequate representation of student's perception of oncology-related specialties. Third, our survey queried students about the 2019-2020 academic period, a year during which the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted education (including medical education) in many different ways. This might have been even more pronounced in exposure to clinical rotations in oncology, considering concerns about patients with cancer being a vulnerable and immunosuppressed population, leading to many cancer clinics limiting access to their facilities to only essential personnel. Since the surveys started before the COVID-19 pandemic, we did not specifically ask about how COVID-19 had affected their OSIGs worldwide.",
