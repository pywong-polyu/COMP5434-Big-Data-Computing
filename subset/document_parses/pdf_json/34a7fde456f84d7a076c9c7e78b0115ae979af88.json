Building on pre-existing relationships, community and hospital-based addictions medicine providers and a local harm reduction group collaborated to establish a shelter-based opioid agonist treatment and safer supply program, and a volunteer run safer drug use space that also distributed harm reduction supplies. In the 4 weeks preceding the program, the rate of non-fatal overdoses was 0.93 per 100 nights of shelter bed occupancy. During the 26 days of program operation, there were no overdoses in the safer use space and the rate of non-fatal overdoses in the shelter was 0.17 per 100 nights of shelter bed occupancy. The odds ratio of non-fatal overdose pre-intervention to during intervention was 5.5 (95% CI 1.63-18.55, p = 0.0059). We were not able to evaluate the impact of providing harm reduction supplies and did not evaluate the impact of the program on facilitating adherence to public health isolation and quarantine orders. The program ended as the outbreak waned, as per the direction from the shelter operator.",

The Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse (CRISM) has issued guidance that supervised consumption models and providing pharmaceutical grade medications to people with ongoing opioid use can be operated amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [6] . In this scenario, oral pharmaceutical-grade tablets are prescribed in-risk mitigation paradigm. Oral formulations are dissolved and injected by the patient. There are harms associated with oral formulations that are injected secondary to the binders, emulsifiers, colorings and lubricants present [9] . The prescription of oral hydromorphone tablets, for patients to crush and inject, as a harm-reduction strategy is a widely presented recommendation in Canada to reduce harms from the poisoned, illicit opioid supply.",

National data estimate that approximately 30% of shelter-users engage in substance use at any one time [12] . This shelter had an abstinence-based approach to substance use prior to and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Common health conditions in the shelter system include seizures, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, and anemia. Unfortunately, these conditions are often undetected or poorly controlled for long periods of time and contribute to a high mortality rate [13] . A shelter-embedded health clinic provided primary care by a dedicated staff of family physicians and internists with expertise in harm reduction, addiction medicine as well as primary inner-city health care. Several of these physicians held other roles as hospital and community-based physicians. The shelter-associated physicians recognized that many residents would be at risk for heightened harms due to the toxic drug supply and self-isolation requirements and may also have difficulty adhering to public health restrictions during the outbreak without additional support. A partnership formed between the Hamilton Social Medicine Response Team (HAMSMaRT), Keeping Six Hamilton Harm Reduction Action League, and the inpatient addiction medicine service (iAMS) to address this need. HAMSMaRT is a grassroots organization that strives to provide excellence in clinical care to individuals who have difficulty accessing the traditional medical system. Keeping Six is a community-based organization that defends the rights, dignity and humanity of people who use drugs. The iAMS is a multidisciplinary team of physicians who provide care to people who use drugs in two academic hospitals. The partnership's primary goal was to provide substance-related support to the shelter residents during the outbreak, with a focus on reducing harm from the toxic drug supply and enabling residents to adhere to public health orders. Networks from both HAMSMaRT and Keeping Six were rapidly engaged to provide on-site volunteer and paid peer support.",

There were no fatal overdoses during either time-period. In the 4 weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak, there were 20 non-fatal overdoses attended to by shelter staff. This is a rate of 0.93 non-fatal overdoses per 100 nights of shelter bed occupancy. During the 26 days the SUS and safe supply program operated, there were no overdoses in the SUS. There was a total of 3 non-fatal overdoses that were responded to in the shelter resulting in a rate of 0.17 non-fatal overdoses per 100 nights of shelter bed occupancy. The odds ratio of non-fatal overdose pre intervention to during intervention was 5.5 (95% CI 1.63-18.55, p = 0.0059). The program ended as the outbreak waned, as per the direction from the shelter operator.",

It helped to mitigate harms related to the reduction and restriction of services including supervised consumption facilities, harm reduction supplies, and substance use care. Fuertes et al. demonstrated that mobile drug consumption rooms were highly utilized in Lisbon's response to the COVID-19 shelter-response and mobile consumption may be an area of further research needed when addressing overdose response in Canadian shelters [14] . Similarly, in South Africa's response to homelessness in a large urban center, primary care practitioners prioritized the provision of methadone to reduce withdrawal [15] . Given that methadone and buprenorphine treatment are readily available in the urban shelter system in this study location and overdoses are common despite this availability, it was felt that OAT alone (without risk-mitigation hydromorphone tablet prescribing or without the ability to offer direct observation of substance use) would not be effective in preventing overdoses. In Tyndall's review of safer opioid prescribing in the context of COVID-19, he discusses the challenges associated with finding physicians willing to prescribe pharmaceutical-grade opioids to PWUD [11] . This study demonstrates that when prescription opioids are offered to patients in a congregate setting, patients are willing to engage in this form of treatment even when the expectation is that prescription opioids are consumed in a monitored setting such as a SUS.",

Notably, more than 100 methamphetamine pipes or safer inhalation kits were distributed by the SUS volunteers during the 4-week period. Further, in addition to harm reduction injection supplies reducing risk of skin and soft tissue and blood-borne infections, safer inhalation kits have the potential to reduce risk of transmission of respiratory illness such as COVID-19 related to sharing of equipment [16] . This demonstrates a significant unmet need for safe consumption spaces and risk mitigation strategies for people who use inhaled substances and may have helped reduce COVID-19 spread by limiting the sharing of paraphernalia for inhaled substances.",

As such, the harm reduction approach paired with the implementation of the SUS was in direct conflict with the existing shelter policies that residents were familiar with. The rapid mobilization of a safer use space and encouragement to access harm reduction services within this context was confusing for clients, and it took time for them to gain the necessary trust to access these services.",

We did not collect any identifiers for shelter residents using the SUS and as a result we do not have data demonstrating the number of unique residents who accessed the SUS or the frequency with which residents accessed the site. Because the program was established so rapidly there was no formal evaluation framework, and we had no way to identify or contact SUS clients after the site closed to obtain their feedback. As this was not a controlled experimental study, it is not possible to conclude that the combined program intervention caused the reduction in overdoses or that there were no other confounding variables that led to the reduction in overdoses. However, an integrated safer drug use and safer supply harm reduction program is a promising approach to reducing substance-related harms in congregate settings, particularly during a pandemic-related outbreak. More rigorous studies are needed to establish the impact of an integrated program, such as was established during this COVID-19 outbreak. Future studies would be helpful to establish the direct impact of this type of intervention and reduce confounders that may have been contributing to the overdose reduction seen in this program description. Future interventions should address the needs of individuals who inhale substances. To establish trust and have a sustained impact, long-term interventions rather than shortterm, episodic interventions should be prioritized. ",
