Within the infected population, patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are in more life-threatening circumstances, resulting in severe respiratory system failure. Various studies have investigated the infections to COVID-19 and ARDS by monitoring laboratory metrics and symptoms. Unfortunately, these methods are merely limited to clinical settings, and symptom-based methods are shown to be ineffective. In contrast, vital signs (e.g., heart rate) have been utilized to early-detect different respiratory diseases in ubiquitous health monitoring. We posit that such biomarkers are informative in identifying ARDS patients infected with COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the behavior of COVID-19 on ARDS patients by utilizing simple vital signs. We analyze the long-term daily logs of blood pressure and heart rate associated with 70 ARDS patients admitted to five University of California academic health centers (containing 42506 samples for each vital sign) to distinguish subjects with COVID-19 positive and negative test results. In addition to the statistical analysis, we develop a deep neural network model to extract features from the longitudinal data. Using only the first eight days of the data, our deep learning model is able to achieve 78.79% accuracy to classify the vital signs of ARDS patients infected with COVID-19 versus other ARDS diagnosed patients.",

ARDS is characterized by an overwhelming immune response and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema that compromise gas exchange, resulting in severe respiratory failure. ARDS mortality ranges from 40%-60%; however, it is unclear if it is substantially higher if associated with COVID-19 infection, as it varies from 28.8%-62% [1, 2] . Currently, more than 38 million people worldwide have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 [3] . In the United States, 7.9 million people have been infected with over 216,000 deaths [3] .

We use the University of California COVID Research Data Set (UC-CORDS) [10] that contains comprehensive, structured information from patients admitted to the University of California Health's five academic health centers (i.e., UC Davis Health, UC San Diego Health, UC Irvine Health, UCLA Health, and UCSF Health). Moreover, we utilize statistical features and neural networks to distinguish between ARDS caused by COVID-19 and other factors. The biomarkers investigated in this study (i.e., heart rate and blood pressure) have the potential for scalable COVID-19 prevention and monitoring in everyday settings, thanks to the ubiquitous availability of inexpensive, non-invasive portable and wearable sensors. For instance, the Omron \u00ae HeartGuide wrist-band [11] is an FDA-cleared example of such wearable devices capable of monitoring all these three biomarkers. These observations have potential applications across community settings and for those living in collective housing.",
