The COVID-19 outbreak is both similar to and different from the earlier outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; 2002-2003 [3] ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS; 2012ongoing) [4] . All three viral infections commonly present with fever and cough, and confirmation of the infections requires nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract samples (e.g., throat swabs). Most secondary transmission of SARS and MERS occurred in hospital settings. However, this is not a major means of COVID-19 spread. Rather, there is evidence that people without symptoms are fueling the spread. It appears that considerable transmission of COVID-19 is occurring among close contacts. A study in Germany suggests that people are mainly contagious before they have symptoms and in the first week of the disease. A CDC study [5] shows as many as 25 percent of people infected with the new coronavirus in the US have no symptoms. This unique characteristic presents a major risk to public health and a great challenge to controlling the epidemic spread.",

Nearly all existing models, including IHME, have lowered their predictions of minimum COVID-19 deaths in the US dramatically in less than five days [14, 15] .

Considering the unique transmission of COVID-19 and deficiency of current epidemic models, we take into account the following factors in modeling the trajectory of COVID-19 spreading: (1) The virus does not always spread exponentially. (2) Isolation and social distancing play a crucial role in flattening the curve and slowing the spread. (3) The process of spreading is stochastic and self-organized, and the model parameters vary spatially and temporally and are locally dependent. (4) The spread of COVID-19 has two unique phases: (I) a long period of exponential infection that is spread by asymptomatic transmission and lack of social distancing, and (II) a regulated growth period that reflects the impacts of enforced social distancing and isolation. Transmission eventually slows when the number of susceptible individuals is depleted, typically leading to the end of the (first) epidemic wave. However, effects of possible mutations after the peak infection rate is not included in this model.",

We view the epidemic spread process as a supply and demand process for the virus. In this picture, the virus requires human carrier or susceptible individual to land, to survive and to spread from one to another as long as supply lasts. If the supply of susceptible individual is depleted and eventually decreased to zero by means of social distancing and behavior changes, the virus would die and the spread would stop.

The third point is at t 2 = 3/1/2020 and P 2 = 35136. Substituting these parameters into the formula, we obtain the community spread rate \u03b3 = 0.325 and the degree of social distancing d \u2243 0.0778 in the beginning of phase II in South Korea. With these two parameters, we predicted the total infections and daily infection rate as a function of time. Figures 1a (above) and 1b (below) compare our model predictions with the data from South Korea. The model does well in predicting the trajectory of spreading, date of peak daily infections, and date of the onset of the plateau [18] . As expected, the model overpredicts the total infections of the plateau because we used the value for degree of social distancing from the beginning of phase II. But as the total infections and deaths increased, the degree of social distancing changed as people's behavior improved. We have found that the actual plateau is always lower than the plateau predicted based on parameters calibrated in the beginning of phase II. We note that South Korea currently reports a very low steady number of new cases daily, which could be the result of relaxing of social distancing and possible second-time infections.",

On 31 January, the US declared a public health emergency and announced restrictions on travelers arriving from China. Since 19 March 2020, social distancing has officially been in place. The US has advised its citizens to avoid all international travel and against any gatherings of more than 10 people [19] . We take t 0 = 3/23/2020 when P 0 = 44056 people had tested positive [20] . Using the next two days' data gives the average community spread rate \u03b3 = 0.22. We take t 2 = 3/29/2020 and P 2 = 144980 [20] and obtain the average social distancing parameter d \u2243 0.038. Substituting these numbers into P (t) generates the total infections and daily infection rate which are compared with the data in Figs. 2a (above) and 2b (below). In the figures, the upper/lower bounds (dashed lines) were obtained by fluctuating the social distancing parameter by \u00b120%. The solid green curve in the figure above represents the natural exponential growth in the absence of isolation and social distancing or without any intervention. The solid cyan curves represent a case with a periodic relaxing of social distancing from the level around 23 March, 2020. The solid red curves show the spread of infections under constant social distancing, where we have assumed a possibility of 30% of under testing at time t 0 . Note that US is a big country, an uniform community spread rate is just an approximation. According to this model, the daily infection rate in the US has peaked on 10-11 April, about 18.7 days after 23 March. The daily death rate and the maximum need for hospital beds and medical devices may peak 6-10 days after the peak of the daily infections.

Our model predicts that the daily infection rate in Germany peaked near 2 April and the total infections will reach the plateau in the end of April if the same level of the social distancing as time t 0 is maintained. The daily infection rate in the state of Louisiana has peaked near 2 April and the total infections should have reached 96% of the plateau around 22 April, 2020.

South Korea reached peak infection rate around 3 March and achieved the plateau within 20 days from the the selected initial date, around 12 March. Germany and several other European countries (France, Spain, Italy etc.) are moving towards the plateau. Treating the United States as a whole, our model predicts that the US will reach the plateau nearly 50 days after 23 March if the social distancing and people behavior are maintained at the level on 23 March, 2020. Constant level of social distancing results in a symmetric daily infection rate before and after the peak daily infections. Any relaxing of social distancing will cause complications and delay to reaching the plateau. Conclusion. The spread of COVID-19 is characterized by two phases: (I) a natural exponential growth phase that occurs in the absence of intervention and (II) a reg- ulated growth phase that reflects enforcement of social distancing and isolation. A fundamental spreading model for the COVID-19 epidemic is presented. This model contains two parameters: the community transmission rate and a metric describing the degree of the isolation and social distancing in individual communities or regions. The model parameters are calibrated by the data from individual communities. Our analysis shows that com-All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Transmission rates may depend on the local geographic environments, such as the temperature and moisture of the region. The uncertainty of our model predictions depends on the quality of data and testing ability. In this sense, testing is a very important component, needed to calibrate the model in the early stages. The model shows that social distancing can have a significant impact in reducing the epidemic spread and flattening the curve. The model is able to make very early predictions about the spreading trajectory in communities of any size (country, state, county and city) including the total infections, the date of peak daily infections and the date of reaching a plateau (a very low and steady daily infection rate) if the social distancing and people behavior remain unchanged. Our predictions are in good agreement with data. The model provides an upper estimate for the total number of infections and daily new infection rate for weeks into the future, providing the vital information and lead time needed to prepare for and mitigate the epidemic.",
