Besides respiratory droplets, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been isolated in other biological samples including urine, blood, feces, and saliva [1, 2] . The expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin 2-converting enzyme (ACE2) across multiple tissues also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could be found in other tissues and body fluids [3] , including in the testis and male genital tract [4, 5] . Very few studies exist on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen, and these studies have been limited by considerable time between semen sampling and diagnosis of active infection. In particular, when semen has been examined ~4-6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus was not detected, and a case report of a single male acutely infected revealed no SARS-CoV-2 in seminal fluid [6] [7] [8] . Whether SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in semen during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection when the virus is concomitantly present in nasal and/or oral secretions remains a concern. Here, we evaluated the presence and level of SARS-CoV-2 in paired semen, nasal secretion, and saliva samples collected in the short and medium term after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infections.",

Recent studies have shown persistant viral detection in the upper respiratory tract up to 37 days after the onset of symptoms [12] . ACE2 expression across tissues and body fluid-including seminal fluid-suggests possible extrarespiratory transmission routes [13] . Here, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen of men in whom virus was demonstrably present in the respiratory tract. We found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen collected 6-17 days after the onset of symptoms despite all men having concomitant shedding of virus in oral secretions up to 792 copies/\u00b5L. Though the study is small in number, it adds to available literature that the male genital tract does not appear to be a site where SARS-CoV-2 is shed in either the acute or late phase of infection. Identifying whether SARS-CoV-2 can Table 1 for quantitative measures via digital droplet polymerase chain reaction. Abbreviation: NP, nasopharyngeal. be shed in semen has implications for public health, as all predominant modes of transmission (ie, droplet, sexual contact, airborne, fomite, etc.) need to be identified in order to help curb the spread of the virus. With the small number of participants in this study, it is difficult to quantify the absolute probably of spread in a large population, but the complete absence of virus using ultrasensitive methods suggests that shedding of the virus in semen is certainly not common. A larger study would be needed to demonstrate and quantify rare events of shedding.",
