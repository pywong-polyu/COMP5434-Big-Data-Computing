            "text": "There is global guidance and national legislation describing restrictions on the marketing of foodstuffs for infants and young children. [1] [2] [3] Breast-milk substitutes (BMS) (also known as infant formula) are one of the categories of products covered by such guidance and legislation. In South Africa (SA), the Regulations R991 relating to foodstuffs for infants and young children (hereafter referred to as 'Regulation R991') was finalised in 2012, and this serves to legislate the International Code of Marketing of BMS (hereafter referred to as 'the international Code'). 1 2 A provision in the SA legislation is that employees of BMS manufacturers cannot contact members of the public to market their products, including via 'internet sites', 2 which includes social media platforms. In general, the capacity to monitor and enforce regulations are stretched, which compounds the entrenched difficulties in regulating social media platforms. Promulgation of Regulation R991 in 2012 was followed by the publication of stricter global guidance on the marketing of foodstuffs for infants and young children. 3 The concurrent growth in internet, digital and mobile platforms, including in low-income and middle-income countries like SA 4 5 has seen innovative digital techniques being used by companies to market their products. 6 SA has high rates of poverty and inequality. 7 The National Department of Health (NDoH), in line with WHO, recommends that infants are exclusively breastfed until 6 months, with the introduction of safe, adequate and appropriate complementary foods at 6 months and continued breastfeeding until 2 years and beyond. 8 9 However, in SA, exclusive breast feeding remains extremely rare 10 with BMS commonly being used in ways that are detrimental to infant and young child nutrition (IYCN), health, and survival. 11 Increased Summary box \u25ba WHO provides guidance in the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (BMS) from which countries can develop national legislation. \u25ba The use of internet, digital and mobile platforms has increased, including in low-income and middleincome countries, and these platforms are avenues for BMS marketing. \u25ba BMS manufacturers have found ways on social media to market their products in a media space that is complex to regulate, and where it is difficult to enforce national regulations. \u25ba Monitoring of marketing of products for infants and young children by national governments needs to include online and digital platforms especially social media.",

            "text": "The first author had already 'liked' or 'followed' pages and handles related to IYCF, in a personal and professional capacity. None of the pages or handles 'liked' by the first author were set up or managed by an industry or industry-affiliated organisation. However, the first author was exposed to specific sponsored (paid for) posts from industry and industry-affiliated organisations that appeared on the first author's newsfeed, unsolicited, due to the advertising algorithms used by social media platforms. Examples of social media posts that the first author has observed on their newsfeed of Instagram or Facebook (from 2015 to 2019) have been included in this paper as they most commonly appeared as sponsored posts, but also provide clear examples of violations to the national R991 regulations. We include examples from two manufacturers as these companies had the largest social media presence. The posts selected were then interpreted according to the provisions of the regulations that they violate and an image and/or weblink is provided to illustrate the violation. Since publicly available information obtained online was used and no participants were included in the research, ethical clearance was not required. The first observation on social media is that one BMS manufacturer has several different pages and groups related to infant and young child feeding (IYCF), targeted to consumers, globally and for specific countries, such as SA (table 1) . Some Facebook groups are categorised as 'baby goods'; while there is no standard definition for the age range of what a 'baby' could refer to, a reasonable assumption would be that this includes infants and young children. The SA Regulation R991 applies to foodstuffs for infants and young children under the age of 36 months. 2 An example of a violation of SA's Regulation R991 (as well as an international Code violation) is provided from a BMS manufacturer's Facebook page. On 20 and 21 June 2019, the following was posted on the 'Nestl\u00e9 Baby ",

Join us for a conversation on WhatsApp, and stand a chance to win rewards for you and your child' alongside a video that includes the Nestl\u00e9 LactoKid 4 product ('a delicious creamy drink for growing children' and indicated from 3 to 5 years) and a WhatsApp phone number. Therefore, the Nestl\u00e9 company is inviting mothers to join a conversation on WhatsApp and to win rewards for the mother and child (figure 1). While the product is not a 'designated product' according to the Regulation R991 (because designated products are those targeted to children under the age of 36 months), it still contravenes one of the regulations related to promotional practice. Provision 7 (1) of the Regulation R991 states that 'No person shall undertake or participate in any promotional practice in respect of (BMS); 7 (2) Promotional practices or devices in respect of the products listed in sub-regulation 7 (1) include, but are not limited to: \u2026 Direct/indirect contact between company personnel and members of the public in furtherance of or for the purpose of promoting the [BMS-related] business of the company\u2026 ; Indirect contact includes internet sites hosted on behalf of an SA entity, television and radio, telephone or internet help lines, mother and baby clubs but excludes contact w.r.t. product quality complaints\u2026'. 2 By inviting mothers to join a conversation on an instant messaging platform (WhatsApp), a BMS manufacturer (Nestl\u00e9) is clearly inviting direct/indirect contact between their company's personnel and members of the public (in this case, it clearly states 'moms'). According to Provisions 7 (1) and 7 (2), this should not be allowed to take place. The example described is, therefore, a direct violation of the SA Regulation R991. This type of practice takes place regularly by this BMS manufacturer on Facebook. Sometimes posts like this could appear on the newsfeed of any person interested in IYCF, even if that person did not like the page responsible, by means of sponsored posts that appear when people have shown an interest in similar content. This type of indiscriminate marketing can be harmful to the public, by building up brand recognition or loyalty in consumers that could lead to inappropriate or unnecessary purchasing of products.",

Furthermore, the statement that 'Babies thrive on love and Purity' can be misinterpreted.

            "text": "The examples presented here display that, in SA, BMS manufacturers use social media in ways which could negatively influence optimal IYCF practices, by violating provisions of national regulations. This is especially concerning, because BMS manufacturers often publicly claim to comply with national regulations and subscribe to voluntary Codes of Conduct. For example, Nestl\u00e9 has been included in the Financial Times Stock Exchange Group (FTSE) 4 Good Index Series since 2011, which monitors companies' environmental, social and governance practices. 18 Nestl\u00e9 asserts that they were the first BMS manufacturer to be included in the FTSE 4 Good Index series. 19 Since 2017, Danone (an international BMS manufacturer) has also been included on this index. 20 It can be assumed that investors and the public are led to believe that indexed companies such as Nestl\u00e9 comply with international guidance and national regulations. However, from the examples provided above, all of which are still available online for consumers to access (except for figure 3) , this is not the case. Further, we are of the opinion that social media marketing, which often purports to have an education purpose, forms part of 'amplification' within the broad category of 'information management' in the categorisation of corporate political activity proposed by Mialon et al. 21 Manufacturers have a legal obligation to comply with national legislation and international guidance. Yet, BMS manufacturers continue to be creative in identifying 'loopholes' that are not being actively monitored whereby they can directly violate these laws, with minimal, if any, consequences. BMS manufacturers need to take genuine responsibility and ownership regarding abiding to international guidance and national legislation. It is publicly known that companies have large marketing budgets. 22 The largest food and beverage manufacturer (which also manufactures BMS), Nestl\u00e9, has information publicly available in an annual Financial Statements report. 23 This document shows that 'Marketing and administration expenses' for the whole company are reported together and for 2018, this totalled 20 003 million CHF (Swiss Francs), currently the equivalent of \u00b1US$20 562 880 000 (around US$20 billion). However, these reports do now show the breakdown of marketing compared with administration expenses, neither the product/product category specific breakdown.",

            "text": "Over recent years, organisations such as WHO have documented the complex algorithms and networks used by companies, including BMS manufacturers, to tailor their online and digital marketing. 6 Social media marketing, in particular, is insidious and it is difficult to keep up with the pace at which marketing strategies develop and what tactics are used by various social media platforms-for example, Facebook and Instagram as presented here-but also other social media platforms, websites and online content. These messages and advertisements could be reaching both current and future parents and caregivers, as well as children, who are increasingly accessing social media. This practice therefore has the potential to have intergenerational negative impacts. The WHOUNICEF-Lancet Commission of February 2020 entitled 'A future for the world's children?' provides strong recommendations for improved regulation (including the adoption of a new protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child) regarding products marketed to children with the potential to cause harm; the categories of products listed include BMS. 24 ",

            "text": "There are a variety of stakeholders that need to be involved in ensuring that BMS manufacturers do not violate national legislation. Monitoring marketing of BMS through social media is particularly challenging because social media and the internet crosses geographical boundaries; however, social media platforms should be informed of the international Code and globally applicable guidelines. Within a specific country, the BMS manufacturer should bear the penalty of transgressions (if penalties have been specified in national regulations), with social media platforms having a secondary accountability, thus disallowing posts that are in violation with international guidance or national regulations. Income generation by social media platforms should not be at the cost of the health of infants and young children. In SA, the NDoH needs to increase awareness of the interpretation of Regulation R991. A Question and Answer Guide for Health Professionals and Industry 25 that was published 6 years ago has not been updated despite changes to international guidance. Updating regulations is an extremely lengthy process, therefore, an alternative BMJ Global Health could be to include a provision in the regulation that will allow an automatic update should international guidelines become stronger than national legislation. Government and the NDoH also need to allocate more resources to monitoring and enforcement of the regulations and consider establishing a centralised body for this purpose-either in the NDoH, Directorate: Nutrition or Directorate: Food Control. Currently, penalties are described in the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act 26 -which is where Regulation R991 is located-and include provisions of fines or imprisonment. Regulation R991 was developed at the national level; however, the monitoring of regulations is the responsibility of environmental health officers who work at a municipal level. This creates a gap in effective monitoring and evaluation of the regulations.",
