            "text": "The Cambridge Dictionary defines virtual reality (VR) as \"a combination of visuals and audio computer -generated that appear to depict a location or a scenario in which a human can participate 1 \". Virtual reality applications have been created for various objectives, including pleasure, learning, commerce, and medical. Virtual reality has been employed to promote mental wellbeing in various settings. Stress, fears, shock, anorexia nervosa, alcohol misuse, social phobia, post-traumatic anxiety, dementia, chronic depression, psychotic, despair, and dyslexia have all been successfully treated with VR-based techniques, according to recent studies. 2, 3 Electronic media's reducing prices and expanding ease and strength are causing a transformation in medicine, and technological advances are influencing how we give and get treatment. In an empirically based atmosphere, virtual reality can be used to test neural correlates, feelings, and actions. The detailed presentation and monitoring of continuous visual inputs underpin VR's accuracy. Furthermore, virtual worlds can deliver precise estimation by simulating circumstances that blend the safety of experimental data with the realism of everyday life. 4 People may experience a great deal of embodiment (the emotional experience of \"being in it\") in interactive virtual scenarios, another key added advantage of virtual reality. 5 Virtual reality allows for modifying the surroundings, which can modify the ambient factors that cause discomfort in individuals with mental illnesses, promoting learning to manage their issues6 effectively. 6 In treating depressive illnesses, virtual reality therapy is becoming more common. Conversely, the minimal study has been conducted on the effects of virtual training on stress and depressed behaviors. Virtually training helps relieve anxious and depression-related feelings. Positive benefits, such as vitality and pleasure, rose after virtual reality training, while detrimental consequences (such as exhaustion and stress) decreased. 7 Children undergoing surgery might benefit from an immersive virtual game to simulate a preparatory operation. The kids in the virtual reality enrichment group played a five-minute game. They witnessed the surgical treatment and an aesthetic initiation in a digital world one hour before entering the surgery theatre. The results showed that students in the gaming group had much fewer anxiety symptoms than the control subjects. Furthermore, children in the stimulation condition had a clause during an aesthetic initiation. The full impact of gaming and virtual reality immersion helped decrease stress in pediatric patients. 8 Conventional psychological therapies have lately been changed to digital or telemedicine versions to increase access to psychological services. 9 Online psychological self-help therapies can be delivered anywhere, removing logistical and geographical limitations to care delivery. Consequently, they are frequently less costly and time-consuming than traditional treatments, resulting in a reduced burden on the health system and considerable improvements in identity procedures. Virtual reality also plays a vital role in the e-rehabilitation of various diseases patients such as Parkinson disease (PD) 10-13. Virtual reality (VR) in interactive computer games and exergaming can be utilized as a supplement to traditional therapy methods. Virtual reality activities could be used as a supplement to traditional activities to improve joint mobility and neuroplasticity. Virtual reality-based activities could help people improve their motor skills by mixing physical and cognitive instruction in a pleasant and engaging way. 14 WHO announced several preventive measures for active living during the isolation period of the COVID-19, including physical exercise, health monitoring, wearing a mask, frequently washing hands, and avoiding unnecessary travel. 15, 16 Covid-19 impacts people's emotional and physical health and an elevated factor of loneliness in their lives due to a lack of interaction with other social beings. They also mention how digital technology reduces lockdown loneliness; various online technologies have been employed in pandemics to keep the globe running. More technologies and social applications are being developed during the epidemic to combat loneliness. The employment of these technologies has both positive and negative aspects. Many people lack sufficient knowledge and access to digital technology, necessitating action by providing them with skills and access. 17, 18 ",

            "text": "Multiple researchers have discovered a high incidence of disease outbreak depressive symptomatology and mental trauma due to this outbreak. 19 The higher incidence of worry and pressure diseases could be entirely due to the outbreak, such as anxieties of contracting the virus or generalized feelings of uncertainty. 20 According to a metaanalysis of prior coronavirus illnesses, a negative state, panic, disorientation, and decreased cognition were usual signs of the active infection of past coronavirus illnesses. Patients should heal from mental conditions without suffering mental illness if SARS-CoV-2 follows the same path as earlier coronaviruses. 21 Anxiety is a psychiatric illness marked by anxious thoughts, tense feelings, and body effects, including elevated blood pressure. 22 Home quarantine due to restrictions and lockdown measures has been connected to feelings of insecurity about the future and a fear of new and undiscovered infectious agents, culminating in excessively high anxiousness. 23 Furthermore, stress is linked to weariness and poor performance among healthcare workers, but boredom and loneliness are linked to rage, irritation, and bearing the brunt of confinement constraints. 24 The sociopsychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been revealed now. If not treated promptly and adequately with appropriate evidence-based interventions, it might have longterm negative health effects. 25 virtual reality-based therapies on anxiety concentrates primarily on virtual reality training, with virtual reality workouts in treating chronic diseases receiving little attention. Virtual reality training involves the addition of virtual reality abilities to conventional workout equipment such as bicycles and treadmills. Specifically, some new fitness machines include incorporated detectors that synchronize with a PC or games system, allowing players to participate in strenuous physical effort on the machine while also playing virtual reality games. Virtual reality combined with workout equipment (a.k.a. virtual reality fitness) has been shown to improve the psychological advantages of activity and raise the likelihood of lengthy commitment to exercise by workers and health experts. 26 The trend of using fitness and health apps increased among the Chinese during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic (46.18% February 2019 and 89.28% February 2020). 27 Patients who have conquered COVID-19 may benefit from virtual reality for physical rehabilitation and psychological assistance. 28 ",

Until now, developing technologies in health promotion have piqued the public's curiosity. Virtual reality is undoubtedly the most exciting and technically sophisticated of the new technologies that could potentially aid in the therapy of anxiety. 41 More extended quarantine periods have been linked to poor mental health, including traumatic stress. Quarantine length is a significant factor of stress. Persons who have been in confinement for more than one week have demonstrated substantially more comment psychological stress than those who have been in confinement for less than ten days. 42 Growing virtual reality fitness features may help steer users toward more ideal emotions even when they are not actively managing their emotional states. 43 Our study results show that VRF and various demographic factors include age, education, gender, marital status, and occupation. The intention and influence of using technology for different socio-psychological and health issues are based on various factors such as performance and perceived usefulness. These factors with demographic paradigm shape our attitude towards the use of technology such as VRF and mHealth apps for health wellbeing. 44 \"People of all ages have been affected by the COVID-19 lockdown around the world. Strain, despair, impatience, restlessness, panic, perplexity, rage, irritation, and apathy have increased due to isolation and stress. Individuals, who have used VR technology during lockdown to relax, exercise more enthusiastically, and have a better outlook on life. 45 According to the latest theory of human essentials in COVID-19 detention, unfamiliarity emphasizes several conditions, including satiating immediate physical needs, as well as the need for identity, affiliation, and social position; as a result, fear, anxiety, and frustration are all negative mental health consequences, and people are more likely to develop depression as a result. 46 The mechanisms of how to persuade others to modify their behavior are explained by social cognitive theory. It implies that people do not need to try a new activity on their own; instead, we learn through watching others, with the environment, behavior, and individual thinking as of primary influences on the learning experience. When people watch a model do a task, they remember the outcome and use it to influence subsequent actions. 47 The findings of our study are according to prior research and show that fitness and health apps positively impact attitude and behavior through physical exercise. The use of health and fitness apps for physical activity and wellbeing increased during the COVID-19 pandemic isolation. Exercise is a natural medicine for the human body to improve sociopsychological and physical health wellbeing. According to biological theories, exercise boosts the body's temperature, endocrine, and corticosteroid function and stimulates the release of certain transmitters like endorphins, according to biological theories. 48 Acute aerobic workouts are demonstrated to help reduce ego stress from anxious lab stimuli in men, and state anxiety was decreased dramatically in adult males immediately after a 20-minute exercise session which is further helpful in behavior and attitude management. 49 Various studies results indicate that interventions for psychological health management are using VRF techniques effectively to treat autism, anxiety, depression, stress, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, schizophrenia, and panic disorders. 2,3 VRF is the best technique for the self-management of mental and behavioral health. Anxiety and depression in the mental health paradigm are the most common disorders worldwide, which can be effectively managed through VRF. 50, 51 Virtual reality is a new technology that allows us to investigate ways to better engage people with health messaging and employ this novel method to promote healthy behaviors and advance new theories. Immersive surroundings technology replaces sensory information we receive in the real world with 3-dimensional views of the simulated space, rational responses, and real-time synchronization of one's behaviors to create engaging, credible, and carefully regulated worlds that seem real to the users. As an advanced type of human interaction, virtual reality allows people to engage with and immerse themselves in PC virtual environments, allowing them to have a completely new physiological, mental, and social revolution. Virtual reality allows consumers to receive medical therapies or instruction as actively participating in an elevated, dynamic, and individualized virtual world, rather than as inert spectators. 52 Statistical findings of our study reported that virtual reality fitness has a positive role in behavior and attitude management during the COVID-19 pandemic isolation. Similar results reported in many studies and state that virtual reality exercise has been acknowledged as a new way to encourage strength training and healthy behaviors in recent years. It is now being utilized more frequently in health promotion. Virtual reality fitness has been shown to improve the psychological effects of exercise and raise the likelihood of lengthy exercise adherence. 53 Virtual reality has expanded the spectrum of psychological treatment, for example, in treating phobias. 54 COVID-19 related psychiatric anguish affects a particular demographic group specifically and the interrupted psycho-social or mental health services due to the COVID-19 lockdown. 55 A personalized avatar in VR is a unique feature that significantly impacts psychological health. Users can communicate with other users in realtime in virtual worlds, which are represented by personalized avatars. Avatar therapy through VRF can be helpful to maintain positive behavior during the stressful time of the COVID-19. VRET has grown in popularity as a treatment for anxiety and depression, with a growing body of evidence indicating that it is a beneficial technique for managing panic and stress symptoms. 56",
