Thus, a comprehensive analysis of the effects across multiple chemical families with immune biomarkers is needed. In this study, we tested the associations between environmental chemicals and immune biomarkers. We analyzed the United States cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999(NHANES -2018. Chemicals were measured in blood or urine (198 chemicals, 17 families). Immune biomarkers included percentages of lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils, and counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and mean corpuscular volume. We conducted survey-weighted, multivariable linear regressions of log2-transformed chemicals on immune measures, adjusted for age, sex, : medRxiv preprint NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice. race/ethnicity, poverty-income ratio, waist circumference, cotinine concentration, creatinine for urinary chemicals, and survey cycle. We accounted for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR). Among 45,528 adult participants, using survey weights, the mean age was 45.7 years, 51.4% were female, and 69.3% were Non-Hispanic White. There were 65 chemicals associated with white blood cell count. For example, a doubling in the concentration of blood lead was associated with a decrease of 61 white blood cells per \u00b5L (95% CI: 23-99; FDR=0.005). 122 (61.6%) chemicals were associated with at least one of the eight immune biomarkers.

Proper function of immune cells in the context of a system is essentialas dysregulation has been linked to poor vaccine efficacy, increased susceptibility to infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

These immune measures are influenced by several individual-level factors including age, 5,6 sex, 5, 7, 8 and genetics. 5, 9, 10 Heritability studies of the variation in these measures estimate that genetics only contribute 25-50% of the population variation. 5, [9] [10] [11] With a projected 5.08 million deaths due to top infectious diseases in 2030 12 and the current six million (March 2022) global deaths due to COVID-19, 13 it is critical to identify the modifiable environmental risk factors that contribute to altered immune measures.",

MCV is a biomarker used to differentiate types of anemia based on the average volume of RBCs. 32 We observed 55 chemicals (27.8%) associated with MCV (FDR<0.05). Prior research on MCV and environmental chemicals have noted conflicting results. In particular, associations between blood lead and MCV have varied depending on the sample size and population. 33 A small study of car battery workers in Iran and study of pregnant women in Mexico both observed no association between blood lead and MCV, 33,34 but another small study of pregnant women in Iran found higher blood levels were associated with lower MCV. 35 Higher blood lead levels of lead recycling workers in Taiwan also were associated with lower MCV. 36 These findings were supported by toxicological research where dosing rats with a mixture of heavy metals including lead decreased MCV after 90 days. 37 In our large, generalizable US sample, we found that a doubling of blood lead concentration was not associated with MCV (FDR<0.05). Based on these observations, MCV may decrease in response to longer-term lead exposure. MCV is measured as part of complete blood panels, and values that are smaller than 80 fL or larger than 100fL can indicate diseases including iron deficiency anemia and copper deficiencies. 32, 38 Future studies may investigate the association between environmental chemicals and MCV, adjusting for intake of iron, folate, vitamin B12, and other dietary vitamins and minerals. 39, 40 Associations between MCV and environmental chemicals outside of heavy metals have been under-studied and could be a new and interesting direction for research.",

Copper and zinc are essential minerals that are important for immune system functions and can be ingested through food sources or exposed from occupational sources. [44] [45] [46] One prior study of 251 adolescents observed that higher copper and zinc concentrations were associated with higher WBC counts. 47 One rat study found no association between zinc and copper deficiency and WBC count, 48 while another found that as zinc intake increased, WBC count decreased. 49 In vitro and in vivo studies in humans have found that zinc deficiency and high levels of zinc supplementation inhibit immune system functions. 50 Copper deficiency and excessive levels can also result in organ system dysfunctions. 51, 52 The NHANES participants had a range of 24.7-306.6\u00b5g/dL copper (median: 113.8\u00b5g/dL) and 40.9-232.5\u00b5g/dL zinc (median: 80.4\u00b5g/L). The reference range for serum zinc was 60 -120\u00b5g/dL and the recommended plasma copper range was 70-140\u00b5g/dL. 51 In prior research, zinc and copper concentrations were inversely correlated, 51 although we did not find evidence of that in our nonsurvey-weighted sample (r=-0.02, p=0.2). NHANES captured both deficiencies and excessive levels of copper and zinc, representing a wide range of nutritional statuses that are associated with WBC counts. Additionally, we found that increased cotinine concentrations, a biomarker of tobacco smoke, were associated with increased WBC counts (FDR=3.9x10 -64 ).

Previous literature on the associations between pesticide exposures and neutrophil counts have conflicting findings. One study of agricultural workers found decreased neutrophil counts associated with pesticide exposure. 60 Another found no difference in neutrophil count in exposed and unexposed participants. 61 Studies of agricultural workers and hospitalized patients with pesticide poisoning found an increase in neutrophil counts compared to unexposed participants. 62 Monocytes are important sources for inflammatory cytokines, and there are rarely disorders that result in abnormalities in only the monocytes. 64 In our study, we observed two (50.0%) smoking-related compounds, 9 (36.0%) VOCs, and 4 (33.3%) PAHs were associated with lower percentages of monocytes. A study of cigarette smokers (exposed to smoking-related compounds, VOCs, and PAHs) found that compared to non-smokers, smoking was associated with lower monocyte counts. 65 In contrast, two other studies observed that smoking or number of cigarettes per day was associated with an increase in monocyte counts. 59, 66 It would be of interest to consider mixtures of these chemical families rather than the association of each individual chemical to determine overall effects.",

We observed associations between six PCBs and monocytes, RBCs, and WBCs (FDR<0.05). We were not able to differentiate lymphocyte subtypes, so it is possible that B cell proportions decreased and the other subtype proportions increased more, or all subtypes increased in cell count, but these chemicals disrupted antibody production.

Examining the average effects for these chemical families (smoking-related compounds, acrylamides, PAHs, furans, BFRs, and PCBs), identifying one indicator chemical from the family, or creating a cumulative measure of the family may be efficient methods to reduce the number of analytical variables. 22,67-69 Conversely, concentrations of metals were less correlated (average r=0.18). The low correlation could be due to the heterogeneous sources of exposure for metals including from the natural environment, diet, and workplace. We observed in the forest plot(Figure 4)that the metals had a large spread and variable direction of effect on the immune measures, so the chemical family may require careful consideration when analyzing as a group.

From this study, we identified many chemicals for further toxicological and epidemiological studies.
