In general, predicting the mechanical properties of proteins and the mechanical stability of protein substructures is very challenging due to the absence This paper is divided as follows: First, we present a post hoc structural analysis of E. coli Hsp70 followed by phylogenetic analysis of 205 Hsp70s. Of these 205, 183 sequences are bacterial DnaK (including nine paralogs), 12 Hsp70 are from Archea and 10 from Eukaryota. Second, we focus on unsupervised and supervised machine learning meth-ods. To this end, 28 physicochemical features, as well as one-hot encoding, were used to find informative projections in the principal component analysis (PCA). Substructures were classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In the first naive approach, we assumed context-free features and were not able to develop a successful learning model for classification. To improve our model, a sequence context was included by applying the moving average algorithm, which uses pre-defined window sizes. Then, LDA and PCA methods were better able to distinguish between two classes of residues located in either mechanically stable or unstable substructures. In particular, LDA at relatively large window sizes was partially successful at distinguishing and classifying the residues into S/U classes. However, we found that the classification was not robust enough. For more accurate S/U class prediction, three machine learning models were used: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). All these methods were able to identify and distinguish residues located in stable and unstable substructures at good accuracy; the logistic regression model performed best, with an accuracy of 0.925 (before the cross-validation procedure). In the next step, the cross-validation procedure of the logistic regression model was conducted, and a final accuracy of 0.879 was obtained. We found that the most of the misclassified residues are located at the borders of the S/U substructure class.",

Structural analysis was conducted on the closed form of E. coli Hsp 70 (accession PDB code: 2KHO) [27] using Discovery Studio (BIOVIA, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, Discovery Studio, San Diego: Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, 2019). Using this program, we calculated secondary structure content, average number, and average lengths of intramolecular H-bonds. Sequence alignment was generated using MEGA X [28] by applying the MUSCLE algorithm [29] . The following settings were used: gap open: \u22122.90, gap extension: 0, hydrophobicity multiplier: 1.2, and clustering method: UPGMA. The sequence identity matrix was calculated after sequence alignment using the program BioEdit [30] . According to the manual, for each pair of sequences, score values are calculated as indicated: (i) all positions are pairwise compared, one at a time, (ii) all 'gap' or place-holding characters are treated as a gap, (iii) positions where both sequences have a gap do not contribute (they are not an identity, they do not exist), (iv) positions where there is a residue in one sequence and a gap in the other do count as a mismatch, (v) reported number represents the ratio of identities to the length of the longer of the two sequences after positions, where both sequences contain a gap, are removed.",

The first and last values were omitted so that the central value of the moving average was calculated with the full size of the window. The window size was varied from 1 to 31 amino acids. For the PC analysis, informative projections were calculated using Orange [32] . In this approach, for every 2D projection 10 nearest neighbors were identified. Hence, combinations of pairs of features are found. Next, counting of features with identical labels provides the score of the projection. The following machine learning supervised methods were used: logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine. In all methods, the values of the attributes were normalized. Regarding the training and testing set: for each window size, we selected 40 amino acids from the beginning and 40 amino acids from the end of the Hsp70 sequence for the testing. Hence, the first 40 amino acids belong to the class of unstable substructures (U1), and the other 40 amino acids belong to the stable substructures S4. The other positions were used as a training set. In the selection of residues for the training set, we selected residues that are not affected by the residues used for testing purposes. Because of significant window size in some cases, training residues may contribute to the features of nearby residues, and hence they can affect each other. To this end, special care was devoted to select positions used for training, which depends on the size of the window used for moving average. Feature selection was performed using a forward feature selection algorithm. It is an iterative approach, which starts with no feature selected. In each iteration, the feature that improves the model the most is added to the feature set. Using the final selected feature set, parameter optimization was then conducted using at least 1000 iterations, and, in the case of SVM, the brute force method was used. In this method, all possible parameter combinations of the given learning model (given the intervals and step sizes) are evaluated, and the best (the highest accuracy) is returned. For LR and RF, the number of iterations was optimized as well. For SVM, three parameters were optimized: power, bias, and gamma for polynomial kernel type. Cross-validation ran in 10-folds, and partitions were sampled randomly. For these partitions, the class distribution has been preserved. A synthetic set of artificial physicochemical features was created by randomized mixing of values for individual amino acids only within a given feature (see also Supplementary Materials). There was no exchange of the amino acid values between different features.",

The analysis of the individual substructures shows that stable substructures have a preference for \u03b2-sheets, while only one out of three unstable substructures contains a significant amount of \u03b2-sheets.

The number of hydrogen bonds per amino acid is slightly lower for U substructures compared to stable substructures. The lowest number of hydrogen bonds per residue are found for U2 (0.857), followed by U3 (1.25). On the other hand, S4 showed the highest number of hydrogen bonds per residue (1.514), likely the result of the helical characters (84.29%) of this substructure. In principle, the mechanical properties of Hsp70 substructures can have different evolutionary constraints, which can be deduced from phylogenetic analysis (see also Supplementary Materials). We collected 205 sequences of Hsp70 mostly from eubacteria and performed multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The MSA enabled us to have a deeper look at the average amino acid composition of the substructures, the number of conserved residues within each substructure, and amino acid variability. In the first step, the average amino acid composition of the substructures was analyzed (Figure 1d ). There are subtle differences in amino acid composition; for example, Ala is slightly more presented in unstable substructures (13.94%) than stable substructures (8.15%). On the other hand, it appears that stable substructures consist slightly more Thr (7.56%) compared to unstable substructures (3.29%). This is consistent with a statistically higher number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds per residues for S substructures since Thr contains the OH group that participates in hydrogen bonding. Next, for each substructure, we analyzed the number of conserved regions in different substructures ( Figure 1e ). Because substructures have a different number of amino acid residues, we calculated the number of conserved residues per single amino acid residue (CSR/residue). The total number of CSR is indicated in parentheses ( Figure 1e ). Substructures U3 and S4 do not have any conserved positions.

The Scree plot shows that the first components already contain most of the variance. Plotting of PC1 (60.94%) and PC2 (14.98%) shows many overlapping values for stable and unstable substructures with no apparent separation between the categories. There is a minor number of points that U and S substructures differ from each other. To analyze whether it is possible to find a linear combination of features that separates two mechanically distinct substructures, we performed a linear discrimination analysis, LDA (Figure 2b ). LDA showed only poor performance; however, slight differences exist that may be utilized for learning approaches consistent with PCA. Therefore, we applied the logistic regression method to our original data in our next endeavor and to transformed data from PCA and LDA. The workflow of the analysis is shown in Figure 2c . Before data were used as an input, a correlation filter was applied (see Methods). For training, all available distributed positions were used for training and. The logistic regression (LR) was then used primarily because other ML methods yielded similar results, and as we will demonstrate later, LR has the best performance among other ML methods such as random forest and support vector machine. To maximize the accuracy of the LR method, several rounds of parameter optimization were conducted. The results of this learning method are shown in the form of a confusion matrix (Figure 2d ), including the corresponding Cohen's kappa value. Cohen's kappa shows very low values for all cases, below 0.125 that indicates poor performance. In the same line, the confusion matrix results show the failure of logistic regression learning to distinguish residues located in mechanically distinct substructures.",

We, therefore, applied an approach where each amino acid is uniquely described by a matrix consisting of 20 columns that have value 1 for identity or zero for else. The results of this so-called one-hot encoding are shown in Figure 2d . However, even for this encoding, there is no learning possible, and Cohen's kappa value drops to 0. Our findings indicate that LR fails to learn using context-free features, which means that the developed machine learning model cannot distinguish the residues located in U or S substructures. To improve the models, we decided to include the local context of amino acids. The reason is that residues within the individual substructures differ by their local sequence and consequently by the physico-chemical context. This context can be approximated by, e.g., using an average moving procedure to calculate a new set of features that reflect nearby residues.",

Hence, the local chemical context of residues can play a crucial role in defining that a given substructure will be mechanically stable or not. To include the local sequence context, a new set of features were re-calculated using the moving average (MA) procedure that provides a measure of the average local properties for a customdefined window's size. In this algorithm, features of the residues encompassing the central position were weighted by the central Gaussian method. In the Gaussian method, nearby amino acids contribute less than distal amino acids (see Methods). The window size defines the cut-off over which residues are assumed to have zero contribution. MA procedure was applied for features A1-A19 because the calculated averages have a plausible physical meaning as local sequence-dependent hydrophobicity. It is physically feasible that for individual substructures, such calculated hydrophobicity is context-dependent and not a sole property of individual amino acids. Other features (A20-A28) such as polarity, refractivity, and mutability were not averaged and considered as not strongly dependent on a local sequence. As expected, moving average has a significant effect on the feature variations (Figure 3a ). Large oscillations of feature values along the sequence are smoothed, and each of the positions starts to be context-dependent. Smoothing and averaging of the A6 and A10 feature values are dependent on window size. The effect of window sizes on feature values is shown in Figure 3a ,b, where the window size was set to 1, 15, and 31 amino acids. In all our further analyses, we limited the maximum value for the window size to 31. This upper limit is given by the amino acid length limitation of the sequence. A more extended window size would result in completely neglecting information about the positions in this shortest substructure. At such large window sizes, residues located in U3 would not be considered for training or testing purposes. For testing at the window size 1, N-terminal 40 positions (U class) and 40 C-terminal positions (S class) were used. For testing at larger window sizes, we kept the total number of trained positions constant. However, as the window size increased, the moving average was not calculated for the positions close to the end. To solve this missing end issue, we shifted the positions for the training set toward protein sequence by the value n-1, where n is the window size. One crucial point is that hypothetically increasing the window size leads to a smoothing of individual differences along the sequence and, as a consequence, one would expect that such smoothing would, even more, reduce the information content of how individual amino acids relocated in U or S substructures.",

Pearsons correlations between 28 features are shown in Figure 3c . By increasing window size, the overall correlation among features decreases from 0.61 for 1 aa to 0.42 for 31 aa. The decrease in the correlation between features results from unequal transformations of features; A20-A28 did not undergo moving average transformations. The observed loss of feature correlations can be explained by residues within distinct clusters while hydrophobic clusters potentiate values of A1-A20 features, the presence of the chemically identical amino acid at different positions encompassed by the cluster of polar amino acid will lead to diminishing correlation with A20-A28 features. Having a new set of context-dependent features, we applied the PCA method to question whether MA at a specific window size can provide a possible strategy to categorize residues within S and U substructures (see also Supplementary Figure S4 ). Our workflow consists of the utilization of a new set of amino acid features. Again, a correlation filter was applied, and highly correlated (r2 more than 0.95) were removed (Supplementary Table S1, Figure S5 ). It is important to emphasize that for different window sizes, different features were selected. After the selection, data were normalized, and PCA was applied, which yields principal components that can have different informative values. After the calculation, we found very that the first PCs was not informative in respect class separation. Informative PC projections were evaluated by the calculating the separation values for U/S classes.",

Notably, depending on the size of the window used for MA, different PCs are selected, and we asked whether these different PC share similar features. Loading scores for the PC components are shown in Figure 4c , and they quantify how the individual features are represented in different PCs. Interestingly, even after MA application, features A20-A28 show a progressively smaller but distinct contribution to the PCs with the best informative projections. The amplitude of the loading score indicates their minor importance for the separation between categories. In summary, the PCA method shows low performance in categorizing positions for the U and S substructure classes, and no clear cluster separation can be found. Using MA and algorithm for the finding of informative projections, the performance of PCA is slightly improved but still inefficient for a precise categorization.

The LDA results in n-1 dimension reduction, where n is the number categories, and the data are represented by a 1D data array that can be used to classify the given residue to U or S substructure classes. The application of moving average has increased the differences between categories. The performance of LDA can be visualized by comparing differences in dimension values for U and S classes, which is shown in Figure 5c . As mentioned earlier, in the absence of MA, the performance is inferior. This increase shows a roughly linear dependence on the window size (Figure 5b) . For window size 15 and 31 amino acids, the difference in dimension values for U and S increases, indicating a better classification of the data. A closer look at eigenvectors for LDA at 31 aa window size is shown in Figure 5d . Here, the features A20-A28 show values close to zero, indicating their weak contribution, consistent with loading scores of the informative projections from PCA.

To assess whether overfitting can be an issue in our analysis, we calculated Cohen's kappa, which was reasonably high for all methods: 0.85 for LR, 0.75 for SVM, and 0.48 for RF. High Cohen's kappa values for LR and SVM indicate that we can rule out the overfitting. The high accuracy of different ML methods for a window size of 31 was further analyzed by reducing the window size and performing feature selection/parameter optimization rounds. As expected, reducing window size led to a decrease in the accuracy of the models in all methods (Figure 6d) . Overall, LR slightly outperforms all of the other methods. Therefore, we continue further with a validation of the LR method. To validate the LR model, we designed a so-called shuffling test. In this test, we took all 22 features identified in the feature selection process for the LR model and shuffled the values for individual amino acids within each feature. Hence, here we would like to estimate how the physico-chemical properties of amino acids contribute to the performance of the LR model (Table 2) . Namely, amino acids with similar chemical structures do have similar values of their features. The shuffling of the values naturally results in a decreased overall correlation between them-from 0.422 to 0.156 for shuffled data at window size 31. Hence, features used in the shuffled test are much more unique and more diverse. Using shuffled features, the accuracy of the LR model decreases to 0.3875 and Cohen s kappa decreases to \u22120.225. Such values indicate the very poor performance of the LR model with shuffled features. ",

The procedure was repeated 10 times (10-folds) and we found that the standard deviation of k-fold errors is 3.63% which indicates a high robostness. After cross-validation, the LR model reached an accuracy of 0.879 and Cohen s kappa of 0.741 (Table 3 ). The precision of the residue classification was 0.863 and 0.884. The analysis of misidentified positions showed that most of the misidentified residues were located between the borders of U and S substructures (Figure 7 ). In general, there are more misidentified positions in U substructures compared to positions within S substructures, and more misidentified positions are in the nucleotidebinding domain of DnaK. In this approach, caution is needed because test/train sets are not explicitly separated. We applied cross-validation to other machine learning methods (see Section 3.5). Even though these approaches had slightly weaker performance, yet they support our overall concept of learning. Cross-validation statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table S2 .

We were not able to develop an accurate machine learning model employing one-hot encoding, which indicates that the physico-chemical information encoded in amino acids is crucial. The most significant difference between one-hot encoding versus physico-chemical parameters is the values for individual amino acids. In one-hot encoding, the values for individual amino acids are binary: 0 or 1. However, the physico-chemical values for individual amino acids have a broader range of values. Additionally, the values are not randomly distributed; instead, chemically similar amino acids tend to be grouped together and have similar physico-chemical values, which results in grouping amino acids as polar, charged, hydrophobic, etc. In one-hot encoding, such grouping is not present. Note that grouping chemically similar amino acids is also observable in evolutionary relations between amino acids, such as in BLOSUM substitutions matrices. These relations indicate that an amino acid can easily replace a chemically similar amino acid in a protein sequence.

In this algorithm, increasing window sizes improved the performance of our machine learning model. The moving average window generates locally averaged values and simultaneously provides a unique value specific to a given residue in the polypeptide chain. Increasing window sizes thus progressively generates unique physico-chemical values that facilitate learning. This approach, however, has a limitation: the number of non-overlapping positions used for learning and training sets decreases proportionally. Classifying residues in the short substructures has an additional intrinsic problem that large window sizes locally average over different substructures eventually over various classes of substructures. We used the moving average algorithm in unsupervised and supervised methods. In PCA, as an unsupervised method, the most informative projections (the largest difference between U/S classes) were found at very high PC numbers (PC14 and PC17-in the case of window size 31), which suggests that the difference between U/S classes is quite small and presents an only tiny fraction of the total variance (0.4659% for PC14, and 0.152% for PC17). The progress in the learning is clearly seen in the LDA ( Figure 5 ); the increase in the difference between the residues in the S and U class has non-trivial dependence likely due to compensation of the features. Here, context-dependent features showed the highest impact. Next, three different machine learning methods, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine, were applied and processed through the several rounds of the feature selection and optimization. From the three ML methods, logistic regression showed the best performance and an accuracy of 0.92. Again, increasing the window size of the moving average up to 30 residues has improved the accuracy of the predictions.",

Similarly, for the NBD, there are no differences in variability profiles of the substructures of U/S class.
