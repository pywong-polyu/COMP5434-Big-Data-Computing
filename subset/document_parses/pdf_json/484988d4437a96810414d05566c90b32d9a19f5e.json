Our meta-analysis aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed with CAPA compared to those without CAPA. Methods We searched the Pubmed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1, 2020 and August 1, 2021, containing comparative data of patients diagnosed with CAPA and those without CAPA. Results Eight cohort studies involving 729 critically ill COVID-19 patients with comparative data were included. CAPA patients were older (mean age 66.58 vs. 59.25 years; P = 0.007) and had underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (13.7 vs. 6.1%; OR 2.75; P = 0.05). No differences in gender, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities of diabetes and cancer were observed. CAPA patients were more likely to receive long-term corticosteroid treatment (15.0 vs. 5.3%; OR 3.53; P = 0.03). CAPA patients had greater severity of illness based on sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score with a higher all-cause in-hospital mortality rate (42.6 vs. 26.5%; OR 3.39; P < 0.001) and earlier ICU admission from illness onset (mean 11.00 vs. 12.00 days; P = 0.003). ICU length of stay (LOS), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) duration, the requirement of inotropic support and renal replacement therapy were comparable between the two groups. Conclusions CAPA patients are typically older with underlying COPD and received long-term corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, CAPA is associated with higher SOFA scores, mortality, and earlier onset of ICU admission from illness onset.",

COVID-19 is known to have a wide variety of clinical manifestations, from a mild flu-like illness to severe respiratory failure in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As the wave of COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe, secondary pulmonary infections from bacterial and fungal microorganisms have been increasingly recognized in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, associated with poor outcomes of increased mechanical ventilation requirement, multi-organ dysfunction, and mortality [1, 2] . The diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is made based on the positive results of lower respiratory tract (LRT) cultures or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Aspergillus species, or using galactomannan (GM) biomarker obtained from serum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in COVID-19 patients, termed COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) [3] [4] [5] [6] . Multiple diagnostic criteria have been used to define and identify patients with CAPA across many observational studies [7] . Although the incidence of fungal",

In the setting of a compatible clinical presentation, positive TA should be an indication to perform a confirmatory test involving serum biomarkers or BAL for cultures, PCR, and GM when appropriate. In our meta-analysis, we only included studies in which we defined LRT samples as either BAL or NBL. Furthermore, LRT PCR together with serum and BAL GM were used to supplant the diagnosis of CAPA over colonization ( Table 1 ). The pathophysiology in which patients develop CAPA is not clear. The damage to the respiratory epithelial lining directly by SARS-CoV-2 or as a consequence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine storm phase will lead to mucociliary clearance dysfunction that facilitates the attachment of Aspergillus spores and subsequent invasion [25] . Moreover, COVID-19-induced ARDS, hypoxia, and sepsis may trigger immune paralysis of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, further promoting invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [3, 26, 27] .",

However, many studies included did not specify the actual doses or total duration of corticosteroids received on a long-term basis by COVID-19 patients. Corticosteroid, in particular dexamethasone, has emerged as the cornerstone therapy for treating COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure [29, 30] . No association was observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed with CAPA than those without CAPA when treated with high-dose corticosteroids in our meta-analysis (Table 2 ). In critically ill non-COVID-19 patients, stress doses of hydrocortisone are not associated with a high risk of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [28] . However, concerns exist that even a short course of corticosteroid may predispose to the development of CAPA. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits of corticosteroids had excluded COVID-19 patients at risk or in whom secondary infections were suspected [29, 31] . In those RCTs that evaluated the risk of secondary infections involving ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia, and catheter-related bloodstream or urinary tract infections, no difference was demonstrated in COVID-19 patients receiving high doses of corticosteroids for 14 days or until ICU discharged [32, 33] . Nevertheless, further studies are required to confirm these findings as most studies included were conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic before the publication of multiple RCTs demonstrating the benefits of corticosteroids, which explains the inconsistent and infrequent use of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 patients (Table 2) .",

            "text": "Additionally, COPD was identified as a risk factor for developing CAPA in COVID-19 patients ( Table 2) . This is likely due to the severity of underlying COPD instead of long-term use of inhalational corticosteroids [28, 34] . Aspergillus spores are typically cleared from the lungs by the ciliary action of the bronchial epithelium, but similarly to COVID-19, the ciliary activity in COPD patients is often impaired and inflamed from tobacco smoke, multiple episodes of infection, and repeated epithelial destruction. This allows Aspergillus spores to bind to the epithelial layer and invade the bronchial mucosa and pulmonary parenchyma, eventually the vasculature, and cause pulmonary infarction [35] . Conversely, several studies observed that comorbidities of COPD and diabetes alone were not associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis diagnosis in critically ill non-COVID-19 patients [28] . The risk of developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in COPD patients is hypothesized to be from underlying long-term use of high-dose corticosteroid, over 700 mg within three months that impairs immune function, especially macrophages and T-cell activity, responsible for monocyte-mediated damage to Aspergillus spores and hyphae, and promote in-vitro growth of Aspergillus species [34] [35] [36] . In our meta-analysis, the number of studies assessing the association of COPD and long-term corticosteroid treatment was limited to three [14, 15, 18] and seven studies [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , respectively. However, a \"two-hit\" hypothesis might exist in which COPD and long-term use of corticosteroid treatment, especially in high doses, synergistically predispose to CAPA.",

Clinical characteristics and risk factors of male, COPD, diabetes, cancer, long-term corticosteroid treatment and immunosuppressants were assessed. The odds ratio was calculated by the Mantel-Haenszel method with a random-effects model. CI confidence intervals, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, df degree of freedom, M-H Mantel-Haenszel \u25c2 not solid tumors, and the recent use within three months of immunosuppressants, specifically those that suppressed T and B cells [10, 28] . In our meta-analysis, no association between the risk of developing CAPA in COVID-19 patients among those with a history of cancers, although the type of cancers, whether solid or hematologic, was not described in the majority of studies included (Table 2 ). Moreover, we demonstrated no association between the long-term use of immunosuppressants or COVID-19 therapies of hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in developing CAPA diagnosis. Tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, has been shown to predispose to invasive fungal infections in animal studies [37] . An early observational study involving 544 COVID-19 patients revealed an increased risk of secondary infections (13 vs. 4%; P < 0.01) in those receiving tocilizumab [38] . Conversely, a large retrospective study of 4,485 COVID-19 patients demonstrated no association in the frequency of developing secondary infections among those receiving tocilizumab therapy [39] . Similar findings were noted in a recent RCT of 389 COVID-19 patients comparing tocilizumab with placebo [40] . Nevertheless, a large, well-designed observational study that focuses explicitly on the type of immunosuppressants, dosing, and duration of administration with the risk of developing CAPA is required to confirm these findings.",

Similar findings were noted in our meta-analysis where many critically ill COVID-19 patients with CAPA were mechanically ventilated and had greater disease severity based on their initial SOFA score, quicker time to ICU admission from illness onset, and higher all-cause in-hospital mortality rate than those without CAPA (Table 2) . However, the requirement of inotropic support, RRT, and duration of IMV were similar. Compared to influenza patients, a retrospective multi-center cohort study of 81 influenza patients observed an increase in morbidity and mortality among those with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis diagnosis with prolonged hospital LOS and higher requirement of IMV, vasopressors, RRT, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, despite receiving antifungal therapy [41] . A larger retrospective multi-center cohort study of 432 influenza patients revealed that those diagnosed with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were more likely to have comorbidities of diabetes, hematological malignancy, neutropenia, solid organ transplant, exposure to high-dose prolonged corticosteroids before admission, and greater severity of illness with longer ICU LOS, the higher requirement of vasopressors and RRT with poor mortality rate [8] . The lack of awareness of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in influenza patients resulting in the delayed initiation of antifungal therapy is an independent risk factor for increased mortality [42] .",

We employed stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria while using recognized invasive pulmonary aspergillus classifications and accepting only BAL and NBL as LRT specimens. Multiple studies from various countries involving COVID-19 patients of different ethnicities (Table 1) ensured that the pragmatic results of our study are relevant and represent all populations. We excluded patients with non-Aspergillus microorganisms identified on LRT specimens as we recognized that non-Aspergillus microorganisms-associated pneumonia, which is common in COVID-19 patients, especially in those requiring mechanical ventilation, are associated with higher morbidity and mortality that might confound the outcomes of our meta-analysis [43] . Furthermore, distinguishing between CAPA and non-Aspergillus-associated pneumonia in COVID-19 patients are challenging due to the overlapping clinical and radiological features [44, 45] . The pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the development of lung injury and the role played in enhancing ongoing infection need to be investigated in further studies. The low heterogeneity among studies describing the in-hospital mortality in CAPA patients prevents underestimating ICU LOS, IMV duration, and the need for inotropic and RRT ( Table 2 ). The funnel plot demonstrated symmetry in patients' clinical characteristics, indicating a low likelihood of publication bias (Fig. 5) .",

            "text": "There are several limitations to our meta-analysis. The heterogeneity among studies with a varying incidence of CAPA between 3.3 and 34.4% and clinical characteristics (Tables 1 and 2) described may limit the ability to perform an accurate meta-analysis. This could be attributed to the difference in clinical and mycological evidence varied in clinical centers from different parts of the world, lack of clinical awareness, and standardized diagnostic approach for evaluating CAPA, particularly when clinical features and radiological findings in CAPA resemble those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia [10, 14, 46] . The use of the randomeffects model as a solution towards clinical heterogeneity in results may have resulted in a more conservative treatment Fig. 4 Forrest plot of COVID-19 patients divided into CAPA versus non-CAPA. Risk factors of initial COVID-19 therapies (antibiotic, corticosteroid, tocilizumab, and hydroxychloroquine, and outcomes of all-cause in-hospital mortality, inotropic support, and RRT were assessed. The odds ratio was calculated by the Mantel-Haenszel method with a random-effects model. CI confidence intervals, df degree of freedom, M-H Mantel-Haenszel, RRT renal replacement therapy \u25c2 effect and wider CIs. Furthermore, the reluctance to perform aerosol-generating procedures of bronchoscopies in critically ill COVID-19 patients is due to concerns of transmission and the risk of triggering hemodynamic instability that limits respiratory tract samples to sputum and TA [46] . These likely explain the low number of studies available in the current literature. Although TAs are potentially safer alternative investigative options, they cannot effectively distinguish between colonization and true infection, leading to overdiagnosis of CAPA and unnecessary treatments. The low yield of serum GM will further complicate the screening process for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in COVID-19 patients due to its poor sensitivity at 21%, especially in nonimmunocompromised patients [46] . Despite BAL GM being a superior diagnostic test to confirm CAPA, as an aerosolgenerating procedure, it is rarely performed. Certain studies even reported that the variability in diagnostic criteria used for CAPA diagnosis might lead to overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and overestimating the true risk factors and associated outcomes [14, 16, 22] . Therefore, significant predictors and prognostic factors associated with outcomes may have been missed due to a lack of analyzable data. Autopsy findings among 677 deceased COVID-19 patients during the first wave of pandemic demonstrated that the incidence of tissue-proven invasive fungal diseases was up to 2% [47] . Important environmental factors such as temporary facilities/medical centers that were rapidly assembled in many countries to accommodate the increase in healthcare capacity during the pandemic that does not adhere to rigorous ventilation protocols present within permanent hospitals might contribute to the spread of COVID-19 among the critically ill patients from increased exposure to dust and ambient air containing Aspergillus spores [48] . In general, the duration of patient enrollment and follow-up for all the included studies (Table 1) were performed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and might not accurately represent the actual risk factors and outcomes due to the ever-evolving improvement in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients.",

Patients with CAPA diagnosis have more significant disease severity based on SOFA scores, earlier onset of ICU admission, and higher allcause in-hospital mortality rate than those without CAPA. Nevertheless, the results of our meta-analysis represent the patient population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and better studies are required with the advancement of COVID-19 therapies to determine if the same risk factors and outcomes are observed during the second wave of the pandemic and beyond. Although early CAPA diagnosis likely improves the morbidity and all-cause in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients, the benefit of timely initiation of appropriate antifungals is unclear. Furthermore, whether antifungal prophylaxis is superior to a standardized diagnostic approach combined with prompt initiation of antifungal therapy for managing CAPA patients remains to be examined. In the absence of antifungal prophylaxis, adequate screening for CAPA, recognition of its risk factors, and exclusion of colonization are essential.",
