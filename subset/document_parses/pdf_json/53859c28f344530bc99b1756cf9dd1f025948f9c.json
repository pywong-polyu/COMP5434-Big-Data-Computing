We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, where super-saturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air.",

This well-documented finding is surprising considering that such masks are poor at filtering the smallest aerosol particles, which can reach the lower respiratory tract and have been associated with severe disease. We show that facemasks strongly increase the effective humidity of inhaled air, thereby promoting hydration of the respiratory epithelium which is known to be beneficial to the immune system. Increased humidity of inspired air could be an alternate explanation for the now wellestablished link between mask wearing and lower disease severity.",

The common cold encompasses more than 200 different viruses [1] , including a large family of rhinoviruses, but also members of the coronavirus family, including 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, that are usually associated with mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illness. As suggested by their \"common cold\" name, these diseases have a seasonal character, and most of these viruses become more widespread with colder outside temperature. Person-to-person transmission of respiratory viruses is dominated by respiratory droplets generated by the infected person, which include breath, speech, cough, and sneeze droplets [2] . The types of droplets that dominate the transmission path depend on the virus and on the location of the respiratory tract infection [2] .",

            "text": "The seasonality of COVID-19 [3] is now increasingly accepted as an important factor in the rapid escalation of this disease in the northern hemisphere with the onset of the 2020 fall and the approaching winter [4] . This pattern follows the same trend reported for the OC43 and 229E members of the coronavirus family by Kim et al., who noted that infections \"sharply increased during the low temperature winter months of October through February\" [4, 5] . Many factors may contribute to this seasonality. These include the following: more time spent indoors [3] [4] [5] , where respiratory virus-containing aerosols remain airborne for many minutes [6] [7] [8] ; decreased exposure to sunlight, resulting in lower levels of vitamin D, which is essential to the immune system [9] ; lower UV levels that efficiently inactivate larger coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19; and prolonged viability of the virus at lower temperature and lower humidity [10] [11] [12] . Importantly, outdoor temperature is positively correlated with indoor relative humidity, which can reach low levels during the colder winter months. Because lower relative humidity results in faster dehydration of respiratory droplets, a larger fraction of droplets fully dehydrate before landing on the ground [13] . Hence, the fraction that remains as aerosol, and thereby the potential for transmission, increases. All of these factors likely play some role in the seasonality of respiratory viruses and can be considered \"external factors\", impacting the life cycle of the virus outside of the human host.",

Although the drug was postulated to function as an inhibitor of the human TMPRSS2 protease [24] , thereby blocking requisite cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, its affinity for TMPRSS2 (Kd ~0.7 \u00b5M) appears too low for this inhibition to be effective. Instead, we propose its benefits may derive from its ability to enhance mucociliary clearance through hydrolytic depolymerization of mucus protein fibers as well as increased hydration of the epithelial surface, which both relate to its use in general clinical practice as a secretolytic expectorant. Interestingly, the anti-asthma drug budesonide, used as an inhaled rather than a systemic corticosteroid [25] , also is showing remarkably positive preliminary results in its clinical trial (STOIC [26] ).

The mask absorbs much of the water in exhaled breath that becomes super-saturated upon cooling when exiting the mouth; upon subsequent inspiration of dry air, this water evaporates and thereby humidifies the air that passes through this hydrated mask. We measured the magnitude of the effect at temperatures ranging from 8 to 37 \u00baC, and for different types of mask material. Whereas all masks tested result in substantial humidification, the effect is strongest for high density cotton masks, where the high heat capacity of such masks aids to heat and humidify the inspired air, resulting in effective increases above the environmental humidity that can exceed 100%. Hence, such masks act as rudimentary equivalents to the more effective heat-exchanger masks, introduced decades ago to mitigate cold-induced asthma [30, 31] .",

During those measurements, the volume of exhaled air was simply derived from the increase in relative humidity within the chamber, which proved to be a convenient method in the absence of masks. However, it became obvious that considerably more expiration/inspiration breathing cycles were needed to achieve the same increase in RH with a mask than without a mask. This observation indicated that the mask absorbs water from the exhaled breath, which under steady-state conditions must be released upon inspiration, thereby effectively increasing the humidity of inhaled air. Considering the increasingly recognized impact of humidity on the spread and severity of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, we quantitatively measured the effective increase in the humidity of inspired air when using facemasks.",

The ability of various types of synthetic and natural fibers to absorb water depends strongly on temperature [36] [37] [38] . Natural fibers such as wool, cotton, and silk are particularly effective at absorbing water, whereas synthetic polyester or nylon fibers do so to a much lesser extent [38] . In our pilot study, we simply tested four common types of masks: An N95 respirator mask; a regular surgical mask; an NIH-supplied mask consisting of two-layers of a blend of cotton and polyester; and a relatively thick, lined cotton mask with a total mass of 22 g ( Figure S3 ).

Under the same conditions, both the N95 mask and the polyester-cotton mask increased the humidity of inspired air by 55-60% ( Figure 2) . Surprisingly, measurements with the heavy cotton mask resulted in a strong further decrease of chamber humidification, meaning a considerably larger fraction of exhaled water is temporarily stored in the fabric mask. During the 96-second measurement, the apparent RH increase over the average RH (ca 30%) in the chamber was about 90%. At first sight, this apparent increase of inspired air humidity to above 100% may defy intuition. However, the explanation is grounded in simple physics. The exhalation of breath warms up the mask (and the water stored in it) to well above the environmental temperature.",

Presumably, this 30\u00b11 \u00baC temperature represents a lower limit for the actual temperature at the face side of the mask at the start of inspiration, allowing the humidity of inspired air to reach values that are well above 100% at 8 \u00baC. Even if only 20% of the mask surface was involved in the actual passage of air, this fraction of the mask corresponds to about 4 grams of cotton with a total heat capacity of 20 J/K, considerably higher than the heat capacity of ca 1.2 J/K for one liter of inspired air.

It is important to note, however, that these very large RH increases at 8 \u00baC (150-300%) correspond to less dramatic increases in absolute humidity of 12-24 mg/L. Once heated inside the respiratory tract, this corresponds to changes in relative humidity at 36 \u00baC of 29-58%. By contrast, even while the RH changes of inspired air are much smaller for the measurements at 37 \u00baC, this increase directly translates into the relative humidity change of air inspired into the lungs. As a consequence, from the perspective of respiratory tract dehydration, the effect of each mask type is fairly constant across the entire 8-37 \u00baC range. At all temperatures, the humidification resulting from the heavy cotton mask is about double that of a surgical mask, with the N95 and cotton-polyester cloth masks falling in between.",

The effect of masks was so pronounced that the authors even raised the possibility of \"variolation\", i.e., the inoculation of an uninfected person with a minute amount of live virus, a procedure introduced into the Western world about three centuries ago to fight smallpox (Variola) prior to the availability of a vaccine [28] . Although, following the successful development of multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines, the idea of variolation is no longer relevant and was strongly criticized by experts [29] , we also note that it should not apply to airborne viral respiratory diseases in the first place. As shown by Haas et al. [40] , the dose-response curve for SARS infection follows the exponential model, also known as Single-Hit-Model (SHM) [41] or Independent Action Hypothesis (IAH) [42] , meaning that the risk of infection initially increases linearly with exposure. This model also proved appropriate in the classic analysis of a measles outbreak [8] . Even while any single inhaled virion is unlikely to enter a susceptible host cell and create progeny, the probability of such an infection to occur is non-zero and increases linearly with the number of virions inhaled. This is analogous to purchasing lottery tickets: the odds of a winning single ticket are small but increase linearly with the number of tickets. With virions randomly dispersed in the oral or mucosal fluid that exits the mouth of an infected person in the form of highly hydrated (>95%) microscopic droplets, the vast majority of these droplets are so small that statistically they are unlikely to contain more than one infectious virion [7] . In contrast to smallpox variolation, where the virus was applied to a small scratch on the skin, inhaled airborne SARS-CoV-2 virions will be distributed randomly across the epithelial surface of the respiratory tract.",

However, cloth masks are relatively poor at filtering out these smallest particles. So, even though cloth masks are expected to lower the incidence of infection, their protective effect to the wearer will be less for the smallest particles, which are associated with more severe disease, opposite to observation.

For non-N95 masks, such leakage is often significant and will proportionately lower the effective humidity increase of inspired air. So, in practice the cotton mask humidification efficiency will drop somewhat, to values comparable to the tight fitting N95 mask. The surgical and polyester-cotton blend masks, which also will be subject to leakage, then are expected to perform somewhat lower than the N95 and all-cotton masks.",

Humidity in the breathing chamber, during tidal breathing at a rate of ten 0.95-L breaths per minute without and with facemasks. The absolute humidity is derived from the relative humidity sensor readings, assuming that the total temperature increases less than 0.5 \u00baC for all measurements, recorded at 0.1 \u00baC resolution, is linear in time. Solid lines connect the mean of three measurements, taken at each time point. The shaded areas enclose the 95% confidence intervals. Black vertical lines mark the start and end of breathing. The temperature-dependent delay in response time of the humidity sensor is evident in the first few seconds of the trajectories and the final asymptotic stabilization after the end of breathing. The lag is most pronounced at low temperature (SI Figure S2) .",

Eq. 1 was derived from the ideal gas law using the empirical equation for predicting the saturation vapor pressure of water from the Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods of Observation, World Meteorological Organization, 2008 [32]. The change in mass of water vapor in the measurement chamber was calculated from the difference in absolute humidity, measured before and after breathing, multiplied by 95.3 L, the volume of the chamber. The amount of water absorbed by each mask, mabs(H2O)mask, was calculated by subtracting the mass of water vapor added to the chamber when wearing the mask, \u2206mchamber(H2O)mask, from the mass added when not wearing the mask, \u2206mchamber(H2O)none: mabs(H2O)mask = \u2206mchamber(H2O)none -\u2206mchamber(H2O)mask (2) For mixing a single breath with the contents of the chamber, the absolute humidity after this breath is given by, AH(1) = {p/(p+q)} AH(0) + {q/(p+q)} AHbreath (3) where p is the volume of the chamber, q is the volume of exhaled breath, and AH(n) is the absolute humidity of the chamber after n breaths. Recursive application of Eq. 3 to account for the effect of n successive breaths yields: AH(n) = {p/(p+q)} n AH(0) + [1 -{p/(p+q)} n ] AHbreath (4) Provided p and q are known, the absolute humidity of exhaled breath is then obtained from AHbreath = [AH(n) -{p/(p+q)} n AH(0)] / [1 -{p/(p+q)} n ]",
