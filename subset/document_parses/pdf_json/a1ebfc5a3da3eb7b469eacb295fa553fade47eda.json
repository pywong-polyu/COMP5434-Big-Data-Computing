While portrayals of the alcohol-breast cancer link within the media could be an avenue to increase women's awareness, there has been conflicting messages as to whether alcohol is a harmful or helpful substance to health generally. Media-disseminated health information can affect the public's behavioural response to reducing individual risk factors [3] . However, conflicting and changing information about health risks in the media adversely impacts public perception and trust [4] . This paper analyses newspaper reporting of the links between breast cancer and alcohol to examine how messages that women are receiving are framed in the media. This is crucial since, for example, if the link between alcohol and breast cancer is framed as 'certain', 'unknown' or 'unlikely', then that will influence how women respond. Additionally, if the link is framed as the responsibility of the government, the alcohol industry, individual women or open to 'fate', this will impact 'what' women might do to reduce their risk of breast cancer.",

The initial time period identified was 2009-2011-a 'peak' period due to the release of three significant public health documents which brought attention to alcohol harms. These included updated NHMRC drinking guidelines (2009) which reflected new understandings of the health impacts resulting from even low levels of alcohol consumption [26] ; an updated monograph from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on alcohol consumption, identifying breast cancer as causally related [27] , and the publication of a position statement on alcohol as a carcinogen from The Cancer Council Australia, officially recommending Australians abstain from alcohol in order to reduce cancer risk [28] . We hypothesised newspaper reporting on the release of these documents would mean Australians might have been exposed to newspaper messaging regarding low risk levels of consumption, the carcinogenicity of alcohol (with a particular focus on breast cancer), and that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption regarding cancer risk.",

This period provided a 'control' with minimal content on the alcohol-breast cancer link expected to appear in newspapers.

A total of 1047 newspaper articles were identified within the three time periods. Details of all newspaper articles were entered into a spreadsheet and assessed for eligibility, searching for articles directly discussing the consumption of alcohol in relation to breast cancer. Over 800 articles mentioned the key search terms separately and did not discuss alcohol in relation to breast cancer (e.g., recipes with chicken breast and wine). These articles, in addition to duplicates Factiva had missed, were excluded. The remaining 203 articles commented on alcohol and cancer, of which 153 directly referred to breast cancer in relation to alcohol consumption specifically. Thus, 153 newspaper articles were included for analysis (2002) (2003) (2004) ",

Over the three time periods, the newspaper portrayals of the alcohol-breast cancer link was most prominent within the behavioural frame, but the content differed over time. Initially, how much individuals drank was identified as the cause, and reductions in consumption subsequently recommended. At this stage, possible benefits of alcohol were discussed, but it was the responsibility of the individual to find balance between the harms and benefits. In the period 2009-2011, as the portrayal of perceived benefits began to wane, individual choices were further condemned, especially among breast cancer patients and survivors. These individuals were the focus of numerous articles which criticised their decisions and behaviours as dismissive of the alcohol-breast cancer warning by continuing to drink after receiving breast cancer diagnoses.

Interpretation of our findings needs to be explored with this in mind. As a popular, accessible source of health information, newspapers 'have the power to change public perceptions on health-related issues' [40] p. 39.

Additionally, Eliott et al. [49] found, where an acknowledgement of the relationship between alcohol and cancer was presented in Australian newspapers from 2005 to 2013, it was often overshadowed by competing health claims. Within the 2002-2004 and 2016-2018 periods we analysed, there remained several articles that reported on the purported benefits of alcohol in the prevention and treatment for breast cancer, presented various proportions of risk of breast cancer resulting from alcohol consumption, and suggested differing levels of alcohol intake to reduce the risk of alcohol-related breast cancer. This is despite clear evidence that breast cancer was classified as causally related to alcohol consumption [27] ; that no safe threshold of consumption was identified to avoid cancer [28] ; and the national guidelines set the maximum limit for reducing long-term alcohol-related harm at two standard drinks per day [26] .",

Our analyses showed that the behavioural frame took prominence, with women consistently portrayed as responsible for health decision making. The medical and societal framing of the alcohol-breast cancer link was generally neglected by the media, with structural factors infrequently ascribed as contributing to increased risk of breast cancer resulting from alcohol. The medical frame featured mildly in the period 2002-2004 but waned shortly thereafter, and the societal frame only began to emerge in the period 2016-2018. The privileging of the behavioural factors results in an unbalanced portrayal of the alcohol-breast cancer link and obscures some of the structural forces of disease risk as well as those medical issues beyond individual control. This can contribute to increased blame (and self-blame) for individuals that develop breast cancer, while also neglecting opportunities to raise and leverage public awareness and action on the commercial determinants of health. While it does appear that the societal angle was drawn on more by media in more recent times, integrating information that links health outcomes with population changes (i.e., exploring why women in midlife drink more than in previous decades) would be of vital assistance to contextualising alcohol consumption as a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer.",

Such advocacy would facilitate the clarity and consistency of health findings reported in the media [49] . Additionally, opportunities exist for public health professionals to respond to conflicting messages portrayed by the media in relation to the alcohol-breast cancer link. For example, through the implementation of mass media campaigns, the public health sector can promote community health messages to enhance the media's portrayal of the relationship between alcohol and breast cancer-ensuring accurate and helpful content is disseminated, avoiding claims that represent the relationship in an ambiguous or contradictory manner [53] .

Directing attention away from organisational responsibility (and the severity of an issue), and towards personal responsibility, has been identified as a key tactic employed when 'unhealthy' products (such as alcohol) are involved [55, 56] . This is observed within the alcohol industry, where DrinkWise frame's alcohol-related harms as the result of cultural drinking practices [18] . In their position statement, the Australian Medical Association [38] proposed the alcohol industry take responsibility for the harms alcohol use contributes to, and not profit from 'excess alcohol use'. The alcohol industry therefore needs to acknowledge the alcohol-related cancer harms and employ suitable strategies to raise awareness that every drink poses a health risk.",

Whilst this demonstrates some level of government accountability for addressing alcoholrelated harm [57] , the impetus for change remains with the individual. Whilst education regarding alcohol-related harm is important, it does not necessarily lead to behavioural change. Our analysis found the media strongly emphasise the behavioural frame, aligning with the neoliberal political environment which positions individuals as responsible for health decision making, conversely relieving institutions of accountability [58] . Our findings suggest other policy levers should be utilised to address alcohol harm, beyond individual responsibility, including understanding and addressing population-level changes in alcohol consumption for women in midlife.

Building on this, the analysis requires the meaning to be derived from abstract variables and is reliant on the researcher's interpretation, which might differ if undertaken by another researcher [61, 62] . Our approach of cross-checking analysis and interpretations amongst co-authors aimed to generate collective insight on the findings. Additionally, the sample was limited to mainstream Australian print media. While this is representative of the cross-platform media distributed by Australian newspapers and the targeted age-group [23] , news platforms are evolving and becoming increasingly varied, therefore attracting different sub-populations [63, 64] . Other themes or frames may emerge when the same topics are presented on different media platforms to different audiences (e.g., social media). For example, a media analysis of social media platforms would enable insight into the cancer prevention content received by young adults, public responses to, and interactions with, such information, and potential platforms for future interventions [65, 66] . It is possible that women's magazines may also provide more extensive and trusted information to their readership [25] . However, there was no such database at the time of data collection. If Australian women's magazine content is added to media databases in the future, a comparison of content could make a valuable contribution to this field. Although the purpose of this study was not to gauge the views of women about how the media portrays the alcohol-breast cancer link, future research could examine this to better understand the influence of the media on women's understandings of knowledge about alcohol as a breast cancer risk factor. Such studies could also identify the most influential themes or frames in prompting behaviour change or facilitating support for interventions designed to reduce alcohol-related cancer harms [25] .",

How the media represents the relationship between alcohol consumption and breast cancer is therefore important for informing women of alcohol-related breast cancer risk. This study demonstrates that the Australian print media has not consistently or accurately portrayed the alcohol-breast cancer link, instead exposing readers to conflicting and controversial news stories focused predominately on individual behaviours. This study identified the most prominent themes and frames portrayed in Australian newspapers over three time periods, representative of the message disseminated by the media about the alcohol-breast cancer link. Over three time periods, five themes were revealed: Ascribing Blame, Individual Responsibility, Cultural Entrenchment, False Equilibrium, and Recognition of Population Impact. Further, one frame was most prominent across all time periods: Behavioural. The commonality between the findings of the thematic and framing analyses was the focus on the individual choices and behaviours which contributed to the alcohol-related breast cancer burden, and subsequently their responsibility to enact changes to reduce this burden. Furthermore, the representation of the alcohol-breast cancer link was found to be incomplete and contradictory-new articles commonly reported results or outdated claims which conflicted with evidence-based information about the causal relationship between alcohol and breast cancer. Through media advocacy and public health promotion, media platforms can be better utilised to disseminate more balanced representations of the relationship between alcohol and breast cancer as well as the wider range of avenues to address the structural drivers of this disease.",
