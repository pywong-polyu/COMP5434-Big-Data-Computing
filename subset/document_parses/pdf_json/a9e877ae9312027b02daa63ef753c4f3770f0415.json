Innovations in regulatory systems strengthening are needed to protect public health. In this study, we assessed the integrity of the antimicrobial supply chain in Bangladesh and suggest innovations. We employed a qualitative methodology comprising a policy content analysis, and literature and database reviews. Bangladesh was chosen as a model LMIC because of its pharmaceuticals production capacity. Using a framework modified from the World Health Organization's and the United States Pharmacopoeia's, the Bangladesh National Drug Policy (BNDP) was evaluated for provisions on quality assurance mechanisms that match regulatory functions. Newspaper, peerreviewed and post-marketing surveillance reports were used to assess the extent of poor-quality antimicrobials in circulation. There are provisions for quality assurance in the BNDP. Newspaper reports identified the circulation of substandard antimicrobials and reported on actions by the government to seize fraudulent/falsified and expired products. Only six peer-review studies testing antimicrobial product quality were identified; the three studies with the larger sample size (over 10 samples tested) reported results of out-of-specifications products. This assessment found evidence of regulatory actions against poor-quality antimicrobials as well as news reports and studies suggesting quality concerns, but no current rigorous assessment of the extent in Bangladesh. We suggest a multi-pronged approach to regulatory system strengthening comprising three strategies: community-based surveillance, task-shifting, and technologyenabled consumer participation.",

A substandard medicine is one that is out-of-specification, or fails to meet quality checks, while a falsified medicine is one that deliberately misleads as to content, or manufacturer (7). The impacts of poor-quality medicines extend beyond the individual to health systems and economies (8). Poor-quality antimicrobials contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with transnational impacts, reinforcing the need for stringent regulatory controls to ensure product integrity in the supply chain (9,10).",

Firstly, the use of existing community-based structures as a tool to strengthening medicine quality assurance. Interestingly, there are NGOs advocating for stricter actions on SF medicines, signifying public awareness and concern. For example, the Organization of Social and Environment Changes instituted a suit against the government in 2015 at the High Court questioning government's apparent inaction to control the production of counterfeit medicines (50). These organizations may be leveraged to help with inspections of demand points, especially in hard-to-reach rural areas where SF medicines tend to proliferate, using a checklist created by the DGDA. This checklist which would be based on visual analysis by package inspection could include product licensing status and expiry date. Similar checklists have been proposed and studied (51,52). They could also help create community awareness on SF medicines. Interventions utilizing community-based approaches to improving health outcomes have been demonstrated in Bangladesh for reproductive health and TB management, for examples (53, 54) . Thus, this strategy could be a useful tool to explore in the context of pharmacovigilance and regulatory inspections.",

To strengthen output measures among several different research institutions, the WHO Guidelines on the conduct of Medicine Quality Assurance Survey could be adopted for uniformity in methodology and reporting (55). Mandating such independent analyses to be shared with the NMRA could provide synergies to improve the integrity of the supply chain in LMICs. While we found that the Bangladesh NDP mentions the use of third-partly medicine quality assessors, the extent to which this is utilized to complement efforts by the DGDA within Bangladesh is not known. Taskshifting has been widely used to address workforce capacity challenges in the health sector in many different countries, including high-income settings (56). There may be the need to extend pharmacovigilance also to the veterinary sector, using veterinarians and para veterinarians in the first instance to flag any suspected poor-quality veterinary medicines for follow-up action by the DGDA. The establishment of a separate veterinary medicines agency as is the case with Ethiopia may be another approach at capacity building (57) . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

In a dated report from 2011, Bangladesh reported a low SF prevalence of <1%.

While there is evidence that this is already happening, for instance in technical analytical capacity, more is needed.

Mandating all antibiotic manufacturers to include Mobile Authentication Service (MAS) codes on antibiotic packs would complement the Bangladeshi government initiative to enforce the sale of antibiotics only in packages, among others, as a means of promoting appropriate use.

The search term was \"medicine\". Following a preliminary scan to identify local descriptors of poorquality medicines, headlines/titles/captions and \"abstracts\", or \"one-liners\" were then searched for any containing the following keywords: \"fake\", \"adulterated\", \"substandard\", \"closure\", \"illegal\", \"counterfeit\", \"unwholesome\", \"banned\" or \"expired\". Reports meeting these criteria were assessed for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were antimicrobial(s)/ antibiotic/ antihelminth(ic).Editorials and commentary pieces were excluded. Also excluded were reports on non-allopathic medicines including herbal and homeopathic medicines. Data was extracted in the form of the following variables: facility type (manufacturer, hospital or medicine outlet, trader, other) where SF medicines were found; location of facility; category of SF medicine; and whether medicine indicated for use in human or animals. Data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.Reporting on quality testing: BANGLAJOL: The search on Banglajol was conducted using the search terms \"medicine quality\" and \"drug quality\".
