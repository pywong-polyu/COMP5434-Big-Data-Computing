To investigate the association between fungal co-infection and mortality due to COVID-19, we systematically searched Medline, Embase, MedRxiv and Cochrane Library for eligible studies published in the period from 1 January to 1 December 2020. We performed a meta-analysis of nine studies that met the inclusion criteria. In total, data from 2780 patients and 426 patients were included who were admitted to the ICU. In eight of the articles, 211 participants died due to COVID-19 infection, which means an overall mortality rate of 10.9%. The overall pooled proportion of fungal co-infection in COVID-19 patients was 0.12 (95% CI = 0.07-0.16, n = 2780, I 2 = 96.8%). In terms of mortality in COVID-19 patients with fungal infection, the overall pooled proportion of mortality was 0.17 (95% CI = 0.10-0.24, n = 1944, I 2 = 95.6%). These findings provide evidence suggesting a favorable use for empirical antibiotics in the majority of patients when COVID-19 infection is diagnosed. Our analysis is investigating the use of antifungal therapy to treat COVID-19 can serve as a comprehensive reference for COVID-19 treatment.",

However, breakthroughs in the development of specific therapeutic agents are still needed and newly developed vaccines against COVID-19 infection are available only in small quantity. Thus, the most effective way to address the pandemic is the prevention of further infection. This is achieved by using specific strategies such as early diagnosis and subsequent quarantine, and policies preventing gatherings, such as enforced social distancing. From the previous coronavirus outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), we found that fungal co-infection of coronavirus patients could significantly increase mortality rates [4] [5] [6] [7] . The significance of fungal co-infection in COVID-19 patients, however, especially in patients with severe and critical conditions, is still poorly understood.",

However, data remain limited regarding the impact of fungal coinfection and associated clinical outcomes. In many studies looking at the treatment of COVID-19 patients, the empirical use of antibiotics for the majority of patients is known [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, there is evidence that inflammatory serological markers, which are usually associated with bacterial infection, such as raised procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, may appear in patients with COVID-19 who have no bacterial coinfection. Paradoxically, the administration of antibiotics prevents co-infection, which has been associated with a more severe clinical condition in COVID-19 patients [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, there is a clinical demand for a robust investigation into the role of co-infection in patients with COVID-19.",

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by COVID-19, an increased risk of microbial infections has been reported, even in the absence of predisposing immunocompromising conditions.

This correlation was not observed in the rate of Aspergillus subgroup or rate of fungal subgroup. A potential explanation for this is that several physicians may not think that mycology detection is necessary for many terminally ill patients. In addition, mycological detection is also not validated for upper respiratory tract specimens in COVID-19 patients.
