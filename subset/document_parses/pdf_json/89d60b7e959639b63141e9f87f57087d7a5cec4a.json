Although the assessment of AA through teacher qualifications has been questioned by some authors due to the possible influence of teacher subjectivity, it continues to be the most commonly used indicator of AA [3] .

Differentiation is made between the cool and hot EF (or the cognitive and socioemotional EF). Cool EF refers to those processes required in motivationally or affectively neutral contexts, i.e., abstract, decontextualized contexts. The cool EF components include working memory (the ability to temporarily store and manipulate information), inhibition (suppressing prepotent responses, halting ongoing process and avoiding distractor stimuli to select the relevant one) and cognitive flexibility (mentally changing between different tasks or sets), in addition to other more complex ones such as planning (choosing and implementing a sequence of actions to achieve a pre-specified goal) [20, 21] . Hot EF refers to those processes that are required to perform goal-directed tasks in motivational or affectively salient contexts, e.g., meaningful, self-relevant reward or punisher contexts. Some of the hot EF components are, for example, emotional regulation (the capacity to manage one's own emotional responses) or the ability to delay gratification (resisting the temptation of immediate compensation and waiting for a more valued, subsequent compensation) [21, 22] .",

Although the different EF components display distinct developmental trajectories, generally speaking, the EF begin to develop at the end of the first year of life. During childhood and adolescence, they undergo major development, reaching levels of maturity in early adulthood (approximately 20 years of age). From this moment until approximately 50 years of age, they remain relatively stable, showing a decline from this latter age. Therefore, it may be said that the development of the EF during the lifecycle follows an inverted U-shaped curve [20] . All of the changes taking place in the EF are associated with major brain changes. Of these brain changes, those which occur in the prefrontal cortex during adolescence are especially significant, such as synaptic pruning or the cutting of weak connections, a decline in grey matter, and especially, the increase in white matter. All of these mean that adolescence is a developmentally sensitive period for EF [22, 23] .",

This suggests that cool EF may play a significant role in AA. Furthermore, the extent to which students can regulate their emotions (for example, their test anxiety) and attend to academic content may depend, in large part, upon hot EF abilities [25] . Therefore, the classroom and learning environment demand the use of both hot and cool EF, and this means that hot and cool EF may be critical skills for children's learning and AA.",

Therefore, the association between these two variables during this period remains poorly understood [22, 27] . This study attempts to eliminate this information gap, containing an integral view of EF which includes hot and cool components, since most studies investigating EF only measure cool components [22] . In addition, in this study, as previously mentioned, we consider both AA in general as well as in the different individual classes and in the instrumental ones. We are unaware of other studies that consider the relationship between EF and AA in distinct classes, with the exception of Language and Mathematics. We hope that this work will contribute to an increased knowledge of this topic.",

There are two main theories or perspectives that explain how PA can be beneficial to cognitive processes and, therefore, how it may be associated with AA: the neurophysiological perspective and the psychosocial perspective [30, 36] . The main argument of the neurophysiological perspective to explain the relationship between PA and AA is that PA offers direct, positive effects on the brain and nervous system. PA produces increased brain functioning by increasing blood flow, boosting glucose and lipid metabolism, resulting in a higher capacity for concentration and improved cognitive capacities. PA also increases the level of several growth factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [30] . BDNF has been found to improve neural survival, neural maintenance, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and neurotransmitter release. All of these factors are involved in the maintenance and plasticity of the brain's structure and function, making it more efficient and adaptive, leading to improved memory, attention and learning. Increasing BDNF is also associated with an increase in the volume of the hippocampus, a brain area that is highly related to memory [35] . The psychosocial perspective indicates that participation in PA with peers improves social skills such as cooperation and respect for the rules and may have a positive influence on AA [33, 36] . PA is also positively associated with mental health components, such as self-esteem, resilience capacity, tolerance to adversity, positive acceptance of changes and emotional wellbeing. This may also contribute to an increased motivation and may have implications on studies, as well as their better management and on the feelings associated with these studies. All of this may result in an improved AA. Therefore, PA may also indirectly improve cognition and AA [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . The explanations offered by both perspectives are not exclusionary and although they all contribute to an improved knowledge of the relationship between PA and AA, the understanding of these relationships is still in an initial phase, with many issues remaining to be clarified and known [34] .",

Girls tend to show better academic achievement in classes related to language and social areas, while boys do better in mathematics and science. These results are found in studies [46] as well as in international assessments carried out by organizations such as the OECD's PISA [7] . PISA has consistently found that girls outperform boys in reading while, to a lesser extent, boys outperform girls in mathematics, on average across all participating countries and economies. In science, the differences found in favor of boys are inexistent or very small. Gender disparities in achievement are a matter of considerable concern, since they may have long-term consequences for the children's personal and professional future [7] .",

            "text": "Scientific debates regarding gender differences in AA have highlighted several explanations, which are now considered to be not excluding. Early research on gender differences in cognitive abilities and AA focused primarily on biologically based explanations, including the contribution of hormones. Although both the structure and the function of the brain is remarkably similar in females and males, region-specific structural and functional sex differences exist. These differences are associated with changes in sex hormone (mainly testosterone and estrogen) exposure during puberty. The action of sex hormones creates different neural networks and biochemical processes in the brains of men and women, affecting certain cognitive capacities and possibly having effects on AA. In terms of cognition, testosterone facilitates the processing of certain types of spatial information. This may explain the fact that men (having higher levels of testosterone than women), on average, have an advantage in visual memory, visuospatial ability and math. Women are found to excel in language tasks such as fluency, vocabulary, verbal memory, grammar and verbal learning, which are associated with higher levels of estrogen [46, 47] . Over recent decades, the explanations have extended to include sociocultural factors, such as differences between boys' and girls' socialization experiences. Boys and girls may be exposed to distinct experiences (both in the family and school and social contexts) that are rooted in gender stereotypes. That is, based on the cultural norms for masculinity and femininity. Gender stereotypes include expectations for a particular gender, as well as the attribution of abilities in specific domains, leading to teachers having distinct patterns of dynamics and interactions for boys and girls, thereby affecting their AA [48] . Some stereotypes, such as the one suggesting that men are better than women in spatial and mathematical abilities and that professions and subjects in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are \"male\" domains, continue to be believed in many contexts. These stereotypes can reduce female's motivation, interest, learning behaviors, skills and consequently, their AA, in domains that are culturally viewed as \"masculine\". However, boys' performance can benefit from such stereotypes [49] .",

Different results were provided by Gonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez and Portol\u00e9s Ari\u00f1o [50] . Although these authors also found some significant differences in AA for students in the four years of Compulsory Secondary Education, they did not find a stable pattern for such differences. That is, their results, unlike those of Hernando et al. [51] and those from the SMEVT data [45] , did not show that AA decreased as the course year increased. The difference between these results may be due, among other things, to the means by which AA was measured in each study. Gonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez and Portol\u00e9s Ari\u00f1o [50] used academic grades from 6 classes (Math, Spanish language, English, Physical Education, Social Studies and Science) in four consecutive quarters, expressing the AA in each class through the mean grade of the same. Hernando et al. [51] , however, assessed AA through an item in which the student was asked for the grades that they obtained at the end of the previous year, offering them six response options (1 = several fails: 3 or more; 2 = a few fails: 1 or 2; 3 = barely passed or just barely; 4 = passed and some pass with distinction; 5 = distinction and some outstanding grades and 6 = outstanding in almost every class). The figures provided by the SMEVT [45] do not consider the specific grades obtained for the classes, but rather, are based on other parameters such as passing the academic year (regardless of doing so while passing all classes or not, and not considering the specific grades received in each class).",

It consists of a battery of 63 items to be responded to on a Likert-like scale of frequency (never, sometimes, frequently) by the student's teacher or any other adult having prolonged or frequent contact with them in the school setting. BRIEF-2 is made up of nine scales grouped in three major indices: (1) Behavioral Regulation Index: indicates the difficulty a student has to regulate and monitor their behaviors effectively. It is composed by the two following scales: Inhibition: informs about the students' problems to control their impulses (i.e., \"Is fidgety\"), and Self-Monitor: problems self-monitoring their own behavior (i.e., \"Is unaware of how his/her behavior affects or bothers others\"). (2) Emotional Regulation Index: indicates the difficulty degree to regulate the emotional responses, specifically to changing situations. It is composed by the following scales: Shift: presence of problems to make transitions/change the attentional focus if the activity requires to solve issues in a flexible way (i.e., \"Has trouble getting used to new situations (classes, groups, friends, etc.)\"), and Emotional Control: issues to control their emotional responses (i.e., \"Has explosive, angry outbursts\"). (3) Cognitive Regulation Index: refers to the difficulty degree to control and manage their own cognitive processes and solve problems effectively. It is composed by five scales: Initiate: problems to start tasks autonomously or to generate new ideas, responses or strategies in solving problems (i.e., \"Has trouble getting started on homework or tasks\"), Working Memory: indicates difficulties in keeping information in mind during enough time to execute an activity (i.e., \"Forgets what he/she was doing\"), Plan/Organize: evaluate the appearance of problems to anticipate future situations, order and prioritize information, set objectives and sequence the necessary steps to achieve them (i.e., \"Underestimates time needed to finish tasks\"), Task-Monitor: grade of difficulty to check their own work, assess the execution and ensure the achievement of the objective (i.e., \"Makes careless errors\") and Organization of Materials: evaluates the presences of problems to keep the study, work, playing and their own things areas organized (e.g., desk, wardrobe, backpack, bedroom) (i.e., \"Cannot find things in room or school desk\"). These three indices, in turn, are summarized in the Global Executive Function Index, the index used in this study. A high score indicates the presence of cool and hot executive function problems, that is, difficulty regulating one's behavior, emotions and cognitive processes and difficulties in effectively solving problems.

Specifically, it assesses the physical activity performed by the adolescent over the last 7 days, during their free time, in their Physical Education classes and at distinct times (lunch, afternoons and evenings) of the class day, as well as over the weekend. The questionnaire also assesses the proposed level of PA, to better describe the physical activity carried out during the week and the frequency with which the adolescent carries out PA every day of the week. The final score was obtained by calculating the arithmetic mean of the scores obtained on these 8 questions. Question 9 offered information as to whether the adolescent was sick or if there was any circumstance preventing them from carrying out PA that week. The final result has a value from 1 to 5 which permits the establishment of a PA scale. The PAQ-A is found to have adequate reliability and reasonable validity to assess PA in Spanish adolescents [54] . Past studies have indicated that the result provided by this questionnaire is similar to that obtained via a more complete study of PA using techniques such as accelerometry [55] . As such, this makes it one of the most widely used questionnaires to assess PA in adolescents and one that has been validated in multiple languages. In our study, the internal consistency value (Cronbach's Alpha) was 0.775 and was considered to be an adequate value. This value is similar to the one obtained by Martinez-G\u00f3mez et al. [54] in the instrument validation for Spanish adolescents.",

In all cases, the EF has been shown to be the variable that has the greatest influence on the student's AA, so much so that difficulties in EF lead to a decrease in AA. The level of PA also influences the student's AA (in this case, positively), except in the case of English AA, where it does not reveal any type of relationship. Therefore, engaging in PA leads to benefits in AA, except in the English class, where it does not affect it, either positively or negatively. However, in all of the tested models, PA contributed to AA to a lesser degree than EF. Being female is another variable that is associated positively with AA in all of the models, except in that of Physical Education AA. This suggests that female participants, maintaining the other variables as constant, obtained a higher AA than their male counterparts, for all of the classes, except for Physical Education (where gender did not appear to have an effect, given that there were no gender-based differences). The female participants also obtained higher mean grades than males in the instrumental classes (Instrumental AA) and in the mean of all classes (Overall AA). Being female, therefore, was found to be more important to AA than level of PA but is less relevant than EF. As previously mentioned, academic year was not found to have any type of significant association with any measurement of AA.

AA is a multi-dimensional phenomenon and therefore it is impossible to consider all of the relevant and diverse variables participating. Therefore, explaining a large amount of its variation is a major challenge demanding considerable effort from a multidisciplinary research field [71] . In our study, we are aware of the variation of AA that remains unexplained in the models tested. Therefore, we believe that future studies should include new variables to further explain the student's AA (either student variables or family and educational variables). The three variables that were included in the models here were found to be significantly correlated with AA. Therefore, major educational conclusions and implications may be derived from our results.

Therefore, our work offers a major contribution in this sense. Our results indicate that deficits in EF (an aspect assessed using the BRIEF-2, in which high scores imply difficulties in the EF) are associated negatively with AA. As such, students with EF deficits obtained a lower AA than those students with a high level of EF, and this occurred in each of the individual classes, when considering the mean of the instrumental classes, or when considering the Overall AA. These results are in line with past empirical studies that show that the presence of EF deficits contributes to academic difficulties that may hinder AA success [74, 75] .",

All of these issues require the use of EF, and they are all necessary in the school context, regardless of the class and specific content being studied.

As we indicate below, this is one of the limitations of our study and is an issue that may be examined in future works.

Therefore, increasing the students' EF should be a goal throughout the educational context, even more so given that EF's importance is not limited to its effect on AA but goes beyond this. A deficient level of EF during adolescence may lead to inadequate AA and to difficulties in facing and managing the physical, psychological and social changes occurring during this life stage [20, 23, 76] . Therefore, the importance of EF goes beyond the academic context to also affect the quality of life of the student and his/her ability to contribute to the progress of society. Since we know that during adolescence, EF are particularly sensitive to contextual influences and because interventions are more effective the earlier they are carried out, this life stage should be considered to ensure its improvement. Therefore, numerous activities and interventions are found to be effective in improving EF [79] . But there is still a lack of information as to which specific features of the training regimen have the greatest effects and on what type of participants, especially in the adolescent population, given that most of the studies in this area have focused on preschoolers.

Furthermore, the results of these limited studies are quite disparate. Therefore, our results corroborate the findings of authors such as Katz et al. [41] and \u00c1lvarez-Bueno et al. [42] since associations were found between PA and AA in the language and mathematics fields, as well as for the composite AA grades. However, there are discrepancies with other works that only found associations between PA and some of the academic areas or, either language or math, but not both [35, 39, 80] . Other studies did not reveal any associations between these two areas [40, 81] . Discrepancies between these studies may be due to distinct methodologies used (such as, for example, using academic notes or standardized tests to assess AA, as well as the assessment of distinct issues referring to PA: frequency, intensity, etc., with distinct measurement instruments), in addition to differences between the analyzed samples. Additional research is necessary to clarify this disparity of results.",

These results suggest the importance of promoting PA amongst adolescents, given its benefits to AA. This is especially relevant if we consider that, despite the wellknown benefits of PA, globally speaking, approximately 81% of all adolescents (between 11 and 17 years of age) do not reach the recommended levels: at least 60 min daily of moderateto-vigorous intensity PA [28, 82] . In Spain, the prevalence of adolescents that do not reach this recommendation is 76.6% [82] . Thus, less than one quarter of all Spanish adolescents comply with these recommendations. This situation is increasingly alarming given that the percentage of adolescents complying with the PA guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) is gradually decreasing, both internationally and nationally [82] . We are therefore far from reaching the target of a 15% relative reduction in insufficient physical activity among adolescents by 2030, established by the WHO member states [28] . Promoting and increasing PA in adolescents is urgent and necessary. It is known that during this life phase, the brain continues to be forming (as well as the adolescent) and is more sensitive to being influenced by the environment, therefore, increasing PA during adolescence would produce more benefits than in subsequent life stages [37] . In addition, adolescence is a key period of life in which individuals develop and consolidate habits that tend to persist over time. As such, if it is promoted during this phase, it is likely that the PA will be carried out throughout the individual's life, with its inherent benefits [83] .",

Physical Education classes should be highlighted as an important means of fostering PA habits in young people and increasing their AA. Thus, educational policies which, at specific times, have attempted to impose and decrease the number of hours dedicated to Physical Education, in favor of more hours devoted to instrumental classes, were not supported by scientific evidence. Many studies have indicated that spending more time in Physical Education classes, even when this means spending relatively less time on other school subjects, does not jeopardize AA, but possibly even improves it [35] . Spain is one of the countries in which fewer hours of the school curriculum are devoted to Physical Education. In 2013, the Eurydice [85] study warned that in Spain, the Physical Education class made up only 3% or 4% of the Compulsory Secondary Education curriculum, far from the 8% that is recommended by the American Heart Association and even farther from the almost 20% of Finland (a country having top results in the PISA).

            "text": "According to the literature, biological and socio-cultural factors should be considered in order to understand the mechanisms by which gender may affect the student's AA. Both types of factors, biological and socio-cultural, act on the interaction and cannot be separated [40] . Positive association between being female and AA, as found in our study, may not be explained by the different levels of testosterone between genders (since, according to many studies [46, 47] , the higher level of testosterone in males favors their visual-spatial abilities, leading to an expected association between being male and Mathematics AA, a result that was not found). However, other studies indicate other effects of testosterone that may explain the results of this study. Higher testosterone levels are associated with decreased capacity for learning [89] . This finding may contribute to explaining our results in which males have a lower AA in all of the classes except for Physical Education, in which gender had no effect on AA. In this same direction, other studies have indicated that females (having lower testosterone levels) have a higher self-regulation level, helping them to adapt more to the learning tasks and school demands. These studies have also found increased ability to concentrate, more hours dedicated to studying, increased compliance with rules, etc. Ultimately, females have more adaptive behavior facilitating learning and fewer disruptive behaviors, clearly helping to give them a higher AA. It appears, therefore, that certain neuroendocrine differences between the genders may lead to distinct behavioral patterns at school, which may be the basis of certain theories that have suggested the faster and easier ability of females to align with expectations and norms of the society, in general and especially in school [90] . Thus, there are links between the endocrine system, the brain and behavior that are relevant to understanding adolescent AA. However, these links are not completely understood [90] , given that these links may also be affected by socio-cultural factors. Along these lines, the literature highlights the importance of socialization processes and, especially, the possible gender stereotypes existing in the context in which the adolescents develop, when explaining gender differences in AA. So, we consider that in order to explain our results, especially the positive association found between being female and Mathematics AA (a result that differs from many findings of past studies and international educational assessments), it is important to consider the educational policies implemented in Spain that go against these traditional gender stereotypes.",

The results are not coherent with certain studies that suggest that the youngest high school students obtain the highest mean scores on AA, while the older students had the lowest mean [52] . The differences between our results and those from this series of works may be caused by the orientation and mentoring actions carried out in the participants' school. It was indicated that the school-based factors (such as implementation of orientation and mentoring programs) make up another series of variables (not considered in this study) which contribute to the students' AA. The mission of the school itself focuses on providing students with an enriched and supportive academic environment. Thus, the school attended by the participants notified us that since the year prior to this study, it has been participating in an ambitious guidance and mentoring program that involves not only students but also their families and the entire school teaching staff. It is possible, therefore, that the AA of these students would be different if the students had not received this program. It may be necessary to determine what happened with other students coming from other schools in which said program was not carried out, or not carried out as intensely as in this case.",

Although they are well-proven assessment methods in different domains of social, emotional and behavioral functioning [92, 93] , some limitations are found. To overcome the limitations of this type of measures, it would be interesting to complement the study using distinct data collection methods. This would determine additional information for each assessed variable. In this study, the School version of the BRIEF-2 was used to assess the participants' EF. It is an informant reported questionnaire designed to index children's everyday EF skills. Its good-excellent psychometric characteristics have been reported by many studies [52, 92] , turning into the most used informant reported questionnaire to evaluate executive functions in adolescents [92, 94] . However, it should not be forgotten that this is a rating scale, and although many defend the use of this type of instruments, many others warn of their limitations (social desirability and the assessment of behaviors that are not the subject of the study but the informant's perception of the same) [95] . For this reason, it may be interesting to complement their use with other measures that are traditionally considered to be more objective, such as performance-based tests. These measures also have their limitations, however, such as a limited functional and ecological validity [96] , since performance-based assessment of EF often occurs in a one-on-one setting with fewer distractions than the typical environment. In addition, existing evidence on psychometric robustness of such performance-based measures remains limited. For this reason, we consider that an excellent alternative would be the observations of every-day, real-world, executive functioning behaviors. The use of observational coding systems does not require reporting from important adults in the students' life. Although this implies certain costs, especially time-related ones, the quality and depth of the information collected as well as its functional and ecological validity is undeniable [97] . On the other hand, to assess the level of PA, a self-reporting method was used. Although the instrument used (PAQ-A) has adequate psychometric properties and its use has been contrasted with other instruments such as accelerometers, the inherent limitations of self-reporting are well-known, raising the question of social desirability bias as well as the difficulty of some participants in informing about their own behaviors, cognitions and feelings [95] . Therefore, we should not discard the presence of these biases in the participants' responses, especially the social desirability bias, since it is possible that our participants exaggerated their level of PA. In the future, to contrast this, it may be interesting to complement this information collection measure with other measures, such as accelerometry. But these instruments have their own limitations, such as the impossibility of their use in aquatic activities and their limited effectiveness in assessing static physical activity, and we cannot forget that when using accelerometers, participants are aware that they are being assessed and measured and therefore may alter their normal level of PA [98] . Of course, we should consider the economic costs of the same (even higher when taking into account that the goal is to assess the PA of the entire sample during the same week to ensure that PA patterns are not affected by other factors, such as different weather conditions).",

In Spain, school grades that are issued by teachers are very important in daily educational practice. Decisions regarding the student's school path tend to be based on these grades.

(2) It considers an extensive perspective of adolescent EF that includes its hot and cool components (and not only the latter, as typical of most studies), and (3) it considers an extensive perspective of AA, by specifically considering it in all of the subjects that are common to the 4 school years of Compulsory Secondary Education, in addition to examining AA based on the instrumental classes and overall AA. This required studying more than just Language and Mathematics, which have been the focus of most past research. In future studies, it would be interesting to delve further into the specific relationships between all of these variables. For example, to analyze the contribution of the distinct subcomponents of the cool and hot EF in each of the classes. Although it appears that not all subcomponents of EF are of equal importance in learning and AA in the distinct academic areas, researchers have yet to offer conclusive results, at least for adolescent samples [43] . More studies are necessary on this aspect. The same could be analyzed in terms of PA. In this work, we have considered the level of PA carried out by students, but it would be interesting to examine whether or not different aspects related to PA (force-resistance and explosive, agility, speed, aerobic endurance, flexibility, etc.) contribute differently to AA in each class and the skills required by the same. Past research appears to indicate this, but further studies are necessary [43] .",
