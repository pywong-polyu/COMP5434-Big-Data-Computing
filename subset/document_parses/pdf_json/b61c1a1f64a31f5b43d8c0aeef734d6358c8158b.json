Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) dramatically enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2, and thus increased SARS-CoV2 infectivity. Surprisingly, mutational analysis revealed that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the surface of the NTD. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected in all samples of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the study. However, the ratio of infectivity-enhancing antibodies to neutralizing antibodies differed among patients. Furthermore, the antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site were detected in 3 out of 48 uninfected donors, albeit at low levels. These findings suggest that the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity-enhancing site could be considered as a possible exacerbating factors for COVID-19 and that a spike protein lacking such antibody epitopes may be required for safe vaccine development, especially for individuals with pre-existing enhancing antibodies.",

Surprisingly, all the enhancing antibodies competed for the spike protein with differing efficiencies, suggesting that they recognized similar epitopes on the NTD (Fig. 3a) . Next, we generated a series of alanine mutants of NTD with the transmembrane domain ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ) and analyzed their binding to the enhancing antibodies. Because the 8D2 mAb contained negatively charged amino acids in the heavy chain CDR3, we analyzed the binding of the 8D2 mAb to lysine-or arginine-mutated NTD. The R214A and K187A mutants were not recognized by the 8D2 antibody (Fig. 3b) . We then analyzed a series of NTD mutants in which the amino acid residues structurally close to R214 or K187 were mutated to alanine and found that the binding of the enhancing antibodies to the whole spike protein was substantially decreased in W64A, H66A, K187A, V213A, and R214A mutants (Fig. 3b) . Similar observations were made with the full-length spike protein with mutations in these residues (Fig. 3c) . Moreover, the W64A-H66A and V213A-R214A double mutants reduced the binding of the enhancing antibodies more than the single mutants did. Furthermore, the quadruple mutant of W64, H66, V213, and R214 was not recognized by any enhancing antibody. Significantly, these mutations did not affect the NTD's recognition by a non-enhancing anti-NTD antibody, 4A8, an anti-RBD antibody, C114, or an anti-S2 antibody, 2454. These data suggested that mutations of these residues in the NTD did not affect the overall conformation of the spike protein ( Supplementary Fig. 4) .",

Therefore, we investigated whether the uninfected individuals carried the enhancing antibodies. Because the competitive binding assay used to analyze COVID-19 patients was not sensitive enough to detect low levels of the enhancing antibodies in uninfected individuals, we measured the levels of the enhancing antibodies by comparing a serum antibody binding to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 NTD and to mutant SARS-CoV-2 NTD (W64A, H66A, K187A, V213A, and R214A) that was not bound by enhancing antibodies (Fig. 4d) . Some donors, such as #13, possessed antibodies bound to both the wild-type and mutant NTD, suggesting that they lacked the enhancing antibodies (Fig. 4e ). By contrast, other donors, such as #18, produced antibodies specific to wild-type NTD, suggesting that they had the enhancing antibodies. Some donors also possessed low levels of anti-RBD antibodies, but there was no correlation between the titers of the anti-RBD antibody and the enhancing antibody (Fig. 4f) .

However, Fc receptor-mediated ADE is restricted to the infection of Fc receptor-expressing cells. In this study, we found a non-canonical, Fc receptorindependent ADE mechanism. The antibodies against a specific site on the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were found to directly augment the binding of ACE2 to the spike protein, consequently increasing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

Although anti-spike antibodies are often detected in uninfected individuals, most of them are directed against the S2 subunit 23 . The sequence homology of the NTD to common human coronaviruses is low compared to the S2 subunit. In particular, the antibody epitopes on the enhancing site are not conserved among other coronaviruses. Although it is unclear how the enhancing antibodies were produced in some uninfected individuals, the production of the enhancing antibodies may be boosted by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Therefore, spike proteins that lack the antibody epitopes at the enhancing site might have to be considered to vaccinate individuals with pre-existing enhancing antibodies. Transfusion of plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients has been proposed as a possible treatment for COVID-19 34 . Because the ratio of neutralizing antibodies to enhancing antibodies in serum differs among COVID-19 patients, the plasma level of the enhancing antibodies in the donor may affect the treatment's effectiveness.
