We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine performance of ROX index as a predictor of HFNC failure. Materials and methods: Systematic search was performed in electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Cochrane Library) for articles published till 15 June 2021 investigating ROX index as a predictor for HFNC failure. Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool was used to analyze risk of bias for prognostic factors, by two independent authors. Results: Eight retrospective or prospective cohort studies involving 1301 patients showed a good discriminatory value, summary area under the curve (sAUC) 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.84) with sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59-0.80) and specificity of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.88) for predicting HNFC failure. The positive and negative likelihood ratio were 3.0 (95% CI, 2.2-5.3) and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.28-0.50) respectively, and was strongly associated with a promising predictive accuracy (Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 9, 95% CI, 5-16). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests ROX index has good discriminating power for prediction of HFNC failure in COVID-19 patients with AHRF.",

HFNC failure was described as patients who needed non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for the context of this research. The following data were collected for each eligible study: authors, publication year, country, study design, study group, proportion of HFNC failure, sensitivity, specificity, true positive, true negative and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve alongwith demographic and baseline characteristics such as sample size, a cut-off value of ROX, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, lymphocyte count, CRP, D-dimer, length of HFNC, SOFA score, HFNC delivery device, humidifier, flow rate and FiO2.",

In the clinical practice of treating AHRF in patients with COVID-19, studies have observed that the ROX index has a good predictive value in HFNC failure. Studies have reported various thresholds to ROX for predicting HFNC outcomes. Clinicians are therefore unclear regarding the optimal thresholds of ROX that should be applied to know the HFNC outcomes. Previous data from AHRF patients treated with HFNC revealed that the set flow rate has a significant impact on oxygenation and RR; it was then investigated whether increasing the set flow rate would affect the ROX index.",

It was demonstrated that the ROX index is a convenient tool that can distinguish patients with COVID-19 infection who need hospitalization (ROX index less than 25.7) from those who can be safely discharged at the time of admission. Also, in COVID-19 patients with AHRF, the ROX index has high sensitivity, confirming that a lower ROX index predicts higher mortality risk [20] . Our meta-analysis showed that ROX index might discriminate with a value of sAUC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.84) with sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59-0.80) and specificity of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.88) for predicting HFNC failure in COVID-19 patients. The heterogeneity (I 2 or inconsistency) was significant (86% for sensitivity and 85%, for specificity). We explored the source of factors that may influence variation in the studies using meta-regression analysis, although the potential clinical conditions e.g. proportion of hypertension, the proportion of diabetes, mean age, D-dimer level, the proportion of male subjects, presence of cardiac disease, CRP level, and lymphocyte count did not influence the pooled prognostic value of ROX-index for prediction of worse outcome except lymphocyte count for specificity which was significant. The absence of publication bias further confirms the validity of the findings observed in the current meta-analysis.",
