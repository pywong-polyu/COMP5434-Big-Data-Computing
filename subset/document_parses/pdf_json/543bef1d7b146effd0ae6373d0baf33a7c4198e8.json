This project was conducted at a mid-sized university in the Southwest region of the United States where current and recent field students responded to surveys and social work field instructors and faculty participated in interviews. The study describes financial burdens and reveals human rights issues affecting nontraditional and underserved students that have answered the call to a career of serving the most vulnerable in society. This study fills a gap in the literature and provides recommendations for further research and anti-oppressive approaches for the academy to employ in the education of future social work professionals.",

Social workers specializing in healthcare, mental health, substance abuse, child, family, and school settings will be in demand in the next decade (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020). Traditionally, social workers serve disadvantaged and vulnerable populations in society, confronting significant social challenges, for which they receive modest salaries (Barth 2003) . Social workers require special qualities as well as good organization, communication, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills. As the demand for social services increases, more trained and skilled social workers are required to meet social needs (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020). In addition, appropriately addressing the social needs of multiethnic and multicultural communities requires educating future social workers who represent the diversity of those communities (Bouye et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "Social work education has made strides in preparing students to work with special populations by completing a required field practicum component in community agencies (Hemy et al. 2016) . Through these field placements, students gain hands-on knowledge and experience with marginalized populations and the systems that affect them as part of the preparation to become licensed social workers. While the students benefit from the experiential learning gained in the field, this learning comes at a high cost. Significant time and energy commitments along with the \"juggling [of] multiple roles and responsibilities with field placement\" are just a few of the costs and challenges experienced by students (Hemy et al. 2016, p. 215) . Costs that have received less attention in the literature are the financial hardships connected to the completion of a field practicum. Financial costs include parking fees, professional attire, childcare, car maintenance, and lost wages due to decreased employment to accommodate the field experience. In addition, fieldwork is typically unpaid, perpetuating the oppression that nontraditional and underserved students often experience. A student who meets one or more of certain characteristics (e.g., delayed enrollment into college, part-time college student, works full time, does not hold a traditional high school diploma, single parent) is often described as \"nontraditional\" (National Center for Education Statistics n.d.), and underserved students are typically women, first-generation, low-income, and/or students of color (Taylor and Jain 2017) . The aforementioned issues have an amplified effect on a student's ability to complete their required field practicum hours while adding to the costs of attending college in general.",

Financial costs related to field practicum coupled with standard educational expenditures place a high financial burden on social work students, who themselves may be of low income. Subsequently, after graduation, many social workers face paying off debts with their salaries that are often meager. This seems to be unfair when we consider a person's right to an education, which should mean that it is accessible, unencumbered by financial barriers. In fact, according to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights' Article 13(c) (1976) , \"Higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education.\" Based on this article of the multilateral treaty to which the USA has been a signatory since 1977, the costs previously described represent a violation of the rights of many students choosing to pursue a social work degree.",

There are several tenets that are central to this philosophy. One tenet is the existence of an authoritative norm such as a contract, moral standard, or constitutional specification that grants the right to individual A. A second tenet is the idea that one must be able to identify whom the individual is that holds a particular right. A third tenet is that it is critical to understand what the specific responsibilities are for person B and what is required to meet those responsibilities (Kramer 2010) . While an examination of this philosophical theory helps one understand how to determine who has rights, what constitutes a violation of those rights, and who is responsible for upholding the rights, a practice theory, namely systems theory, provides an understanding of how one might actually carry out the process of supporting others' rights within a complex system.",

Goins (2018) states that the education system (in particular) has to change and adjust to accommodate student needs. To accomplish this, the systems theory intervention of systemic approaches, as described by Walker (2012) , can be employed to foster change on an ongoing basis. Systemic approaches call for all members of the system to identify practices and principles that support dysfunction for the purpose of working to promote change. Thus, the philosophical perspective of ITR coupled with an understanding of systems and systemic interventions can serve in a complementary fashion to identify and protect human rights. In concert with these theoretical underpinnings, a review of the literature revealed the social work profession's declared responsibility to teach, uphold, and advocate for human rights in education. It also revealed systemic issues associated with required field practica among several professional disciplines.",

            "text": "According to the preamble of the National Association of Social Workers' (2017) Code of Ethics, the main mission of the profession is to \"enhance human well-being and help meet the basic human needs of all people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty\" (para. 1). It also mentions that social workers push for the elimination of social injustices like oppression, discrimination, and poverty. While the Code does not explicitly state that human rights are a central focus, it is inferred throughout the document. In keeping with this same professional focus, over the years, there have been calls for social work curricula to elevate the profession's tradition of social justice by building on it with an emphasis on human rights (Steen et al. 2017; Reisch 2011; Wronka 2007) . In the 2008 and 2015 Education Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), the topic of human rights was included, creating a requirement for social work programs to include human rights content in their competency-based curricula. On a global level, the International Federation of Social Workers (2020) includes human rights as a key tenet in its global definition of the profession and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (United Nations 1948) has been embraced by many professional social work organizations (McPherson and Cheatham 2015) . In 2013, the Katherine A. Kendall Institute of the CSWE published a book focused on teaching human rights in social work education and others have authored books heavily focused on helping with the inclusion of human rights content in the classroom (McPherson & Cheatham) . In addition, there are online training manuals for human rights offered by the United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner (2000), the Austrian Development Agency (2010), the Advocates for Human Rights (2017), and the European Training and Research Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (Benedek 2012) . These open-access training manuals and books put valuable information in the hands of social work educators, promoting student exposure to a human rights perspective and to human rights actions and strategies. While there is an unsettled debate on whether social work education in academic settings is a form of social work practice, there is consensus on social work faculty modeling social work values and adhering to the profession's ethics (Teater and Lopez-Humphreys 2019) . Thus, faculty can exhibit their commitment to values and ethics of the profession by advocating for the academy at large to demonstrate a commitment to human rights by tackling issues in education at the structural level (Rozas and Garran 2016) . This can be done by addressing inequities in the design and subsequent hardships experienced by students engaged in field practica.",

An example of this would be the conflict that nontraditional and underserved students often experience when deciding how to accomplish a required academic field practicum while maintaining paid employment. It is no secret that college students frequently need to work while in school to cover personal and family expenses (Hemy et al. 2016; Gair and Baglow 2018a; Johnstone et al. 2016; King and Bannon 2002; Raskin et al. 2008; Wray and McCall 2007) which can negatively affect their academic performance including performance in a field experience (Johnstone et al. 2016 ). According to Hemy et al. (2016) , social work students often have difficulties trying to balance multiple responsibilities (e.g., school assignments, family obligations, paid employment) while engaged in a field practicum experience, and Baglow and Gair (2019) discuss the challenges of social work students who are experiencing poverty and are of a mature age. Johnstone et al. (2016) state that social work and human services students experience considerable stress financially because of unpaid field practica, and Gair and Baglow (2018b) discuss that required social work field practica leads to financial strain. In addition, Wray and McCall (2007) found that financial hardships were made worse by the lack of financially subsidized field placements of health professional students. These examples demonstrate that the field practicum requirement results in hardships for many, especially students that can be described as nontraditional or underserved.

More than any other, food/lunch was identified as a cost with 28 (75.68%) participants selecting it. The second most selected item was fuel/tolls with 27 (72.97%) participants identifying it as an increased cost. Clothing/shoes was the third most selected cost with 25 (67.57%) respondents identifying it as an increased expense. Approximately half of the survey participants (n = 19; 51.35%) marked vehicle maintenance, eight (21.62%) marked dry cleaning/laundry, four (11.76%) marked childcare, and two (5.41%) marked mental health counseling. Three (8.11%) respondents indicated that they had not experienced any increased costs as a result of the field practicum experience. When given the opportunity to identify any costs not provided as choices on the survey, health-related costs was listed by one (2.7%) participant.

Nearly onethird (n = 11; 29.73%) marked loss of health insurance, and just over a tenth (n = 4; 10.81%) indicated a loss of employment in order to participate in the field experience. Eight (21.62%) participants marked none of these occurred, indicating that they did not have any of the losses listed as choices on the survey. When given the opportunity to identify any losses not provided as choices on the survey, loss of paid time off (PTO) was listed by two (5.41%) respondents, loss of death insurance was listed by two (5.41%) respondents, loss of food was listed by one (2.7%) respondent, and loss of a leadership position was listed by one (2.7%) respondent. Lastly, Table 1 shows that two (5.41) respondents stated that they received a financial stipend while 35 (94.59%) indicated that they did not. One of the respondents that received a stipend listed gas, clothing, and groceries as items paid for with the money, and the other respondent listed bills. There were numerous items listed, by the remaining 35 participants, to indicate how they would have used a stipend. In the order of frequency, the list included car expenses (including tolls and fuel), household expenses (including rent and utilities), food, childcare, replacement of lost wages, future graduate school expenses, clothing, medical insurance/healthcare, work uniform, self-care activities, school supplies, and tuition as shown in Table 2 .",

These rights include education, safety, healthcare, and an adequate standard of living. The results of this study highlight areas of concern within the field practicum requirement that demonstrate failure to promote basic human rights according to our own standards within social work education. This study found inherent inequities in the design of the field experience component of the social work curriculum, especially in its financial effect on nontraditional and underserved students. There is a lack of consideration for students managing jobs and supporting households and families while in school. In effect, the CSWE and its Commission on Accreditation (COA) have not kept pace with the changing demographics of the US college student. For many years, there has been a steady increase in the number of students classified as nontraditional or underserved. Yet, the COA has maintained a policy since 1982 that is based on an arbitrary number of field hours that BSW students are required to complete and there is no evidence that 400 field practicum hours is a gold standard for desired educational outcomes (Raskin et al. 2008) .",

Some lose health insurance or exhaust paid time off, all while specific field-related expenses (e.g., car maintenance, fuel, tolls, childcare, counseling) are being added to their budgets. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA magnified the inequities caused by the field practicum requirement, prompting requests from accredited social work programs for a reduction in field hours for students. The initial response from the COA on 19 March was an emphatic no, stating, \"field hours cannot be waived\" (CSWE 2020a). A second announcement on 20 March stated, \"no changes will be made at this time regarding the minimum number of required field hours\" (CSWE 2020a). In keeping with the professional value of advocacy, field instructors across the country made requests while students signed a petition imploring the COA to make a concession in the face of a worldwide public health crisis. Eventually, a temporary policy was created to address this need and field hours were reduced to 85% of the standard requirement for students that would complete their field practice experiences by December of 2020 (CSWE 2020b). Also to their credit, the COA ultimately allowed field seminar class hours to be counted as field practicum hours under the temporary COVID-19 provisions.",

According to international social work scholar Katherine Kendall, in the late 1800s, it was common for fieldwork to take place 2 days or 3 days weekly, and this was doable for the mostly female social work students who could financially afford to dedicate this amount of time without needing monetary support (as cited in Raskin et al. 2008 ). Today's circumstances are different, and college experiences need to uplift students while preparing them for future endeavors, not create hardships, especially financial hardships that gnaw away at one's ability to afford and maintain basic needs. The current design of the field practicum requirement often puts students at risk, many of whom are already marginalized in some way. These human rights issues place students in a position where they have to choose between completing a BSW degree and safeguarding their personal welfare and the welfare of their families. In addition, the negative financial effects of the field practicum requirement demonstrate a violation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which decrees accessibility of higher education as a right to be maintained and progressively moved toward becoming cost-free. Based on the premise of Bentham's interest theory of rights, the Council on Accreditation and the social work academy at large are responsible for ensuring that this right is upheld for all social work students, something the academy has failed to do.",

In the end, these changes need to occur because (1) students deserve an educational experience free from injustice, bias, and oppression; (2) maintaining the status quo in social work field education not only hinders a student's human right to an adequate standard of living (as described in the 2015 EPAS), it is categorically unjust, discriminatory, and oppressive; and (3) it is unacceptable to knowingly continue to stand in violation of the ICESCR for which the USA is a signatory.",

We recommend that programs work closely with financial aid offices to ensure that eligible students access work-study funds for the hours they engage in fieldwork. In addition, programs should foster supportive environments, which can be accomplished by engaging in poverty-informed educational practices.
