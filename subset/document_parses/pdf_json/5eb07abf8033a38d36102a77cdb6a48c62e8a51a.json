B cell epitopes are the parts of antigen proteins recognized by antibodies. A deeper understanding of the features of B cell epitopes will propel the development of serological tests, vaccines, and therapies for various human diseases. Therefore, critical innovation is necessary to develop bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately predict B cell epitopes. B cell epitopes are either linear or conformational, meaning that the epitopes that induce antibodies could either be a linear stretch of amino acid residues of the antigen proteins, or could be formed by noncontiguous parts of the antigens that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (Benjamin et al., 1984; Berzofsky et al., 1982) . The prediction of linear B cell epitopes has been the major focus of research. Popular linear epitope prediction algorithms include BepiPred 1.0 and 2.0 (Jespersen et al., 2017; Petersen et al., 2009) , SVMTriP (Yao et al., 2012) , LBEEP (Saravanan and Gautham, 2015) , LBtope (Singh et al., 2013) , etc. Popular conformational epitope prediction algorithms include Discotope1.1 (Haste Andersen et al., 2006) , ElliPro (Ponomarenko et al., 2008) , SEPPA 3.0 (Zhou et al., 2019) , etc. Although discrepancies exist among different evaluation studies, the consensus appears to indicate that these methods perform only slightly better than a random classifier, and significantly fall behind HLA binding prediction software in quality (Galanis et al., 2019; Sanchez-Trincado et al., 2017) . Specifically, the performance of B cell epitope prediction software achieved Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) between 0.5 and 0.6, whereas HLA binding prediction software can now achieve AUC of >0.9. Usually, an AUC of 0.6-0.7 is considered acceptable and an AUC>0.7 is considered good (Mandrekar, 2010; Trifonova et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "The recent SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more apparent the importance of studying B cell epitopes that can induce antibody responses. Robust antibody response can neutralize viral infectivity in a number of ways, such as interfering with viral binding to cellular receptors or blocking viral uptake into cells. Characterization of how the genetic variants that recently emerged in SARS- CoV-2 (van Dorp et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Plante et al., 2021; Toyoshima et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) impact its B cell epitopes will reveal the selective pressures the human humoral immune system places on this virus, which could be critical for understanding the long-term effectiveness of the recently deployed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Importantly, Greaney et al., 2021) found that mutations at the Spike E484 position lead to >10-fold reduction in antibody neutralization, demonstrating the importance of monitoring emerging viral variants. However, given the large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that have been sequenced and shared publicly, it is impractical to test each viral epitope in every strain experimentally. A systematic and accurate bioinformatics profiling of all these SARS-CoV-2 strains in silico can help elucidate the It has been observed that the activation of follicular B cells and the selection of high affinity B cell receptors are aided by CD4 + T helper cells in an epitope-dependent manner, a phenomenon known as T-B reciprocity (Berzofsky, 1983; Ozaki and Berzofsky, 1987; Sabhnani et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2014) . As a result, the B cell epitopes with nearby CD4 + T cell epitopes are more likely to be truly immunogenic and to induce mature B cell receptors (BCRs) and antibodies. For example, Brumeanu et al. observed that T or B viral synthetic epitopes from HA of the PR8 influenza virus were immunogenic not by themselves, but only when assembled as a contiguous dipeptide (Brumeanu et al., 1997) . Mechanistically, Moss et al. proposed a direct ''hand over'' of antigen fragments from the BCRs to MHC II proteins (Moss et al., 2007) . Alternatively, in the germinal centers, the protection from proteolysis of antigen epitopes by the bound antibody may lead to preferential MHC II-mediated presentation of the protected adjacent helper epitopes by the same B cells (Berzofsky, 1983; Ozaki and Berzofsky, 1987; Sabhnani et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2014) . Either case results in a selective loading (likely spatially constrained) of MHC II epitopes from BCR-internalized antigens ( Figure 1A ), which has been observed by Barroso et al. (Barroso et al., 2015) . However, the detailed mechanisms of T-B reciprocity need to be further elucidated.",

The proposed BepiTBR model has incorporated three different base B cell epitope prediction models (Bepi.) and two different HLA class II epitope (T cell epitope) prediction models (Tepi.) . To evaluate the model performance, we tested all possible combinations of base B cell epitope prediction models and HLA class II epitope prediction models, together with different parameters in the model: HLA class II epitope rank cutoff (cutoff), overall penalty strength (lambda), and balance between L1 and L2 penalty (alpha). The internal validation set was used to select the best parameter combination for each base model. The final models were further validated in other independent data, examined for model interpretation, and applied to COVID-19 research. iScience Article potentially recognized by CD4 + T-cells) significantly enhanced the prediction of B cell epitopes. We developed and validated a machine learning model, named BepiTBR, that incorporated this mechanism in the model specification.

The core rationale of our model is that the enrichment of CD4 + T epitopes/ HLA class II epitopes in the neighborhood of candidate B cell epitopes could contain useful information to aid in the judgment of whether the potential B cell epitopes are truly immunogenic. We considered previous B cell epitope prediction models, BepiPred 1.0 and 2.0 (Jespersen et al., 2017) and LBEEP (Saravanan and Gautham, 2015) , as our base prediction models for model improvements and comparisons. They were chosen because of the availability of standalone software packages. For prediction of HLA class II epitopes, we considered the classical netMHCIIpan software (Jensen et al., 2018) and the newly developed MixMHC2pred (Racle et al., 2019) . All HLA class II alleles that are available from the HLA class II epitope prediction algorithms were considered.",

Details of training and validation/test data creation are described in the STAR methodsection. For each IEDB record, the epitope sequence and the full antigen protein sequence were extracted. Full antigen protein sequences were obtained from NCBI'|'s Entrez protein database using the Entrez Programming Utilities. The HLA class II epitopes were predicted by either of the two software applications, for all available DRB alleles, all DP alleles, and all DQ alleles. Specifically, the DRB, DP, and DQ binders were predicted in a 15 a.a. residue-by-residue moving window from 180 a.a. upstream from the center of the B cell epitopes to 180 a.a. downstream. Then, the center positions of the predicted HLA class II epitopes were used to assign each epitope into one of the 18 nonoverlapping bins of 20 a.a. width. Because none of the available databases have recorded the HLA allele types of the host, we can only count the binders for all available HLA class II alleles, and treat those as a population average. However, as shown later, this approach is already providing a significant improvement to the prediction of B cell epitopes.",

The L1 penalty helps perform regularization and only retains the variables that are most important for prediction. The L2 penalty is beneficial to limit colinearity as the counts of DRB, DP, and DQ allele binders of each bin could have high correlation.

The combination of BepiPred1.0 and netMHCIIpan is shown here as an example, whereas the results for other combinations are similar.

Setliff et al. performed the Libra-seq experiment on an HIV patient, n90. Five strains of HIV-1 Env sequences (KNH1144, BG505, ZM197, ZM106.9, and B41) were screened in this patient, and Libra-seq yielded a total of 1,465 B cells with BCR specificity known for each of the five Envs. The binding specificity, Libra-seq score, is measured as a continuous variable. When the Env sequences between two strains are more similar, the BCR repertoire will likely show a more similar response and vice versa. Under this rationale, the sequence similarity was measured by the number of shared candidate B cell epitopes between any two strains. The similarity in Libra-seq scores was defined by the correlation between the Libra-seq scores across all BCRs for the same pairs of Env antigens. For each given B cell epitope prediction model, we included all predicted B cell epitopes on the Env proteins (15-mers in overlapping moving windows), as well as only epitopes with confidence scores that meet different cutoffs, because we hypothesize that this definition of B cell epitope similarity is more relevant when considering B cell epitopes of higher immunogenicity. For all pairs of Env antigens, a Spearman correlation was calculated between similarity in Env B cell epitopes and similarity in Libra-seq scores. There is indeed a higher concordance (correlation) between the predicted Env immunogenicity and the measured Libraseq scores when considering B cell epitopes of higher BepiTBR confidence scores ( Figure 2H ). This trend is less clear when using epitopes predicted by BepiPred 1.0 ( Figure 2H ), and even less so for BepiPred 2.0 and LBEEP (data not shown).",

For HLA-DR, only DRB alleles were considered as DRA alleles are not used by any of the HLA class II epitope prediction software. To investigate which of these alleles are most critical for the generation of B cell epitopes, and the ways in which these alleles participate in this process, we extracted the estimated coefficients of the Elastic-Net models in BepiTBR (BepiPred 1.0), BepiTBR (BepiPred 2.0), and BepiTBR (LBEEP). We examined the coefficient of each 20 a.a. bin (from \u00c0180 a.a. to 180 a.a.) for each allele class and for each of the three BepiTBR models. Overall, the coefficients for the DQ alleles' bins were mostly positive, meaning a higher density of DQ allele binders would lead to higher chances of the B cell epitopes being predicted as true ( Figure 3A ). Bootstrap resampling was performed to generate the CIs of these coefficients, which confirmed that most of these coefficients for DQ binders are significantly larger than 0. Comparatively, the coefficients for DRB and DP alleles across all bins do not have a clear trend of being positively associated with B cell epitope generation ( Figure S3 ). In fact, there seems to be a modest negative correlation between DRB allele binders and B cell epitope immunogenicity.",

To rule out this possibility, we tested whether HLA ligands for each class of alleles, predicted by mixMHC2pred and netMHCIIpan, as well as experimentally validated ligands documented by IEDB, were enriched in hydrophobic amino acids. If our observations were because of an artifact related to surface exposure, it would be expected that the true or predicted DQ ligands have less hydrophobic amino acids compared with DRB ligands.

Five B cell scRNA-seq datasets generated from PBMCs of healthy donors with paired BCR-sequencing were examined ( Figure 3C ). In most datasets, the higher expression of DQ alleles was associated with higher levels of B cell activation, characterized by the switching of heavy chain classes to IgG/IgE/IgA, in sharp contrast to DP and DRB alleles (one example dataset shown in Figure S6 ). The expression of DRB, DQ, and DP alleles was usually correlated in B cells, which presented a confounding factor to this analysis. A multivariate regression against the B cell activation status (class switching) was performed based on the gene expression of DRB, DQ, and DP alleles to remove confounding correlations. Indeed, across all five datasets, the higher expression of DQ alleles was positively associated with the class switching of B cells, with statistical significance achieved in three datasets ( Figure 3D ).

Nevertheless, we tried to correlate the expression of DQ/DP/DRB with CD19's expression. CD19 is a marker of B cell activation/maturation during the developmental stage (Wang et al., 2012) and is thus a good fit for correlation with MHC class II proteins. In these scRNA-seq data, all of DP, DQ, and DRB demonstrate a strongly positive correlation with CD19 expression. But DQ does not have a more positive expression than DP or DRB (Table S2) . Therefore, as we explained above, this analysis may be biased and may not best capture the real relationship between MHC class II proteins and B cell/BCR maturation (against B cell epitopes) during development. Therefore, it will be more informative to examine the correlation between CD19 and DQ/DP/DRB in germinal center B cells. We analyzed the correlation between the expression of the HLA-DQ/DP/DRB genes and CD19 in germinal center B cells from a 10X human lymph node Visium dataset ( Figure S7 , processed data from (Wang et al., 2021a) ). We showed that the correlation between HLA-DQ and CD19 is the most positive and much higher than those of HLA-DP/DRB (Table S3) . Overall, our results strongly support the role of DQ alleles in B cell/BCR maturation, and thus the importance of DQ binders for B cell epitope formation.",

BepiTBR was used to predict the B cell epitopes in the reference S protein sequence. Figure 4G shows the confidence scores of the predicted B cell epitopes in the reference S protein sequence that were lost in these variant sequences. Importantly, we only predicted and examined immunogenic B cell epitopes in the reference S sequence in this analysis. The antibodies are from the vaccine's sera, which are developed against the original S, and the new B cell epitopes that emerged in the variant S sequences are irrelevant. The lost epitopes of S sequences that are associated with severe decrease of serum neutralizing activities indeed have higher confidence scores than the other lost epitopes from variant sequences of minimum/no decrease in neutralization. Similarly, Wang et al., 2021b examined another group of recently reported variants, including N501Y, E484K/R683G, K417N/N501Y/E484K/R683G, K417N, N439K, A475V, Q493R, and N440K, and showed that they induced significant loss of neutralizing activity in either vaccine plasma (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech) or against neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, the other variants, including R346S, Y453F, S477R, R683G, and D614G, did not induce significant loss. In alignment with the experimental validation, our model also correctly predicted which variants will induce severe loss of neutralization ( Figure 4G ). For the Wu et al. and Wang et al. studies , we performed the same analyses with BepiPred 2.0 as control, which showed that BepiPred 2.0 is not as good as BepiTBR in predicting the variants that induced loss of neutralization ( Figure 4G ). These analyses proved again that BepiTBR is a much improved B cell epitope prediction model, compared to other predecessor software. Wang et al. and Wu et al. studies , we investigated the B cell epitopes that were lost in the mutated S protein sequences compared to the reference S sequence. We calculated the average B cell immunogenicity confidence score, by BepiTBR (left) and by BepiPred 2.0 (right), for the lost B cell epitopes in each mutated S protein sequence.

The SARS-CoV virus has a much shorter circulation time in the human population than SARS-CoV-2. The MERS-CoV virus is characterized by spillovers from camels into humans independently over multiple years (Killerby et al., 2020) . Given this, we anticipate the genetic variants in SARS-/ MERS-CoV to be mostly independent of human humoral immune responses because of the limited time of sustained human circulation and human-to-human transmission. Thus, BepiTBR was used to predict the number of B cell epitopes in the reference genomes of SARS-/MERS-CoV, which are some of the earliest appearing strains for each virus, and compared each against all other strains of SARS-/MERS-CoV ( Figure S11 ).

To our knowledge, none of the publicly available B cell epitope prediction software algorithms have leveraged this observation. Moreover, by building upon several off-the-shelf B cell epitope and HLA class II epitope prediction software, we showed that T-B reciprocity provides general enhancement of performances, rather than being specific to a particular combination of B cell epitope and HLA class II epitope prediction algorithms. The final BepiTBR model achieved an AUC of 0.686 on an independent validation cohort, representing an improvement of AUROC of $0.1-$0.17 compared to the three base models. A ''reasonable prediction performance'' should take into consideration the specific research domain, difficulty level of the question, and what prior works have achieved. Prior studies (Galanis et al., 2019; Sanchez-Trincado et al., 2017) have achieved AUC only between 0.5 and 0.6, reflecting the high degree of difficulty in prediction of B cell epitopes and the relative lack of success of prior methods. Our performance of 0.686 should be considered satisfactory in this context. The analyses of the linear and conformational B cell epitopes both yield this similar conclusion. Our work points to a new direction for future works to further improve the prediction of B cell epitopes bioinformatically. More importantly, this work reiterated and reinforced the importance of T-B reciprocity, which has been underappreciated as a valid biological phenomenon that governs the generation of B cell epitopes.",

Therefore, not all epitopes are capable of inducing immunogenic responses or are at least highly inefficient in doing so. Moreover, our work showed that T-B reciprocity results in preferences for certain candidate epitopes to be more or less potent in inducing antibody responses, governed by restrictions on spacing to HLA class II epitopes.

Next, as shown in the test cohort, both in terms of the contributions to the performances of the BepiTBR (BepiPred 1.0, BepiPred 2.0, and LBEEP) models and the performances of the base models, BepiPred 1.0 and 2.0 appear to be comparable with each other, whereas both appear better than LBEEP. This is consistent with the rankings of these models' performances from other studies (Galanis et al., 2019; Jespersen et al., 2017) . Third, comparing the HLA II-only models (trained on HLA class II epitope data for the task of B cell epitope prediction) and the base models, we found that the HLA II-only models generally perform much better than the three base models, which are dedicated prediction models for B cell epitopes. The three base models were all developed with overall narrow consideration of the B cell epitopes themselves, whereas the HLA II-only models (and also BepiTBR) explicitly considered the information of a much wider neighborhood. Therefore, it seems that the neighborhood of the final B cell epitopes is important for the induction of B cell responses and contains essential information for improving prediction of B cell epitopes.",

These observations confirm that the improvement in prediction accuracy in BepiTBR is not an artifact related to caveats such as antigen protein length. Otherwise, the same pattern should have been observed for DRB, DP, and DQ allele binders. These observations also shed light on the biological process of T-B reciprocity, especially the curious opposing effect between DQ and DRB. One possible explanation is that DRB allele binders might be more likely to be T reg epitopes rather than T helper epitopes, whereas only T helper cells participate in T-B reciprocity. In fact, the T reg epitopes first described by Cousens et al. (Cousens et al., 2013 indeed have high affinity binding to DRB alleles.

This raises great concerns for reinfection of SARS-CoV-2, which has been reported increasingly frequently (Cohen and Burbelo, 2020) . This also raises concerns for long-term effectiveness of the recently developed vaccines, especially given the rise of the Delta and Omicron variant strains. On the other hand, there is also the possibility that some antigenic drift could make the virus less pathogenic and less ''visible'' to the human immune system, which could increase the survival fitness of this virus. This coincides with the reported increase in proportions of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (Ren et al., 2021) .

Both questions are valid and have different areas of application. The former could be used for determining candidate epitopes for vaccine development or monitoring antigenic epitope drift, whereas the latter may be useful in scenarios such as engineering of bispecific antibodies (Fan et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "For our training and validation/testing, we mainly considered linear B cell epitope data of the human host from The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (Vita et al., 2019) . We filtered the B cell epitope data by type (linear epitopes only) and length (peptides greater than 6 a.a.). We did not impose an upper length limit for the B cell epitopes. Only 5% of these B cell epitopes are longer than 20 a.a. in length. Entries corresponding to the same B cell epitopes were combined into a single record. We also only used epitopes that had valid corresponding antigen protein sequences, which is necessary for HLA class II epitope prediction. We note that BepiPred 1.0 and 2.0, as well as LBEEP were also trained on the IEDB data. The goal of our work is to show that HLA class II epitope (putative CD4 + T cell epitope) prediction can enhance the base B epitope prediction model. Namely, we are interested in the relative difference of prediction accuracy, induced by incorporation of HLA class II epitope information. Importantly, the HLA class II epitope information has never been considered in these prior models. Therefore, although some of these models also incorporated data from IEDB in training, the use of IEDB data in our work does not constitute any leak of information or overfitting. However, to remove any concern of overfitting, we divided all IEDB records by the year 2018 (all three B epitope prediction software were published before 2018). The IEDB records before 2018 were split randomly into a training cohort and a validation cohort. The IEDB records after 2018 formed the completely independent test cohort. ",

These two software algorithms give a confidence score for each amino acid residue of a given peptide sequence. We then took the maximum of the scores for each amino acid within the given peptide sequence as the peptide level confidence score. We found this approach to be very important for improving the performance of the BepiPred 1.0 and 2.0 software for a given peptide sequence. LBEEP directly gives a prediction score for the whole given peptide. It was applied with the following parameters: ''-m pep -M C -t 0.001''. Conformational epitopes were predicted by ElliPro and discotope using the default options (maximum distance of 6 \u00c5 and minimum score of 0.5 for ElliPro, and contact distance of 10.0 \u00c5 and threshold of \u00c07.7 for discotope).",

For netMHCIIpan software, we used the ''-inptype 0'' parameter, and considered the same alleles to match mixMHC2pred for consistency. For both prediction tools, we scanned all 15-mer candidate epitopes in an overlapping moving window from \u00c0180a.a. upstream of the middle of the B cell epitope of interest to 180a.a. downstream of the middle of the B cell epitope. DRB, DQ and DP allele binders were counted in non-overlapping bins of 20a.a. within this range.Counts were assigned to bins based on the center positions of the moving windows. When the centers of the bins extend beyond the start or the end of the antigen protein, counts of 0s were assigned to those affected bins.",

Interaction terms were added between the B cell epitope confidence score and each bin of HLA class II epitope count. Penalty terms were added to only the HLA class II epitope counts and the interaction terms. Overall, the model can be described as:where refers to the label of B cell epitope immunogenicity, x refers to the features of B cell epitope confidence scores, HLA class II epitope counts, and their interaction terms (see below), and refers to each of the B cell epitopes in the training set. The total penalty strength is denoted as l,and the proportion of penalty assigned to L1 (LASSO) is denoted as a.The link function taken for the regression is:denotes the observed data in a row vector format, and b = b bepi ; b tepi ; b int T denotes the coefficients to be learned, in a column vector format. We implemented the BepiTBR model using the R glmnet package (Friedman et al., 2010) . No standardization of the covariates was employed.In the training phase, as there are many more negative cases from IEDB than positive cases, we randomly subsampled the negative training data points so its sample size is twice that of the positive training data points. We bootstrapped the training dataset 200 times, and fitted the same model (with the same parameters) on the boostrapped training data. ",

We downloaded a total of 1,959,135 viral sequences before the data lock of June 15 th , 2021. Sequences that are the same between the two databases (0.03% of all collected strains) were combined into the same records. Sequences that have any ambiguous amino acids in any coding sequence (49.8%) were removed. We then translated the genomic sequences to proteins, kept only sequences with greater than three appearances, and then removed viral strains with duplicated protein sequences. In order to keep the computation time manageable, for sequences collected after April 2021, we randomly sampled $1000 unique sequences for each month. We identified a total of 21,917 unique and high quality sequences after all filterings. The reference genome was acquired from NCBI.
