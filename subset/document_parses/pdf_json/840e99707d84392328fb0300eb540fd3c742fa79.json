Likewise, neither the suffering from chronic medical conditions (related to increased risk of death due to nor exposure to COVID-19 related risk situations were related to higher risk for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Critically, for age, this was even reversed, namely, adults above 60 who are at higher risk for COVID-19 complications, actually displayed greater resilience to psychiatric disorders associated with the COVID-19 crisis. Such results can be viewed in light of older adults typically displaying lower reactivity to stress, exercising more effective emotional regulation, having greater experience with being alone and with life-threatening medical situations, and thus were perhaps less sensitive (Losada-Baltar et al., 2020). The second main finding reveals that loneliness, due to the social-distancing policy, was the main risk-factor for depression, anxiety and especially their comorbidity. In line with previous studies linking loneliness with a range of deleterious physiological and psychiatric outcomes (Heinrich and Gullone, 2006) , the results underscore that loneliness at such a time (regardless of the socialdistancing policy) bears a notable psychiatric toll. Accordingly, policy makers and mental health practitioners need to stress the importance of safe social interactions (Jeste et al., 2020) .",
