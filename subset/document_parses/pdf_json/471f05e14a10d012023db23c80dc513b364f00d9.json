            "text": "Background: This study sought to investigate incidence and risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 823 COVID-19 patients with at least two evaluations of renal function during hospitalization from four hospitals in Wuhan, China between February 2020 and April 2020. Clinical and laboratory parameters at the time of admission and follow-up data were recorded. Systemic renal tubular dysfunction was evaluated via 24-h urine collections in a subgroup of 55 patients. Results: In total, 823 patients were enrolled (50.5% male) with a mean age of 60.9 \u00b1 14.9 years. AKI occurred in 38 (40.9%) ICU cases but only 6 (0.8%) non-ICU cases. Using forward stepwise Cox regression analysis, we found eight independent risk factors for AKI including decreased platelet level, lower albumin level, lower phosphorus level, higher level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), urea, and prothrombin time (PT) on admission. For every 0.1 mmol/L decreases in serum phosphorus level, patients had a 1.34-fold (95% CI 1.14-1.58) increased risk of AKI. Patients with hypophosphatemia were likely to be older and with lower lymphocyte count, lower serum albumin level, lower uric acid, higher LDH, and higher CRP. Furthermore, serum phosphorus level was positively correlated with phosphate tubular maximum per volume of filtrate (TmP/GFR) (Pearson r \u00bc 0.66, p < .001) in subgroup analysis, indicating renal phosphate loss via proximal renal tubular dysfunction. Conclusion: The AKI incidence was very low in non-ICU patients as compared to ICU patients. Hypophosphatemia is an independent risk factor for AKI in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.",

A recent study from the United States reported that mechanical ventilation was associated with AKI [7] . The onset time of AKI was related to that of mechanical ventilation suggesting that AKI may be a manifestation of disease severity of hospitalized COVID-19 patients [7, 8] . The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has also been reported in autopsy kidney tissue [9] . The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, are highly expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and podocytes [10, 11] , and a spectrum of pathologic abnormalities have been identified in autopsy reports [12] [13] [14] [15] . Although the results of renal autopsy reports cannot confirm direct infection of the virus, finding the risk factors of AKI may help explain the etiology of AKI and why patients with AKI have higher mortality.",

Patients with AKI during hospitalization had a higher probability for death than those without AKI. We found that hypophosphatemia on admission was a new risk factor for AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with every 0.1 mmol/L decreases in serum phosphorus level on admission being associated with a 1.34-fold increase in the risk of AKI. We describe proximal renal tubular dysfunction as a common clinical presentation of renal dysfunction in a subset of our cohort and suggest that a potential reason for hypophosphatemia in COVID-19 patients is renal phosphate loss. The incidence of AKI has been reported inconsistently. In a large cohort from New York City, 36.6% developed AKI during hospitalizations [7] . Here, we describe that the AKI rate was only 5.4% in COVID-19 patients, similar to the previous studies in China (5.1%) [2] , but much lower than in the United States [3, 7] . These differences may be due to different hospitalization practices, as we also noticed that differences in the proportion of critically ill patients among studies. The proportions of patients in the ICU or who received mechanical ventilation reported in a large cohort from New York were much higher (25.6% ICU and 21.8% received mechanical ventilation) than in our cohort, which correlated with a higher AKI rate [7] . In addition, we observed that the rate of AKI was only 0.8% in non-ICU patients, which is even lower than previous reports of 1.3% in mild or moderate severity patients [19] . Our results suggest that the rate of AKI is very low in noncritical patients with COVID-19 infection. However, the incidence of AKI is likely underestimated in our study because we could only presume that creatinine level on admission was the baseline for patients. Consistent with previous studies, we observed a poorer prognosis in COVID-19 patients with AKI.",

Hypophosphatemia, considered as a general marker of illness severity in critically ill patients [25] , was found in about 20-50% of ICU patients on admission. Previous studies have reported that hypophosphatemia may impair the contractile properties of the diaphragm during acute respiratory failure [26] , although correction of hypophosphatemia has not been shown to decrease mortality [25, [27] [28] [29] . Our results show that patients with hypophosphatemia had lower lymphocyte count, higher aspartate aminotransferase, longer prothrombin time, higher CRP and LDH levels, which suggests that hypophosphatemia may have been related to disease severity and multiple organ injuries. Some studies reported that admission serum phosphate over 4.4 mg/ dl and 4.9 mg/ml were associated with an increased risk of developing AKI [30] and in-hospital mortality [31] in hospitalized patients. However, we did not observe this correlation in patients with COVID-19 in our study. It may due to limited cases with hyperphosphatemia in our study. Phosphorus metabolism is complex in critically ill patients and can be affected by renal function, nutritional status [32] , and renal phosphorus loss [29, 33] . In a subset of our cohort, we found that 27.0% of patients had proximal tubule dysfunction, supporting renal tubular injury was common in COVID-19 patients.",

Several histologic findings were observed in COVID-19 patients, including acute tubular injury, collapsing glomerulopathy, and endothelial injury/thrombotic microangiopathy [34] . Previous studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may cause cell damage through direct infection of the kidney. As the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is highly expressed in the kidney [35] , direct viral tissue damage is a plausible mechanism of injury. In addition, endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulation of immune responses, and maladaptation of ACE2-related pathways might all contribute to these extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 [36] . SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in the urine [37] , and viral particles have also been identified in the epithelium of proximal tubules by electronic microscopy [15, 38] . However, identification of viral particles is difficult and can be confounded by similar appearances of organelles as reported by Goldsmith CS [39] , and not all reported data are consistent. In one recent case series of hospitalized COVID-19 with AKI, acute tubular injury and epithelial necrosis in the biopsied kidney tissue were the predominant histopathologic findings which are similar to that of septic AKI [13, 14] . Glomerular disease presenting as proteinuria with or without AKI was also considered as an important presentation of COVID-19 infection in patients with a high-risk APOL1 genotype [40] .",
