Globalization and technological advancements are opening new avenues and opportunities for social workers around the world (Panos, 2005) . In today's online world, there are 4.57 billion internet users globally and 3.81 billion active social media users (Kemp, 2020) . Youth in the age group of 15-24 are the most connected, and one in three internet users are children and adolescents (UNICEF, 2017) . Fieldwork agencies are also advancing their clinical, family, and community-based practices with different technologies, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is only a 3% chance of automating social work jobs; that is to say, it is difficult work for robots to do (Bui, 2015) . Social workers' engagement in technology has become imperative. I have been a field instructor for social work students from India, Europe, and the USA. As a professional social worker from a marginalized indigenous community in India, embracing and advocating for human rights and social justice in my personal life, social work practice, and field instruction, I have observed emerging trends in social work practice. In the digital era, human rights violations fueled on social media lead to offline violence. There is a significant shift in the digital behavior of young people which is paving a path for social workers' role in technology. As a field instructor, I am always thinking and reflecting with my students on the future of social work practice, research, and education for human rights and social justice with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI).",

This paper has been prepared based on my last decade of transnational social work practice experience and fieldwork supervision. Although social work field supervision is a particularly important core component of social work education, there is no clear model for social work field practice with emerging technologies. This paper will share some of the critical reflections on emerging technologies based on my transnational social work practice with a youth-led organization called Trust for Youth and Child Leadership (TYCL). This article acknowledges pressing human rights issues existing in emerging technologies and does not claim technology as a universal solution for human rights issues. This article explores the potential scope for budding social workers' engagement with emerging technologies to prevent potential human rights issues such as bias, harm, and digital divide and promote community participation, safety, and inclusion. Social workers' training in the field prepares social work students to ethically address human rights issues in technology and promote a tech social work model for future practices.",

Digital technologies increase social workers' consciousness around well-equipped skills and competencies for contemporary social work practice (Kirwan, 2019) . In the digital era, e-social work is emerging as a new specialization with the adaptation of innovations and new methods for social work practice (L\u00f3pez Pel\u00e1ez & Marcuello-Serv\u00f3s, 2018) . There have been several case studies highlighting the use of digital tools in social work education, diagnosis, intervention, and evaluation (Goldkind et al., 2018) . Digital social work services, however, are available only in high-income countries, typically target affordable groups, and often require a credit card (Reamer, 2013) . In recent years, we have seen more free and subsidized social work services available across the globe, including TYCL's free mental health services to young people in India through a Youth Helpline mobile application. However, the digital divide exists at all levels from geopolitical to household, and social workers can be key actors in analyzing that divide, and developing and implementing solutions (Steyaert & Gould, 2009 ). In the growing techdriven society, appropriate assistive technologies certainly create more access to services and compensate for certain impairments of persons with disabilities and the elderly. Similarly, access and ownership to technological tools transform the lives of women in developing counties (The Cherie Blair Foundation for Women & The GSMA Development Fund, 2013). However, inequality in access to digital technologies generates and replicates socio-economic exclusions (Srivastava, 2019) . Social interventions focusing on reducing the digital divide include those which aim to enrich digital skills and promote diverse information producers (Steyaert & Gould, 2009 ). There has been an ongoing debate around the ethical use of technology in social work practice. Yet, there has not been much discussion on social work in emerging technologies. Patton et al., (2020a, b) discuss collaboration between social workers and data scientists, and social workers are offered ethical guidelines for social media data research related to youth violence prevention. There is ongoing interdisciplinary research and practice to address pressing human rights issues with social work ethics and principles. Preparing social work students to work with technologies and technologists can become an essential part of social work education and practice to accelerate the human rights agenda.",

The personal safety and protection of people in the twentyfirst century demands multi-stakeholder action to address the intersection between technology and human rights (Smith & Browne, 2018) . The World Summit on the Information Society (2003) proclaims that upholding the UDHR is central to build a people-centered, inclusive, and developmentoriented Information Society (ITU, 2003) . Increased access to the internet and social media tools has amplified public and activists' voices for human rights (Bloomer, 2020) . In the recent past, technologies have enabled and significantly increased freedom of expression for all social groups through social media. However, the COVID-19 global pandemic has made ever more evident the digital divide across society and the inaccessibility of technologies, devices, and internet for poor and marginalized communities to avail education, food supplies, health care, mobility, freedom of expression, employment, and communication in several parts of the world. On the other hand, over the course of the pandemic, the world has seen a significant increase in the use of the internet and digital products and services across socio-economic boundaries (IANS, 2020; PCMag, 2020) . There are multiple ways technology helps to take the human rights agenda forward. A few examples might be educating youth on human rights and social justice with virtual reality (VR) technology; using artificial intelligence (AI) facial and image recognition technology to prevent crimes against children; and implementing AI tracing technologies to support immigrant laborers and refugees. Social workers are equipped with both theory and practice and are directly connected with marginalized communities. Therefore, tech social work can be critical in overcoming crucial challenges in the tech space, including access, deployment, use, and data bias.",

Race is one social identity that is often subject to visible and invisible structural oppression and human rights violations. Caste is one of the most invisible identities, repeatedly subject to encounter visible and invisible oppression and injustice. There has been hope that technology could reduce the structural inequalities in society and amplify equal opportunities for inclusion. While there has been progress to some extent, bias, prejudice, digital divides, and discrimination often exist online as they have in offline communities (Benjamin, 2019; Buolamwini et al., 2020; Noble, 2018) . Unfortunately, inequalities show up in every phase of technology development, deployment, access, and usage. This underdiscussed reality has created huge systemic human rights issues online. The fundamental question is, by whom and for whom are these technologies and technological tools created? Students in India and the USA are more comfortable exploring and discussing social identity and intersectionality of race and caste. Most Indian students, however, are hesitant and not prepared to explore questions and expressions of social identity, though this also differs from school to school and by the lived experiences of the students. These unexplored social identities often cause human rights issues in the field. People behind technology are biased, are less diverse, and tend to bypass ethical processes, all of which amplify structural inequalities in technology and cause harm to vulnerable populations (Floridi et al., 2020) . The preparation of social work students in the field education requires three layers to address human rights challenges: (a) constant reflection on identity and structural inequalities; (b) adaptation of innovative technological tools in social work practice; and (c) social work ethical contributions to emerging technologies. This type of holistic approach in preparing social students in the field potentially addresses inequalities and amplifies human rights voices in the digital space.",

TYCL respects and recognizes indigenous knowledge, culture, and development practices in hybrid social change models that combine indigeneity with modern technologies. This unique approach attracts social work students from all over the world. TYCL is committed to addressing the most pressing issues of young people, such as mental health, violence against children both online and offline, and promoting pro-environmental behavior among young people. TYCL is not only working with young people and their families and communities, but also working with social workers and technologists from different parts of the world to create safe and inclusive spaces for young people online. TYCL has launched a youth helpline mobile application for virtual mental health support and another mobile application for children's mentorship programs with the support of local technologists, social workers, and youth volunteers. These mobile applications have not only expanded the organization's operations, but have also broadened the scope for transnational social work practice and virtual support systems for vulnerable young people. My affiliation with social work schools like the Department of Social Work, Pondicherry University in India, and Columbia School of Social Work in the USA has expanded my theoretical knowledge and supported my exploration of the need for triangulated collaboration between youth-led community organizations, social work schools, and tech companies to ensure no one is victimized or criminalized online and to promote safe and inclusive technologies through a social work lens beyond borders.",

First, fieldwork days and times differ from country to country and school to school. In India, some schools engage students in fieldwork 2 days a week throughout the semester or for a 1-month field practicum at the end of the semester. In the USA, schools may provide 3 days a week for the whole academic year. It can be challenging for the organization to adjust its operational schedule based on the placement of the student. Most of the schools do not offer orientation or training on emerging technologies and media. This requires a high investment of the organization's time and knowledge to induct the students, but due to limited time, it is not always possible to harvest the maximum fruits of the students' social work skills and abilities in the emerging technology space. Likewise, social work schools have assigned to organizational field instructors' additional academic responsibilities, such as supervising students, task management, process documentation assessments, feedback, evaluation, and career support. These academic requirements consume more time and limit the time available for social work practice and innovation. Some students are more advanced and are willing to do more tech work, but due to resource constraints, there may be limited tech tools available to advance their practices in the organization.",

While their field education plans may include online research and practice, some of the students argue that online and tech research is not social work research and prefer to seek direct practice with vulnerable communities. A few common challenges observed among the students are a lack of clarity in their learning style and the application of basic and advanced skills of social work in the organization. These students' challenges can be addressed with additional resources and by adjusting the fieldwork duration. In addition, many Indian students faced challenges in using tech tools like Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, e-Classroom, and Meet for virtual collaboration, and many had limited or no access to the internet and tech devices. Social work students from rural and underprivileged backgrounds, especially, have therefore faced multiple challenges in the field. All these challenges have to be addressed and social work practice has to take place within 24-28 fieldwork days in a semester in India. The US model of fieldwork, however, has more time for both preparation and practice. In the ongoing modernization of the social work field education curriculum, sufficient time and resources need to be allocated to prepare students for modern tech social work practice.",

These developing trends and debates contribute to the improvement of ethical standards, skills, and relationship approaches in social work practice. L\u00f3pez-Pel\u00e1ez and D\u00edaz (2015) discuss e-Social work as online research, patient treatment (individual therapy, group, and community dynamics), the training and teaching of social workers, and the monitoring of social service programs. These discussions are focused on adopting technology in social work practice. Alternatively, Patton et al., (2020a, b) have discovered opportunities for social work contributions to data science to address human rights issues. In their research, social workers contribute contextual qualitative inputs to social media research (Patton et al., 2020a, b) . Data science, likewise, has the potential to improve the scientific approach of qualitative and quantitative social work research and practice (Cariceo et al., 2018) . In this context, tech social work can be defined as a specialization within social work which ethically contributes to technology development processes and to the deployment and use of data in various social settings to address harm. Tech social work also emphasizes effectively using technological tools in the process of social work education, training, research, practice, and interventions to promote equity, diversity, human rights, community participation, and social justice with indigenous knowledge and interdisciplinary theories.",

In 2017, the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) in the USA released new standards and ethics for technology use in social work practice (NASW, 2017) . In India, however, there is no clear theoretical background or ethical procedures to work with technologists in social work practice. As mentioned above, social work students add value to the tech world by sharing ethical standards of practice for fairer and more just technologies to ensure human rights on digital platforms. Social workers offer combined skills and knowledge in human rights, social justice, and social and environmental ethics. These qualities and skills are widely lacking in the tech sector, which has caused more social issues like racial discrimination in AI products and services and caste-based digital expressions and advertisements, which have resulted in victimization and criminalization of marginalized communities. Social workers can complement their social skills and knowledge in technologies for social justice. There is an emerging need for engaging social workers in technology development, deployment, and implementation to prevent such consequences in society. Figure 1 below exhibits the qualities and components of tech social workers in the field to ensure safe and inclusive technologies and online communities. Social work schools around the world must incorporate emerging media and technology in the social work curriculum to equip social work students to ensure human rights and social justice in online and tech spaces. Social work schools in India may focus on developing standard fieldwork guidelines and induction programs for fieldwork agencies and field instructors, similar to Seminars in Field Instruction (SIFI) offered in the USA. Alike to TYCL, there may be ample scope for other development agencies to move practices online and adapt more tech tools for their program implementations in India and beyond. Likewise, social workers are particularly well equipped to take on opportunities in tech companies towards human rights and ethics. Google, for example, was recently hiring social scientists for their ethical AI team. Unlike other disciplines of social sciences, social work includes the unique aspect of field practice with specific direct and indirect methods to work with people using appropriate approaches, principles, and ethics. This makes social workers more than eligible to work in the tech spaces and organizations.",

There is great potential for social work schools in the USA, India, and globally to expand their coursework available and create specialized tracks in human rights, emerging technology, and media. Fieldwork agencies like TYCL are keen to train social work students to practice with emerging technologies through a human rights lens to bring community participation, cultural context, and language inclusion into the tech tools. It is essential that social work students are sensitized and internalize the visible and invisible identity issues in human rights and cultural contexts. When access to the internet and digital tools becomes a basic right of the people, understanding how caste, oppression, race, power, and privilege (CORPP) impact the technology sector and socio-cultural contexts can add value to human rightsand social justice-driven tech social work practice. Social work schools around the world should incorporate CORPP courses in their curriculum to advance their human rights actions in the field. With AI/ML technologies positioned to lead the market in every aspect of human life and shift human digital behavior, it is time to prepare social workers to work with marginalized people and technologies to promote human rights and social justice (Dobrescu, 2018; Hasse et al., 2019; Patton, 2020) . Mainstream technology companies can be potential field partners for social workers along with appropriate guidelines, field supervisors, and academic supervisors. The emergence of tech social workers is the need of the hour, and it requires collective will and action to move this human rights agenda forward. The unique combination of social work with indigenous knowledge and emerging technologies may be a step towards decolonizing social work practice. This unique integrated approach creates an opportunity for tech social work model and specialization within social work education, practice, and research to support safe and inclusive communities online and offline to promote human rights.",
