Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to human health, especially COVID-19 that has became a serious worldwide health concern since the end of 2019. Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent its onward transmission. Contact tracing can help us better understand the transmission link of the virus, whereby better interrupting its transmission. Given the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, contact tracing has become one of the most critical measures to effectively curb the spread of the virus. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on contact tracing, with a detailed coverage of the recent advancements the models, digital technologies, protocols and issues involved in contact tracing. The current challenges as well as future directions of contact tracing technologies are also presented.",

The pathogens that cause infectious diseases are bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi and so on [1] . Infectious diseases bring a great threat to human health, national economy and societal development. Death from infectious diseases is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, and the incidence of infectious diseases in developing countries is especially high [2] . In 2016, infectious diseases resulted in 4.3 million deaths (1.7 million women Figure 1 : Statistics on the incidence and death of China's statutory infectious diseases in 2019. and 2.7 million men) according to the WHO's 2019 World Health Statistics report [3] . According to the Statistics of the National Health Commission of China in 2019, a total of 1,0244,507 cases of statutory infectious diseases were reported nationwide, resulting in 25,285 deaths. The reported morbidity rate was 733.57 per 100,000 and the mortality rate was 18,100 per 100,000. As shown in Figure 1 , HIV Viral Hepatitis Tuberculosis Rabies influenza are among the top five infectious disease deaths in China. Starting from the end of 2019, COVID-19 has taken a huge death toll on people's life, having caused 45,406,832 infections and 1,183,726 deaths as of October 30, 2020 [4] . Infectious diseases can be categorized in different ways. Here, we present two commonly used approaches for categorizing infectious diseases. According to the mode of transmission, infectious diseases can be broadly divided into the following four categories [5] :",

An HIV-positive obstetrician in Australia infected 149 pregnant women through contact in 1994. This event attracted wide attentions, and helped prompt more research attentions on controlling infectious diseases through contact tracing [11] . Contact tracing and the follow-up control measures such as quarantine and isolation were crucially important during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [12] , the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014 [13] , as well as in the eradication of smallpox [14] . Despite the current advances in vaccine development technologies, the role of contact tracing and follow-up control measures in the initial stage of an epidemic are still critical. The results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can have a major role in relaxing social-distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 [15] .",

Relying mainly on manual interviews and investigations, the traditional tracing method is time and resource consuming. A low, steady number of new cases is usually manageable by the traditional contact tracing methods, but for those highly infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, the infection rate of the diseases can easily outpace that of the contact tracing and will quickly overwhelm the tracing system [19] , making contact tracing lose much of its efficacy eventually. Also, the traditional contact tracing method is mainly based on interviews and thus tends to produce highly incomplete and inaccurate information. This will mislead or even disrupt the tracing process and waste a lot of resources unnecessarily which may have already stretched to the limit. Therefore, it becomes imperative for us to develop and deploy more efficient contact tracing technologies, by taking advantage of the latest advancements in information and communication technologies, for faster responses to major infectious disease outbreak.",

These equations are a well established, heuristic approach to reformulate individual based models as described above. Instead of counting the number of individuals of a given type, the expected relative frequencies are addressed by the ordinary differential equations model. In many cases, these models allow for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism, and for powerful predictions [29] . Detailed pairwise equations [30] give an analytical insight into contact tracing for STDs, such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia, which are described by a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) framework, while the airborne infections, such as SARS, smallpox, polio and measles, follow the susceptible-infected-recovered/dead paradigm.",

In the case of a decentralized architecture, the process of consent revocation is more complex. If an infected user requests their personal data to be deleted, the server can delete the stored data it receives from the user, but it might be difficult to ensure that the data which have been transferred to other devices can be instantly removed from those devices. The possible solution is to ensure that the transferred data are always deleted after a specific time duration (e.g., 21 days) from all the devices involved in the architecture. On top of that, enhanced data encryption among all the nodes in the architecture can be implemented as the additional protective measures just in case the shared data are not deleted in time.",

In this subsection, we will detail a number of popular contact tracing mobile Apps, that have been adopted by different countries in contact tracing of COVID-19. Similar to the protocol, these contact tracing apps can generally be classified into two classes by whether the contact tracing is done on a centralized server or done on every user's phone in a decentralized way. Table 3 presents a summary of these apps, which all can be downloaded from Google Play, the Apple App Store or online.",

            "text": "As mentioned in protocols, in centralized architectures, all contact tracing tasks are done in a centralized servers. After infected users upload their data, central Health Authorities can notify their contacts. In this kind of architectures, app developers, health workers and Health Authorities may know who have installed the app, who have been infected and who may have been exposed to the virus. In this way, Health Authorities can inform the exposed users and request specific actions from them. However, users will only know whether they have been exposed to the virus recently. TraceTogether The TraceTogether app [52] is a Bluetooth-based app proposed by the Singapore Government in March 2020. It uses a digital contact tracing protocol called BlueTrace. Phones exchange anonymized proximity information using Bluetooth during encounters. This information is stored securely on the phone and is automatically deleted after 25 days. If a user tests positive to COVID-19, the data is only shared with the Ministry of Health (MOH) . Using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values, TraceTogether can measure the signal strength between devices. Calibrated RSSI values are used to estimate the approximate distance between users during an encounter. TraceTogether interpolates between successive communications to estimate the approximate duration of an encounter. Singapore's National Development Minister, Lawrence Wong, has said, if we want the tracing technology to be truly effective, three-quarters of country's residents must have the app installed on their mobile phone. But a month after TraceTogether's launch, there were only 1.08 million users (5.7 million residents total) in Singapore, which is far from the target [53] . Due to the app's data privacy policies, no further results are released. However, the app has attracted global interest-the governments of more than 50 nations worldwide have expressed interest in adopting or modifying the app to suit their countries [54] .",

For example, social inequality will be caused by forcing citizens to use a certain tracing technology and the discriminatory measures on the traced movements of people. This will need to digital social exclusion and inequality. Social conflicts, even instability, may also be caused between governments and those people who believe in personal freedom around the mandated tracing measures. The extent in which contact tracing is utilised in our society also needs to be carefully measured. In the crisis of COVID-19, we will be more inclined to sacrifice the freedom as our response to the crisis. But when the situations of COVID-19 pandemic is in some countries, we may not have some appropriately relaxed contact tracing available accordingly.

Despite great efforts that have been taken by contact tracing system and app developers in enhancing the preservation of privacy information of users and strengthening system security against possible hacking and attacks which try to illegally access users' sensitive information, it is still a very challenging task to persuade users to adopt contact tracing technologies in many countries, particularly in the Western countries where the culture of individual privacy is deep rooted. We have witnessed some individual cases of mandatory adoption of contact tracing technologies in several countries under some special circumstances. For example, all the arriving passengers in South Korea and Singapore from overseas were once required, with no exception, to use their contact tracing app upon passengers' arrival.

While centralized storage of data can bring efficiency to governments and support research and other activities, it raises concerns that data may be stored or re-purposed for other uses. Thus, part of the equation to solve or mitigate the privacy concerns in contact tracking may be to avoid centralized data collection. However, a decentralized approach to data collection in contact tracing reduces the opportunity for health researchers and epidemiologists to easily access data for comprehensive studies of populations, leading to reduced data utility overall. For example, the UK government's proposal to adopt Apple/Google products has reduced public health surveillance and analysis. More importantly, reliance on Apple and Google for this technology has the clear potential to place more data mining and public health impact opportunities in the hands of the already dominant technology companies.",

The quality of data may also be compromised in the communication process from the tracing devices to the server. The smartphones, as the most important means of physical devices for contact tracing, may not be properly working all the time, e.g., they may be running out of power when the tracing is performed. From the subjective perspective, users may fail to open the tracing devices for collecting the data. This may because that they are reluctant to use the tracing devices to share the data or they simply forget to turn it on.

Such scenarios-specific factors will have impacts on the corresponding optimal specification of the localization technology, data collection and storage approaches, the values of some key tracing parameters as well as notification and response strategies.

Several countries, such as France, for example, have pursued to collect contact data on central government servers, not on decentralized servers, in order to maintain records of personal information that can be used to assist in investigating cases. Governments in different countries tend to support locally developed digital technologies for contact tracing due to the reasons of fast rollout and removal of obstacles posed by the local laws and regulations.
