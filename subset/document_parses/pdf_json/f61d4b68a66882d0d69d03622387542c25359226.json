            "text": "Differencing is a preferred approach to stabilize the mean values of the time series, while log transformation can usually reduce but not eliminate the nonconsistency of the variance (i.e., heteroscedasticity). Heteroscedasticity where the spread is proportional to the mean of the time series will tend to be improved by taking logarithm, but if it's not increasing with the mean, then the heteroscedasticity may be made worse by that transformation. In addition to log transformation, other types of transformations such as cube, square, square root and so on are possible [16] . If the approximate form of the heteroscedasticity were known, a type of transformations might approximately make the variance constant. However, in most of the cases, heteroscedasticity cannot eliminate by transformation, because the relationship between the variance and mean of the time series are unknown. If the variance of the time series varies with time, the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) estimated by the ARIMA will not be accurate. In addition, the current values of the time series usually have stronger correlations with recent values of the series, but not with earlier ones. With the traditional ARIMA modeling technique, information contained in the earlier series is ignored or attenuated. This paper proposes a method to modify the traditional ARIMA model. Information computed from historical ARIMA models and the real data reported in the past were applied to adjust the forecasted values derived from the general ARIMA model. As an example, weekly incident cases of the Alberta COVID-19 were analyzed and forecasted.",

(3) -(5), subscript t represents the \"current\" time. It is usually the last available time point of the series.
