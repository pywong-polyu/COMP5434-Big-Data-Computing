            "text": "Misinformation has become prevalent since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand why people believe and share misinformation, we conducted a nationwide survey during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We found the indirect effects of COVID-19 risk on people's information accuracy judgment and associated information sharing intention through people's emotional states. People faced with a higher level of COVID-19 risk (measured by a 7-day moving average of daily new deaths or new cases) experienced weaker positive and stronger negative emotions, and heightened emotionality (both the positive and negative emotions) was associated with increased belief in and greater likelihood to share the COVID-19 information regardless of veracity. We also found that only the negative emotion mediated the relation between the COVID-19 risk and the truth discernment regarding accuracy judgment. However, the mediating effect of negative emotion disappeared among people with high analytic thinking ability. These findings suggest that the analytic thinking ability could moderate the destructive relationship between negative emotion and accuracy discernment. Based on a large sample, our findings provide actionable insights for the policymakers to respond to the spread of misinformation appropriately and promptly during the pandemic.",

            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted over 200 countries and territories worldwide so far. As of January 17, 2022, more than 326 million cases of COVID-19 and over 5 million deaths from it had been reported all over the world (World Health Organization, 2022) . To fight against this novel and infectious disease, people need accurate information to guide their behavior and protect themselves (Tangcharoensathien et al., 2020) . Because of practicing physical distancing during the pandemic, people are heavily reliant on social media to obtain, share, and seek information about the virus (Limaye et al., 2020) . However, social media platforms that allow people to express their (false) opinions and share (mis)information freely have become populated with various misinformation, which is a severe problem, especially in science communication during the COVID-19 pandemic (Bavel et al., 2020; Scheufele et al., 2021) . Even worse, many false and misleading claims had easily triggered emotional thinking and behaviors that endangered oneself and others (Ahmed et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2020) . For example, conspiracy theories about the cause and origin of the virus led the public to be angry with and distrust the government and health authorities, which hampered the implementation of containment measures (Limaye et al., 2020) . It was also reported that the false rumors regarding a connection between 5G and the spread of the COVID-19 were trusted by many people and disseminated widely online. As a result, many phone masts were torched in the United Kingdom, including a mast serving a hospital in Birmingham (Page, 2020) . This event is exceptionally harmful during such a special time when hospitals need to operate with maximum efficiency (Ahmed et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is crucial to understand why people believe and share misinformation in the context of the pandemic.",

            "text": "Previous studies on severe pandemics (e.g., SARS, H1N1, Ebola) suggested that their outbreak had a tremendous psychological impact on individuals. People were observed to suffer emotional distress, such as anxiety, depression, panic, when faced with highly contagious diseases (Lau et al., 2010; Qian et al., 2005; Shultz et al., 2016) . Currently, the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is not only substantial and sustained but also complex and multifaceted, given the threat, uncertainty, and potential loss during the pandemic (Gruber et al., 2021) . The pandemic contributed to a range of emotional reactions and reduced subjective well-being (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020) . Meanwhile, the degree of emotional responses in public was highly associated with the severity of the epidemic locally. For example, a study conducted in China during the outbreak of SARS in 2003 found that college students in Beijing showed more negative emotions than those in Suzhou, where the SARS epidemic was less severe compared to that in Beijing (Qian et al., 2005) . Based on a large-scale nationwide survey during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, Qiu et al. (2020) found that people from the most severely affected regions experienced the highest level of psychological distress. Besides, Zheng et al. (2020) also found that people who live in the provinces with a higher number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in China demonstrated a higher level of anxiety. Thus, we speculate that people faced with higher COVID-19 risk, i.e., more infections and deaths, are likely to experience more negative and less positive emotions.",

            "text": "Based on previous work, there are two main perspectives on the relationship between emotion and individuals' propensity to trust information. One perspective suggests different effects of positive and negative emotions on believing information. According to the assimilative-accommodative model (Bless & Fiedler, 2006) , positive and negative emotions influence individuals' inclination to trust information by regulating their information processing strategies differently. Specifically, people in positive emotional states tend to employ more heuristic and less effortful strategies. In contrast, people in negative emotional states tend to use more analytic, detail-oriented, and effortful strategies (Bless et al., 1990; Bless & Fiedler, 2006; Fiedler & Bless, 2000) . However, when encountering new information, people would automatically accept it as true during the comprehension process and reject the information that required additional cognitive resources and further processing (Gilbert, 1991) . In this vein, when adopting more heuristic or less analytic strategies, people may be more likely to accept new information as true and worse at discerning true from false information. In line with this perspective, studies found that gullibility was increased by positive emotions and reduced by negative emotions (Forgas, 2019 for a review). Therefore, positive emotions that induce more heuristic information processing strategies may be positively associated with the perceived accuracy of COVID-19 information and negatively associated with truth discernment. Furthermore, since people are more likely to share the information they believe , positive emotions may also be positively associated with the information sharing intention. In contrast, negative emotions that activate more analytic information processing strategies may associate with increased truth discernment.",

            "text": "The other perspective is that positive and negative emotions promote the perceived accuracy of information by facilitating heuristic information processing strategies. According to the resource allocation model (Ellis & Ashbrook, 1988) , both positive and negative emotions increased irrelevant thoughts, which occupied attentional resources (Seibert & Ellis, 1991) and further reduced the processing effort invested in the ongoing cognitive tasks (Ellis & Ashbrook, 1988; Ellis et al., 1997) . Supportive evidence came from a previous study showing that positive and negative emotions measured by PANAS were positively associated with intuitive decision-making (Sinclair et al., 2010) . Given that people by default accept new information as true (Gilbert, 1991; Lewandowsky et al., 2012) , it seems that heightened emotionality would make people trust the COVID-19 information more regardless of information veracity. As reviewed by Scheufele and Krause (2019) , emotional states, especially negative emotion, would intensify people's perceived accuracy of the (mis)information that is consistent with their beliefs or what they want to believe. Moreover, a recent study found heightened emotionality concerning both positive and negative emotions was associated with increased vulnerability to believing fake political news on social media (Martel et al., 2020) . Therefore, emotionality (both positive and negative emotions) may positively relate to the perceived accuracy of COVID-19 information and the associated information sharing intention and negatively relate to truth discernment.",

Specifically, if truth discernment is negatively related to positive emotion and positively related to negative emotion according to the assimilative-accommodative model, the indirect relation between COVID-19 risk and truth discernment through positive emotion would be weaker while the indirect relation through negative emotion would be greater or the same for people engaging more in analytic thinking.

The headline presentation was in a format that appeared commonly on the Internet, and each was presented with a picture, lede sentence, and source (see Fig. 1 ). Following each headline, participants needed to judge the accuracy of the information and indicate their information sharing intention. To avoid the influence of information familiarity, they were also asked to report whether they had seen the news before or not. All news headlines were presented in a random order for each participant. After finishing all the questions related to the twentythree news headlines, participants answered twenty questions about their mood state during the past few days and seven questions regarding their tendency to engage in analytic thinking. Upon completing the measures of emotion and analytic thinking, participants answered a oneitem attention check to ensure that they paid attention to the survey and thoroughly read the materials in the questionnaire. Finally, participants completed demographic questions, including age, gender, the highest level of education, marital status, monthly personal income, and place of residence.

We calculated the two indicators for a specific area by averaging the associated local daily numbers in the past week, including the data collection day. Thus, we estimated the level of COVID-19 risk that each participant might experience based on their local daily new deaths and new cases (the 7-day moving average) in their living province. However, because participants from the same province might complete the survey on a different day, the levels of COVID-19 risk estimated for them would be different. In such a case, the level of COVID-19 risk we estimated in the current study would be better regarded as an individual-level rather than group-level variable. All the case-related data were obtained from the official websites of the health commission of each province, which published the daily briefings of the novel coronavirus cases (The website links are listed in Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials). In general, more daily new deaths and new cases in a province imply a higher level of the COVID-19 risk people could have experienced locally. Table 2 provides basic statistics for the main measures and the bivariate correlations between the individual-level variables in the current study. We found that both the daily new deaths and new cases were correlated negatively with positive emotion and positively with negative emotion. Both positive and negative emotions were correlated positively with the perceived accuracy of the headlines and the associated sharing intention regardless of information veracity.",

An ICC value near zero (smaller than 0.1) suggested that multilevel modeling would be unnecessary (Aguinis et al., 2013) . We thus performed the null models with by-province random intercepts without any predictors to obtain ICCs. The results showed that 0.7% (ICC = 0.007) of the total variance in positive emotion and 0.9% (ICC = 0.009) of the variance in negative emotion were associated with province, indicating that single-level analyses were appropriate (Aguinis et al., 2013) .

Therefore, we first calculated ICCs by running the null models that included by-item, by-participant, and by-province random intercepts but without any predictors. The results showed that, for the variance in perceived accuracy, 36.9% (ICC = 0.369) was associated with item, 8.2% (ICC = 0.082) was associated with participant, and 0.04% (ICC = 0.0004) was associated with province. For the variance in sharing intention, 25.6% (ICC = 0.256) was associated with item, 17.8% (ICC = 0.178) was associated with participant, and 0.09% (ICC = 0.0009) was associated with province. Because of the near-zero ICCs for the province, we excluded by-province random effects. Still, we included by-item and by-participant random effects in the models to account for the nonindependence in the data (Brauer & Curtin, 2018) . We then ran the mixed-effects models that included the daily new deaths, positive emotion, negative emotion, headline type, and three two-way interactions between headline type and the other three variables as fixed effects, as well as control variables of age, gender, educational level, marital status, income, population density, and GDP. Headline type was a dummy variable (0 for false headlines and 1 for true headlines). Besides, except for the headline type, we standardized all the other variables in the models.",

A larger discernment score indicates a higher level of overall truth discernment in the perceived accuracy (accuracy discernment) or sharing intention (sharing discernment) of the true versus false news headlines (Pennycook & Rand, 2019 . We performed linear regressions with accuracy discernment and sharing discernment being the dependent variable separately. Similar to the analyses above, we calculated ICCs. The results showed that 0.8% (ICC = 0.008) of the total variance in accuracy discernment and 0.7% (ICC = 0.007) of the total variance in sharing discernment were associated with province, indicating that single-level analyses were appropriate. We then ran the linear regressions that included the daily new deaths, positive emotion, negative emotion, and control variables of age, gender, educational level, marital status, income, population density, and GDP. All variables were standardized. The results are presented in Table 5 . We only found a significant relationship between negative emotion and accuracy discernment. Stronger negative feelings were associated negatively with enhanced ability in distinguishing false headlines from true ones in the accuracy judgment.

We tested the mediation models in which one \"Level 2\" variable (COVID-19 risk) predicted other \"Level 2\" variables (positive and negative emotions), which in turn predicted the \"Level 1\" variable (perceived accuracy or sharing intention). To count the correlations between positive and negative emotions, we developed the parallel multiple mediator models to explore the indirect effects of emotions, allowing us to estimate the indirect effect of each type of emotion by controlling for the effect of the other type of emotion. The daily new deaths entered as the measure of the COVID-19 risk in the mediation models. Additionally, age, gender, educational level, marital status, and income were control variables 4 in the models. All of the variables in the mediation models were standardized. We performed the analyses using the lavaan package in R (Version 3.1.2). A bootstrap confidence interval did not include zero, suggesting the existence of an indirect effect. Full model structures are available in the Supplemental Materials. The results are presented in Table 6 . We can find that both the positive and negative emotions mediated the relations between the daily new deaths and the perceived accuracy of the news headlines and between the daily new deaths and the associated information sharing intention regardless of the information veracity. For both the true and false headlines, it appears that when facing more daily new deaths, people tended to have lower levels of positive emotion. Accordingly, they showed lower ratings of information credibility and a lower likelihood of sharing the information. In contrast, more daily new deaths would connect with a higher level of negative emotion. As a result, people tended to show increased belief in all types of information and a higher likelihood of sharing the information. These results supported our hypothesis that there were indirect relations between COVID-19 risk and perceptions of the information accuracy and the associated information sharing intention through individuals' emotional states. Similar results were obtained when we further used the daily new cases to measure the COVID-19 risk (see Table S6 in the Supplementary Materials).",

Our findings identified the indirect effects of COVID-19 risk (measured by the 7-day moving average of daily new deaths or new cases) on people's accuracy judgment of the COVID-19 information and associated information sharing intention through people's emotional state. We also found an indirect relationship between COVID-19 risk and accuracy discernment via negative emotion. Our results regarding the stable mediating role of emotional state fit well with the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory (Mehrabian & Russell, 1974) in environmental psychology. According to the SOR theory, the path from environmental stimulus to behavioral response goes through people's internal states, such as primary emotional responses. In other words, when people received the environmental stimulus during the COVID-19 outbreak (the COVID-19 risk), they first reacted with internal processes (induced emotional state). They then responded to the uncertain risk (trusting and sharing the COVID-19 information) in a sequential manner.",

It is easy to detect that a lot of the COVID-19 information online was about recommendations to prevent people from infecting (Tangcharoensathien et al., 2020) . Therefore, we consider that people with heightened emotionality showed increasing belief in and sharing intention for both true and false COVID-19 information could be explained as a protective behavior. Our results also supported the review argument by Scheufele and Krause (2019) that heightened emotionality would make people trust and share more about the information that they want to believe. Our hypothesis that both positive and negative emotions would associate with truth discernment was partially supported. For the truth discernment regarding accuracy judgment, we found that negative rather than positive emotion mediated the relation between the COVID-19 risk and accuracy discernment. People from regions with a higher level of COVID-19 risk displayed stronger negative feelings, which related to a lower accuracy discernment between facts and misinformation. However, the resource allocation model (Ellis & Ashbrook, 1988) assuming that negative emotions would play a similar role as positive emotions in vulnerability to misinformation could not account for these results. Furthermore, although we observed different truth discernment results between the negative and positive emotions, our results also rejected the assimilative-accommodative model (Bless & Fiedler, 2006) . The negative relation between negative emotion and accuracy discernment in the present study denies that negative emotion would provoke analytic thinking as found in other studies (e.g., Forgas & East, 2008) . To measure the level of COVID-19 risk that people might experience locally, we applied the epidemiological index to represent it in the present study. A higher level of COVID-19 risk would undoubtedly associate with stronger negative feelings. Therefore, we would argue that it is reasonable that negative emotions played a dominant role in influencing people's judgment during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

However, for the information sharing intention, its measurement in the present study mixed with the situation that people are too careful to share the information even for that they trust. In such cases, the reason why they do not share the information is not that they could not distinguish facts from misinformation. On the contrary, they might have already demonstrated truth discernment between facts and misinformation. To confirm the existence of this phenomenon, we further examined the percentage of news headlines that were judged as very accurate but assigned to no sharing intention for the associated information (see Table S14 in the Supplementary Materials). The results showed that there were 10.5% false headlines and 7.9% true headlines that people judged as very accurate but still chose not to share. Besides, information sharing involves social interactions and would highly depend on with whom people share, the information content, as well as the motivation of sharing, such as being kind, knowledgeable, etc. It might also be attributable simply to personal preferences . Therefore, it is appropriate that negative emotion served as a mediator on the relation between the COVID-19 risk and accuracy discernment rather than between the COVID-19 risk and sharing discernment.",

First, in the survey, sharing intentions were always asked after headline accuracy, which might introduce an \"accuracy nudge\" prior to sharing choice and impact participants' sharing decisions . Therefore, while the accuracy judgments were reliable in this study, the results of sharing intention would require cautious interpretation. Future research should measure sharing decisions separately. Second, information sharing intention measured in the present study could not distinguish two common sharing motivations. People might share misinformation to correct misinformation, and others might share misinformation because they could not discern between facts and misinformation accurately. Though there was evidence showing that self-reported sharing intention collected via online surveys was associated with actual shares on Twitter (Mosleh et al., 2020) , the particular motivation of sharing had always been ignored and should be considered in future misinformation studies to help understand the spread of online misinformation more accurately. Third, we measured individuals' emotional states after the news headlines exposure and evaluation questions in the survey. It was likely that the news headlines could have impacted the measured emotional states. However, it is worth noting that we instructed participants to report their feelings during the past few days as the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotions was enduring (Gruber et al., 2021) . This instruction might help mitigate the potential influence of news headlines on emotional states. Nevertheless, future studies are recommended to counterbalance the order of measures of emotion and information exposure to eliminate the potential influence. Fourth, because of the timeliness of the COVID-19 information during the outbreak, we could not perform a pretest for the news headlines. However, we selected the true and false news headlines from the same websites, and our findings were robust after controlling for the familiarity of the news headlines. Fifth, over 70% of participants in our sample at least had a college degree. The proportion is much higher than that among the average citizens in China. However, this group of people is active users of social media. Given that misinformation spreads widely on social media (Wang et al., 2019) , studying this population for infodemic management seems to be crucial. Nevertheless, different samples are still needed in future studies to assess the generalizability of our findings. Sixth, we calculated the estimates of COVID-19 risk with province-level data in this study. This particular choice was because no complete data was available for us to use at each specific administrative division (e.g., city level). However, we expect to have complete city-level data in the future to confirm influences of the infectious disease and emotional responses on accuracy judgment and sharing intention for misinformation. Finally, because the truth discernment score was at the individual level, analyses regarding truth discernment had to use aggregated scores rather than item-level scores. However, using the aggregate item-level scores as individual-level scores would likely produce biased standard errors and inflate type-I errors.",
