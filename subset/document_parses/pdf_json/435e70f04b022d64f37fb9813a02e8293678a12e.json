We designed a survey to estimate HPV vaccination coverage and understand factors associated with HPV vaccination among American Indian adolescents aged 9 to 17 years in Cherokee Nation, United States.

This process paper provides an overview of the survey development. We focus on the collaborative process of a tribal-academic partnership and discuss methodological decisions regarding survey sampling, measures, testing, and administration.",

From 2013 to 2017, the incidence of HPV-associated cancers nationally was 1.2 times higher in American Indian and Alaska Native (15.9 per 100,000) than non-Hispanic White (13.7 per 100,000) women [1] . In addition, during the same period, regional variations in HPV-associated cancers among American Indian and Alaska Native populations have been observed, with the highest incidence of all HPV-associated cancers among males (14.9 per 100,000) and cervical cancer among females (13.8 per 100,000) reported in the Southern Plains (Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas) [1] . In Oklahoma, American Indian and Alaska Native women had the highest age-adjusted incidence rate for cervical cancer (14.8 per 100,000 women) among all racial and ethnic groups. This incidence rate was significantly higher than the rate in White (rate ratio [RR]: 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 1.8) and African American (RR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.8) women [2] .",

However, data on HPV vaccination coverage for individual American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are not readily available. In addition, patterns and policies for vaccination among American Indian and Alaska Native populations differ. For example, in a survey of HPV vaccination policies among American Indian tribes in Washington State, 25% of the facilities serving tribal members had a clinic-only policy, 4% had a tribal-only policy, 18% had both clinic and tribal policies, and 46% had no policy [4] . While tribal policies regarding HPV vaccine administration followed guidelines from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), some clinics followed guidelines from the ACIP, Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, or Washington State [4] . Examples of differing clinic policies included providing the HPV vaccine unless the family opted out, developing a standing order protocol to enable nurses to administer the vaccine without a physician's order, and offering vaccines to 19-to-26-year-olds who may not meet the VFC eligibility criteria [4] . Similar to differences in HPV-associated cancer burden, these variations in policies likely result in regionaland tribal-dependent differences in HPV vaccination coverage. Furthermore, the lack of tribal-specific or missing estimates for HPV vaccination likely hinders the opportunity to monitor trends and improve coverage in their tribal communities.",

Our survey was designed to estimate HPV vaccination coverage and assess factors associated with vaccination for American Indian adolescents aged 9 to 17 years in Cherokee Nation. By understanding vaccination factors, this survey will provide information to guide interventions and policies aimed towards improving HPV vaccine initiation and completion among Cherokee Nation adolescents (CONSIDER statement #17).",

In response to data inequities, Native nations are working towards advancing Indigenous data sovereignty and governance. Indigenous data sovereignty is \"the right of a nation to govern the collection, ownership, and application of its own data\" [50] . In a Tribal Data Practices Survey conducted by the National Congress of American Indians in 2017, responses representing 122 tribes revealed that 83% indicated that it was extremely important for tribes to collect or access data on their tribal citizens for governance purposes [49] . In the same survey, health (57%) was one of the most frequently identified need areas for more or better data on their tribal members [49] . Our survey represents a small effort among the numerous initiatives of data sovereignty and governance at Cherokee Nation. This project could provide guidance for other indigenous populations on how to conduct their research and evaluation projects to understand the health of their communities. Further, this project may guide academic and other research-based institutions on working with tribal entities and facilitate research and evaluation projects that are tribally directed and engaged. This may lead to better implementation of interventions aimed at improving the health and well-being of indigenous populations.",

First, we plan to estimate HPV vaccination coverage for American Indian adolescents based on self-reported data provided by the parents. As a result, parental reports may under-or over-estimate the number of doses or shots received. However, previous studies have shown high concordance [51, 52] , indicating that parental reports of HPV vaccination status may be reasonably accurate. Second, and closely related, we rely on parental recall for HPV vaccination factors, which may vary depending on the time elapsed and information regarding the adolescents' immunization, among other factors. Third, self-reported responses are subject to social desirability bias and may not correlate with actual or future behaviors, such as the intention to receive the HPV vaccine. However, we tried to minimize any resulting bias by assuring the participants in the consent letter that their responses were confidential. Fourth, we anticipate low response rates based on prior surveys of HPV vaccination [53, 54] , but have provided an incentive for participation, sent an advance letter, and mailed a reminder letter to mitigate nonresponse. In addition, we will adjust for nonresponse in our analysis. Fifth, due to the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and response, participants' attitudes and perceptions regarding the COVID-19 vaccine may evolve and not reflect the current reasons for vaccination. Lastly, we asked parents to select only the main reason for vaccinating or not vaccinating their child. Some parents may have had multiple reasons; however, capturing the main reasons allowed us to identify the most important reasons.",
