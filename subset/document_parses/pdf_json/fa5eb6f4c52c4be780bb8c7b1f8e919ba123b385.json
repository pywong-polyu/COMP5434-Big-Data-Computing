We report here two female patients admitted to Assiut University Hospitals/Egypt during the period from first of July to August 10, 2020. Both presented with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nasopharyngeal swab, elevated serum d-dimer and ferritin levels, and bilateral ground glass appearance in a CT chest scan. The first was a 60-year-old female with acute onset of flaccid paraplegia 10 days after flu-like symptoms, in whom MRI revealed transverse myelitis. The second was a 21-year-old female with symptoms of acute quadriplegia, fever, headache, and anosmia in whom an MRI scan revealed long cervico-thoracic myelopathy. Anterior spinal artery occlusion and possibly transverse myelitis were considered as differential diagnosis of long segment myelopathy.",

One day later, she developed weakness and numbness of both upper limbs with retention of urine and fecal incontinence. Autonomic symptoms included fluctuations of heart rate with frequent attacks of palpitation, and dizziness and fainting upon sitting from recumbent position. She had received no vaccinations in previous months, and there was no history of a previous similar attack.

Pain and temperature sensation was absent up to the C4 level with preserved touch, vibration, and joint position sense. Laboratory tests: SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in a nasopharyngeal swab, and serum D-dimer (4.6 mg/L) and ferritin (502 ng/mL) were elevated.

A CT of the chest showed no evidence of aortic dissection with normal heart and symmetrical blood pressure in both arms. Thus, we think it unlikely that the lesion was the result of aortic dissection-related occlusion of multiple supplying arteries. Given her age, multiple sclerosis was considered as a possible diagnosis. However, the long segment of cord involvement, together with the normal evoked potentials and no positive MRI findings in the brain, excluded multiple sclerosis. The possibility of transverse myelitis was also considered as a differential diagnosis of long segment myelopathy; however, the complete preservation of deep sensation on clinical examination could support the diagnosis of anterior spinal artery occlusion.",

Although the pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear, there are two likely possibilities: hematogenous dissemination (9) and neuronal retrograde dissemination (10) . The first requires the presence of virus in the blood, where it can infect the endothelium. In contrast, neuronal retrograde dissemination occurs when the virus infects sensory or motor nerve endings and is transported retrogradely or anterogradely into the CNS (11, 12).

Yet, as she presented clinically with characteristic features of acute paralysis of four limbs with loss of pain and temperature together with preserved dorsal column function and MRI findings of bilateral involvement of the anterior 2/3 of spinal cord, we considered the possibility of anterior spinal artery occlusion. Diffusion MRI would be helpful to confirm such diagnosis at early onset. Unfortunately, an MRI scan was only available at a later stage for this patient. Although the extensive longitudinal involvement along the cord (as shown in our case) is most frequently associated with large vessel dissection, other causes of thromboembolism and coagulopathy also have been shown to be associated with long segment involvement (17) .",
