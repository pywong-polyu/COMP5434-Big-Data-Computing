Methods: a cross-sectional design was used. A probabilistic sampling by twostage conglomerates was carried out. Data were collected from a self-administered questionnaire and a blood sample for antibody identification. The COVIDAR IgG and IgM test were used. RESULTS: 738 health workers were included; the overall response rate was 73.80%. 71.83% of that were women; age showed a normal distribution. Nurses and doctors accounted for more than half of the staff. 75.86% of people claimed to always use Personal Protective Equipment. 5.61% of people had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. 4.60% of people had previously had a nasopharyngeal swab with a negative result. Five workers had positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 (four women and one man) with negative IgM.",

We stress the need to complement passive epidemiological surveillance strategies with serological monitoring in health workers.",

The fieldwork done in order to obtain the required data for the sampling frame implied a great effort on the part of the research team since the information available was not integrated in only one database and had to be developed. In this regard, we highlight the need to improve the health care information systems in Argentina to allow for the possibility to access appropriate records.",

The sensitivity determined in patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was 74% in the first 3 weeks from symptom onset and, at least, 91% in samples taken after 21 days from symptom onset.
