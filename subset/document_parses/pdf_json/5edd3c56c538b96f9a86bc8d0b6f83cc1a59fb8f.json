Targeted temperature management (TTM) remains the only neuroprotective strategy, although its effectiveness remains controversial [9] . Maintaining an adequate CBF and cerebral oxygen delivery appears an appealing strategy [10] . Although it is recommended to keep mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg, such target may not guarantee an adequate cerebral perfusion in CA patients. In fact, pressure-cerebral autoregulation (CAR), which is an active mechanisms that maintains a constant CBF through changes in the diameter of cerebral arterioles within a wide range (i.e., 50-150 mmHg) of MAP in healthy individuals [11] , might be altered after an acute illness [12] [13] [14] . As such, changes in MAP would lead to directly proportional modifications in CBF, with the risk of either cerebral hypoperfusion or hyperemia. Altered CAR has been reported in CA patients [7, 8, [15] [16] [17] and associated with poor outcome [8, 15] . However, some of these studies were conducted before of the TTM era and differed in methods to assess CAR.",

Data were compared using Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test or Fisher Exact test as appropriate. Difference in Mxa values among CPC groups was tested by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis. Correlation between Mxa and NSE was assessed using Spearman coefficient. In the multivariable analyses, considering the limited number of events, the predictor variables that were highly collinear within and across outcome and the risk of overfitting, we constructed predictive models for each outcome using tenfold cross validation with penalized logistic regression [23] (providing odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals) and, as a sensitivity analysis, using generalized linear model via regularized regression with elastic net. Elastic net regression is controlled by two parameters, (1) alpha, which sets the degree of mixing between two extremes of regularized regression, and (2) lambda, defining the strength of regularization [24] . Linearity of the continuous variables with respect to the logit of the dependent variable was assessed via the Box-Tidwell procedure. Presence of outliers were assessed by studentized residuals. Collinearity between variables was assessed by variance inflation factor. All test are two tailed and the statistical significance was set at the 5% level.",

However, whether altered CAR is a marker of brain injury or a contributing factor to outcome remains unclear; CAR was preserved early after CA, while altered in non-survivors and patients with UO at NT. Moreover, Mxa values at NT correlated with the highest NSE values during ICU stay, generally obtained 48-72 h after injury [26] . These findings suggest that altered CAR might result in altered cerebral perfusion inducing secondary brain damage in these patients. In previous studies, lower limit of CAR was right-shifted and the range of effective CAR narrowed after CA [7, 8, 15] . Furthermore, although the association between maintenance of MAP within CAR range and neurological recovery has not be determined [27] , the amount of time spent at MAP outside CAR ranges has been associated with UO [8] . As MAP didn't differ between HT and NT nor at NT between groups of patients with different outcomes, assessing autoregulation to individualize MAP values according to Mxa values rather than targeting predefined MAP targets (i.e., > 65 mmHg) may be beneficial in clinical settings.",

            "text": "The mechanisms underlying the impairment of CAR after CA are unclear, but involvement of cerebral vasculature is likely. During the first 12 h after CA, vascular resistances are often increased, while they decrease 24 h from resuscitation (i.e., secondary hyperemia) with CBF returning to normal values after 24 h from CA [28] [29] [30] . After 24 h from CA, low cerebrovascular resistances and high CBF have been associated with poor prognosis [31, 32] . In this study, abnormal Mxa values were more likely to be observed during NT. The vasodilation that accompanies the late hyperemic response could be responsible of the reduced vasoactive tone and loss of response to BP fluctuations, i.e., loss of CAR. Experimental studies suggest that moderate decrease in core body temperature might be associated to an extended range of CAR [33] . Lavinio et al. showed that rewarming was associated with altered CAR in 24 patients cooled for refractory intracranial hypertension following TBI [34] . An inverse correlation between temperature and effectiveness of CAR has been suggested in CA patients treated with TTM targeting either 33 \u00b0C, 36 \u00b0C or not treated with TTM [25] . Given the association between time and temperature in this study, it is not possible to infer whether the modifications in CAR are associated to the progression of brain damage or to the effect of temperature on brain homeostasis. No specific studies on the role of TTM on CAR in CA patients has been performed so far. However, a potential protective role of TTM on preserving the reactivity of brain vasculature after anoxic brain injury cannot be excluded. These findings should, therefore, increase the awareness of clinicians on the importance of an accurate management of temperature after rewarming from moderate hypothermia, as this might have an impact on cerebral perfusion. Future studies comparing patients with or without TTM after CA are necessary to understand the role of temperature on CAR in CA patients. Regulation of CBF is a complex phenomenon, which depends on the interaction between metabolism and pressure regulation. Neuronal metabolism is probably the chief drive in modifying CBF, while the myogenic mechanism keeps CBF constant in case of modifications in cerebral perfusion pressure [35] . Data on CAR in case of altered metabolic demand are not univocal. Epileptic activity increases the diameter of the vessel supplying spiking neurons, thus increasing CBF [36] . Altered CAR has been documented in patients with seizures [37] and animal models showed persistent alteration in CAR after epileptic generalized activity [38] . On the opposite, CAR was intact in sedated patients with refractory status epilepticus [39] and during propofol-induced burst-suppression [40] ; no specific data on CAR and burst-suppression secondary to severe brain damage has been reported so far. In our cohort, burst-suppression on EEG correlated with higher Mxa at NT. Whether altered CAR is a reflection of deranged metabolism or severe brain damage cannot be determined. Major strengths of this study are the analysis of a relatively large cohort of patients and the use of a validated approach to assess CAR through spontaneous oscillations in MAP [41] . We systematically evaluated Mxa during HT and at NT, suggesting that time assessment is crucial to understand the role of CAR in CA patients. We should acknowledge also some limitations.",

Therefore, we cannot exclude an overestimation of altered CAR in our patients due to the possibility of MAP falling outside the individual range of CAR. Altered CAR at NT could be secondary to an increase in intracranial pressure, which was not directly measured in this study. Cerebral autoregulation may be affected by several factors, such as modifications in the intracranial arteries diameter due to the effect of carbon dioxide arterial partial pressure. However, 45/50 (90%) of patients in our cohort had PaCO 2 in the physiological range of 30-50 mmHg and no relationship was found Table 3 Penalized logistic regression cross validation of predictive models",

Cardioactive medications: noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and/or dobutamine [42, 43] . Finally, given the lack of published data on CAR in cardiac arrest patients, we could not properly calculate the sample size of this study and a convenient cohort of 50 patients was selected for this exploratory analysis. All patients who had CPC 5 at 3 months because of brain death or death by other cause were included in non-survivors and unfavourable outcome group. However, multi-organ failure was the cause of death in 8/31 patients (26%). Multi-organ failure refers to a condition, where more than one organ, system or apparatus is failing, including the brain. In such patients, diagnosis of brain death was not initiated due to the critical general condition. In addition, we only analyzed one fourth of CA patients admitted to our ICU, although most of exclusion criteria were reasonable, and the small sample size may bias statistical modeling. However, the possibility of small sample size bias and overfitting were limited by our modelling [44, 45] . Nevertheless, caution is advisable with regard to generalizability of our results, which should be confirmed in larger cohort.",
