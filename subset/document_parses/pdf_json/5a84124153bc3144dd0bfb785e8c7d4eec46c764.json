These variants are getting challenging to contain from spreading worldwide. Because of these variants, the second wave has started in various countries and is threatening human civilization. Thus, we require efficient vaccines that can combat all emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we took the initiative to develop a peptide-based next-generation vaccine using four variants (Wuhan variant, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.28) that could potentially combat SARS-CoV-2 variants. We applied a series of computational tools, servers, and software to identify the most significant epitopes present on the mutagenic regions of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The immunoinformatics approaches were used to identify common B cell derived T cell epitopes, influencing the host immune system. Consequently, to develop a novel vaccine candidate, the antigenic epitopes were linked with a flexible and stable peptide linker, and the adjuvant was added at the Nterminal end. 3D vaccine candidate structure was refined, and quality was assessed using web servers. The physicochemical properties and safety parameters of the vaccine construct were assessed through bioinformatics and immunoinformatics tools. The molecular docking analysis between TLR4/MD2 and the proposed vaccine candidate demonstrated a satisfactory interaction. The molecular dynamics studies confirmed the stability of the vaccine candidate. Finally, we optimized the proposed vaccine through codon optimization and in silico cloning to study the expression. Our multi-epitopic next-generation peptide vaccine construct can boost immunity against the Wuhan variant and all significant mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2.",

Galloway et al. reported SARS-CoV-2 variant lineage B.1.1.7 as a significant cause of concern in the United Kingdom (UK) [11, 12] . The 501Y.V2 or B.1.351 lineage first emerged in the Nelson Mandela Bay area of Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, and different locations in Eastern and Western Cape Provinces [9, 13] . Another important SARS-CoV-2 variant with 17 unique mutations was reported from Brazil. In this variant, one out of ten mutations is in spike glycoprotein. Among them, mutations that have been designated to be of particular concern are N501Y, K417T, and E484K [14] .

Therefore, the structural changes in spike glycoprotein (S-protein) through mutation impact viral functions and harms immunization programs. Furthermore, the mutant variants affect the neutralizing antibodies; hence a modified next-generation vaccine candidate using alternative epitopes is urgently required against these three threatening variants and the Wuhan variant. This study aims to design a multi-epitope peptidebased vaccine using alternative epitopes of these four variants that could efficiently elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses. Our vaccine development strategies using immunoinformatics and bioinformatics approaches are fast, precise, cost-effective, and reliable against pathogens [19, 20] . Therefore, we carried out several immunoinformatics studies to identify B cell, Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and Helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes from the S proteins of all four variants (Wuhan variant and other three newly emerged variants). We also combined adjuvants and PADRE sequence at the N-terminal of protein vaccine candidate having the most promising common B cell and T cell (CTL and HTL) epitope along with suitable peptide linker. Furthermore, we have calculated the vaccine candidate's antigenicity and physicochemical properties through bioinformatics and immunoinformatics approaches. The modeled 3D vaccine structure was docked against the TLR4/MD2 complex to ensure its efficacy of inducing an immune response [21] . Additionally, the docked complex was validated and analyzed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By using immune simulation profiling, we also assessed the vaccine candidate's immune response on its administration to the human body and calculated the extent of elevation of primary and secondary immunoglobulin. Subsequently, we performed in silico cloning to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the proposed vaccine candidate. Our study tried to generate a potential and effective vaccine candidate against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and provide a platform for future researchers to develop a suitable next-generation peptide-based vaccine against the Wuhan and all significant mutant variants of this virus to resist the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Furthermore, to boost the immunity, CTxB adjuvant was attached to the N-terminal of the chimeric sequences by an EAAAK linker to the vaccine candidate. CTxB is the nontoxic segment (124 amino acids long) of cholera toxin that can provoke cellular and humoral immune responses [33] . Finally, an additional PADRE sequence (AKFVAA WTLKAAA) with 13 amino acids was added at Cterminal to improve immunogenicity within the host body [34] . The graphical representation of the constructed vaccine is shown in Figure 2 . ",

Among 17 CTL epitopes, 2 unique CTL epitopes are present in B.1.351 lineage, and 5 unique CTL epitopes are present in the B.1.1.7 lineage. The 4 CTL epitopes, such as SQCVNLTTR, NIADYNYKL, FQPTYGVGY, SPGSASSVA are common epitopes that are present in the B.1.1.28 lineage and other variants (Table 2 ). However, the SQCVNLTTR epitope is not present in the B.1.351 lineage due to mutation of L>F. However, this epitope is present in the other three variants. Two 9-mer epitopes (NIADYNYKL and SPGSASSVA) are present only in B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 lineage but are absent in the other two variants. Another 9mer epitope (FQPTYGVGY) was identified from the other three newly emerging lineage, but the epitope is not present in the Wuhan variant (Table  3) . Nevertheless, all these identified epitopes are not always common for all variants. The same techniques were employed for the identification and characterization of the common and variants HTL epitopes. Finally, we identified a significant 6 HTL (15-mer epitopes) from all variants. A total of 23 epitopes (17 CTL and 6 HTL) were considered for the final vaccine construct. The VaxiJen score of the CTL epitopes was calculated and is tabulated in Table 2 . ",

Subsequently, servers calculated the allergenicity of C1 and compared it with our designed vaccine candidate to support the designed vaccine safety and non-allergenic characteristic. The server predicted the physicochemical properties of the vaccine (Supplementary Table 1 ). The vaccine construct was found to be basic (8.98) in nature. It was observed that the theoretical Isoelectric point of the vaccine was 8.98, and it possesses a molecular weight (MW) of 52.306 KDa. GRAVY was estimated to be -0.168, the negative GRAVY value indicating the vaccine protein might be hydrophilic in nature. The hydrophilic nature of the protein should assist in the easy purification and formulation of the vaccine. Thermo-stability (Aliphatic index) of the vaccine was found to be 76. 18 . In addition, the half-life was calculated >30 hours, >20 hours, and >10 hours in mammalian reticulocytes (in vitro), yeast (in vivo), and E. coli (in vivo), respectively. The instability index (II) was computed and was noted as 23.36. It indicates a stable vaccine construct. The final vaccine candidate was compared with the positive control (C1), and a comparison of the physicochemical properties is recorded in Table 4 . It appeared that the primary sequence of vaccine candidates has a better result in comparison with the positive control. The final vaccine construct showed suitable physicochemical properties like hydrophilicity, stability, and increased immunogenicity. At the same time, the decreased probable side effects informed us that the vaccine candidate is safer for further administration. SOPMA analysis predicted the secondary structure values like the alpha helix, extended strand, beta-turn, and random coil as 43.42%, 20.88%, 5.01%, and 30.69%, respectively (Fig. 7A, B) . The server was calculated with a window width value of 17. We have fixed the similarity threshold value to 8. In this case, we considered four numbers of states. Moreover, the Protein-Sol server calculated the solubility of the vaccine construct, which was found to be soluble (0.316) in the basic of scaled solubility value (QuerySol) (Fig. 7C ).",

The levels of IgM+IgG immunoglobulin were radically rising after the administration of the vaccine candidate, and prolonged immune responses were observed against SARS-CoV-2 by the high titers of IgG and IgM immunoglobulin (primary immune responses). Furthermore, the C1 positive control was used for comparative assessment of the vaccine candidate immune simulation (Fig. 15A) . A high resemblance was shown between the immune simulation results of the C1 and our next-generation vaccine construct ( Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 ). The innate immunity of the host body (after administration of vaccine) along with B cell population in both acting and resting phase was found to be increased with B isotype IgM and B-memory cell. It might scale up to 600-700 cells/mm 3 ( Fig. 16B and C) . The control shows a similar type of increment of B isotype IgM and B-memory cells ( Fig. 15B and C) . Moreover, the elevation of CTL cells reached a maximum of 1117 cells/mm 3 after ~8 days of vaccine immunization and gradually decreased after 25 days (Fig. 16D) . Additionally, at the state of the active and resting phase, the T cell populations showed great diversity in their cell population (Fig. 16E ). C1 shows a similar level of CTL cell elevation both in the active and resting phase, represented in Figure 15d -15e. In response to both control and the vaccine, elevated HTL cells (both active and resting phases) play a key role in the establishment of adaptive immunity against virus infections. Subsequently, the elevated HTL cells generated a high number of memory cells (Fig. 15F , G and 16F and G). Memory cells play a vital role in regulating and preventing viral infection/reinfection through selfmemorization upon encountering pathogens. The administration of both C1 and designed vaccine successfully elevated other central regulators of the immune system (cytokines, interleukins, and NK cells) (Fig. 15H-15L and 16H-16L ). This comparative study signifies the designed vaccine as a potent next-generation vaccine for eliciting a robust immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. ",

As the structure-function is the impact of the nonspecific mutations, the emergence of these three new variants is of urgent concern; it would likely impact key functionalities associated with COVID-19 infection, including disease severity, transmissibility, and diagnostic sensitivity along with specificity and vaccine-induced protection. Although some vaccines have already been approved for the COVID-19 Wuhan variant, no vaccine is available to protect the mutant variants and the Wuhan variant. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a next-generation vaccine to provide comprehensive protection against all these variants. This study designed a next-generation multi-epitope peptide vaccine targeting the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, covering all the three significant variants' epitopes along with the Wuhan variant epitopes. Our vaccine construct has considered all significant mutations such K417N, T716I, S982A, N501Y, D118H, A570D, L18F, D614G, T1027I, P681H, H655Y, E484K, D215G, L18F, and K41N. For generating a multi-epitope peptide vaccine, B cell-derived T cell epitopes were identified, which can provide a robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Our vaccine construct comprises 17 (9mer) CTL epitopes and 6 HTL epitopes (15mer) and is 479 amino acids long due to the addition of adjuvant CTxB, PADRE sequence, and a peptide linker. The adjuvant was also joined with the EAAAK linker at the N-terminal of the vaccine construct, which was merged for active separation of a bifunctional fusion protein [67] . The EAAAK linker was joined with the PADRE sequence. The PADRE sequence act as a helper T cell epitope which is significant for enhancing CTL responses of different antigens. Moreover, GPGPG and KK linkers were fused with CTL and HTL epitopes, respectively.",

The negative docking scores of both TLR4/MD2 with control and TLR4/MD2 vaccine candidates illustrated that the vaccine construct has similar binding interaction properties with the TLR4/MD2 complex. It implies that the vaccine can trigger TLR4 activation and enhance immune responses against a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The free binding energy of the vaccine and TLR4/MD2 complex is -113.47 kcal/mol, which indicates an excellent binding affinity between the immune sensing (TLR4) receptor and the vaccine model.

The maximum peaks were observed at ~1.6 nm in the plot, indicating highly flexible regions in the complex (Fig. 10B) . The NMA study was performed to analyze the molecular motion, comparative deformability, and B factor with PDB value.

Furthermore, the secondary response created by the vaccine was significantly higher than the primary response. Finally, the SnapGene cloning software was performed to amplify the desired vaccine sequence within the pET28b (+) expression vector for large-scale production.

The vaccine construct can stimulate a good immune response, as confirmed by immunoinformatics. Therefore, our developed next-generation vaccine construct can provide a wide range of protection against all the significant variants of SARS-CoV-2. However, in vitro and in vivo validation is required to ensure the vaccine construct efficacy through animal models and human clinical trials. This designed vaccine candidate might contribute to controlling the next COVID-19 wave and the pandemic situation on a global scale.",
