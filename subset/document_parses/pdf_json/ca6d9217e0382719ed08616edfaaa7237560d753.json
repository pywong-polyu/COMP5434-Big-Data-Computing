Wave 1 hazard ratios for adults on the learning disability register (adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and geographical location) were 5.3 (95% confidence interval 4.9 to 5.8) for covid-19 related hospital admission and 8.2 (7.2 to 9.4) for covid-19 related death. Wave 2 produced similar estimates. Associations were stronger among those classified as having severe to profound learning disability, and among those in residential care. For both waves, Down's syndrome and cerebral palsy were associated with increased hazards for both events; Down's syndrome to a greater extent. Hazard ratios for noncovid deaths followed similar patterns with weaker associations. Similar patterns of increased relative risk were seen for children, but covid-19 related deaths and hospital admissions were rare, reflecting low event rates among children.",

            "text": "As of February 2021, the Learning from Death Reviews programme reported that 1405 people with a learning disability had died from covid-19 in England since February 2020. 2 The true number is probably far higher because of gaps in learning disability registration. The latest estimates from 2015 suggest that 23% of people with learning disability are included on the learning disability register. 1 Emerging evidence from the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom showed that people with learning disability were at higher risk from mortality 3-7 than people in the general population. For instance, the Oxford RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network reported an odds ratio of 1.96 (95% confidence interval 1.22 to 3.18) for mortality during the first wave of infection in the UK among people with learning disability compared with those without. 4 People with Down's syndrome might be at particularly high risk; an analysis of primary care data from eight million adults reported a hazard ratio of 10.4 (7.1 to 15.2) for covid-19 death associated with Down's syndrome. 8 However, existing studies on the association of learning disability with severe outcomes from covid-19 do not include the second wave of the pandemic. Additionally, these studies frequently adjusted for variables that might be partly a consequence of the learning disability, such as deprivation and comorbidities, complicating interpretation of the results. 4 A lack of clarity also exists on the increased risk of covid-19 deaths among people with milder learning disability, and this aspect needs exploration. 9 The higher risk of premature death among people with learning disability in England is well known 1 10 and triggered the establishment of general practice learning disability registers to allow for better provision of their healthcare. A number of mechanisms exist which could increase the risk of covid-19 mortality in this group. People with learning disability have a higher prevalence of covid-19 mortality risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, epilepsy, and poverty. [11] [12] [13] Medical conditions underlying the learning disability might confer additional risk; for instance, people with Down's syndrome are more vulnerable to impaired cellular immunity, congenital heart disease, and respiratory conditions. 14 15 Many people with learning disability in England live in residential care or supported accommodation, or receive community based social care 16 ; therefore, they have frequent contact with carers and other care recipients, and face challenges in physical distancing. Difficulties understanding the protective measures needed, compounded by a lack of accessible information, further increase the vulnerability of this group to infection. 17 Healthcare access and quality, including prevention and treatment, are frequently worse for people with learning disability, leading to avoidable deaths. 10 Treatment failures, 10 including do not resuscitate orders, 18 might increase their risk of death once infected.",

For each of these variables, previous research into their recording in UK primary care records suggested that multiple imputation would not be appropriate because the assumption that the data are missing at random is not met: for example, people who are underweight and overweight will be more likely to have their body mass index recorded in primary care 25 ; serum creatinine measurement typically reflects monitoring because of underlying risk factors for chronic kidney disease or a known diagnosis 26 ; and social disparities in monitoring of HbA 1c among people with diabetes. 27 People with missing body mass index were assumed to be nonobese. People with no serum creatinine measurement were included in the category \"no evidence of poor kidney function,\" an approach which has been found to produce prevalence estimates of chronic kidney disease comparable to those from other sources. 28 When categorising people with diabetes according to glycaemic control, those with no HbA 1c measurement were included in a separate group \"diabetes, no Hba1c\" as an indicator for diabetes with poorly monitored glycaemic control.",

Higher risks remained among those on the learning disability register who do not have Down's syndrome or cerebral palsy compared with the general population. This observation is not explained by measured physical comorbidities or residential care status. After we excluded people who were prioritised for vaccination (first six groups of the phase 1 vaccination priority list in England due to age or comorbidities), those on the learning disability register still had a substantially increased risk of covid-19 related hospital admission. We also observed a higher risk of non-covid deaths in people with learning disability, though associations were weaker than for covid-19 related deaths. This finding is in contrast to most other risk factors that appear to have a similar magnitude of association with covid-19 related deaths and non-covid deaths. 30 Findings in context Our findings are consistent with the existing literature, yet make an important contribution by including outcomes from the second wave of the pandemic and by showing the importance of the learning disability register in identifying people for vaccination prioritisation. The Oxford RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network, which includes 4.4 million people who are nationally representative of the population in England, reported twofold higher mortality rates among people with learning disability (odds ratio 1.96, 95% confidence interval 1.22 to 3.18, P<0.01) after extensive adjustment. 4 Public Health England used different sources of data and estimated that, up to June 2020, the mortality rate in people with learning disability was approximately 6.3-fold higher than that of the general population. 31 Data from Scotland also showed that adults with intellectual disabilities had higher rates of covid-19 infection, severe infection, and mortality. 5 Increased risks remained after adjusting for age, sex, and deprivation (standardised severe infection ratio: 2.59, 95% confidence interval 1.80 to 3.39; standardised mortality ratio 3.20, 2.1 to 4.25). Higher mortality rates among people with learning disability have also been reported in Wales, 6 New York State, 7 and the United States more broadly. 3 Not only are death rates higher for people with learning disability, but deaths occur at younger ages. 3 8 9 31 The increased mortality rates among younger people with learning disability observed in our study have also been reported in the US. 3 The younger age at death among people with learning disability is also well established for noncovid deaths. 10 The high risk for people with Down's syndrome was shown for the first wave by Clift and colleagues by using the QResearch population level primary care database 8 . In their cohort of eight million adults in England from January to June 2020, the age and sex adjusted hazard ratio for covid-19 death for adults with Down's syndrome versus those without was 24.94 (95% confidence interval 17.08 to 36.44) , which reduced to 10.39 (7.08 to 15.23) after extensive adjustment (deprivation, body mass index, cardiovascular, pulmonary and other disease, residential status, ethnicity). Data for cerebral palsy are more limited, but the QResearch analyses showed a higher mortality rate for this group (2.66, 1.62 to 4.36). Clift and colleagues obtained a fully adjusted hazard ratio of 1.27 (1.16 to 1.40) for covid-19 related death in those with learning disabilities other than Down's syndrome, in contrast to our higher estimates. This discrepancy is probably because of differences in adjustment. We chose not to adjust for many comorbidities, viewing most of them as consequences of the learning disability and therefore part of the causal pathway. In our analyses, children with learning disability had a higher risk of hospital admission for covid-19. Existing studies also indicate that children with learning disability are more likely to require hospital admission and critical care because of covid-19 outcomes. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] However, it is important to note that the absolute risk of covid-19 related hospital admission experienced by children on the learning disability register was low.",

Therefore, while we cannot quantify any differences in risk of covid-19 related deaths in children on the learning disability register, the absolute risk remains low.",

            "text": "The hazard ratios for covid-19 outcomes in our study attenuated after adjustment for deprivation. Residential status also partially explained the higher risks of severe covid-19 outcomes in people with learning disability. However, residential care for people with learning disability might not raise risk as much as in other care settings, perhaps because these facilities generally have fewer occupants. 31 An important driver appears to be comorbidities, reflecting the higher prevalence of these covid-19 risk factors among people with learning disability. 11 13 Comorbidities are also an important driver of increased risk of non-covid deaths. 10 However, large excess mortality rates remained after extensive adjustment, which is also apparent in previous studies. 8 This pattern implies that other drivers might be relevant, including inherent clinical vulnerabilities for people with certain conditions and concerns about healthcare quality, as also indicated by the higher case fatality rates among people with learning disability (Scotland: 30% v 24% 13 ; New York: 15.0% v 7.9% 7 ; US 18-74 year olds: 4.5% v 2.7% 3 ). Additional mechanisms might contribute to the high risk among people with Down's syndrome, including impaired cellular immunity. 15 Strengths and weaknesses Key strengths and weaknesses of the OpenSafely platform have been outlined previously. 12 An important strength in the current analyses is that the study is large, including the records of approximately 40% of the English population, which allows disaggregation by learning disability grouping. We used comprehensive data on participants from medical records, which allowed us to adjust analyses successively to explore mechanisms for the association of learning disability and adverse covid-19 outcomes. Additionally, we were able to assess excess risks for both waves of the covid-19 pandemic, in terms of hospital admission and mortality outcomes. We also considered children and adults.",

            "text": "This study also has important limitations. Substantial geographical variation exists in the choice of electronic health record system, 37 and so the population might not be fully nationally representative, although it is broadly representative in terms of ethnicity and deprivation. 12 Identifying everyone with a learning disability from medical records alone was not possible. For instance, the most recent data, from 2015, suggest that 23% of people with learning disability are included on registers. 1 The overall proportion of people on the learning disability register was 0.44% for England in 2015, slightly lower than the proportion in our study (0.63%); this potentially indicates an increase in coverage of the register in recent years. The reasons for under registration are unclear, but might include lack of perceived need and fear of stigma, among patients or clinicians. People on the learning disability register probably have more profound impairment and health conditions. For instance, in the current analyses 89% of people with Down's syndrome were on the register and had higher mortality rates than people with Down's syndrome who were not on the register. As a consequence, the hazard ratios might have been overestimated, although most of our sample had mild to moderate learning disability. Validation studies are not available for the Down's syndrome and cerebral palsy codelists, although they were reviewed by clinicians specialising in the care of people with learning disability. Our hospital admission data included only completed hospital admissions, therefore this outcome will have been under ascertained towards the end of the second wave. Defining hospital admission and death as covid-19 related depends on diagnosis, and validity of the outcome measure probably changed over time. If testing or clinical diagnosis of covid-19 differed for people with learning disability compared with the general population, this could have biased our estimates in either direction. Additionally, underlying health conditions could have been under ascertained in primary care records. Data were not available for epilepsy, which is a covid-19 risk factor and more common among people with learning disability. 11 13 We also had an incomplete, and probably underestimated, measure of residential care. 16 38 The consequences of do not resuscitate orders on the survival of people with learning disability have been raised as an area of concern, but we were not able to assess this impact in the current analyses. We did not have data on quality of treatment and so were not able to explore all our hypothesised pathways between learning disability and adverse covid-19 outcomes. Furthermore, these analyses focused only on severe covid-19 outcomes, and did not explore impacts on physical and mental health of people with learning disability, which probably occurred as a result of lockdown and other restrictions 32 and require mitigation. We focused on the general population and so our analyses explored the combination of infection and severe outcomes once infected, therefore we were unable to disentangle associations with those two steps in the process. However, focusing on infected people only would induce biases due to unrepresentative testing.",

The existing priority groups, including those with Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy or severe or profound learn ing disability, were extended to include all people on the learning disability register. This change was informed by a previous version of this analysis, which showed increased risk in people on the learning disability who were not already prioritised for vaccination. However, the current learning disability registers are incomplete, 1 and updating them would help to inform prioritisation programmes. Relying on codelists as an alternative to learning disability registers is not pragmatic for prioritisation given the large number of codes that are non-specific for learning disability. Many other countries (eg, Germany 39 and the US 40 ) currently focus on prioritising people living in care homes and those with Down's syndrome for vaccination, and should consider broadening this category to include other people with learning disability. Increased risks among children <16 years suggest that vaccination in this age group warrants further consideration. These data should also be used to inform future prioritisation for subsequent vaccination initiatives in England, and international vaccine prioritisation programmes. Besides vaccination, efforts should continue to protect people with learning disability from covid-19 adverse outcomes, including consideration of non-pharmacological interventions such as shielding, and ensuring adequate support to obtain prompt access to testing for covid-19 and to appropriate healthcare.",

However, using learning disability register data has highlighted the importance of public health surveillance and the need to develop indicators for disability. We used an indicator of care home residence to explore the extent to which this factor might mediate the association between learning disability and covid-19, but more detailed and accurate information on care home residence status is needed to understand how best to mitigate risk for people in residential care. More research is warranted on the excess covid-19 risks among people with Down's syndrome. Cerebral palsy includes people with a broad range of conditions and severity, and a deeper exploration of covid-19 risk for this group is needed.",
