They tend to occupy the largest portion of a zoological park primarily because of their spatial needs. Their variations in size, from quite small to very large, allows the zoo to display them in a wide range of exhibits, from small, box-like stalls to immense park-like settings often in mixed groupings. Their diversity, which ranges from the bizarre to the beautiful, gives them a strong appeal for the public.",

The temperament of the animals is a major consideration. A highly nervous individual is more difficult to establish than a calm one. Almost as a rule of thumb, the larger species tend to be less complicated than smaller ones; this generalisation is particularly applicable to the antelope and wild cattle.

I n some cases, relatively small original groups have blossomed and flourished; in others, even where substantial numbers have been brought in, we have failed to meet the needs of the animals and our attempt to establish them in captivity has not been a success. All too often in the past greater co-operation amongst zoos might have made a measurable difference as to whether the breeding programme succeeded or failed. Much of this earlier failure to work together, both in terms of the sharing of information and the management of the species as a total captive population, has been either moderated or eliminated. Co-operation is at an all-time high and recent successes with a number of species reflect that fact.",

When we acquire animals from the wild, it is usually impossible to be at the collecting site and exercise our own judgement on those specimens which would be the most suitable for our needs. The reality is that we must take what is available and have no idea of the particular animal's temperament or character until after it arrives. In addition, although the phenotype of the imported animals can be assessed, we can have no idea of their genotype. We may, for example, import two 68 and two 99 which in appearance are much alike, but we do not know whether they are related or unrelated. We know nothing of their characters or breeding potential. Only after they have been in the collection for a period of time can these be determined and only after successive generations and with the full co-operation of all zoos can comprehensive studbook records be formulated and maintained.",

When assessing the figures in Table 1 , it is important to bear in mind that they represent the state of the collections which contributed data for publication in that particular year. The totals given, especially for the smaller populations, can be greatly affected by the omission of one or two important holders. Another factor is that the inclusion of zoos which are situated within the animals' natural range and have easy access to new specimens without breeding them may give an unduly optimistic picture. This has been true of the chevrotains in some southeast Asian zoos and the brockets in some South American zoos. The general impressions which can be drawn from Table 1 , however, are in our assessment borne out by the study of the full annual data and the results of our own survey.",

It can be hypothesised that these animals may require more seclusion and sense of security than they are often allowed. DEER We looked at three representative groups in the family Cervidae, the Chinese water deer Hydropotes inermis, four Asiatic forms of the widespread Eurasian subfamily Cervinae and five species of New World deer.

The free-living herd at Whipsnade Park, for example, produced 50 young in 1982 and 166 in 1983. The difficulty of maintaining them in other types of collections lies in the fact that they tend to be highly nervous animals which need a great deal of room.

Apart from some wild-caught specimens in Santiago Zoo, Chile, the figures in Table 1 include only the specimens held in European zoos. These animals have recently been augmented by a reasonably substantial importation into North America. The indications are that given proper husbandry and housing the species has the capability of becoming well established in time. The studbook was taken over in 1979 by Antwerp Zoo and the prospect of controlled and planned distribution of the breeding population offers further hope for the future. The brocliets present a less encouraging picture. None is listed as threatened by IUCN and the group is not included in the Yearbook rare animal census, but our survey indicated that captive populations are far from well established. Most of the Red brockets Mazama americana in Europe are of Central and South American origin. Those in North America are the Mexican subspecies M . a. temama. They have been brought into captivity in sufficient numbers for breeding groups to be formed and the reports look encouraging: in 1965 one young was born in one collection; by 1971 six were born in three collections; by 1977 25 were born in 11 collections, and they continued to be produced in similar numbers in slightly fewer collections, mainly in the Americas, in more recent years. The progression looks fair, but there are two points to note: the neonatal mortality is high (eight of the 1977 young failed to survive) and the records for [1976] [1977] [1978] show that a large number of births were to wild-caught 00. While it seems that the Red brocket has a reasonable breeding potential, it is far from established in North America and there has been no record of breeding in Europe for the last few years.",

            "text": "The founding population of the Okapi Okapia johnstoni was less than 50 animals. In 1962 there were 20.19 specimens in the Yearbook census, of which 5.2 were zoo born, in 16 collections. By 1981 23.28 specimens in 12 zoos were reported to the Yearbook (Table 1) while 27.34 animals, most of which are captive bred, were registered in the studbook. The group has been sustained in captivity over a long period of time with few wildcaught additions but it has just barely held its own. Studies by Foose (1978) demonstrated cause for concern and at the third captive breeding conference grave fears were expressed for the future of the species (Foose, 1980; Van Dam & de Boer, 1980) . With the greater co-operation amongst zoos and the Species Survival Program developed in the United States, however, it is hoped that the future might be brighter. On the negative side, the species has a slow rate of reproduction, more 68 are born than 99, and mortality rate has paralleled survival rate. It is difficult to pinpoint any particular cause for the high death rate; there have been complications during birth, and other reproductive problems, as well as a toll from bacterial and mycotic infections. On the positive side, the Okapi is a fairly sturdy animal with a calm temperament and is not too difficult to manage. It is long lived and it is not uncommon for individuals to reach the high teens or early twenties in age.",

Even though their living area was large and allowed them considerable space to avoid each other, the arrangements for feeding and housing put the 99 at a constant disadvantage. The majority of the deaths were due to injury inflicted on the YQ by the $2 and other problems could be attributed to the stressful situation. With hindsight it can be said that the history of this group is one of failed management.

Originally recorded under two separate headings as C. ibex severtzovi and C. caucasica, the two groups were later combined as a sub-species C. i. caucasica ( = severtzovi) and are now considered as belonging to one full species, C. caucasica ( = severtzovi). Also, when the census figures for 1970 (volume 11) are compared with those of the following year, it is clear that many of the animals in the USSR and Czechoslovakia shown in the earlier volume as C. i. caucasica had been reassigned to a subspecies not previously listed, the East Caucasian tur C. i. cylindricornis (now shown as a full species).
