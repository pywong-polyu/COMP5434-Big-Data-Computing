            "text": "The trend of the number of publications on a research field is often used to quantify research interest and effort, but this measure is biased by general publication record inflation. This study introduces a novel metric as an unbiased and quantitative tool for trend analysis and bibliometrics. The metric was used to reanalyze reported publication trends and perform indepth trend analyses on patent groups and a broad range of field in the life-sciences. The analyses confirmed that inflation bias frequently results in the incorrect identification of fieldspecific increased growth. It was shown that the metric enables a more detailed, quantitative and robust trend analysis of peer reviewed publications and patents. Some examples of the metric's uses are quantifying inflation-corrected growth in research regarding microplastics (51% \u00b1 10%) between 2012 and 2018 and detecting inflation-corrected growth increase for transcriptomics and metabolomics compared to genomics and proteomics (Tukey post hoc p<0.0001). The developed trend-analysis tool removes inflation bias from bibliometric trend analyses. The metric improves evidence-driven decision-making regarding research effort investment and funding allocation.

            "text": "The chronological distribution of publications on a given field, commonly called \"publication trend\", is often included in critical, systematic and bibliometric reviews as well as in grant applications. This metric is used to illustrate the rise in scientific interest in the discussed field, identify key knowledge gaps within a larger field and highlight the commercial potential of technologies [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Such trend analyses can have important implications in the decisions made by researchers and funders to invest in a specific field [7] . It is thus paramount that reported trends accurately reflect true field-specific growth. However, the use of the unadjusted publication trend (i.e., number of articles over time) has several drawbacks. Firstly, the general growth in the total number of publications across all disciplines and fields may influence field-specific growth trends. Scientific publication output (reviews and original research articles) in the leading scientific databases has grown significantly over the past two decades. This is reflected by the quadratic trends observed for Scopus (R 2 = 0.993), Web of Science (WoS) (R 2 = 0.994) and PubMed (R 2 = 0.995) (Fig 1a) . This increase in total publications across science affects the growth rates for specific fields. Secondly, the current method lacks quantitative information, making it hard to compare trends between fields. For instance, research on estuary toxicological pollution [8] and microplastic pollution in the marine environment [9] are two fields that significantly increased during the last two decades. However, it is very difficult to determine which of the two is growing more rapidly by simply comparing the publication trends presented [8, 9] . Different approaches can be adopted to resolve these shortcomings. As shown in Fig 1b, the average yearly percentage increase in publications in WoS (3.99% \u00b10.37% SEM), Scopus (4.16% \u00b1 0.43%) and PubMed (5.26% \u00b1 0.55%) was similar between 1998 and 2018. These figures corroborate findings (using WoS, Scopus, Microsoft academics and Dimensions databases) indicating an average overall growth in the scientific literature of 5.08% since 1952 until present day [10] . These overall growth rates may be used to correct field-specific growth rates for total publication inflation, similar to the widely used approach in macroeconomy to adjust the gross domestic product (GDP) for inflation [11] . Such an approach can remove the bias derived from the yearly total publication increase from the specific field growth and enable quantitative comparison between different fields. This paper discusses the potential of this approach as well as other approaches to resolve the discussed shortcomings of publication trend analyses. After comparing approaches across randomly chosen life science topics (37) and published reviews (26), we proceed to introduce a novel metric. This metric, the General Growth Tendency (or GGT), calculates inflation-corrected, field-specific yearly growth rates. The benefits of the GGT are demonstrated by applying the metric to datasets of previously published reviews and other well-known life sciences fields. Finally, we assess additional applications such as comparing trends within research fields that are corrected for field-specific inflation and obtaining inflation-corrected patent publication trends.",

Many GGTs will therefore fall within \u00b1 10%. If a field has a GGT>100% the yearly increase or decrease in publication output in that field is roughly 20 times higher than what could be expected from growth caused by publication inflation. This may occur for fields with small absolute numbers of yearly publication outputs leading to high GGT fluctuations. However, such large fluctuations are unlikely to occur in established fields with higher absolute numbers of yearly publication output. Thus GGT>100% or fluctuations in the GGT of more than 100% likely represent unsustainable growth or large fluctuations due to low numbers of publication outputs. Rolling averages were considered to compensate for erratic patterns but were not implemented due to the difficulty to perform statistical analyses on such data and the risk of creating misleading patterns in the data.

Interestingly, changes in the material inclusion for PO do not significantly affect the growth trend (One-Way ANOVA; P = 0.89) which remains fluctuating around 4% even if all literature is included (Fig 1d) . As such, changing the document type choice was considered to have an insignificant effect on the baseline used for correcting publications inflation. Nonetheless, the PO can be changed (for instance including conference papers) to reflect field specific output format preferences (conference papers are the preferred output format in some fields) for more detailed field specific inflation correction if desired.",

These open selection criteria were applied to avoid any bias in the selection of such reviews. The publication output trends reported in these articles were reconstructed by utilizing each review's choice of search strings, article types and database. The yearly publication outputs obtained (S1 File) were used to calculate GGTs and inflation adjusted trend lines. Additionally, GGTs, adjusted and unadjusted trend lines were calculated for another 37 life-science related fields including diverse fields such as medicine, biotechnology, food technology and ecology (Table 1 ; S2 File). Here, fields were specifically selected to include both relatively young and fast growing (e.g machine learning and microplastics) and more established fields (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease and vaccines). Less common fields (such as food authentication, edible insects and cell-based meat) were also included to cover a wide range of possible datasets. Search strings were limited to peer-reviewed original articles and reviews only using the WoS database, unless if the field commonly uses other forms of output (e.g., in the field of computer science proceedings papers are often used). Such cases are mentioned specifically.",

The years 2019-2021 were excluded as these records will continue to be updated. GGT calculation was restricted to publications after 1991 since the WoS search algorithm includes keyword searches in abstracts from 1991 onwards only, which creates an artefact in field-specific analyses before and after 1991 making direct comparison before and after 1991 unfeasible [14] (Fig 2a) . Similarly, the inclusion of the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) index in WoS from 2015 [15] implied the detection of another artefact observed in the total publication output, when calculating the GGT for this year (Fig 2b) . For that reason, the use of ESCI was avoided for the GGT calculation for fields. However, the ESCI index was included (and the year 2015 excluded) for the search strings that were identical to the analysed reviews to keep maximum similarity with the data presented in those reviews. It should be noted that these results highlight how shifting indexing policies can distort the results of bibliometric analyses and how the GGT can aide to identify these issues.

In this way, one can compare R 1 and R 2 to detect higher or lower publication output increases for the field compared to the total general output [16] .

This limits the number of data points present in the trend analyses of the R values. Narotsky et al.

            "text": "Additionally, it is difficult to compare trends between fields with different absolute publication outputs with this system since the ratios will vary significantly. In some of the review papers analysed, the authors used an exponential function as a proxy for the publication trend for the specific field of study [18] . Therefore, we considered calculating the ratio R trend of the field-specific publication trend slope and the slope of the overall total publication output obtained after fitting the yearly publication output data. According to this metric, R trend <1 would indicate a decrease, R trend = 1 no increase and R trend >1 an increase in fieldspecific publication output relative to the total publication output. However, this metric would not be able to detect brief periods of intensified or reduced research activity. Moreover, the growth trends may follow different models (linear, quadratic or exponential), making it difficult to compare with the underlying overall publication trend. Finally, normalization of the publication output on a 1-100% axis was considered. This may enable visual comparison of the trends between various fields and the general publication output as well. However, in this scenario the trends themselves are not quantified, and the relationship between the field-specific and general publication trends may be difficult to analyse. Therefore, the GGT can be considered to be more informative than other described metrics as it offers not only an unbiased value that corrects for total publication growth but also avoids over-generalization of the growth trends and enables quantitative statistical analyses within and between field-specific trend lines. Additionally, inflation correction procedures are also proposed for citation analyses [19] . In theory, the principle behind the GGT may be used for citation analyses as well whereby the steady increase in yearly citation output in a specific field can be corrected for the overall increase in citation output throughout the scientific literature. However, the usefulness of such a measure would need to be studied in more detail as the focus here was on publication output. Such approaches can equally be beneficial to compare shifts in citation practices over time. Segmented regression analysis is equally suggested as a statistical tool to analyse crude publication trends [20] . Such regression analyses may aide to tease apart differences in publication trends or the relative growth of these trends over time and is thus complementary to what is proposed here.",

            "text": "GGTs for the fields discussed in the 26 reviews were calculated. In some cases, the reported keyword search did not match the obtained number of publications and minor changes (mainly adding Boolean operators) to the search string were required, complicating replication. However, keyword searches identical to those in various reviews could be used directly with minimal differences and the publication and GGT trends for a selection of these studies [1, 5, 6, 17, [21] [22] [23] which are shown in Fig 4a-4f enabling direct comparison between the yearly publication output analyses reported in the reviews and the GGT analyses. Data and search strings are given in the S1 File. All datasets showed an overall increase in the yearly number of publications and several studies concluded that the field increased considerably [1, 5, 6, 22, 23] . For instance, articles on the study of malaria [23] and giardia [22] grew considerably during the analyzed period (Fig 4b, 4c) . Nonetheless, the GGTs calculated for those datasets fluctuated around zero (GGT = -0.8% \u00b1 2.3% for [22] and 0.9% \u00b1 2.3% for [23] ). Likewise, a study published in Trends in Analytical Chemistry reported an increasing trend in publications in the sensor arrays field during 2008-2018 (Fig 4d) [1] . However, the average GGT calculated over these years was 2.3% \u00b1 1.7%, suggesting little growth relative to total publication growth. Correlation coefficients can also be calculated to test whether the GGT is consistently significantly different from zero, as this would mean that a field is continually growing/shrinking faster than the reference field. For example, the correlation coeficient calculated for the sensor array GGTs over 1998-2018 suggest (although not significantly) that there may even have been a decrease in inflation corrected growth (r = -0.63; p = 0.12). The examples described above are a practical demonstration of the bias due to the effect of total publication growth on a specific field trend and the benefits of GGT to correct it. Reviews covering celiac disease (Fig 3a) also reported an increase in the unadjusted publication trend, albeit more nuanced [17, 21] . Narotsky et al. [17] reported an increase in the fieldspecific/total output ratio for 1995-1999 compared to 2000-2004 and 2005-2009 concluding that publications covering celiac disease increased~0.2% relative to the overall scientific production over that period. Nevertheless, the GGT trend (7.5% \u00b1 5.1%; 2.5% \u00b1 3.7%; -0.7% \u00b1 2.5% for the respective periods) indicates that this increase is likely due to random variation around zero inflation-corrected growth. Indeed, a one-way ANOVA comparing GGTs of these periods showed no significant difference (p = 0.63) in inflation-corrected growth during the different periods. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found over the 1995-2018 period (r = -0.43; p = 0.04). Another review on the same field reported that the publications doubled between 1996 and 2018, which contributed to improvements in diagnostic tests and histopathology [21] . However, the total number of publications in WoS during the same period increased~2.6 fold. Again, the calculated GGT (1996-2018) showed a fluctuation around zero (GGT = 1.5% \u00b1 2.2%) and no significant correlation or deviation from zero (r = -0.11; p = 0.63), thus reflecting that the bias of total growth can lead to inaccurate conclusions. The GGTs and yearly number of publications also largely overlap between the studies even though different databases were used. Therefore, the observed increases in yearly publications for studies covering celiac disease may be solely attributed to the overall increase in publication growth.",

The first noteworthy aspect is that relatively young fields often have volatile GGTs with peaks that can be above 100%. This is likely due to the low number of publications coming out in the earlier years of these fields of study, making growth rates vulnerable to erratic change. Analysing publication trends in the early stages of a field's development (below 50 papers yearly) will inevitably see large random fluctuations due to the larger proportional effect of random changes and if an inherent issue in publication trend analyses in emerging fields.

For example, the unadjusted publication trend for research on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one of the great public health concerns of the 20 th century, has consistently increased in volume since the late 1990s and the trend appears to mirror the trend for obesity (a major risk factor for NAFLD [24] ) (Fig 4c) . In contrast, the GGTs show a consistently strong growth trend in NAFLD research from 1999 to 2005 (GGT = 29% \u00b13%) before stabilizing, with a GGT of~0. 10 year on year while the GGT for obesity research (7% \u00b1 1%) was significantly lower (t-test; p<0.0001) over that period. This difference would be hard to determine by looking at the basic publication trends. Another example of improved analyses using the GGT can be the detection of a brief burst of research activity following an outbreak or contamination event. For instance, the deliberate melamine contamination in Chinese infant milk powder in September 2008 [25] corresponds with the largest peak in the GGT in 2009 (~49%) (Fig 4d) . Another example is the outbreak of avian flu (H5N1), which caused horizontal and secondary human transmission in 2003-2004. This outbreak coincides with an increase in the publication trend and GGT (Fig 4e) . However, the GGT clearly peaks at 2006 at~120% while the unadjusted publication trend appears to continue to increase at a similar rate until 2009. Therefore, changes in research intensity are more easily discerned using the GGT.",

Omics technologies have gained considerable attention over the past two decades due to their massive potential in a variety of fields including medicine, food authenticity and ecosystem health. However, it is difficult to quantifiably compare their growth trends due to the large difference in age and publication output. Using GGTs, it becomes clear that the research intensities for genomics (GGT = 0.8% \u00b1 0.4%) are stable (r = -0.12, p = 0.73) and have ceased to grow between 2008-2018 (Fig 4f) . Inflation-corrected growth for proteomics behaved similarly (GGT = 1.2% \u00b1 1.4%) and showed (non-significant) indications of decline (proteomics r = -0.53, p = 0.10). Metabolomics and transcriptomics GGTs also appear to be on the decline between 2008 and 2018, although correlations are just not significant (metabolomics r = -0.57, p = 0.07; transcriptomics r = -0.51, p = 0.11). The average GGTs of these four fields are significantly different (one-way ANOVA p<0.0001). Specifically, the GGTs for metabolomics (GGT = 16% \u00b1 2%) and transcriptomics (GGT = 17% \u00b1 2%) were significantly higher than the GGTs for proteomics and genomics (Tukey post hoc p<0.0001) but no significant difference in the GGTs was observed between proteomics and genomics or between transcriptomics and metabolomics in post-hoc comparisons.",

            "text": "The GGT is a relative measure of growth. Therefore, one needs to be careful when choosing the reference field, to make sure that GGTs are comparable. Moreover, one should clearly state this reference field to avoid confusion about what growth trends are being corrected for. The GGTs reported above describe growth in specific fields relative to the growth of the overall publication output on WoS. Such GGTs are a very useful and robust measure that enable to check if a specific field is growing faster as what would be expected from the average inflation observed across all fields in WoS. However, a more refined field specific inflation correction can also be considered to account for the difference in the frequency of publication between disciplines. Consider research fields a' and b' within disciplines A and B, where the publication frequencies of A and B are different. GGTs calculated for a' and b' would lead to unfair comparisons between the fields if publication frequency in A or B is significantly different from the overall publication frequency used to calculate PO. In such a scenario PO could be calculated individually for each discipline. The five major research areas (technology, social sciences, physical sciences, life sciences and biomedicine, and, arts & humanities) or the major categories used in WoS could be used to get discipline specific inflation corrections to overcome this issue. The publication and growth trends of the WoS research areas and WoS research categories are shown over the 2018-1998 period (Fig 5; S2 File) . A One-way ANOVA was not significant for research areas (p = 0.38). Thus, making this distinction for PO calculation may not result in highly different results. That said, arts & humanities did have a slightly higher (nonsignificant) growth rate over this period than all literature (p = 0.085; two-tailed t-test) while the life sciences and biomedicine growth rate was similar to all literature (p = 0.29; two-tailed t-test). The absolute number of publications produced in these fields is very different, with arts & humanities producing less publications per year. This scale difference may result in different growth rates of these fields, as yearly variation in PO in arts & humanities will cause larger changes to the growth trend. Thus, research area specific PO calculation may be useful to obtain GGTs that are corrected for interdisciplinary differences in publication practices between fields and detail the growth of a field relative to the overall growth in that research area instead of to all literature. However, we do not expect this to make large differences to the overall analyses in this case since no statistical differences in the growth rates of individual research areas compared to the growth rate of all literature was observed. In some cases, growth rates of individual research categories may differ, and could be used for PO instead to obtain growth rates for a field relative to its respective research category. The one-way ANOVA between all WoS categories tested did not show a statistically significant effect of category (p = 0.55) (Fig 5d) . Post-hoc analyses comparing the growth rates of all the WoS categories with the total publication growth rate did not find significant differences, with p>0.90 in all cases except for the comparison of all literature versus computer science (p = 0.58). Thus, it was considered here that PO calculation using all literature does not introduce large bias in the GGT calculations for the topics discussed (which fall in the research categories investigated). However, a t-test comparing the growth in the environmental sciences category with the growth of all literature showed near significantly different growth rates (p = 0.06; two-tailed ttest) (Fig 5c and 5d) . Thus, when investigating the growth of a specific field in this category (e.g., microplastics), one could investigate if that field is growing relative to the growth in all literature and relative to the growth in the environmental sciences category using both a general \"total publication\" PO (correction a') and a WoS category specific PO (correction b'). If GGT using correction a' are significantly different from GGTs using correction b' then this would indicate that the observed differences in growth trends between the fields are, at least partly, due to differences between the higher-level research categories, rather than being field- PLOS ONE specific differences. Additionally, correlations using a' and b' can be calculated to further investigate the relative growth of a field. Such detailed analyses with variable PO use can help to identify confounding factors and obtain more precise comparisons of specific research fields. For microplastics (a field in the environmental science category) the average GGT relative to the environmental sciences research area was 15.6 \u00b1 8.0% for the period between 2018 and 1998 whereas the average GGT relative to all literature was 18.8 \u00b1 8.0% (Fig 5e) . This difference is not significant (p = 0.79; two-tailed t-test). Moreover, correlation coefficients were similar (r = 0.63, p = 0.003, PO = all literature; r = 0.59, p = 0.007, PO = environmental sciences) (Fig 5f) . Thus, in the case of microplastics, one can conclude that the field is growing significantly faster as the overall literature and the environmental research category. Overall, using a different PO can be useful to investigate the growth of a field relative to the growth in a specific discipline and to compare fields from disciplines that have discipline specific growthrates that substantially vary from the overall growth rate of all literature. That said we did not detect any cases in our analyses where research categories or research areas differed sufficiently from the overall growth rate of all literature to cause large differences in GGTs, further showing the robustness of the GGT for trend analyses.",

The principles behind the GGT would remain identical but changing the reference field may help to compare field-specific growth with the growth of the related overarching field. This enables more in-depth investigations. For example, it would enable visualizing the increased application of machine learning tools to Alzheimer's-related fields relative to the growing use of machine learning methods in the overall scientific literature. Inflation-corrected growth trends can also be calculated on changes in patent growth for various European Patent Office (EPO) categories. Total technology patents reported (2010-2019) in the EPO database have increased, and a quadratic polynomial trendline can be fitted to the data (R 2 = 0.97; Fig 6a) . Moreover, growth rates have been relatively stable except for a clear spike in the year 2016, possibly indicating a change in the database indexing system similar to what was observed for WoS. Interestingly, the GGTs visualised in Fig 6b for the EPO food chemistry and environmental technology patents show that inflation-corrected food chemistry patent registration has significantly decreased (r = -0.75; p = 0.026). Patent submissions for environmental technology, on the other hand, have been on par with the total growth in technology patents (r = -0.02, p = 0.98).",

The measure enables statistical comparison between separate research fields of similar or different dimensions. That said, caution remains key when making comparisons between fields due to field differences regarding field specific co-authorship practises, publication output type (e.g. short conference papers or lengthy journal articles) and the field-specific differences in the need for time and resource consuming laboratory experiments. The GGT does not correct for these differences which should be considered when comparing field-specific growth rates from dissimilar research fields. It is possible to perform statistical analyses to discern trends and detect brief changes in the growth tendency of a research field caused by a temporary increase in research intensity. The reference field of GGTs can be used to calculate growth rates relative to the growth in specific research fields or can be calculated on field-specific patent publication to inform on relative growth rates for patent production as well. The measure can be most informative if accompanied by unadjusted publication trends thus enabling statistical analyses of inflation corrected growth and appreciation of the overall size of the studied research field. Such analyses will provide a more detailed, quantitative and sound temporal analyses of the actual changes in field-specific research intensity. Better-quality trend analyses may considerably improve the identification of key knowledge gaps and highlight the commercial potential of emerging technology. This will ultimately result in more efficient and evidence-driven decision-making regarding research effort investment and funding allocation, as true growth is better visualized and quantified. ",
