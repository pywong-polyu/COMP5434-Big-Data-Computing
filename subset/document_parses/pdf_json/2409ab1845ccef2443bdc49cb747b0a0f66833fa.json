This case report is of a young male presenting as chill blain over the penile region. A 27-year-old male patient reported of pain and swelling of penile shaft following exposure to extreme cold climate in the month of September at high altitude. There was no history of trauma, ulcer over the penis, no blister, no discharge, or fever, with no history of cold related injuries in past. The examination revealed erythematous penile shaft with subcutaneous edema. There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy and the scrotal skin was normal. The patient responded to the conservative management for chill blains. Idiopathic penile chill blain is an extremely rare condition. People living in cold mountainous region should frequently change the clothes to keep the local area dry to avoid being victim of such cold related injuries.",

He gave history of exposure to extreme cold climate, ambient temperature being -7 to 13\u00b0C at an altitude of about 17,000 feet above mean sea level, where he had been for over a period of 2 months. He denied history of trauma, insect bite, vigorous masturbation, or sexual intercourse. There had been no history of swelling in the joints and skin lesions over other body parts, and the family history for such illness was negative. On local examination, the entire penis was erythematous with subcutaneous edema. There was no local rise of temperature, no blistering of the penile skin, no lesion on glans with retractable prepuce, and a normal urethral meatus. The scrotal skin was normal, and there was no inguinal lymphadenopathy. The examination of the hands and feet were normal. On investigation, his Hb is 19.3 g/dl, TLC 10,700/mm 3 , DLC P 78L16M02E04, platelets 161x10^3, INR 1.1, urea 28 mg/dl, S.Creat 1.1 mg/dl, SGOT/SGPT 46/ 52 IU/L, viral markers negative, urine RE/ME NAD and VDRL negative, and rapid antigen test (COVID-19) negative. He was managed with local hot fomentation and application of glycerine and lignocaine jelly. He was started on tab ecosprin 75 mg and tab nifedipine 20 mg. His symptoms resolved completely in few days. On follow-up of the patient for 6 months, he had no recurrence.",

This is accompanied by reducing the cold exposure by using double layer of woollen clothing. The drugs commonly used are calcium channel blockers, nifedipine, and antiplatelets, ecosprin. Pentoxifylline has also been used but not found to be effective [6] . In our patient, we had used nifedipine and ecosprin to which he responded well.

Anecdotal case reports have reported affection of unusual areas like the thigh and the buttocks [7, 8] . To the best of the knowledge of the authors, this is the first time an isolated penile chill blain is being reported. Our patient had presented with erythema and edema of the penile shaft after exposure to cold although the penis was well protected by clothing. One of the possible reasons may be the damp microenvironment after a bout of perspiration in the area, and subsequent exposure to the cold, the temperature in the area would have dropped suddenly leading to the development of chill blains [2] . The diagnosis of chill blains is clinical, with no confirmatory test to affirm the diagnosis. The supplementary proof comes from the fact that the erythema and edema settled with treatment in lines of treating chill blains. Chill blains have been reported to be recurring in cold season; however, on follow-up of the said case, there has been no recurrence till date, possibly due to extreme rare manifestation of chill blains.There was no evidence of erectile dysfunction associated along with this rare manifestation.
