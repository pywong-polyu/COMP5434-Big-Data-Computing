            "text": "With over 165 million cases reported and 2 million new cases per day [1] , the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic [2, 3] has hit Italy particularly hard since March 2020 [4] , yielding more than 125,000 deaths in three separate waves, the third of which is currently raging. Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, intensive care hospitalization in Lombardy has been very high, urging a profound reorganization of healthcare facilities through the creation of specific COVID-19 hospitals able to guarantee patient isolation and intensive care support, as well as the centralization of treatment for other life-threatening diseases such as cancer in COVID-19-low specialized hubs. In this scenario, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori (INT) in Milan, an Institute of Scientific Hospitalization and Care (IRCCS), was addressed as a hub hospital by the Lombardy Region. INT is the first Italian public cancer center and is one of the main national and international referral centers for cancer treatment. It has 482 beds and is located in a metropolitan area that includes 133 different municipalities and serves more than 3 million people. Considering all these features, INT is in a privileged position to conduct patient care, and preclinical and translational research in oncology. The Department of Pathology has 82 members and is provided with fully equipped labs for routine histopathological assessment and molecular testing. The approach to cancer diagnosis has recently been revolutionized by the introduction of the mutational paradigm, which leverages the comprehensive molecular characterization of tumors for personalized care. Accordingly, we recently applied an innovative organizational model to the INT Department of Pathology, by creating two independent and highly integrated units of surgical and molecular pathology. This structure allowed us to efficiently diagnose and comprehensively profile the case-mix of roughly 50,000 exams per year, either internal or referred by community hospitals, which traditionally represent the core business of our Institution. In this manuscript, we describe the changes in the number of exams and in the workflow of the department units after the first peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, also focusing on the management of biological tissues and procedures to preserve the health of workers.",

For this reason, we evaluated the number of exams in two different timeframes, i.e., December 2019-February 2020 (pre-COVID-19 period) and March-May 2020 (COVID-19 period). The exams were grouped into different classes-\"surgical\", \"biopsy\", \"second opinion\", \"molecular\", \"cytology\" and \"PAP test\"and differentiated by the origins of the exams, namely, (i) day hospital, (ii) inpatients and (iii) outpatients.",

Accordingly, procedures concerning fresh material handling (fresh sample reduction and processing) and the access of external personnel were modified in both the units of the Department of Pathology, in order to preserve the health of workers [6] . As a secondary aim, we measured the performance of the Pathology Department in diagnosis production, taking advantage of the Turn-Around-Time (TAT) metrics released by the Lombardy Region for the pathology laboratories accredited with the national health system: this procedure establishes that at least 90% of the diagnoses must be carried out within a timeframe pre-specified for each category of exams. To this end, the internal Pathox workflow management (Tesi Elettronica e Sistemi Informativi, Milan, Italy) software was retrospectively interrogated for TAT by comparing both the pre-COVID-19 period and COVID-19 period. Finally, the changes in the operating procedures, applied for the safeguarding of workers, were described as a model for the other Pathology Laboratories.",

The first measure adopted was to submit all the specimens to a 24-72 h fixation with 10% buffered formalin. All the fresh surgical materials referred to our department were properly handled by a pathologist, wearing a FFP2 safety mask and single-use sterile gown under a chemical fume cabinet, to improve formalin penetration, and then fixed for 24 h before routine sampling.

On 8 March 2020, a presidential decree (Law no. 34/2020) established that up to 50% of the staff personnel could be placed in remote working. The decree was then implemented during the second peak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in October 2020, in order to further balance the need to face the pandemic and the continuity of services through flexibility in working hours. We prioritized remote working for the personnel who were actually able to work from home. In particular, pathologists who shared offices with other colleagues were equipped with software for digital slide viewing and VPN access. Accordingly, biologists were also connected to the VPN in order to enable them to use the lab software remotely. These procedures allowed obtaining a 50% reduction in onsite pathologists and biologists, respectively. By contrast, only 15% of the laboratory technician staff were able to carry out remote working, due to the need to manually perform working procedures on site. Rotations were established to guarantee a safe alternation between onsite and remote working. The access of personnel external to the pathology department was restricted to operators carrying samples from surgical rooms and the day hospital. All the offices of the department were already equipped with sensors unlocked through electronic badges, a measure further helping to reduce contacts among inter-and intra-department operators. The reception of patients for pathology report collection or consultation sample delivery was restricted to offices equipped by glass separators, and the opening time was reduced.",

During the first lockdown in Lombardy, lasting from March to May 2020, several structures were converted into COVID-19-hospitals, and cancer patients were centralized to a few hubs, including INT Milan. Cancer screening programs including gynecology and mammographic exams were suspended, first and follow-up visits were often postponed, and surgery was delayed except for cases defined as urgent according to specific guidelines released by the regional department of health. In this scenario, cancer centers had the twofold goal of maintaining their proficiency within a COVID-19-low environment through careful screening for COVID-19 infections and new procedures for patient triage as well as internal reorganization [5] .",

The TAT measures the proficiency of a pathology lab in providing timely diagnoses, a prerequisite for properly applying personalized treatments, especially in cancer patients. We found that the TAT of all the diagnostic procedures evaluated during the COVID-19 period was always >90%; specifically, 93.5-100% of the exams were completed within the prespecified timeframe. This result in spite of a 50% reduction in onsite personnel (mainly pathologists and biologists) and the implementation of time-consuming procedures including 24-72 h formalin fixation for all the samples admitted to the department likely stems from a generalized decrease in the overall workload due to lockdown restrictions. Actually, the volume of histological, cytological and molecular procedures showed a 14.1-36% reduction during the COVID-19 period. The reduction was particularly evident for day-hospital histological and cytological exams, while samples from inpatients subjected to surgery slightly increased, a trend attributable to social confinement with the centralization of cancer patients from general hospitals. PAP tests showed the greatest decrease (\u221281.6%), further confirming that cancer screening had an abrupt slowdown during the first wave of COVID-19, a trend endangering cancer prevention in the near future. These data are in keeping with a recent report of London J.W. et al. [8] , who compared January-April 2019 and 2020 patient data from a network of 20 US institutions accounting for more than 28 million patients, showing a substantial decrease in breast cancer (\u221289.2%) and colorectal cancer (\u221284.5%) screenings. Along this line, Maringe et al. [9] predicted a substantial increase in the number of avoidable breast, colorectal, lung and esophageal cancer deaths in England as a result of diagnostic delays due to pandemic lockdown measures in the UK.",
