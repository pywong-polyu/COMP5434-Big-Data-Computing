            "text": "Genetic variants of the interferon lambda (IFNL) gene locus are strongly associated with spontaneous and IFN treatment-induced clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Individuals with the ancestral IFNL4-dG allele are not able to clear HCV in the acute phase and have more than a 90% probability to develop chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Paradoxically, the IFNL4-dG allele encodes a fully functional IFN\u03bb4 protein with antiviral activity against HCV. Here we describe an effect of IFN\u03bb4 on HCV antigen presentation. Only minor amounts of IFN\u03bb4 are secreted, because the protein is largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it induces ER stress. Stressed cells are significantly weaker activators of HCV specific CD8 + T cells than unstressed cells. This is not due to reduced MHC I surface presentation or extracellular IFN\u03bb4 effects, since T cell responses are restored by exogenous loading of MHC with HCV antigens. Rather, IFN\u03bb4 induced ER stress impairs HCV antigen processing and/or loading onto the MHC I complex. Our results provide a potential explanation for the IFN\u03bb4-HCV paradox.",

            "text": "I nterferon lambda (IFN\u03bb) is generally recognized for its important role in innate immunity at mucosal barriers of the intestine and the respiratory tract 1 , but it is also an important regulator of the host response to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In 2009, genome-wide association studies unexpectedly linked genetic variants of the IFN-lambda (IFNL) gene locus with spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of HCV [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Four years later, IFN\u03bb4 was discovered and identified as the molecular link between genotype and phenotype 8 . IFN\u03bb4 differs in several important ways from the other three IFN\u03bb family members. IFN\u03bb4 shares only 29% amino acid identity with its closest relative IFN\u03bb3, whereas the three other members of the family share >80% 8 . Compared with the other IFN\u03bb family members, IFN\u03bb4 is very weakly induced by viral infections, poorly expressed, and hardly secreted at all [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . These properties of IFN\u03bb4 make it difficult to explore functional properties that could explain its negative impact on defense against HCV. Years after its discovery, the most compelling evidence for the central role of IFN\u03bb4 still comes from genetic association studies. Genetic variations in the IFNL4 gene encode several isoforms. The IFNL4 signature single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at rs368234815 is an insertion/ substitution mutation (IFNL4-G/TT) that disrupts the open reading frame of the ancestral IFNL4-G allele in exon 1. A second functionally important SNP at rs117648444 (T/A) changes a proline at amino acid position 70 of the protein to serine, resulting in a much less active IFN\u03bb4-S70 15 . Paradoxically, the non-functional IFNL4-TT, the functionally impaired IFNL4-S70, and the fully functional IFNL4-P70 alleles are strongly associated with high, intermediate, and low spontaneous HCV clearance rates, respectively 15 . Why a functional IFN with strong in vitro antiviral activity [10] [11] [12] can be a disadvantage in the host response to HCV remains unexplained.",

We confirm previous reports showing that IFN\u03bb4 is poorly secreted, but once secreted, binds to the IFN\u03bb receptor, strongly induces Jak-STAT signaling, and has strong antiviral activity. Here we describe that these positive effects on innate immunity are counteracted by a negative impact on cellular immunity. This negative effect comes from the non-secreted IFN\u03bb4 that accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress. ER stress leads to reduced antigen processing from endogenous HCV proteins, which in turn inhibits HCV antigen presentation to CD8 + T cells. As a consequence, HCV-specific T cell responses are attenuated. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that IFN\u03bb4 has a negative impact on antigen-dependent immune responses that could explain the \"IFN\u03bb4 paradox\".",

In order to obtain further insights into IFN\u03bb4 production, glycosylation, and secretion, we transiently transfected Huh-7 cells with expression vectors encoding different Myc-tagged IFNs and monitored intracellular and extracellular accumulation. Forty-eight hours (h) post-transfection, total cell lysates and cell-culture supernatant were subjected to Myc-tag-specific (Fig. 1a, top panel) and IFNspecific (Fig. 1a , bottom panel) western blot analysis. As expected, IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03bb1, 2, and 3 accumulated in the cell-culture supernatant (Fig. 1a) .

To that end, we stimulated Huh-7 cells stably expressing the receptor IFN\u03bbR1 (Huh7-LR cells 16 ) with serial dilutions of supernatant collected from cells transfected with IFN\u03bb4 or IFN\u03bb3 expression plasmids. IFN\u03bb4 samples strongly activated STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation (pY-STAT1, pY-STAT2) even in dilutions where the Myc-tagged protein was not detectable (Fig. 2a-c) . This experiment was also performed in the presence of B18R, a type I IFN inhibitor [17] [18] [19] . Treatment of Huh7-LR cells with B18R prevented IFN\u03b1-but not IFN\u03bb3-and IFN\u03bb4-mediated JAK-STAT activation (Fig. 2b, c and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). To further study the activity of IFN\u03bb4 in a time-dependent manner, we investigated the kinetics of STAT phosphorylation triggered by IFN\u03bb4 or IFN\u03bb3. Compared to IFN\u03bb3, IFN\u03bb4 activated STAT1 and STAT2 faster and stronger (Fig. 2d, e) . For a more quantitative assessment of the specific activity of IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4, we purified the proteins from cell-culture supernatants ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Huh7-LR cells were then stimulated with different concentrations of the purified proteins ( Supplementary  Fig. 4a, b) . Dose-response curves were generated and used to calculate EC50 values. The EC50 for STAT1 phosphorylation was 1.4 and 39.1 ng/ml for IFN\u03bb4 and IFN\u03bb3, respectively, and for STAT2 activation it was 1.9 and 54.3 ng/ml for IFN\u03bb4 and IFN\u03bb3, respectively. Thus, IFN\u03bb4 was approximately 28-fold more potent than IFN\u03bb3. The high specific activity of IFN\u03bb4 was confirmed in Mx1-promoter-reporter gene assays ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ), by quantifying interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression (Supplementary Fig. 4d ), and also demonstrated as antiviral activity in HCV replicon cells ( Supplementary Fig. 4e ). We conclude that IFN\u03bb4 is poorly secreted, but highly potent.",

It has been described that posttranslational modification of IFN\u03bb4 by N-linked glycosylation is required for secretion but apparently does not influence its activity 10 . Nevertheless, we explored whether glycosylation is also important for the activity of IFN\u03bb4. First, we compared pY-STAT1 activation in Huh7-LR cells that were treated with equal amounts of purified IFN\u03bb4 and IFN\u03bb3 produced in Huh7 cells (i.e., properly glycosylated) or Escherichia coli (E. coli) (i.e., lacking all glycosylation) as quantified by silver staining (Fig. 3a) . In case of IFN\u03bb3, which is physiologically not glycosylated 20 , there was no difference between E. coli and Huh7derived purified proteins in terms of STAT1 activation (Fig. 3b) . This was different for IFN\u03bb4, where Huh7-derived preparations were much more potent (Fig. 3b) , suggesting that glycosylation increased IFN\u03bb4 activity. To further investigate the role of glycosylation for IFN\u03bb4 activity, we pre-treated Huh-7-produced purified IFN\u03bb4 with different glycosidases prior to stimulation of Huh7-LR cells. Consistent with previous reports 10 , we observed in western blots a shift of IFN\u03bb4-specific bands to lower molecular weights in samples that were pre-treated with a mix of deglycosylation enzymes (PNGase F, O-glycosidase, neuraminidase, \u03b2\u22121-4 galactosidase, and \u03b2-N-acetyl glucosaminidase) or with PNGase F alone (Fig. 3c, lane 2 Without stripping, membranes were re-probed with an IFN\u03bb4-specific antibody with the signal acquisition in the red channel (bottom panel). In lysates from IFN\u03bb1 and IFN\u03bb4-expressing cells, several bands were detected representing different glycosylation forms of the proteins. Data are representative of n = 3 independent experiments. b, c IFN\u03bb4 and (d, e) IFN\u03bb3 total intracellular protein accumulation and daily supernatant production were measured over a 5-day period after transfection.

There was no clear change in molecular weight of IFN\u03bb4 upon treatment with other enzymes (Fig. 3c, lanes 4-7) . Of note, PNGase F treatment of intracellular IFN\u03bb4 also shifted it to the same lower band, indicating that intracellular IFN\u03bb4 was also N-glycosylated (Fig. 3c , lane 9). To establish whether glycosylation affects IFN\u03bb4 activity, enzymatically pre-treated IFN\u03bb4 samples were used to stimulate Huh7-LR cells. PNGase F, but not the other enzymes, reduced the activity of IFN\u03bb4, indicating that N-linked glycosylation is important for IFN\u03bb4 activity (Fig. 3d ). Of note, intracellular IFN\u03bb4 did not induce pY-STAT1 activation despite the fact that it was N-glycosylated (Fig. 3c, d) .",

The observation that intracellularly accumulated IFN\u03bb4 is N-glycosylated refutes the hypothesis that a defect in N-glycosylation is responsible for the poor secretion of IFN\u03bb4. To explore other potential mechanisms for intracellular retention of IFN\u03bb4, we first set out to identify the subcellular compartment(s) where IFN\u03bb4 retention occurred. Immunofluorescence studies using IFN\u03bb4 antibodies together with an ER staining dye or an anti-Golgi antibody revealed that IFN\u03bb4 colocalized both with ER membranes and the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4a) . Colocalization analysis showed preferential accumulation of IFN\u03bb4 in the ER. Next, we performed subcellular fractionation with IFN\u03bb4-transfected and IFN\u03bb3-transfected Huh7 cells. More than 50% of total IFN\u03bb4 was enriched in the ER or ER-PM (plasma membrane) fractions, whereas IFN\u03bb3 was enriched in the cytosolic (Cyto) fraction (Fig. 4b) . Of note, intracellular IFN\u03bb3 was as potent as secreted IFN\u03bb3 (Supplementary Fig. 5a , left panel). In contrast, intracellular IFN\u03bb4 was at least 100 times weaker than secreted IFN\u03bb4 irrespective of its subcellular location ( Supplementary Fig. 5a , right panel). Together with the results from Fig. 4a , this strongly suggests that intracellularly retained IFN\u03bb4 is not properly folded and remains inactive.",

The accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) through the activation of the ER stress sensors protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) and their signaling cascades 21, 22 . Therefore, we investigated whether these pathways were activated in cells transfected with IFN\u03bb4 expression plasmids. PERK, IRE1, ATF6, and eIF2\u03b1-activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) were not significantly activated upon the expression of IFN\u03bb4 in Huh7 cells. Of note, treatment of Huh7 cells with the ER stress inducer Thapsigargin did also not affect these proteins. We, therefore, used phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1), splicing of X box-binding protein (XBP1), and CHOP mRNA expression as indicators of ER stress induction in Huh7 cells. Transfection of IFN\u03bb4, but not IFN\u03bb3 or other IFN proteins, induced transient phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 with a peak at time point 24 h ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 5b ) and splicing of XBP1, but did not induce CHOP ( Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5c Fig. 5c ), suggesting that ER stress is caused by misfolded endogenous IFN\u03bb4 and not by the small amounts of correctly folded and secreted IFN\u03bb4. We also quantified induction of sXBP1 and CHOP mRNA in doxycycline-inducible HepG2 cell lines that stably express GFP-tagged IFN\u03bb4 (IFN\u03bb4-GFP) or its truncated non-functional form IFN\u03bb4 p131-GFP. Indeed, wild-type, but not truncated IFN\u03bb4 induced both the early and late UPR, sXBP1, and CHOP in HepG2 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 5d , e). We conclude that IFN\u03bb4 is not properly folded, is retained in the ER, and induces ER stress.",

            "text": "Impact of IFN\u03bb4 genotype on global gene expression. To further study the impact of SeV-induced IFN\u03bb4 on the cellular response to viral infection, we performed RNAseq on liver organoids with a dG genotype (B20, nt115, U15) and with a TT genotype (nt5, U16, U19). From each organoid, we profiled the uninfected organoids at time point 0 h (pre-infection) and 12 h (mock), and from SeV-infected (SeV) organoids at time point 12 h. The 12 h time point was chosen because we observed the peak of IFN\u03bb4 expression at this time (Fig. 5a ). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the transcriptomic profiles revealed a clear separation between SeV-infected and uninfected samples (Supplementary Fig. 8a ). By contrast, among both the infected and the uninfected samples, no clear separation was observed between the IFN\u03bb4 genotypes ( Supplementary Fig. 8a ). To identify transcriptomic changes induced by SeV infection, we performed a differential expression analysis between SeV-infected and uninfected (pre-infection and mock) samples. We found that SeV infection-induced changes in the expression levels of 4649 and 3306 genes in the dG and the TT genotypes, respectively, including a significant enrichment of 2983 genes commonly altered in both genotypes (enrichment factor = 2.55, p < 2.2e\u221216, hypergeometric test, Supplementary Fig. 8b) . Indeed, the overall gene expression changes induced by SeV were highly similar in the two IFN\u03bb4 genotypes (r = 0.93, Pearson correlation, p < 2.2e \u221216, Supplementary Fig. 8b ). This was also reflected at the level of biological pathways as determined by pathway enrichment analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8c ; Supplementary Data 1 and 2). Since the molecular analysis revealed a dG genotype-specific induction of ER stress, we specifically interrogated the RNAseq data for differences in regulation of genes associated with response to ER stress. Indeed, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the pathway \"GO-Response_To_Endoplasmic_Re-ticulums_Stress\" was positively enriched in organoids of dG genotype, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, the regulation of the corresponding genes was stronger in the organoids of the dG genotype ( Supplementary  Fig. 8d ) consistent with the induction of an IFN\u03bb4-dependent ER stress upon viral infection. 4 IFN\u03bb4 accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and causes ER stress. a Huh7 cells were transfected with IFN\u03bb4 encoding or mock expression vectors (MV) and processed 24 h later for immunofluorescence staining of ER (red, Cytopainter ER staining kit), Golgi (red, anti-Giantin antibody), IFN\u03bb4 (green, anti-IFN\u03bb4 antibody), and nuclei (blue, DAPI). Images are representative of n = 5 independent experiments. Scale bars are 10 \u03bcm. Pearson's correlation of colocalization coefficients for IFN\u03bb4-ER (dark gray) and IFN\u03bb4-Golgi (light gray) were quantified as described in the \"Methods\" section separately for each IFN\u03bb4-expressing cell, p = 0.0073, two-tailed unpaired t-test. b Huh7 cells were transfected with IFN\u03bb4 or IFN\u03bb3 expression vectors and homogenized 24 h later. Plasma membrane (PM), ER, plasma-ER associated membrane-associated (ER-PM) and cytosolic (Cyto) fractions were enriched from the cell homogenate as described in the \"Methods\" section. 2 \u03bcl of each fraction and dilutions of purified IFN\u03bb3 as a protein standard were analyzed by western blotting for the presence of IFN\u03bb4 and IFN\u03bb3 (using anti-Myc-tag antibody) and for E-cadherin and calnexin as markers for PM and ER, respectively (upper panel). The IFN\u03bb protein distribution in the fractions was calculated from the western blot data with the IFN\u03bb4 (black) and IFN\u03bb3 (light gray) signal in the total HM set to 100% (lower panel). kDa, kilodalton. c Huh7 cells were transfected with Myc-His-tagged IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4 expression vectors or a mock vector (MV) or left untreated (UT). Cell lysates and cell-culture supernatants were collected at the indicated time points. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting for the ER stress markers IRE1\u03b1, phosphor-IRE1\u03b1, PERK, phosphor-PERK, Bip, cleaved ATF6 (cATF6), ATF4, phospho-eIF2\u03b1, and eIF2\u03b1 using marker-specific antibodies as well as intracellular IFNs (IFNs(C)) using an anti-Myc-tag antibody. IFN proteins in the supernatants (IFNs(S)) were also detected with an anti-Myc-tag antibody. Cells treated with 2 \u03bcM Thapsigargin (Tg) for 8 h served as a positive ER stress control. d Total cellular RNA was harvested from Huh7 cells transfected or treated as described in (c) at the indicated time points. Spliced mRNA of the ER stress marker sXBP1 (left panel) and total mRNA of CHOP (right panel) were analyzed by RT-qPCR as described in the \"Methods\" section. sXBP1 levels are shown as relative expression to mRNA level of total XBP1. CHOP mRNA expression was calculated relative to that of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. IFN\u03bb4 expression inhibits HCV peptide-specific CD8 + T cell activation. Cytosolic antigens presented by MHC-I are primarily derived from proteasomal cleavage of proteins into peptides that are then imported into the ER and loaded onto newly synthesized MHC-I 25 . Thus, we hypothesized that the IFN\u03bb4-induced ER stress could interfere with HCV antigen presentation, and thereby reduce the activation of HCVspecific CD8 + T cells. To address this question, we made use of a unique in vitro cell coculture system consisting of subgenomic HCV replicon cells stably transduced with HLA-A2 (Huh7 A2 HCV EM ) and an HLA-matched HCV-specific CD8 + T cell clone 26 . We tested the impact of ER stress on T cell response in this system by Thapsigargin treatment of the Huh7 A2 HCV EM ( Supplementary  Fig. 9a, b) . As expected, Thapsigargin induced XBP1 splicing and indeed, HCV-specific CD8 + T cell activation was significantly reduced. Next, Huh7 A2 HCV EM cells were transfected with expression plasmids for IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03bb1, IFN\u03bb3, and IFN\u03bb4. Consistent with our previous results, IFN\u03bb4 was retained in the cells and induced ER stress ( Supplementary Fig. 10a, b) . Consequently, we observed a significant reduction of CD8 + T cell activation by Huh7 A2 HCV EM cells expressing IFN\u03bb4, but not by cells transfected with IFN\u03bb1 or IFN\u03bb3 (Fig. 6a) . This was not due to reduced expression of HLA-2A (Fig. 6b) , and also not caused by a stronger inhibition of HCV replication in IFN\u03bb4-transfected cells compared to IFN\u03bb1-or IFN\u03bb3transfected cells (Fig. 6c) . Furthermore, treatment of Huh7 A2 HCV EM cells with IFN\u03bb3 or IFN\u03bb4 did not induce an ER stress response in Huh7 A2 HCV EM and had no impact on T cell activation (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b) . To further test the hypothesis of IFN\u03bb4 interference with endogenous peptide loading on MHC-I, we investigated whether the T cell response could be rescued by exogenous loading of an HCV peptide to the replicon cells. To this end, we used another replicon cell clone (Huh7 A2 HCV) presenting a mismatched epitope that does not induce T cell activation but is otherwise identical to Huh7 A2 HCV EM cells 26 . As expected, IFN\u03bb4 had no impact on T cell activation in this setting (Fig. 6d) . Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that IFN\u03bb4induced ER stress impairs endogenous processing and MHC-I loading of HCV antigens, and thereby inhibits HCV-specific CD8 + T cell responses.",

For example, multiple SNPs in the IFNL3 have been shown to regulate IFNL3 transcription or translation [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . In a seminal discovery, IFN\u03bb4 has been identified as the molecular link between the various genetic variants of the IFN-lambda (IFNL) gene locus and spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of HCV leading to the so-called \"IFN\u03bb4 paradox\" 8, 10, 32 . Individuals with a functional IFNL4 gene show an impaired host defense during acute hepatitis C and often become chronically infected 2-7 , despite the fact that cell-culture experiments demonstrate a strong antiviral activity of IFN\u03bb4 against HCV and corona virus 10 . Moreover, IFN\u03bb4 signals through the same receptor that other members of type III IFN do, and its biochemical characteristics are highly comparable [10] [11] [12] 15 . A striking difference to the other IFN\u03bbs is the poor secretion of IFN\u03bb4 8,10,11,14 . Therefore, we performed biochemical and immunological studies to explore whether there are differences between IFN\u03bb4 and other IFNs in regard to biosynthesis, secretion, induction of JAK-STAT signaling, and antigen presentation that could explain the negative impact of IFN\u03bb4 on the immune response to the virus.",

The reasons for this striking difference in potency remain to be explored. Interestingly, Huh7-produced IFN\u03bb4 that is properly glycosylated is the most potent, while E. coli-produced IFN\u03bb4 and IFN\u03bb3 are equally active as Huh7-produced IFN\u03bb3. We extended these observations by comparing IFN\u03bb4 activity pre-and post-enzymatic removal of N-linked sugar residue, demonstrating that glycosylation is important to preserve biological potency of IFN\u03bb4, which has also been demonstrated with other cytokines and receptors [33] [34] [35] .",

            "text": "Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that IFN\u03bb4 is retained in the ER (Fig. 4) . It is well known that for some proteins, glycosylation is an important step for entering the secretory pathway. However, the absence of IFN\u03bb4 glycosylation cannot be the main reason for poor secretion, since intracellular retained IFN\u03bb4 seems to be correctly glycosylated (Fig. 3c) . Rather, we believe that IFN\u03bb4 is not properly folded. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that even correctly glycosylated but intracellularly retained IFN\u03bb4 cannot induce STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3d ). Since proteins have to pass a \"qualitycontrol\" check before being transported from ER through the protein secretory pathway 36, 37 , misfolding in the ER could well explain the retention of IFN\u03bb4 in the ER. Like other misfolded glycoproteins, improperly folded IFN\u03bb4 would have to cycle through the \"refolding\" process before it reaches its native conformation. Only the small fraction of correctly folded protein would then be secreted. The model is consistent with our observation that ER-accumulated IFN\u03bb4 induces UPR in Huh7, HepG2, and HCV replicon (Huh7 A2 HCV EM ) cells by stimulating XBP1 mRNA splicing. Many of the ER stress response markers were not strongly induced in the Huh7 cells by IFN\u03bb4, but this was also the case for thapsigargin (Fig. 4c, d) . We, Fig. 5 IFN\u03bb4 is induced upon viral infection in liver-derived organoids. Liver-derived organoid cultures of the dG (B16, U15, U12) and TT (U16, nt5, B13) genotype were infected with Sendai virus H4 at a MOI = 10 as described in the \"Methods\" section. a Organoids were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36 , and 48 h after SeV inoculation. Uninfected organoids were harvested at the time of SeV inoculation and used as time point 0 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted and analyzed by RT-qPCR for the expression of SeV DI-RNA and mRNA expression of interferons (IFNB, IFNL1, IFNL2/3, IFNL4) and the ISGs Mx1 and ISG15. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM of biological replicates (n = 3 for B16, U15, U16, and nt5, n = 1 for U12 and B13). For better visualization, the data point symbols of the 3 and 9 h time points have been omitted from the graphs. Red, dG organoids; black, TT organoids; dotted line, lower limit of detection (LoD); negative data points and those below LoD are displayed at LoD. b Some SeV-infected organoids (B16, U15, U16, nt5) were harvested at 12 h post-infection and processed for IFN\u03bb4-specific western blot analysis as described in the \"Methods\" section. M, molecular size marker. Data are presented from one representative experiment. c Three organoid cultures each of the dG (B20, nt115, U15) and TT (nt5, U16, U19) genotype were infected with Sendai virus H4 (MOI = 10). Total cellular RNA was extracted from infected cells at the indicated time points and analyzed for the mRNA expression of IFNL4 and sXBP1 mRNA. sXBP1 levels are shown as the ratio of the spliced (s)XBP1 mRNA to total XBP1 RNA. The ratio at the time point 0 of each organoid line was set to 1. IFNL4 levels were expressed as copy numbers per 40 ng of total RNA. Open bars, IFNL4 mRNA; lines with red circles, sXBP1 mRNA in dG organoids; lines with black circles, sXBP1 mRNA in TT organoids. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. therefore, think that the weak induction of these ER stress response markers rather reflects an intrinsic property of the Huh7 cells than a limited ER stress-inducing activity of IFN\u03bb4. Furthermore, ER stress was not only observed in overexpression systems, but also when IFN\u03bb4 was expressed from the cellular genome in reaction to SeV infection. The fact that XBP1 mRNA splicing upregulated in viral-infected organoids of dG genotype, but not of TT genotype (Fig. 5c) , proves that IFN\u03bb4 protein expression is causing ER stress.",

We conclude that the small amount of IFN\u03bb4 expression in the context of viral infection does not significantly alter the overall transcriptional response induced by the very potent type I IFN system. However, this does not rule out that intracellular IFN\u03bb4 retention causes ER stress and thereby affects protein trafficking. The ER plays also an important role in the loading of viral antigen peptides onto the MHC class I complex. To test whether IFN\u03bb4-induced ER stress could interfere with HCV antigen presentation, we used a unique in vitro cell coculture system consisting of sub-genomic HCV replicon cells stably transduced with HLA-A2 (Huh7 A2 HCV EM ) and an HLA-matched HCV-specific CD8 + T cell clone 26 . In this system, IFN\u03bb4 expression in the antigen-presenting replicon cells impaired the CD8 + T cell response. This was not due to inhibition of HCV replication or reduced cell surface expression of MHC class I molecules. Furthermore, we could rescue the CD8 + T cell response by loading HCV peptide exogenously. This demonstrates that the negative effect of IFN\u03bb4 on the CD8 + T cell response is not mediated by direct inhibition of CD8 + T cells, but by causing reduced antigen presentation. Moreover, when transfecting a plasmid expressing the non-functional IFN\u03bb4-TT variant in the HCV replicon cells, CD8 + T cell activity was not inhibited. Based on these observations, we propose that the IFN\u03bb4 paradox can be explained by the negative impact of IFN\u03bb4 on HCV antigen presentation to immune cells. Interestingly, previous studies have shown decreased numbers of CD8 + T cells and CD163 + macrophages in liver biopsies from patients of the IFN\u03bb4 producing genotype 38 , and decreased degranulation activity in freshly isolated CD3 + CD56 \u2212 T and CD3 + CD56 + NKT lymphocytes from liver biopsies of patients with an IFN\u03bb4 producing genotype 39 .",

Small amounts of IFN\u03bb4 are secreted, and these molecules are highly potent antiviral inducers of the JAK-STAT interferon signaling pathway. However, most of the IFN\u03bb4 is retained in the ER and causes ER stress. ER stress interferes with HCV antigen peptide loading and surface presentation by MHC-I complexes. As a consequence, T cell responses are attenuated, favoring viral escape from the cellular immune response that is known to be crucial for viral clearance.",

Full-length open reading frames (ORF) for IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03bb1, IFN\u03bb2, IFN\u03bb3, and IFN\u03bb4 were amplified using the primers shown in Supplementary Table 2 and cloned into the pcDNA4/To/myc-His B expression vector (ThermoFisher Scientific) or into the pCMV-mir-GFP expression vector (a gift from Jacek Krol). The IFN\u03bb4-TT expression plasmid was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of \"C 65 \" to \"AA 65-66 \" in the IFN\u03bb4 sequence. Recombinant IFN proteins were expressed in Huh7 cells by transient transfection with polyethylenimine (PEI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Myc-His-tagged secreted IFN\u03bb4, IFN\u03bb3, and IFN\u03b1 were purified from the culture supernatant 48 h post-transfection by Ni affinity chromatography using Ni Sepharose TM 6 fast gravity-flow resin (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specifically, Myc-Histagged proteins in supernatants were bound to the resin in buffer A (10 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM sodium hydrogen phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.8), and were eluted with buffer B (10 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM sodium hydrogen phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) after two times washing with buffers containing 10 mM and 20 mM imidazole, respectively. Purified proteins were concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 filters (Merck Millipore) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Because of the low amounts of IFN\u03bb4 secreted from cells, 10-fold more supernatant was used for IFN\u03bb4 than for IFN\u03bb3 purification. The purified IFN\u03bb4 and IFN\u03bb3 preparations were finally further concentrated to 0.3 and 0.5 ml, respectively. The identity and purity of the purified proteins were analyzed by western blotting using anti-IFN\u03bb4 (1:1000, Merck Millipore) and anti-IFN\u03bb3 (1:1000, Abcam) antibodies ( Supplementary Fig. 3a-c) . Because of the much larger starting volume and final concentration necessary for IFN\u03bb4 compared to IFN\u03bb3 purification, the IFN\u03bb4 preparation still contained some contaminating protein which we determined to be primarily carry over serum albumin that was present in the cell-culture supernatant used for protein purification (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) . Serum albumin however does not contribute to activation of the Jak-STAT interferon signaling pathway (Supplementary Fig. 3g) . Because of the contaminating serum albumin, however, the IFN\u03bb4 concentration in the purified preparation could not be directly measured. Therefore, the IFN\u03bb4 concentration was determined by anti-Myc-specific (1:1000, Cell Signaling) western blotting using the purified IFN\u03bb3 as a reference (Supplementary Fig. 3e ). The concentration of purified IFN\u03bb3 was determined independently with three different methods: (i) Absorbance at 280 nm (Nanodrop) using a protein molar extinction coefficient of 11,500 and a molecular weight of 26 KDa, (ii) Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) at absorbance 595 nm, (iii) 12% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining using bovine serum albumin (BSA) (SigmaAldrich) as a standard (i.e., 50, 100, 200, and 400 ng) ( Supplementary  Fig. 3d ).

Cells were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 h post-infection. Total cellular RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent and IFNL4 mRNA expression was quantified by RT-PCR as described above. Expression analysis of endogenously induced IFN\u03bb4 and IFN\u03bb3 was analyzed by Western blotting as described above using cell lysates harvested 6 and 12 h post-infection. Organoids were derived from liver biopsies of patients enrolled in this study. The study was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of North Western Switzerland (Authorization number EKNZ 2014-362). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in this study. Organoids that underwent hepatocyte differentiation were removed from BME2 using cold PBS and washed 3 times with PBS. Suspended organoids were then infected with Sendai virus (H4 strain) at an MOI = 10 for 1 h before seeding them back into BME2 as described above. For RNA extraction, organoids were released from BME2 by incubating with 0.25% Trypsin for 5 min at 37\u00b0C followed by Trypsin inactivation with DMEM/10%FBS, and total RNA was extracted using the ZR-Duet DNA/RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sendai virus RNA and mRNAs of IFNs and ISGs were quantified by RT-qPCR as described above using the genes-specific primers shown in Supplementary Table 3 . For the detection of endogenously produced IFN\u03bb4 protein, organoids were released from BME2 by incubation in Cell Recovery Solution (Corning) and subsequent processing using the Mem-PER Membrane protein Extraction Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

SR150 sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 550 System at the Institute of Medical Genetics and Pathology (University Hospital Basel) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Primary data analysis was performed with the Illumina Real-Time Analysis software (RTA version 1.18.66.3). Sequence reads were aligned by STAR 53 using the two-pass approach to the human reference genome GRCh37. Gene quantification was performed using RSEM, a software package for estimating gene and isoform expression levels from RNAseq data 54 . Gene expression analysis was performed using the edgeR R package 55 in RStudio v3.6. Specifically, genes with counts-per-million (cpm) < 1 in \u22653 samples were removed. Normalization was performed using the \"TMM\" (weighted trimmed mean) method. cpm values were log2-transformed prior to plotting by multidimensional scaling (MDS) using the top 500 pairwise variable genes. Differential gene expression analysis between SeV-infected and uninfected samples was performed using the quasi-likelihood F-test. Uninfected organoids at time points 0 and 12 h were treated as biological replicates. All tests were performed treating samples from the same organoids as paired samples. Genes with FDR \u2264 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Representative analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) term was performed with the clusterProfiler package 56 in dG and TT organoids, respectively. Gene Set Enrichment analysis was conducted to compare differences between SeV-infected organoids of dG and TT genotypes in pathway levels, with the R-package \"fgsea\", version 1.14.0 57 , and Gene Ontology-Biological Process (GO-BP) from MSigDB, version 7.2 58 . For fgsea, parameters nperm = 10,000 and minSize = 5 were set. As separating score, sign(logFC) * F-statistic was used, computed from the edgeR differential comparison of (dG.S-dG.PM) vs (TT.S-TT.PM). Leading genes of the selected pathway \"GO_RESPONSE_TO_ENDOPLASMIC_RETICULUM_STRESS\" were plotted as the log2 fold-change in expression levels induced by SeV infection in organoids of the TT genotype against the dG genotype.",

Data are representative of n = 3 independent experiments. b, c Huh7-LR cells were seeded in a 48-well plate and pre-treated with B18R (500 ng/ml) for 2 h or left untreated. After washing, cells were stimulated for 30 min with 150 \u03bcl of IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4 containing supernatants at the same dilutions shown in (a).

For gene expression analysis, Huh7 cells were transfected with IFNexpression plasmids or incubated with IFN supernatants from transfected Huh7 cells at the indicated time points. Cellular RNA was extracted and used for RT-qPCR as described above. The expression level of spliced sXBP1 mRNA was calculated relative to the expression level of total XBP1 mRNA. CHOP mRNA expression was calculated relative to that of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Huh-7 cells treated with 2 \u03bcM Thapsigargin (SigmaAldrich) for 4, 8, and 12 h served as a positive control for ER stress induction. HepG2 cell lines stably expressing IFN\u03bb4-GFP or IFN\u03bb4 p131-GFP were cultured in the presence of increasing amounts of \u03bcg/ml). After 24 h of doxycycline induction, IFN\u03bb4-GFP and IFN\u03bb4 p131-GFP expression in the cells and supernatant was quantified by western blotting using an anti-IFN\u03bb4 antibody (1:1000, Merck Millipore) as described above.Organoid culture and hepatocyte differentiation.
