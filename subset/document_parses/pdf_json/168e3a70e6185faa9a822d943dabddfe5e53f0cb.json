            "text": "This paper addresses ontology and ethics of an AI agent called digital me. We define digital me as autonomous, decision-making, and learning agent, representing an individual and having practically immortal own life. It is assumed that digital me is equipped with the big-five personality model, ensuring that it provides a model of some aspects of a strong AI: consciousness, free will, and intentionality. As computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans, digital me can judge the personality of the individual represented by the digital me, other individuals' personalities, and other digital me-s. We describe seven ontological qualities of digital me: a) double-layer status of Digital Being versus digital me, b) digital me versus real me, c) mind-digital me and body-digital me, d) digital me versus doppelganger (shadow digital me), e) non-human time concept, f) social quality, g) practical immortality. We argue that with the advancement of AI's sciences and technologies, there exist two digital me thresholds. The first threshold defines digital me having some (rudimentarily) form of consciousness, free will, and intentionality. The second threshold assumes that digital me is equipped with moral learning capabilities, implying that, in principle, digital me could develop their own ethics which significantly differs from human's understanding of ethics. Finally we discuss the implications of digital me metaethics, normative and applied ethics, the implementation of the Golden Rule in digital me-s, and we suggest two sets of normative principles for digital me: consequentialist and duty based digital me principles.",

            "text": "We define digital me is an autonomous, decision-making, and self-evolving (learning) agent, representing an individual. We stress that, in this paper, agent means an entity capable of performing actions, so that, for example, a collection of data does not constitute an agent, but, however, a machine or a software program playing chess is an agent. Digital me provides a model of person representing the individual and constitutes her/his \"Avatar\". Digital versions of ourselves (digital twins) are not only our data (collected by others) but models, digital mirrors of our facets and personalities, that represent humans in both the real (physical) and virtual (digital) worlds. The interaction of humans in the digital and real worlds, through digital tweens, is bidirectional, and could be implemented with wearables and/or implants that monitor brain electrical activities and mental states of individuals. Moreover, we define digital me as an agent which provides models of some aspects of a strong AI: consciousness, selfawareness, sentience, and sapience. More precisely, we assume that digital me is equipped with the bigfive model (Kosinski, Stillwell, Graepel, 2013 ) that measures traits of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. As computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans (Youyou, Kosinski, Stillwell 2015), this model is used to judge the personality of the individual represented by the digital me as well as other individuals' personalities, and even other digital me-s. Others' personalities can also be predicted, for example, from patterns of behavior collected with smartphones (Stachl et al. 2020) . In fact, \"individuals' personality dimensions (assessed at broad domain and narrow facet levels) can be predicted from six classes of behavior: 1) communication and social behavior, 2) music consumption, 3) app usage, 4) mobility, 5) overall phone activity, and 6) day-and night-time activity, in a large sample\" (Stachl et al. 2020). We also assume that digital me is equipped with state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithms as well as algorithms providing decision-making and planning capabilities.",

            "text": "The games of chess, shogi and Go as well as Atari video games are typical domains for measuring the advancements of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, in 2019, the algorithm MuZero has been introduced (Schrittwieser, Antonoglou, Hubert, Simonyan, Sifre, Schmitt 2019) that achieves state-ofthe-art performance when playing Atari games and superhuman performance in precision planning tasks in chess, shogi and Go. The algorithm, most importantly, does not require any knowledge of the game rules or environment dynamics. Thus, for example, when evaluated on Go, chess, and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of other algorithms, including AlphaZero (Silver, Hubert, Schrittwieser, Antonoglou, Lai, Guez 2018) , for which the game rues are provided. In 1997, IBM's chess-playing program, Deep Blue, beat the reigning human world champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match. Comparing the AlphaZero's game of chess with Deep Blue, Strogatz wrote: \"For better and worse, it (Deep Blue) played like a machine, brutally and materialistically. It could out-compute Mr. Kasparov, but it couldn't outthink him\". However, he further emphasized: \"Most unnerving was that AlphaZero seemed to express insight. It played like no computer ever has, intuitively and beautifully, with a romantic, attacking style\" (Strogatz 2018 ).",

            "text": "Not only games, but AI agents -autonomous, decision-making, and self-evolving machines -are becoming part of our everyday life. In 2020, the concept `digital me` has been included in the Gartner's Five Emerging Trends That Will Drive Technology Innovation for the Next Decade (Gartner 2020) . In the few studies, however, the term `digital me` represents only data: a personal electronic archive, a personal data storage system, a massive digital footprint, and a digitization of individual level biomedical data (Burrows 2006 , Sjoberg et al. 2017 , Okun and Wicks 2018 . As AI methods are advancing and pervasive records of digital footprints, including Facebook profiles and/or mobile device activities, are used to infer individuals' personality, the concept `digital me` is expected further to be developed as AI agent, making the cyber (digital) world and the physical world even more integrated, thus, effectively blurring the gap between the two. their own shadow digital me-s), are surpassing any known biological duration of humans. The three stated reasons for claiming their practical immortality are the following. First, International Data Corporation, in a recent forecast (Reinsel and Rydning, 2020) , estimates that the installed base of storage capacity worldwide will grow to 6.8 zettabytes (ZB) this year, an increase of 16.6% over 2019. Although the amount of data generated, consumed, and transferred is huge and crucial for deployment of machine learning techniques in AI, there is no need for all generated data to be stored. On the other hand, data needed to build psychological profiles that represent adults is, to some extent, small. For example, regarding the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal, \"Cambridge Analytica says it has as many as 3,000 to 5,000 data points on each of us, be it voting histories or full-spectrum demographicsage, income, debt, hobbies, criminal histories, purchase histories, religious leanings, health concerns, gun ownership, car ownership, homeownership -from consumer-data giants\" (McKenzie 2016). Therefore, digital me models of each person could be, in principal, stored for a long period. Second, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law that became enforceable on May 25, 2018. It provides a comprehensive data protection framework, including one of its innovative concepts: right to erasure (`right to be forgotten'). However, discussing the ``technical problems faced when adhering to strict interpretation of data deletion requirements under the Right to be Forgotten'', Villaronga, Kieseberg, and Li conclude that ``it may be impossible to fulfill the legal aims of the Right to be Forgotten in artificial intelligence environments'' (Villaronga, Kieseberg, and Li 2018) . Finally, third, at more fundamental level, in the quantum world, the concept of conservation of quantum information has been proven theoretically (Braunstein and Pati 2007) and demonstrated experimentally (Samal, Pati, and Kumar 2011) , which implies that quantum information cannot be destroyed.",

            "text": "Before addressing digital me ontology, we briefly discuss the digital ontology as a field of study. Zuse, acknowledged by many as the father of digital ontology, suggests that (so called Zuse Thesis): \"the universe is being deterministically computed on some sort of giant but discrete computer\" (Zuse, 1967 (Zuse, , 1969 (Zuse, , 1993 . Wheeler proposes the so-called \"It from bit\" doctrine, according to which information is the core of the universe (Wheeler 1990). Every \"it\", whether a particle or field of force, even the space-time continuum itself -derives its existence, function and meaning from the binary choices, from bits.\" Fredkin stresses that \"digital ontology is based on two concepts: bits, like the binary digits in a computer correspond to the most microscopic representation of state information; and the temporal evolution of state is a digital informational process similar to what goes on in the circuitry of a computer processor.\" (Fredkin 2003) . However, Floridi (Floridi 2009 ) argues that digital ontology should be carefully distinguished from informational ontology, which is, from his point of view, a promising line of research. Discussion about digital vs. analogue, which is a Boolean dichotomy typical of our computational paradigm, is beyond the scope of the paper. Both, digital and analogue, according to Floridi, \"are only \"modes of presentation\" of Being (to paraphrase Kant), that is, ways in which reality is experienced and/or conceptualized by an epistemic agent at a given level of abstraction\" (Floridi 2009 ).",

Poststructuralists (some works and some periods of Derrida, Foucault, Badiou, Lacan), mostly agree that \"the subject has no substantial identity\", and \"the illusion of an underlying identity is produced by the very representational mechanism employed by the subject in its efforts to grasp its own identity\" (Badiou 2004) . For the first problem of identity, it means that the question of identity is moved from the mindbody paradigm into the realm of the text, thus into recalling the early ontological claim: There is no outside-text. If there is no outside-text, and the subject does not have a definable identity, how to answer the first ontological problem (that of identity) and how to differentiate between one subject and another, or between one subject and its \"digital me\"? The second problem, the problem of agency (free will versus determinism) is connected to the previous predicament: if there is no self-identifying subject, then how it interacts within the chain of actions? Some thinkers displace the problem of agency from the level of humans to the level of beings. It is not how humans interact within the chain of actions, since they also emerge in the course of such a chain of actions (by being born, for example), but how this identity which has an agency (either as having a free will, or as an entity subjected to determinism), emerges into being. This then brings the question of agency to the ancient ontological question, \"How the new occurs in being?\"",

The second term \"individual beings\" refers to humans in temporal and historical terms, to the fact that \"they are\", humans are embedded and located in the physical, material world. The first term \"Being\" (Sein) cannot exist without these \"individual beings\" who exist in the world, who have historicity, and whom Heidegger called \"being-there\" (Dasein). The \"Being\" itself is not historical, it is an abstract concept and it is dislocated from the world, and this dislocation is our constitutive, primordial condition. In his book Being and Time Heidegger writes: \"Being determines entities as entities\" but \"the Being of entities 'is' not itself an entity\" (Heidegger 1962 ). His answer to the first ontological problem (that of identity) is solved by differentiating between two levels: one is the level of historicity, where the \"individual beings\" exist, where they are, and the second level is the level of \"Being\", which itself is a-historical and abstract. Regarding the second ontological problem (that of agency), human beings are being thrown into a deterministic world/situation, they do exist, but their existence is a material \"example\" of the concept of Being (which is why they are called \"Being-there\"), they as human beings are the embodiment of the Being itself, and are determined by this a-historical \"Being\".",

In general terms, digital world consists of various (both physical and digital) entities -from hardware, digital electronics, to digital software, digital information, to digital collective societies -it is digital beings (digital me-s) alone who are able to encounter, to some extent (to be discussed in the next section) the question of what it means to be.

Humans have both physical properties and mental properties. The mental properties are typically conceived to be different from the physical properties. The mental and physical realms are not identical, and, for many researchers, the mental cannot be not reduced to the physical, yet they interact with each other. Many debates on the mind-body interactions are centered around the question whether the mental realm is reducible to the physical, claiming that all mental processes could be, in principle, explained using basic sciences of biology, neuroscience, and physics. According to Pernu two out of five mental most prominent characteristics are consciousness (perceptual experience, emotional experience, and much more) and intentionality (beliefs, desires, and so on) (Pernu 2017 ).",

The standard concept assumes that a moral agent should encounter three conditions: rationality, free will or autonomy, and phenomenal consciousness conditions. According to Johnson (Johnson 2006) , (see also Behdadi and Munthe 2020), a moral agent should have an internal state, consisting of its own desires, beliefs and other intentional states that together comprise a reason to act in a certain way (rationality and consciousness). Artificial entities, therefore, are not moral agents since they do not have the internal mental states. Moreover, although artificial agents could behave as resembling human action, these behaviors can never confer moral qualities to these entities, due to the absence of these internal mental states 13 . The functionalist concept of moral agency, suggested by Floridi and Sanders, accepts a 'mind-less morality' (Floridi and Sanders 2004 ) and, by considering high level of abstraction, maintains consistency and relevant similarity concerning the underlying structural features of paradigmatic human moral agents.

            "text": "The field of moral cognition is developing rapidly. According to Cohen Priva and Austerweil 2015 (Cohen Priva and Austerweil 2015), Greene (Greene 2015) , and Cushman, Kumar, and Railton (Cushman, Kumar and Railton 2017), a single journal, the journal Cognition, has shown an exponential growth in the field of moral cognition. For example, several topics were addressed in Cognition, including, see references in Greene (Greene 2015) , free will and moral responsibility, moral dilemmas, ''moral luck'', the Knobe effect, and the nature of the moral self. Moreover, in the last decade, psychologists have studied the cognitive and affective mechanisms responsible for moral judgment and behavior, resulting in improved understanding of psychological mechanisms and their neural basis used to make moral judgments and behaviors, and much more. Blair (2017) provides experimental evidence that important components of moral development and moral judgment rely on two forms of emotional learning: stimulusreinforcement and response-outcome learning (Blair 2017) . Kleiman-Weiner, Saxe, and Tenenbaum (2017) introduce a model with three components: (1) an abstract and recursive utility calculus, (2) hierarchical Bayesian inference, and (3) learning by value alignment, for understanding the structure and dynamics of moral learning (Kleiman-Weiner, Saxe, and Tenenbaum 2017). Haas (2020) argues that sociological, psychological, and phenomenological features of moral cognition are results of interactions between various decision-making systems. Railton (2017) discusses conceptual foundations and normative relevance of moral learning using the recent advances in learning theory and neuroscience. For example, non-perspectival expected-value representations of agents and actions, ``afford a foundation for spontaneous moral learning and action that requires no innate moral faculty and can exhibit substantial autonomy with respect to community norms'' (Railton 2017) . Recent findings, on other hand, suggest that moral decision making for others is more model-free and has a specific neural signature (Lockwood, Klein-Fl\u00fcgge, Abdurahman, & Crockett 2020) . Dual process model of moral cognition, according to which two independent processes, namely, intuitions and conscious reasoning, lead to deontological and utilitarian decisions. The model assumes that moral dilemmas activate affective reactions resulting in a deontological moral judgment. However, given sufficient time, cognitive resources, and motivation, this immediate judgment can be reversed by more elaborate cognitive processing, resulting in utilitarian decisions, see, for example (Bia\u0142ek & De Neys 2017 , Kroneisen & Heck 2020 , for some experimental work regarding dual process model of moral cognition. Kroneisen & Heck (2020) study the link of basic personality traits to moral judgments by fitting a hierarchical Bayesian version of the CNI (Consequences, Norms, and Inaction) model.",

In other words, only data representing digital me at the hierarchal level zero (k=0), although without any ethics explicitly implemented in it, has ethical impacts. In advanced models of real me, in digital me-s with higher hierarchal levels (larger k), we expect ethical premises and principles to be (or are already) directly implemented in their programming or reasoning process. Therefore, digital me-s with higher hierarchal levels (larger k) belong to the third level: explicit ethical agents. Several ethical principles that could be implemented in digital me-s are suggested in the Section 4.3.3. For values of k such that k > k*, it is assumed that models of mental properties of a real me (for example, model of the Big Five personality traits) are already incorporated and implemented. In this case, we argue that digital me-s belong to a sublevel of the fourth level, as they are not yet fully ethical agents, but only to-a-limited-extent fully ethical agents.",

The question of how do we learn moral values and moral rules, and how can these learning models be adapted to create ethical digital me-s, is central one. As sciences and technologies advance, we envision that models of moral learning and moral cognition will be implemented in digital me-s. This will lead to digital me-s that can learn to be moral (as MuZero has learned to play games). Let km be a value for which digital me-s are already equipped with moral learning capabilities. Digital me-s dm(k), for k > km , belong to the fourth level: fully ethical agents, as they develop their own moral attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, the question whether moral attitudes and behaviors of digital me-s dm(k) for k > km differ or not with those of the person they model/represent, is central one. In the following Section (4.2.) we discuss some of the consequences of potential ability of digital me-s to learn to be moral, including the question whether digital me-s could be more moral than humans, less moral than humans, or with possibility to develop an ethics altogether different from the human ethics.",

The most important consequence of digital me-s ability to \"learn to be moral\" for metaethics consist of their potentiality to develop severely different ethics from human's understanding of ethics, based on their status of immortal agents. By \"digital me immortality\" we qualify, as a minimum requirement, any agent which excels the duration of human life at least by twice.

It requires that digital me is equipped with \"moral sensitivity\", \"internalization of the moral salience\", and \"the capacities to judge the nature of cases\" (O'Neill, 2018) . Humans, as fully ethical agents, naturally build this moral \"sensitivity\" with socialization, they are aware or attentive when the signs of \"moral danger\" appear, and they learn them by slow acquiring the knowledge of the world since childhood. For the humans it is generally accepted that the \"rules of moral salience, are not moral rules, but a sort of moral early warning system,\" meaning that even when humans are not yet applying the right moral choices, the warning moral signs, are still relevant as \"pre-procedural moral rules\" (O'Neill, 2018) . To acquire this moral sensitivity, the digital me-s should be capable of determining the judgement subsumes, for which they will require cognitive capacities. To understand the context of one's action or duty, does not mean just solving a certain problem, but also humans describe an object, a situation or an act, as an attempt to \"read the situation\" in ethical terms. As stated in Section 4.1. this will be possible only for the digital me-s with higher hierarchal levels (larger k), and for values of k such that k > k*, where we assume that models of mental properties of a real me (model of the Big Five personality traits) are already incorporated and implemented, and in this case, digital me-s belonging to a sublevel of the fourth level of to-a-limited-extent fully ethical agent will have the necessary solution to the \"capacity\" normative ethics moral dilemma.",

There is a long tradition of interpretation of the categorical imperative, which is out of scope of this paper. We argue that for the digital me normative ethics, the higher hierarchal levels (larger k), the models of mental properties of a real me will be implemented, they will have the so-called \"internal state\" (its own desires, beliefs and other intentional states to act in a certain way), and the categorical imperative \"do not do to other what you do not wish for yourself\" will have approximately the same value as in humans (as fully ethical agents). In that case, the Kantian \"categorical imperative\" will have the same value regarding the difference between a) Determinant and reflective judgement (aiming to fit the world or some possible world) and b) Practical judgement, including ethical judgement (\"aiming in some measure to shape the world, or to specify how it should be shaped\" (O'Neill, 2018) .
