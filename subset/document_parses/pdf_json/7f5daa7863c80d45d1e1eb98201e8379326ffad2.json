For the problems of Internet application network information security, attackers use attacks to continuously threaten them. This paper studies the method of information security monitoring and early warning mechanism for Internet application network based on particle swarm optimization. Based on the support vector regression machine, a network security prediction model with multi-group chaotic particle optimization is established. The prediction results are obtained through the network information security monitoring and early warning mechanism, and the prediction results are analyzed and summarized. The results show that the Internet application network information security prediction model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm can provide guidance for the development of network security solutions and strategies, enhance the initiative of network security defense, reduce the losses caused by network attacks, and have better practicality Sex.",

Kennedy and RC Eberhart in recent years. The PSO algorithm is a kind of evolutionary algorithm. It is similar to the simulated annealing algorithm. Starting from the random solution, it finds the optimal solution by iteration, and evaluates the quality of the solution according to the fitness. However, it is simpler than the genetic algorithm rule. It has no genetic algorithm. The \"cross\" and \"mutation\" operations seek global optimality by following the current searched optimal values. This kind of algorithm has attracted the attention of the academic community because of its high precision and fast convergence, and it has shown its superiority in solving practical problems. Particle swarm optimization is a parallel algorithm. The information security situation value of Internet application network based on particle swarm optimization is an important indicator to measure network security. The value of its value directly affects the quality of network security [1] . Establishing an effective network information security monitoring and early warning mechanism model can prevent network security incidents and play an important role in network security protection.",

The algorithm uses the randomness of chaotic principle, initializes the population particles in the initial stage, and divides the particles into three populations. Different populations adopt different updating strategies, and the convergence speed of the algorithm is accelerated by the synergy and information sharing among the three populations. The variance of the population fitness is used to judge whether the particles fall into local convergence, and chaotic processing is performed on the particles that are partially converged. It escapes from the local convergence point and avoids the phenomenon of \"premature maturity\" of the population with a certain probability, thus improving the optimization performance of the algorithm. The improved algorithm is tested by four standard test functions and compared with pso and ldw-pso to verify the algorithm has better performance.",

If the particle swarm algorithm optimizes the simple problem, the global exploration ability of the particle itself and the local development capability is not high, and generally the optimal solution for the optimization problem can be found. However, for complex optimization problems, if the particle happens to be near the global best of the population, the development ability of the particle is weak due to the strong exploration ability of the particle at this time. So that the particles are farther away from the neighborhood where the optimal solution is located; if the particles are in the neighborhood of the most favorable locality, due to the strong development ability of the particles at this time, the exploration ability is weak, and it is easy for the particles to fall into local convergence [2] . Therefore, when the population is initialized, the randomness of the chaotic principle is used to make the particles evenly distributed in the search range, and then the population is divided into multiple populations, so that different populations can exhibit different exploration and development capabilities. Some particle swarms have the ability to explore and optimize. Global search in the process; part of the particles have the ability to develop, local search in the optimization process.

The deviation parameter e is the distance from which the sample data deviates from the regression line, and the number of sample data affecting the support vector. If the value of e is relatively large, the number of sample data of the support vector is relatively small, and the error of the regression estimation is increased, and the precision is lower. If the value of e is relatively small, the number of sample data of the support vector is relatively large, and the number of samples is reduced. The accuracy of the regression estimate is higher. Penalizing the size of the parameter C not only affects the training error of the sample, but also affects the complexity of the regression model [4] . If the value of C is relatively large, the phenomenon of \"overlearning\" will occur. The larger C value imposes a heavier penalty on the sample data outside the e-band, increasing the number of support vectors, thereby reducing the training error of the sample and increasing The generalization ability of the model; if the value of C is relatively small, it will produce the phenomenon of \"under-learning\". The smaller C value will lighten the penalty of the sample data outside the e-band, reducing the number of support vectors and increasing the training. Error, reducing the generalization ability of the model. The kernel function parameter g is the width of the RBF, and its magnitude affects the corresponding width of the inner product kernel function on the input variable. If the value of g is too large, the regression function or the discriminant function is too gentle; if the value of g is too small, the training data may have a certain memory ability or an \"over-fitting\" phenomenon. In summary, setting reasonable parameters plays an important role in the generalization ability of the support vector regression model. By judging the error rate of the model algorithm, it can be judged whether the value of the model parameters is optimal [5] .",

Because the unimodal function itself does not have a local optimal solution, the algorithm does not fall into local convergence.
