            "text": "After a year of living with the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated consequences, hope looms on the horizon thanks to vaccines. The question is what percentage of the population needs to be immune to reach herd immunity, that is to avoid future outbreaks. The answer depends on the basic reproductive number, R 0 , a key epidemiological parameter measuring the transmission capacity of a disease. In addition to the virus itself, R 0 also depends on the characteristics of the population and their environment. Additionally, the estimate of R 0 depends on the methodology used, the accuracy of data and the generation time distribution. This study aims to reflect on the difficulties surrounding R 0 estimation, and provides Spain with a threshold for herd immunity, for which we considered the different combinations of all the factors that affect the R 0 of the Spanish population. Estimates of R 0 range from 1.39 to 3.10 for the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variant, with the largest differences produced by the method chosen to estimate R 0 . With these values, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) ranges from 28.1 to 67.7%, which would have made 70% a realistic upper bound for Spain. However, the imposition of the delta variant (B.1.617.2 lineage) in late summer 2021 may have expanded the range of R 0 to 4.02-8.96 and pushed the upper bound of the HIT to 90%.",

However, although these are the published figures, there were probably many more undocumented virus related deaths that were not recorded due to lack of tests [2] [3] [4] . After a year of struggling, restrictions to lessen the spread of the virus, a downturn in the economy and the cost of human lives, most people are wondering when the pandemic will end. The year 2020 ended with the hopeful approval of some vaccines 5 , but how many people must be vaccinated to return to pre-pandemic life? The answer is quite complicated since vaccines do not provide 100% protection against infections 6, 7 nor fully block the transmissibility of the virus [8] [9] [10] . However, it is theoretically interesting to study when the herd immunity threshold (HIT) will be reached, if possible, under the assumptions that immune population (recovered and vaccinated people) get permanent immunisation against the different mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and will not transmit the virus any further. In Spain, there is a general opinion that the HIT will be reached when 70% of the population becomes immune, which is not equivalent to 70% of vaccinated population in real life. Note that there is no single definition of HIT 11 and this can lead to misunderstandings. In this study, HIT will refer to the minimum proportion of the immune population that will produce a monotonic decrease of new infections, even if restrictions are lifted and society returns to a pre-pandemic level of social contact. The question is how realistic is a HIT of 70% for Spain.",

Replacing these equalities in Eq. (1) and operating, we get 15, 16 Note the direct relationship: the larger the R 0 , the larger the HIT; and that Eq. (2) makes sense only when R 0 > 1, since for values R 0 < 1 the disease will disappear naturally and the concept of HIT loses its sense. In Eq. (2) it is intrinsically assumed that recovered individuals cannot become susceptible again, that is, they cannot get re-infected nor transmit the virus after recovery. R 0 is used to quantify the transmissibility of the virus, which depends on the virus itself and the characteristics of the population that is being infected. Regarding other infectious diseases, typical values of R 0 are 0.9-2.1 for seasonal flu and 1.4-2.8 for the 1918 flu 17 , ~ 3 for SARS-CoV-1 18 and < 0.8 for MERS 19 . For COVID-19 in 2020, a systematic review of 21 studies, mainly in China, found R 0 ranging from 1.9 to 6.5 20 , which leads to HIT values between 47 and 84%. However, in 62% of these studies, the R 0 was between 2 and 3 (HIT between 50 and 67%). In Western Europe in 2020, an average R 0 was estimated at 2.2 (95% CI = [1.9, 2.6]) 21 , with a HIT value of 55% (95% CI = [47, 62] ). Therefore, 70% is an upper bound of HIT in 2020 in most of the cited cases, but not in all.",

Consequently, the first problem is to figure out the latest day, n 0 , before I(n) will abandon the strictly exponential growth because of the diminishing of the number of susceptible individuals. To estimate n 0 , we use the property that during the exponential growth I(n) is not only rising, but is accelerating with an increasing acceleration. Then, n 0 is the day where the first maximum of I\u2033(n), the second (discrete) derivative of I(n), is reached. For REMEDID I(n), from both official and MoMo data, n 0 is 23 February 2020 (Fig. 1c) . Figure 2 shows the least-squares best fit of Eq. (3) to REMEDID I(n) truncated at n 0 , whose parameters are: Considering the Bonferroni correction, the difference between the two estimates of r has a CI = [\u2212 0.0034, 0.0038], which has at least a 90% of confidence level. Since the CI includes the value 0, there is no evidence that these two parameters are different. Besides, a linearization of the model allows to perform a contrast of hypothesis www.nature.com/scientificreports/ on r, that confirms that there is no significant discrepancy between the two estimates of r. Then, REMEDID I(n) will be estimated from MoMo ED hereafter. Applying the same hypothesis for contrast, it can be observed that the a parameters are significatively different. However, since a value is not relevant to determine the growth rate, which is our aim here, we will not discuss its estimated values. If the same analysis were carried out with official I(n), which were not reliable at the beginning of the pandemic, we would get r = 0.2322 (95% CI = [0.2266, 0.2377]) and the end of the exponential growth on 5 March 2020. This value is significantly different, at least at 90% confidence level after Bonferroni correction, from the r estimated from any REMEDID I(n) since the CI of their differences do not include the 0. A contrast of hypothesis confirms this discrepancy. Note that despite the larger value of r from official I(n) the fitted exponential is smaller than those estimated from REMEDID I(n) (Fig. 2 ) because of the horizontal shift due to differences in the a parameter. The end of the exponential growth has been estimated from 7-days running averaged versions of I(n), I\u2032(n), and I\u2033(n) (Fig. 1a -c respectively). It has to be said that at the beginning of the outbreak, the official data underestimated the number of infections due to the low sampling capability.",

Unfortunately, such distribution is not as easy to estimate as that of the serial interval, which accounts for the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case to the onset of symptoms of a secondary case. This is because the time of infection is more difficult to detect than the time of symptoms onset. Ganyani et al. 27 developed a methodology to estimate the distribution of the GT from the distributions of the incubation period and the serial interval. Assuming an incubation period following a gamma distribution with a mean of 5.2 days and a standard deviation (SD) of 2.8 days, they estimated the serial interval from 91 and 135 pairs of documented infector-infectee in Singapore and Tianjin (China). Then, they found that the GT followed a gamma distribution with mean = 5. Figure 3 shows the probability density functions (PDF) of such distributions, f GT . The differences between them are remarkable. For example, the 54.5%, 81.0%, and 80.7% of the contagions are produced in a pre-symptomatic stage (in the first 5.2 days after primary infection) assuming GT 1 , GT 2 , and GT 3 , respectively. Theoretically, assuming that the incubation periods of two individuals are independent and identically distributed, which is quite plausible, the expected/mean values of the GT and the serial interval should be equal 29, 30 . The mean of the serial interval is easier to estimate than that of the GT. For that reason, we assume a mean serial interval as estimated from a meta-analysis of 13 studies involving a total of 964 pairs of infector-infectee, which is 4.99 days (95% CI = [4.17, 5.82]) 31 , is more reliable than the aforementioned means of the GT. This value is within the error estimates of the means of GT 1 and GT 2 , but not for GT 3 . Then, we construct a theoretical distribution for the GT that follows a gamma distribution (hereafter GT th ) with mean = 4.99 days and SD = 1.88 days. Table 1 ). In all cases, R 0 from GT th are within those from the three known GT distributions and indistinguishable from them within the error estimates. The lower (upper) bound of the CI is estimated as the minimum (maximum) R 0 obtained from all the possible combinations of 100 evenly spaced values covering the CI of r, mean GT and SD GT . Then, following the Bonferroni correction, the reported CI present at least a 85% of confidence level for GT 1 , GT 2 , and GT 3 , but it cannot be assured for GT th since the CI of its SD is unknown. In general, all these R 0 estimates are lower than those summarised by Park et al. 20 .",

In any case, assuming that REMEDID-derived infection data are more accurate than official data, 70% seems to be a good upper bound of HIT for the ancestral variant. However, the upper bound increases to 80% (accounting for the CI) if we rely on official data. Besides, the most important impediment to determine the value of the HIT is that it is variable in time. The more transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variants present higher R e , and in consequence a higher (theoretical) associated R 0 and higher HIT values. For example, the B.1.1.7 lineage (also known as alpha variant), which was first detected in England in September 2020 42 , and thereafter rapidly spread around the world. In Spain, at the beginning of January 2021, the alpha variant was ~ 30% of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, but it was over 80% from March to May 2021 43 . On the other hand, the B.1.617.2 lineage (also known as delta variant), first detected in India in December 2020 44 , has represented over 95% of the SARS-CoV-2 variants in Spain from late July to at least up to October 2021 43 . Both alpha and delta displaced the previous variants because of their higher transmissibly. Although the R 0 cannot be directly estimated for these variants since they appeared in the middle of the pandemic, the R e can. It has been estimated that the R e of the alpha variant is ~ 70% higher than in previous existing variants 45 . On the other hand, the R e of the delta variant is also ~ 70% higher than in alpha variant 46 . Following Eq. (1) and assuming that the variations of R e from one variant to another are not produced by changes in the control measures, it can be inferred that the R 0 of the alpha and delta variants are 70% and 189% higher than the ancestral variant, respectively. Therefore, if we take the highest estimate of R 0 in Table 1 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ specific HIT values for each region. It should be kept in mind that none of the three vaccines administered in Spain are able to completely prevent the transmission of the virus. Then, even with a 90% of the population vaccinated, the HIT will probably not be reached. However, it is true that the risk of infection is significatively reduced for vaccinated susceptible individuals 6, 7 , which directly reduces the R 0 . Besides, in case of infection, the transmission of the virus is also reduced [8] [9] [10] , which modifies the associated GT, and reduces the R 0 and the HIT of a vaccinated population. So, even if transmission is not completely prevented by vaccines, the greater the proportion of the vaccinated population, the lower the HIT. Therefore, it is expected that the HIT of a highly vaccinated population will be below the estimated 90% upper bound. However, all this may change with the emergence and spread of new variants with re-infection capacity 47 . In any case, even if the HIT is reached, it will not be the panacea. First, if HIT is reached in most places in a country but there are some specific regions or population subgroups in a region with a percentage of immune individuals below HIT, local outbreaks will be possible for those regions or subgroups. Second, the final size of an epidemic in a randomly mixing population with HIT = 70% and 90% is reached at 95.9% and 99.9% of infections, respectively 15, 37 . This means that if the ancestral variant would have not been replaced, the decreasing rate of infections after reaching a HIT of 70% may still produce a non-negligible 25.9% of infections, that is 12.2 million infections in Spain. Third, interpretation of HIT values must be done carefully and overoptimistic messages should be avoided as has been learnt from Manaus in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. In October 2020, it was thought that Manaus had reached the HIT with 76% of infected population 48 , which led to a relaxation of the control measures. However, either because the percentage of infected population was not accurately estimated or because the new SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant was capable of re-infecting, Manaus had a second wave in January 2021 with a higher mortality rate than in the first one 49 . Therefore, health authorities should strictly ensure an adaptive and proactive management of the new situation after theoretical herd immunity is reached.",

In theory, the basic reproduction number R 0 can be estimated as far as the intrinsic growth rate r, and the distributions of both the latent and infectious periods are known26,[32][33][34] . The latent period accounts for the period during which an infected individual cannot infect other individuals. It is observed in diseases for which the infectious period starts around the end of the incubation period, as happened with influenza 35 and SARS 36 . However, fromFig. 3it is inferred that COVID-19 is transmissible from the moment of infection, and we will assume a null latent period. Then, if the GT follows a gamma distribution, R 0 can be estimated from the formulation of Anderson and Watson 32 , which was adapted to null latent periods byYan 26 as    where mean GT is the mean GT and shape GT is one of the two parameters defining the gamma distribution, which can be estimated asFor GT th , we get R 0 = 1.50 (CI = [1.41, 1.61]) for REMEDID I(n) and R 0 = 1.76 (CI = [1.60, 1.94]) for official I(n).

(6), official data) as an upper bound of the R 0 of the ancestral variant, we get that 8.99 (CI = [5.32, 14.16]) is an upper bound estimate of the delta variant R 0 . In that case, we can conclude that an upper bound of the HIT at present in Spain is 88.9% (CI = [81.2, 92.9]). For a more realistic upper bound, we could alternatively take the maximum R 0 for REMEDID data in Table 1 (R 0 = 2.85, CI = [2.05, 3.25]; for GT 1 , dynamic model) as an upper bound, which would produce R 0 = 8.24 (CI = [5.92, 9.39]) and HIT = 87.9% (CI = [83.1, 89.4%]) as upper bound for the delta variant, in agreement with previous estimates46 . Then, a HIT of 90% seems to be realistic for Spain with a predominant delta variant as in October 2021.The presented results are valid for a randomly mixing population with a spread dynamic similar to Spain as a whole. However, even Spanish regions show different dynamics between themselves 23 , which may lead to https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-04440-z",
