Elective orthopedic surgery was forced to stop to allow the healthcare system to face the emergency. However, many orthopedic oncology cases could not be postponed. The aim of this study was to report the experience in managing sarcoma patients and the reorganization of a cancer center in an attempt to maintain it free from COVID-19. A Coronavirus Crisis Unit was established by the health directorate coordination in order to adopt specific procedures. General rules of screening and social distancing were applied in different health settings (entrance check point, hospital inward, outpatient clinic, operative room). Regarding oncologic orthopedics, priority was given to bone and soft tissue sarcomas, metastases and aggressive benign tumors at risk of impending or pathologic fracture. Precise indications were followed to manage first outpatient visits, patients undergoing surgery and follow-up. Meticulous adherence to rules among patients and personnel and collaboration between leadership and medical staff in order to continue to perform multidisciplinary treatment protocols, maintain the availability of infrastructural spaces and source protective equipment, swabs and screening samples have been successful in the aim towards a safe cure for cancer patients.",

One month later, according to the activation of the third phase of the emergency announced by the Ministry of Health, many hospitals and medical centers were reorganized in Hub and Spoke Units to ensure the implementation of intensive care beds and new multidisciplinary networks with infectious, medical, pulmonology and resuscitation specialties [2] .",

However, similar to trauma injuries, many orthopedic oncology cases could not be postponed [1, 5] ; these included bone or soft tissues sarcomas, bone metastases and some aggressive benign tumors because of their related risk of impending or pathological fractures. Soft tissue and bone sarcomas are rare malignant tumors, globally accounting for less than 1% of all new cancers diagnoses (<0.2% for bone sarcomas) [6, 7] . Management of these patients in reference centers with high levels of expertise and within reference networks and translational clinical trials is the key to improve the prognosis of these rare tumors [6] [7] [8] . Many patients, from children to elderly people, affected by primary or metastatic malignancies experienced the tragedy of the disease together with the fear of viral contagion. The task of remaining the referral center for \"no-COVID-19\" oncologic diseases given to our institute by the regional ordinance was challenging as the medical staff was unprepared to face this unprecedented threat together with the well-known frailty of cancer patients. Our institute is located in Rome and it is the reference cancer center for the Lazio region, which is the largest region in central Italy and the second most populated Italian region after Lombardy. According to the 9 April 2020 regional bulletin [9] , there were 4429 overall cases: 253 patients died, 644 patients recovered and 3532 were COVID-19-positive patients; of these, 1244 were hospitalized with mild disease, 198 required respiratory support in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and 2090 were in home isolation.",

A higher rate of patients needing mechanical ventilation or ICU admission, as well as a higher mortality rate, is reported for cancer patients in comparison with patients without cancer [12] [13] [14] . Unfortunately, many medical centers located at the outbreak epicenter, such as Lombardy, could not prevent intra-hospital infections and lacked ICU beds and adequate resources for inpatients [15] . The lower density and the slowdown of viral transmission in central and southern Italy gave more time to our regional healthcare system to reorganize local hospital networks. Despite the potential threat of SARS-CoV-2, to provide proper, prompt and safe treatment to cancer patients was a mainstay of the institute's governance at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. While ensuring all the medical and surgical activities for cancer patients followed international and national guidelines, our institute carefully complied with governmental, ministerial and regional provisions regarding the behaviors to adopt in order to avoid the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [16] . Every medical, diagnostic and surgical specialty adopted dedicated pathways and procedures for its patients according to the single characteristics of care.

A remote consultancy service came into force for those who needed to contact one of the specialists. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and related follow-up activities continued regularly. A drug domiciliation project for oral therapies was also developed in order to reduce patient hospitalization. Surgical activities proceeded and post-operative checks were regularly delivered. In-ward visits to hospitalized patients were limited to one visitor per day during visiting time, which was reduced to one hour. Visitors were strictly forbidden in the intensive care and resuscitation areas. Patients were instructed to carefully follow the indications provided by the healthcare professionals in all aspects of the center's activities. Reinforcement of a strict \"stay at home when ill\" policy was applied both to patients, their families and to medical and paramedic staff in case of traced exposure [18] . Disease management team briefings among multidisciplinary specialists were canceled to avoid crowding and interdepartmental consultations were available through business emails or telecommunication. All staff were instructed that they must wear full personal protective equipment (PPE) and were taught how to don and remove PPE in different settings of care (surgical and medical wards, operative theatre, ambulatory, diagnostic section, etc.) An adequate cleaning and sanitization of spaces was planned if a suspected or confirmed COVID-19-positive patient had been identified. Within the regional contact-tracing network, the epidemiological survey was always performed in case of COVID-19 positivity detection among both patients and personnel; testing with rhino-pharyngeal swabs in a dedicated service area of both symptomatic and asymptomatic staff members when they came in contact with potential COVID-19 positivity could have been the key to limiting exposures. All personnel with a history of possible COVID-19 contact were constantly monitored by the institute's occupational doctor.",

Therefore, outpatient waiting lists and surgical interventions needed a new prioritization. In setting priorities, the urgency was assigned for newly diagnosed high-or intermediate-grade sarcomas, relapse detected at follow-up and unstable clinical conditions postoperatively. All activities performed at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak are summarized in Table 1 . In the same way, the team had to continue the immediate and early postoperative controls and follow-up of patients at high-risk of local recurrence or systemic progression. In all cases, indication for surgical treatment and its most suitable timing were preceded by virtual multidisciplinary tumor board discussions that considered a start with neoadjuvant radiotherapy whenever possible, as defined by current guidelines [6, 7] . Preoperative and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation treatment were planned, giving high priority to malignant bone tumors and high-/intermediate-grade soft tissue tumors. Medical and radiation schedules were regularly performed for patients already undergoing treatment and in the context of a clinical trial whenever patient benefits outweighed the risks and when patient safety was ensured. Radiotherapy was considered urgent for acute spinal cord compression and high priority was given as palliative treatment for bleeding or painful non-pharmacologically responsive inoperable masses or painful bone metastases that were not surgically treated. Whenever possible and considered case by case, hypo fractionated radiation regimens were promoted in order to reduce hospital visits. When feasible, chemotherapy schedules were deferred to reduced clinical visits and blood tests and clinical monitoring of side effects were recommended near homes and under the control of the patient's general practitioner (GP). Domiciliation of oral therapies was extended to selected patients with metastatic sarcomas. Besides this, both patients and physicians could consult the platform dedicated to telemedicine. To keep the sarcoma unit free of COVID-19, it was essential to control the patients' access to services. We can distinguish between new cases and known cases.",

Despite the rarity of the disease, this statement also applies to bone and soft tissue cancer patients, who are often advanced in age and undergo multimodal treatment. Appointed as a reference center to support cancer patients during this emergency for all the oncologic structures of COVID-19-committed hospitals in the Lazio region, specific guidelines of COVID-19 risk management were developed in our institute in order to maintain the continuity of care with regard to medical treatment and surgery [18, 21] . Thus, it was imperative to maintain the hospital's no-COVID-19 status and the employee and leadership's aim was to guarantee clean pathways for patients with cancer as much as possible including inpatient hospitals, lab wards, operating rooms and outpatient clinics. In our experience, some principles were considered a priority: first, all cancer patients must be regarded as potentially infected; second, patient access to the sarcoma unit had to be kept untouched from risk of contagion; third, screening needed to be vernacular; and lastly, the orthopedic team had been advised to wear surgical masks and gloves for all patient encounters and to follow strict hand hygiene practices [3, 4] . As surgeons, utmost care was given to patients in the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative settings to minimize the risks of nosocomial spread. Despite worldwide cancellation of elective orthopedic procedures, surgical practice performed for sarcoma patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in our institute was in line with current literary guidance [5, 23] . In the same period that Italy dealt with the emergency, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) emanated recommendations for the management and treatment of patients affected by sarcoma [23] . Our approach was in line with the suggested risk stratification of priorities but some typical surgical cases have to be highlighted: (1) since unresponsive to chemotherapy and radiation, chondrosarcoma was treated with very high priority in the orthopedic unit; (2) bone metastases were treated regardless of the distinction between oligo-or pluri-metastatic patients as the risk for pathological fracture or untreatable pain was not postponed; (3) high priority was given to young growing patients for whom limb salvage surgery required reconstruction with customized implants. Prioritization of urgent cases and accuracy in minimizing risk of COVID-19 infection resulted in optimal tools to preserve our cancer patients.",

On the contrary, the infection slowdown in regions like ours allowed the preparation of regional governance to reorganize the healthcare network, to commit hospitals for COVID-19-positive patients and to reserve other centers for the treatment of patients that were not infected. Although the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a priority, cancer centers should make it their mission to do all that is possible to continue to keep their doors open in order to provide valuable care. Emerging literature reiterates the point that our duty is not only to educate but also to provide resources to help patients make decisions regarding treatment during this time of uncertainty. In a period when channeling a large amount of resources for a single patient is in direct conflict with the greater social good, cancer patients especially need individualized and rationed but safe treatments [15, 18, 21] .",
