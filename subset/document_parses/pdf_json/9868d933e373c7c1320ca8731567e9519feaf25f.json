The subcutaneous fat area (SF), the skeletal muscle area (SMA), and the muscle radiodensity attenuation (MRA) were measured at the level of the twelfth thoracic (T12) and the third lumbar (L3) vertebra. Necessity of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), length of stay, or time to death (TTD) were noted. For statistics correlation, multivariable linear, logistic, and Cox regression analyses were employed. Correlation was excellent for the SF (r = 0.96) between T12 and L3, and good for the respective SMA (r = 0.80) and MRA (r = 0.82) values. With adjustment (adj.) for sex, age, and body-mass-index the variability of SF (adj. r 2 = 0.93; adj. mean difference = 1.24 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-1.45]), of the SMA (adj. r 2 = 0.76; 2.59 [95% CI 1.92-3.26]), and of the MRA (adj. r 2 = 0.67; 0.67 [95% CI 0.45-0.88]) at L3 was well explained by the respective values at T12. There was no relevant influence of the SF, MRA, or SMA on the clinical outcome. If only thoracic CT scans are available, CT body composition values at T12 can be used to predict abdominal fat and muscle parameters, by which sarcopenia and obesity can be assessed.",

CT body composition parameters at L3 have been found to be of predictive value in many entities including COVID-19 9,10,14 . However, most COVID-19 patients only receive chest X-rays or thoracic CT scans and while there are reviews with hundreds of studies on abdominal CT body composition measurements 15,16 experience on thoracic CT body composition parameters is less profound, with especially few studies on thoracic CT body composition assessment in COVID-19 5,6,17 .

Exclusion criteria were: (a) non-ICU patients to generate a more homogenous collective, and (b) non-contrast-enhanced examinations because the muscle radiodensity attenuation (MRA) would differ between contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced scans 22 , which biases comparability between patients if no dual-energy CT scans for contrast-agent independent muscle characterization are available 23 .

At the level of L3, the abdominal muscles' outer and inner perimeter and the perimeter of L3 were manually contoured (Fig. 1a) . The SMA was then determined by applying a muscle-specific threshold (\u2212 29 to + 150 Hounsfield units (HU)) according to Gomez-Perez et al. 25 . The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated from the SMA by correction for body size (SMA [cm 2 ]/height 2 [m 2 ]). Additional regions of interest (ROI) were drawn along the waist circumference (WC) and around the whole abdominal muscles' circumference at L3. The subcutaneous fat area (SF) was calculated by subtracting the outer muscle area from the whole body area (WC ROI) after application of a fat-specific threshold (\u2212 190 to \u2212 30 HU) (Fig. 1b) . The visceral fat area was given by the ROI along the abdominal muscles' inner perimeter and the fat-specific threshold (Fig. 1c) . The MRA was determined from the whole abdominal muscle at L3 after application of the muscle-specific threshold (Fig. 1d ) to avoid underestimation of myosteotosis which can occur if measurements are restricted to, e.g., the psoas muscle 26 . Whole-body fat mass [kg] and visceral fat mass [kg] were calculated as proposed by Zopf et al., who have proven good agreement to bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) body composition results 13 .",

However, compared to the sex-, age-, and BMI-specific percentiles of van der Werf et al. for the MRA at L3, more men were below the 5th percentile (n = 26, 56.5%) and thus considered to have low muscle quality, than women (n = 17, 37.0%).

Of the multiple studies and reviews which have been published on CT body composition [34] [35] [36] , studies which investigated fat or muscle parameters at other heights than L3 are the minority. Concerning other abdominal levels, e.g., only one out 20 studies in a review addressing body composition measurements in cancer 34 , and 18 out of 177 studies in a review on the MRA 36 were not carried out at the level of L3. This may be explicable by the fact that the highest correlation of the skeletal muscle area to the whole-body muscle volume was described for analyses in the region of L3 37, 38 . Similarly, compared to number of studies at the level of L3 there are few studies on thoracic CT body composition measurements, e.g., in patients with lung cancer 39, 40 , or aortic valve repairment 20, 21 . In COVID-19, studies on thoracic body composition measurements have been carried out at the height of the 7th and 8th thoracic vertebra 6 , at T12 5,17 , and for different muscle groups like the pectoralis muscle 6 or the autochthones spine muscle 5, 17 . The variation of measurement levels, of employed muscle groups, and the difference between proposed thoracic cut-off values for sarcopenia detection [19] [20] [21] , however, illustrate the lack of experience with thoracic CT body composition measurements. This supports the alternative approach, 19 . As the SMI (SMA/height 2 ) is regularly based on measurements at the L3 landmark 11 , it was not calculated for T12 in this study. Instead, the correlation for the SMA at T12 and L3 (r = 0.8) was investigated, which was in the same range as the results of Nemec et al., who determined and correlated the SMI at both levels (r = 0.71) 20 .",

This is in accordance with Derstine et al. who described a significant variance of MRA values between T11 and L5 and 17 other thoracic and lumbar vertebrae pairings. It can thus be argued that MRA differences between the variable measurement heights are at least likely and thoracic MRA values cannot be simply considered representative for L3 values. Instead, the exact relation between T12 and L3 values as investigated in this study needs to be known.",

For example, Iannuzzi-Sucich et al. who assessed sarcopenia by BIA and clinical testing in a healthy older population, found men to be sarcopenic 4% more often than women, a discrepancy which increased in the age cohort of those over 80 years 42 . Similarly, higher rates of sarcopenic male patients have been described in some CT based body composition studies 43, 44 . However, it should be noted that contradictory study results with a slightly higher sarcopenia prevalence among women have also been published 45 and that the patient number of this study's collective was limited.",

Besides the overall patient number, this might be due to the study collective which consisted of already severely ill ICU patients, who furthermore had variable primary conditions (e.g., leukemia, cardiac, or renal primary conditions). Moreover, the predefined inclusion criterium of a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen, which in COVID-19 patients is only performed if an additional abdominal issue, e.g., due to rising lactate is suspected or for vascular imaging before installation of an ECMO therapy, caused a further selection of extremely ill patients. It is likely that in such study collective body composition parameters have less influence on the clinical outcome than other influencing factors as, e.g., bacterial superinfection, thrombosis, embolism, or bleeding. However, the negative impact of sarcopenia on the clinical outcome in the healthy older population 11, 46, 47 is known, and effects of obesity 7, 8 , reduced muscle mass 10 , or muscle quality 6 on COVID-19 patients have been described. Also, while no association for the FMR to IMV or time to death was found, Kottlors et al. have described its use to predict ICU admission 17 . Determination of muscle and fat parameters at L3 to detect sarcopenia, obesity, or sarcopenic obesity more reliably than by the body weight or BMI, is thus nevertheless relevant to ensure best nutritional support and physical therapy in COVID-19-patients.",

This is because COVID-19 patients beside chest X-rays mostly receive thoracic CT scans. The number of patients, who, due to severe disease progression or complications, needed CT scans of the thorax www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and abdomen was thus limited. However, all patients who received CT scans of the thorax and abdomen during the study period were included. The restricted number of COVID-19 patients with CT scans of the thorax and abdomen also highlights the relevance of this study: to evaluate the predictability of established abdominal fat and muscle parameters by thoracic values in patients who only receive thoracic CT scans. Concerning future studies, it would be interesting to apply this study's results to less seriously ill COVID-19 patients with thoracic CT scans, to better evaluate the relation of the predicted abdominal CT values to the clinical outcome. In this context care should be taken to not only employ cut-off-based sarcopenia classification systems, which inherently results in a loss of information but as done in this study additionally perform analyses of the metric measurement data. Finally, to improve measurement speed and prospectively include CT body composition measurements into clinical routine the use of (semi)automated body composition analyzes as evaluated for abdominal CT slices should be investigated for thoracic scans as well 48 .",
