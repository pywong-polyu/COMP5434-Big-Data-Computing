At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, most of the COVID-19 cases were imported cases, particularly from migrant workers. There were 587 confirmed cases and 10 deaths among migrant workers in Indonesia (14). A similar situation occured in Bali Province. During the early period of the COVID-19 epidemic in Bali, transmission was predominantly from imported cases including from repatriated migrant workers (15) .

Sometimes, migrant workers were considered rich, with high-class jobs and dignity (16) . After COVID-19, there was a negative stigma due to increasing COVID-19 cases among those groups. As the migrant workers sometimes experience rejection from their community, the government of Bali Province urged the public to stop stigmatizing migrant workers as \"COVID-19 carriers\" (17, 18) . This phenomenon affected the mental well-being of the migrant workers who returned to Bali. Moreover, the uncertainty about the economic situation in Bali could worsen mental health among migrant workers. In response to this, this study sought to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression among repatriated migrant workers in Bali during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also aimed to identify the factors associated with anxiety and depression. The result of this study might be important for the government to formulate the best approach regarding the prevention of mental health problems, particularly among migrant workers.",

            "text": "The results of this study provide meaningful findings to help policymakers and program developers to address the main factors that might influence the mental health status of the repatriated Indonesian migrant workers. This study found that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among migrant workers was 9.25, 10.15, and 2.39%, respectively. This was relatively lower than the mental health problem among the general population during the epidemic situation, which was about 30.3% for depression, 36.1% for anxiety, and 32.1% for stress (29) . Furthermore, this prevalence is also relatively low compared to healthcare workers, about 24% of whom report depression, 30% anxiety, and 40% stress (30) . This is surprising as we expected higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress due to the difficult situation experienced by the repatriated migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reasons for the differences could come from differences in the instrument used in the studies, socio-demographic characteristics, and recruitment strategy. The present study found that the younger age group was associated with higher anxiety, similar to the findings in Austria among the general population during the COVID-19 lockdown (31) . Additionally, the current study also found that higher educational attainment was linked with lower anxiety and depression. Different levels of knowledge and experience on coping strategies might explain why the older age group and those with a higher educational attainment have lower anxiety and depression (32) . Furthermore, this is because the younger age group experiences a range of changes in transition in behavior, education, and social and developmental challenges. The addition of mental health-related COVID-19 escalates mental illness among these age groups. Married people have lower anxiety compared to unmarried in the present study, which might be related to better social support from their partner or family (33, 34) . A study in China during the early point of the pandemic found different effects of quarantine on mental health status. An initial report revealed that quarantine was not related to mental health problems (35) , as opposed to other studies which reported the risk of mental health problems (36) . This study indicated that undergoin a 14-day quarantine was associated with lower anxiety and depression. These results might be related to the different sociodemographic situations, although is open to research to confirm the conflicting findings. According to the quarantine policy in Bali, the 14-day quarantine was recommended in the form of self-quarantine or centralized quarantine. As 64% of respondents experienced the centralized quarantine, lower anxiety and depression among migrant worker might be related to better health services provided by the government during quarantine.",

This implies the need to improve on health services during quarantine and that health promotion should be implemented to reduce the negative stigma related to COVID-19. Emphasizing the needs of migrants to stay away from their family, ensuring mental and physical support, and providing basic needs and effective counseling were considered as comprehensive health services to reduce mental health problems (43) .

The online survey which was based on self-report may be subjected to recall bias, self-bias, and a tendency to report socially desirable responses. Despite these limitations, this study contributes to the understanding of anxiety and depression among Balinese migrant workers. Lastly, further studies should consider exploring more about the mental health problems among migrant worker in more in-depth qualitative research. The results of this online survey could be used as baseline information to conduct qualitative studies in the future.",
