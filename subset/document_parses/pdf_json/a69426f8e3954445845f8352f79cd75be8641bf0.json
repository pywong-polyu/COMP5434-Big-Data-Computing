Thus, it is important for nurses to understand what virtual reality and its features are, how this technology has been used in the health care field, and what future efforts are needed in practice and research for this technology to benefit nursing. In this article, we provide a brief orientation to virtual reality, describe the current application of this technology in multiple clinical scenarios, and present implications for future clinical practice and research in nursing.",

The technology stimulates a user's multiple senses, enabling the user to interact with realistic 3D virtual environments [5, 8] . VR is different from augmented reality, which is another type of extended reality technology; while augmented reality superimposes digital data onto the real world, VR shuts out the real world and provides interaction with the simulated virtual world [9] . Simulated virtual worlds can be delivered in a nonimmersive or immersive manner. Nonimmersive VR implements the virtual environment by projecting it onto a large display or wall screen (eg, Powerwall screens and cave automatic virtual environments), while immersive VR commonly applies a head-mounted display to provide full immersion and interaction with the virtual environment [10] .",

Although VR has a comparatively short history in nursing, VR has been mainly used for nursing education purposes to optimize nursing students and nurses' acquisition of practical skills and theoretical knowledge. Some examples include urinary catheterization practice, basic life support training, and communication practice with patients having virtual dementia [3] . Most participants who experienced VR in medical and nursing education indicated that VR-based trainings were motivating and helpful in acquiring knowledge and skills [1, 3] . With the high demand for contactless learning due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the application of VR to health care education has never been more prominent.",

Current regimens in pain management, including surgical treatment, physical rehabilitation, or implantable drug-delivery systems, can be costly and ineffective [19] . Furthermore, opioids prescribed for pain control may lead to dependency and misuse [19] . Studies reporting positive results of VR interventions for pain management suggest that nurses working in a variety of care settings could use VR as an alternative therapy for pain relief [11] . In a randomized controlled study with 120 adults hospitalized in orthopedics or internal medicine with a pain score of at least 3 out of 10, those using multiple options of VR experience (eg, meditation, game, and nature experience) through a headset showed significant reductions in pain after 48 and 72 hours compared with those watching a television channel on health and wellness [8] . Importantly, the effect of this VR intervention was more pronounced in patients with severe baseline pain (pain score 7 out of 10) [8] . VR can also assist patients in coping with uncomfortable and even painful medical procedures [2] . Piskorz et al [20] found that 36 children whose attentions were distracted by playing or watching VR games during blood sampling reported significantly lower pain and stress than 21 children who did not experience VR.",

The participants described their trauma in detail while being exposed to VR scenarios simulating the attacks and reported significant decreases in PTSD, which in turn led to decreased depressive symptoms [16] . Another experimental study assessed the effects of up to 16 sessions of VR-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in 15 adult patients diagnosed with generalized social anxiety disorder [17] . The participants were exposed to behaviors and sounds of digital humans in virtual environments that simulated places that might trigger anxiety for these individuals, such as crowded caf\u00e9s or supermarkets. This study indicated that VR-based CBT can be effective in improving social anxiety and depressive symptoms [17] . These studies suggest that VR may be a useful adjunct to psychotherapy to safely expose individuals to their traumatic triggers in a carefully controlled environment, enabling them to establish healthy cognitive coping skills over time.",

Mekbib et al [24] developed a VR-based rehabilitation system and validated its therapeutic potential in 23 recent patients who had stroke. The system provided upper extremity training in an immersive virtual environment and was effective in recovering upper extremity motor function when combined with conventional occupational therapy [24] . Regularity and repetition are essential in rehabilitation training for individuals with neurological disorders; however, motivation and adherence often decrease over time [18] . VR combined with traditional rehabilitation training may improve motivation and training outcomes. Winter et al [25] demonstrated that VR-based treadmill training improved motivation and gait rehabilitation in 36 healthy participants and 14 patients with multiple sclerosis or stroke. VR-assisted therapy is also promising for rehabilitation of children with neuromotor impairments. In the study by Bortone et al [26] , VR games were introduced to 8 children with cerebral palsy or developmental coordination disorder through immersive virtual environments and wearable haptic devices, improving the children's functionality of upper extremity.",

Nurses may introduce relaxing VR experiences to reduce stress and anxiety in patients undergoing uncomfortable and painful procedures or surgeries [27] . VR can be a supportive medium to alleviate distress of patients undergoing intense treatments, such as chemotherapy [28] . Entertaining elements of VR can be effective in relieving pain and promoting psychological well-being in hospitalized patients, especially pediatric patients who tend to be more interested in gaming technology [29] . For patients with impaired cognitive or neuromotor functions, VR-based programs may stimulate their interests and motivate them to engage in long-term therapy sessions or rehabilitation [17, 25] .",

While caring for individuals with acute or chronic conditions, caregivers often experience high levels of stress and associated multiple symptoms (eg, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and impaired cognition) due to the burden of caregiving tasks and changes in their circumstances [30] . Caregivers tend to be reluctant to leave the patient to practice their own health-promoting activities [31] , but limited resources are available that enable caregivers to cope with stress without leaving the side of the patient. Through a VR platform, caregivers could briefly escape their real circumstances by exploring peaceful nature scenes or practicing mindfulness, which may lead to stress reduction and symptom improvement.",

While some patients and caregivers are interested in and willing to use VR, others may be skeptical about the technology [8] . They may think that using VR takes away therapeutic encounters with care providers, and those with less affinity for technology may be somewhat averse to trying VR [32] . As such, the acceptance of VR depends on each person's characteristics and perception and attitudes toward VR use [32] . More evidence should be generated regarding factors closely associated with VR acceptance. To optimize the opportunities VR can provide in health care, nurses need to first become familiar with the technology so that they can introduce and educate patients and caregivers about VR-based programs. It is important to create an environment that supports nurses to be competent in using digital health technologies, including VR [33] . Efforts also should be made to evaluate and improve user-friendliness and usefulness of VR-based programs perceived by various users [34] .",

Expanding scientific research of physiological markers (eg, pulse rate, cortisol, cytokines, and genomic DNA) or neuroscientific measures (eg, real time functional magnetic resonance imaging) will also contribute to understanding the impact of VR interventions [35, 36] . In addition, research on VR use in care settings should be practical, examining not just whether the interventions are effective, but also whether they are feasible for nurses to use in their practice and satisfactory to subjects [37] . Another important consideration when it comes to VR research is designing the research based on theoretical knowledge. Designing VR research referring to well-validated theories helps develop interventions that reflect the characteristics and needs of the target population; however, existing VR studies have rarely discussed theoretical components [34] . Further efforts are encouraged to develop and perform clinically meaningful and methodologically robust theory-based VR research.",
