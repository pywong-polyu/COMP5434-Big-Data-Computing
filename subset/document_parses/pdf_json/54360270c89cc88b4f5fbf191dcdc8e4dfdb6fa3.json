Their experience reflects how cardiac surgery has been adapted safely in the high-income developing country of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) during these unprecedented times. 9 While T&T have the second highest income per capita in the region, national health indicators significantly lag behind economic growth and substantial pockets of poverty remain. 10 Despite its small population of 1.40 million, T&T has the world's 34th highest population density, similar to that of the United States of America. It has had, nonetheless, remarkably low COVID-19 cases (142 cases per one million population, perhaps reflecting a low testing rate) and low associated deaths (eight deaths in total).The twin island state therefore provides a unique opportunity to examine successful strategies to safely deliver cardiac surgery in a developing country. 11, 12 These changes may subsequently be compared with low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), in addition to their developed counterparts. Like many countries across the globe, the burden on healthcare services resulted in the suspension of all elective surgeries in T&T. 9, 13 Their deferral proves to be an important step in enabling the reallocation of limited staff to intensive care units (ICUs) and rationing the use of supplies including PPE and blood products. that patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are more likely to have unfavorable clinical outcomes with COVID-19 infection. 14 In T&T, these aggressive policies took the form of a mass restructuring of healthcare into \"parallel systems\" with \"hot\" (COVID-19 presumed or proven) and \"cold\" (COVID-19 negative) centers. 9 While such a strategy has been possible in high-income countries, limited accessibility and border closures in LMICs meant many were forced to rely on a single center to cope with a surge in COVID-19 infections.",

There has been a need to differentiate between patients requiring urgent care and those for whom surgery can be safely postponed. 3 Risks of deferring surgery include worsening of the patient's condition, which may subsequently compromise their fitness for later procedures. To make this distinction, international cardiac services were required to triage and prioritise their patients. A notable difference between T&T and other HICs, was the use of telemedicine. An important aspect of telehealth in cardiac surgery was tele-triage, allowing for the risk stratification of patients. 20 Within PLECS, patients were categorised into four levels based on their urgency. Elective patients were classified as level 1; level 2 consisted of patients at home in need of urgent care; inpatients occupied level 3 and level 4 were emergency cases requiring urgent surgery. 16 While telecardiology has been recommended by the American College of Surgery, T&T continued to triage utilising MDT (cardiac surgical teams) in preoperative clinics, with enforced social distancing measures. 9 Assuming that the 58 patients operated on during the two-month study period were distributed evenly, this is a manageable footfall for a department, however this model is unlikely to have been possible in services with larger caseloads.",

            "text": "There are some parallels between the management of patients requiring cardiac surgery in developed and developing countries. preoperative RT-PCR. 9 Given that 43% to 60% of patients with COVID-19 are thought to be asymptomatic, this has implications for risk stratification and preventing disease spread. 3, 23, 24 Therefore, testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is important as many of such patients are asymptomatic and may have subclinical infections which could have significant impact on perioperative outcomes. 25 An international cohort study, including 1128 patients, organised by COVIDSurg Collaborative, report a 23.8% postoperative 30-day mortality (n = 268) in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. 26 In addition to an increase in overall mortality, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients with COVID-19 is thought to increase the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is hypothesised that exposure of blood to non-endothelial surfaces during CPB triggers a proinflammatory response, increasing both tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 10, 16 two cytokines implicated in ARDS in 27 Given the associated risks and frequency of AGPs involved in cardiac surgery, preoperative testing plays a significant role in resource allocations. Thus, in developing countries, where testing may be restricted, the authors demonstrate the two different approaches to dealing with this conundrum. In the private sector, they demonstrated the use of prioritising tests to high risk groups (those undergoing cardiac surgery) and in the state hospitals ensuring that all other preventative measures were executed rigorously. One possible method to do so is by implementing a preoperative testing algorithm, such as one recommended by Patel et al, 3 based on patients' travel, exposure history and community prevalence. This is perhaps a more reliable method than symptom manifestation. Such testing mechanism should be complemented by strict preoperative shielding measures, the likes of which have already been implemented within T&T. 9 Surgical equipment and SARS-CoV-2 testing have not been the only global scarcity during this pandemic. Blood transfusions have also been restricted due to a limited number of blood donations, secondary to national and regional lockdowns. Such issues have been reported by Ramsingh et al to have particularly affected T&T causing a national shortage. 9 They were able to mitigate for this by utilising off-pump coronary surgery and use of autologous blood transfusion. The impact of COVID-19 has been felt throughout healthcare systems across the globe, indiscriminately affecting developed and developing nations. 31 In many specialties including cardiac surgery, caution and improvisation has been essential to continue provide services to those in whom the risks of the natural history of their disease outweigh those of the risks of catching COVID-19 in hospital. 32 This is particularly true of cardiac surgical disease. Between the 190 countries that have been affected by COVID-19, each nation's accessibility to such resources vary widely. Ramsingh et al demonstrate well that basic measures, such as social distancing, mandatory preoperative isolation and rigorous PPE can supplement and mitigate for reduced access to swab testing. They demonstrate well that there is no universally applicable worldwide framework for the provision of cardiac surgery during the pandemic. Individual nations' responses to the pandemic must consider their service burden and availability of resources, including staff and undertake appropriate surgical prioritization, triage and preoperative assessment. It appears to be possible to balance the risks of peri-operative COVID infection with those of advanced cardiac pathology. 33 ",

By comparison a third of this number were performed by the authors' (AAH/BHK) single tertiary level hospital in the United Kingdom. The extent of the availability of this testing depends on many factors, including access to financial resources within healthcare services. While private hospitals in T&T are able to provide preoperative RT-PCR testing for all patients, this is not the case for public healthcare services. A limited availability of tests resulted in only symptomatic cardiac surgical patients received",

During COVID-19, many healthcare systems reallocated surgical staff to the emergency frontline and ICUs to overcome the burden of the pandemic. 4,8,29 Although Ramsingh et al reported that many countries, such as UK, Italy, and Canada have practiced the redeployment of cardiac surgical staff to general critical care areas to facilitate ventilated patients with COVID, their own staff redeployment remains unclear. The mandatory 2-week isolation of cardiac surgical staff outside of work was an additional precaution made in T&T that was particularly patient-centric. Such requirements of healthcare workers would probably not be feasible in developed countries but were implemented in T&T to compensate for the reduced levels of testing. Before the pandemic, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery estimated a need of 20 surgeons, anaesthesiologists and obstetricians per 100,000 population for LMICs to meet the burden of surgical disease. Yet, statistics show LMIC only met half of this recommendation.30 This shortage may only be compounded by deficiencies in PPE, staff burn-out and inevitable exposure of health care workers to SARS-CoV-2.8",
