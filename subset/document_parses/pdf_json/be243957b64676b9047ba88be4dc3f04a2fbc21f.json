In this Point of View paper, currently available evidence is summarised regarding the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) during this pandemic. de Vries concludes that, although further research on the influence of bloodpressure-lowering drugs, including those not targeting the renin-angiotensin system, is warranted, there are presently no compelling clinical data showing that ACEIs and ARBs increase the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 or worsen the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections. At the moment it appears that the pathophysiology of COVID-19 seems to predominantly affect the respiratory system. van den Heuvel et al. [6] describe the cardiac involvement in hospitalised COVID-19 patients, as they frequently display elevated cardiac biomarkers. They found no relation between elevated troponin T or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels and left or right ventricular function, while adding that echocardiography is of limited value in screening for ventricular failure in hospitalised COVID-19 patients.",

[8] provide us with practical recommendations for continuing to provide cardiac rehabilitation services. Current public health measures and reorganisations in outpatient cardiac care render traditional centre-based cardiac rehabilitation almost impossible. In addition, they describe the potential negative influence of public health measures on lifestyle behaviour and general well-being. As we need to find a way to continue regular cardiac care amidst this crisis, Vendrik et al. [9] propose a means of enabling ongoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI). TF-TAVI in current practice is predominantly performed as an elective catheterisation laboratory procedure, and the COVID-19 crisis has created a relative unavailability of anaesthesiological support. The authors describe the performance of TF-TAVI with a dedicated nurse performing local analgesia instead of an anaesthesiologist as feasible and safe in a selected group of patients. Continuing to perform TAVI procedures in this way may theoretically prevent non-COVID-related deaths. Finally, limited evidence regarding cardiovascular complications and long-term outcomes of COVID-19 in (elite) athletes and non-hospitalised patients is available. Verwoert et al. [10] provide us with a practical guide to pre-participation screening, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies after COVID-19 in athletes, as less stringent restrictions for sports and exercise will soon be employed.",
