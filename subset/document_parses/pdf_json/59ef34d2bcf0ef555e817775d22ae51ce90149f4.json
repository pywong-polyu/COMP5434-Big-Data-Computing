The recommendations of the disease control bodies are focused on disease prevention and control measures to minimize spread and to reduce the burden on the healthcare system. [6] [7] [8] Vaccination is an effective preventive measure reducing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious agents. It constitutes the mainstay of prevention of infectious childhood diseases and is of major importance in primary health care. 9 Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant drive to find an effective vaccine with several vaccines at various stages of drug trials and some already being tested in humans across various countries. 10, 11 However, the success of this vaccine will be dependent on the acceptance and uptake level and the subsequent development of herd immunity. 9 In recent times, there has been a growing anti-vaccine movement, 11 it is therefore imperative to explore the barriers and drivers of uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine to help the government, policymakers, and health care workers mitigate the impact of probable low vaccine uptake.",

Malik A. 25 in his study in the United States (US) also found that 67% of participants would be willing to accept the vaccine. About one-fifth of the respondents in this study were indecisive; a finding similar to the one reported among healthcare workers from a study conducted by Fu C. et.al. 26 Strikingly, there was an aversion to multiple vaccine doses among those willing to take the vaccine with most preferring the oral and the injection routes over other potential routes of administration This information is important for policymakers to improve uptake and compliance, especially if multiple route options become available. About one-fifth of the respondents were unwilling to receive a potential vaccine which appears to stem from skepticism about the safety of the potential vaccine. For instance, in this study, the majority were unsure if the potential vaccine is 'a mark of the beast' or if the motive is 'to reduce the world population'. This is comparable to the findings in the study by Thunstrom L. et.al 9 where it was reported that 20% of the US population would decline the vaccine.
