Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are important for viral clearance and are considered key to recovery and protection against viral diseases. Depending on the isotype (IgM, IgA, IgG, etc.), NAbs have different roles in viral clearance and disease prevention. 1, 2 One previous study showed that the presence of NAbs from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against reinfection, 3 and NAbs levels have been used as a standard with which to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines. 4 Passive antibody therapy has been used as a potential therapy for infectious viral diseases, where the efficacy of such therapy was found to be associated with the concentration of NAbs in the plasma of recovered donors, 5 and studies have reported that convalescent plasma therapy could be a potentially effective treatment option for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 1, 6, 7 Therefore, identifying the characteristics, including titers, of NAbs in Koreans who have recovered from COVID-19 could help conduct proper convalescent plasma therapy.",

One study demonstrated that severe COVID-19 is associated with higher antibody production and neutralization titers and that the development of neutralizing humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 appears to increase survival. 9 In the aforementioned study, of 113 patients, only 18 did not require hospitalization. Further studies are needed to determine how the immune responses in relation to NAbs operate in mild cases, which account for most COVID-19 infections. In addition to severity, it is also necessary to identify other factors related to NAbs titers. Therefore, we first measured SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers in the plasma of 143 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and determined the antibody-positive persistency rate. We then investigated associations between NAb titers and clinical characteristics.",

To confirm the possibility of participation in the study and to arrange blood sampling hospital visits, cellular phone text messages were sent to recovered CO-VID-19 patients in Daegu. Individuals who agreed to participate in NAb-tracking study were recruited from the Kyungpook National University Hospital located in Daegu city. We included patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 19 to March 28, 2020. Patients aged <18 years or those who were unable to make a voluntary decision to participate in the research, such as patients with mental illness, were excluded. From June 3 to June 23, 2020, blood samples were collected from 143 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19-recovered patients. On the day of hospital visitation, a survey of clinical characteristics was conducted using an individualized questionnaire that assessed basic demographics, clinical symptoms at COVID-19 diagnosis, persisted symptoms until the survey date, and admission information. Confirmation of the original diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and epidemiological information were provided by the Daegu Center for Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention. Clinical data, including the first symptom onset date, disease severity, and underlying diseases from the survey, were reevaluated and matched with the Daegu Center for Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention data registry.",

High NAb titer was defined as NAb titers higher than the median value. Sequelae in this study were defined as newly identified symptoms after COVID-19 diagnosis that persisted until the survey date. Reinfection with COVID-19 was defined as clinical recurrence of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 accompanied by positive PCR (Ct<35) at more than 90 days after the onset of the primary infection supported by close contact exposure or outbreak settings and no evidence of another cause of infection. 12",

All samples were transported in a frozen storage form. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was conducted at the Department of Microbiology of Korea University in Seoul, where a bio-safety level three facility is available. The neutralization activity of plasma from COVID-19-recovered patients was analyzed by PRNT. The SARS-CoV-2 of S clade (BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020, NCCP 43326) was used for neutralization activity analysis. The neutralization assay was performed in accordance with the following steps: In the PRNT measurement, the antibody sample was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline at 1:10 and further serially diluted two-fold in stages. The diluted antibody samples (100 \u00b5L each) were mixed with the same volume of virus (100 PFU in 100 \u00b5L) and reacted for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After 1 h of reaction, the whole reaction mixture was used to inoculate Vero cells for the subsequent plaque assay. Virus-inoculated Vero cell plates (NEST Scientific, #703003; SPL Life Sciences, Pochen, Korea) were overlaid with agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 3 days. The plates were then stained with crystal violet (GeorgiaChem, #548-6-29; Georgia Chemicals Inc, Norcross, GA, USA) to visualize the plaques formed by replicating non-neutralized infectious virus. PRNT50 was determined as the maximum antibody dilution fold value that reduced the number of plaques by >50%, compared with the control that was untreated with antibodies.",

To determine the factors associated with high NAb titer (\u226580), univariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Among these predictors, multiple logistic regression by the stepwise method was used to determine factors contributing significantly to the prediction model. All tests were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using R statistics v.4.0 (The R Foundation; https://www.r-project.org, Vienna, Austria).",

This result can be referenced in selecting plasma therapy donors with a high probability for higher levels of NAb. However, high levels of antibodies with low neutralization potency could potentially increase clinical severity of COVID-19. 9 Therefore, using convalescent plasma as a treatment strategy requires attention because severely ill patients can have low neutralization potency.

            "text": "Wu, et al. 21 reported that 10 (6.0%) of 175 patients showed NAb titers below a detectable level with neutralization assay (<40), even 2 weeks after hospital discharge. However, interestingly, a previous study showed that some asymptomatic seropositive individuals could generate NAb titers >1000 at an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms, and highly potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been isolated from asymptomatic patients. 22 Recent research conducted in London found that some individuals maintain NAbs titers >1000 at >60 days post-onset of symptoms, whereas others have NAbs titers approaching baseline within 94 days. 23 There is a need for an attempt to determine the factors associated with the persistency of high NAb titers. Studies seeking to identify factors associated with high NAb titers have been conducted on eight ICU patients and 42 non-ICU patients in China. Multivariate analysis revealed that oxygen requirement and fever were the only factors associated with a higher NAb response. 18 One study conducted on 126 patients demonstrated that male sex, advancing age, and hospitalization were associated with increased antibody responses across serological assays. 24 However, in our study, while sex was not associated with high NAb titers, age and disease severity were factors associated with NAb titers \u226580. One study conducted in Shanghai, China demonstrated that older patients had significantly higher titers of NAbs than younger patients at the time of discharge. 25 Another study reported that older patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing severe and critical disease than younger adults. 26 Our study also revealed similar results: older age (\u226550) was associated with NAb titers \u226580 in COVID-19-recovered patients at a median of 109 days after the date of symptom onset. A possible explanation for this finding is that older patients with COV-ID-19 infection tend to have more severe diseases than younger patients, and enhanced inflammatory responses associated with increased disease severity could drive higher B-cell recruitment and consequently more antibody production. Therefore, the magnitude of antibody responses may also likely be correlated with disease severity. This hypothesis suggests that patients with more severe diseases are more protected against reinfection: those with asymptomatic or mild disease could be more vulnerable to waning immunity over time because the initial immune response was not as strong as that in patients with more severe disease. 20 One retrospective cohort study showed that prior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection (\u226590 days after initial testing) and that symptomatic disease results in protection rates of 81.8% and 84.5%, respectively. However, the NAb detection was not implemented in this study. 27 Therefore, till date, the protective level of NAb titers in humans has not yet been identified. In an animal study in ferrets, direct-contact transmission was observed only from reinfected ferrets with low NAb titers (<20). 28 In our study, no pa- tient had symptomatic reinfection with COVID-19, even in patients with NAb titers <20. However, we should also consider environmental conditions that may result in the possibility of a decrease in social activities among recovered COVID-19 patients than in non-infected individuals due to sequelae or a more precautious attitude, thereby preventing COVID-19 reinfection, or national restrictions of mandatory mask wearing at public facilities. It would be important to follow up with patients to evaluate protective NAb titer levels, which may have a significant implication on vaccination strategies in recovered COVID-19 patients around the world. Simultaneously, understanding NAb responses is clinically important, especially in relation to the use of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin therapy. 18 Our study has several limitations. First, since NAb titers were measured at one cross-sectional point, and NAb development kinetics could not be detected from the acute COVID-19 period. Therefore, we could not identify if NAb titers were lower in milder patients or if NAb titers had waned. However, we showed that the NAb responses depend on age and disease severity. Second, there were only 12 and four patients in the severe and critical disease groups, respectively. Thus, the small number of patients could limit the interpretation of our study results. However, this study included patients aged 60-69 years with mild or severe cases concurrently and demonstrated results from the largest number of patients in each specified age group. Third, all patients included in this study were adults, and it is necessary to investigate NAb responses in children. Fourth, clinical information, such as laboratory findings during hospitalization or specific treatments, including steroids, that may affect NAb titers was excluded. In regards to NAb measurements applied in this study, since the S clade was targeted, further NAb titer research on the other clade or variant SARS-CoV-2 strain and on utilization according to NAb isotype will be needed. Also, analysis of the qualitative characteristics of antibodies and potency index are required.",
