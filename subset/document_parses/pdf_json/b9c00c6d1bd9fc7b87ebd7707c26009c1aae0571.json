            "text": "Background: SARS-CoV-2 has challenged health service provision worldwide. This work evaluates safe surgical pathways and standard operating procedures implemented in the high volume, global city of London during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also assess the safety of minimally invasive surgery(MIS) for anatomical lung resection. Methods: This multicentre cohort study was conducted across all London thoracic surgical units, covering a catchment area of approximately 14.8 Million. A Pan-London Collaborative was created for data sharing and dissemination of protocols. All patients undergoing anatomical lung resection 1st March-1st June 2020 were included. Primary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection, access to minimally invasive surgery, post-operative complication, length of intensive care and hospital stay (LOS), and death during follow up. Findings: 352 patients underwent anatomical lung resection with a median age of 69 (IQR: 35\u00c086) years. Self-isolation and pre-operative screening were implemented following the UK national lockdown. Pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 swabs were performed in 63.1% and CT imaging in 54.8%. 61.7% of cases were performed minimally invasively (MIS), compared to 59.9% pre pandemic. Median LOS was 6 days with a 30-day survival of 98.3% (comparable to a median LOS of 6 days and 30-day survival of 98.4% pre-pandemic). Significant complications developed in 7.3% of patients (Clavien-Dindo Grade 3\u00c04) and 12 there were re-admissions(3.4%). Seven patients(2.0%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, two of whom died (28.5%). Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increases morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing elective anatomical pulmonary resection. However, surgery can be safely undertaken via open and MIS approaches at the peak of a viral pandemic if precautionary measures are implemented. High volume surgery should continue during further viral peaks to minimise health service burden and potential harm to cancer patients. Funding: This work did not receive funding.",

On the 23rd of March, the UK government imposed a national lockdown. At the peak of the first wave on the 2nd of April, more than 5000 hospital beds were occupied by patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection representing nearly a quarter of all inpatient bed capacity. At this peak, there were 1073 new confirmed cases within a single 24-h period [3] . In response to the increasing demand for intensive care (ITU) beds, unprecedented measures were implemented including the deferral of thousands of non-urgent operations, the use of private hospitals by NHS patients and the creation of new sites such as the Nightingale Hospital.",

Some estimates are alarming, with current estimates of thousands of additional cancer-related deaths and tens of thousands of years of life lost [4] . The reasons for deferral are logical, both chemotherapy and surgery have demonstrable immunosuppressive effects and some hypothesised that radiation pneumonitis could potentially increase the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, more recently data has begun to emerge that cancer therapy including chemotherapy can continue without a significant increase in adverse effects during the pandemic [5] . From a surgical perspective, initial research from China demonstrated a 20% mortality rate in patients undergoing surgery who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection [6] . More recent data from Dublin, however, suggested that lung resection could proceed with appropriate safety measures [7] .",

            "text": "T a g g e d P The breakdown of cases performed at each site is shown in Table 2 . A total of 352 anatomical lung resections were performed during the Table 2 ). The breakdown of resection types is shown in Table 3 . Initial concerns regarding the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) during the pandemic [9] relating to CO2 insufflation used for robotic procedures led to an early move towards open surgery (Fig. 2a) . However, on consultation with virology teams, our SOP was quickly adapted to reflect the fact that MIS lung resection in the thorax can be performed without excessive aerosolization. As such, the majority of cases were performed via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS; 45.5%), with 38.4% being performed via an open thoracotomy and 16.2% robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS)( Table 3) . Notably, the proportion of patients undergoing MIS reduced during the peak of the pandemic in London (between late March and mid-April) (Fig. 2 ). However the number of MIS procedures remained overall comparable to our baseline dataset taken from the most recent UK Lung Cancer Clinical Outcomes Publication (LCCOP) validated dataset of the same institutions ( Table 4 ). The remainder of patient characteristics are shown in Table 3 . 109 (31%) patients received no pre-operative screening for SARS-Cov2 (either swab or CT imaging). Notably all of these patients underwent surgery before 14th April 2020 when availability of PCR testing was extremely limited. 160 patients had CT imaging pre-operatively to assess for the presence of pulmonary infiltrates. 6 patients received pre-operative chemotherapy. There were 14 conversions from MIS to open approaches, all of which were controlled. Table 5 displays the outcomes after surgery. 101 (28.6%) patients went to ICU post operatively, for a median of 1 day (IQR: 1\u00c08). The rate of ICU admission was higher than pre-pandemic where only 7.6%* of patients were admitted to ICU (*compared to a representative sample of 158 patients undergoing lung resection 1st March to 1st June 2018). This largely reflects the standard operating procedures of the private hospitals which were free of any SARS-CoV-2 infection and where ICUs served as overnight recovery. 9/352 (2.6%) patients received non-invasive ventilation and 3/352 (0.8%) patients required invasive ventilation post operatively. Overall hospital stay was a median of 6 days (IQR: 2\u00c033), with length of stay from operation to discharge a median of 4 days (IQR: 1\u00c026). Patients were followed up for a median of 328 days (IQR: 299\u00c0351). Complications were seen in 162/352 (45.7%) patients. 130/352 (36.9%) were Clavien-Dindo grade 1\u00c02 comprising of hospital acquired chest infection (HAP), post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF), and prolonged air leak (or a combination of these). More severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade 3\u00c04) occurred in 26/352 (7.3%) patients. Return to theatre occurred in 12/352 (3.4%) patients and included 6 cases of bleeding, 3 bronchoscopy and bronchial toilet, 2 surgical repair of bronchopleural fistulae and 1 return to theatre for completion lobectomy (due to infection). The remainder of severe complications were treated supportively on the ICU with renal replacement (n = 3), vasopressor support (n = 3), and antibiotic treatment of severe chest sepsis requiring NIV (n = 9). There were 12/352 (3.4%) readmissions following discharge, at a median of 11(8\u00c013) days. Five of these were due to persistent air leak or pneumothorax. Death during follow up occurred in 6/352 (1.7%) patients at a median of 19 days (IQR: 5\u00c024) following surgery. Supplementary Table 1 displays the characteristics of patients who died. Cause of death was respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 in 2 cases, in the remaining 4 cases cause of death was arrhythmia, self-harm, and pulmonary embolus. In one case death occurred at home without defined cause. Notably, length of stay and overall survival remained comparable to baseline data (Table 4) . Seven (2.0%) patients were diagnosed as positive for SARS-COV-2 at a median of 4 days post operatively (4\u00c028) ( Table 6) . Notably, one patient tested positive pre-operatively and had surgery delayed for 4 weeks until clinically well and a negative swab result was confirmed. Of the remaining 6 post-operative SARS-COV-2 positive cases, only one was diagnosed after implementation of SARS-COV-2 specific admission, isolation and screening protocols. Two patients died during the post-operative period, both were diagnosed with coronavirus Results reported as n(%) or Median(IQR). disease post operatively. The first death (Patient 1) was a white Caucasian 61-year-old male admitted electively for lung and rib resection for a cT3N0 biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. His-only significant past medical history was hypertension, his body mass index was 26.1. His-operation occurred at the beginning of the pandemic in London, prior to the implementation of lockdown measures. No pre-operative swabbing for SARS-COV-2 infection or CT screening was performed. His-recovery was initially uncomplicated however he became pyrexial and tested positive for SARS-COV-2 infection on day 4 post-operatively. He recovered sufficiently to be discharged on day 6 with some ongoing pyrexia with advice from the local SARS-CoV-2 medical and infection control teams. He was readmitted to his local hospital intensive care unit 5 days after his discharge with multi-organ failure and died on day 17 post-operatively.",

The corresponding variation in activity between units partly reflects this discrepancy, but was also influenced by factors such as the number of ITU beds, the number of beds occupied by patients with SARS-COV-2 infection, the presence of a large infectious disease team, the availability of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation and the availability of a separate 'clean' site.

We also advocate that patients are encouraged to continue shielding post-operatively during pandemic peaks.

The low volume of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our population despite the high rates of infection in London during this time reflect the robustness of pre-operative swabbing and it is our group consensus that this would be an ideal SOP for maintaining safe surgery [20] . Our data also however re-emphasises the fact that false negative results from pre-operative nose and throat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swabbing can occur [21] . The impact of inaccurate swabbing is highlighted in the case we present of a patient with a clinical and radiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 but negative preand post-operative coronavirus swab results, who ultimately died as a result of his SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early post-operative period. Following our move back to NHS hospitals with 'protected' and 'non-protected' pathways and fewer side rooms, it was essential that the sensitivity of swabbing was assessed and that an effective self-swabbing protocols were implemented to improve safety for both patients and healthcare professionals.",

At the onset of the pandemic, owing to the limited testing capacity and initial concerns regarding the accuracy of nose and throat PCR swabbing, CT screening was utilised at several London Centres. This was not however supported by subsequent research from the COVIDSurg Collaborative or the UK consensus of the combined Royal Colleges and Associations of Surgeons [17, 20] . Their data highlights the low sensitivity and specificity of a pre-operative CT chest in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients prior to elective surgery. They do not recommend it as a suitable screening tool, but advise that it can be employed in certain circumstances such as patients who are planned to recover in HDU or ITU areas [23] . In practical terms, the need for admission 1.5\u00c02 days prior to surgery for naso-pharnygeal swabbing followed by CT scanning and then reporting, limited the use of this protocol, particularly when beds were in short supply. From our data however, the lack of pre-operative CT screening was an independent risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

First, we appreciate at present there is a lack of long-term follow up to determine the sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in thoracic surgical patients. Second, clinical stage data were limited, resulting in difficulties commenting on stage progression. This is in part due to the impact of the pandemic on aerosol generating procedures such as endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), which were completely suspended in a number of peripheral referral centres. It is therefore essential that we continue to study the oncological outcomes of patients treated during the coronavirus pandemic and strive to overcome these limitations for future waves. Many current oncology models suggest that priority setting could result in either delays in treatment, or the decision not to proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy for NSCLC following surgery [24] . Within our own cohort, at least one patient did not receive adjuvant treatment following a referral to oncology due to the coronavirus pandemic. The patient was found to have disease progression at 3-month surveillance imaging, which was subsequently proven histologically. Whilst we appreciate surgical intervention itself confers risks of major morbidity and mortality, the overall mortality from surgery remains low in comparison to the reduction in survival in patients receiving delayed or no treatment [25] .",

This is consistent with data which demonstrated up to an 80% reduction in urgent referrals for suspected cancer [4] . This is echoed in other oncology work which demonstrated that a two-month delay in urgent referral for investigation results in up to 0.7 life-years lost per patient and that young cancer patients were disproportionately affected by delays to their care [28] . We must consider ways of identifying this cohort of patients.
