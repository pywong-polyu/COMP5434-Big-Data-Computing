Mutagenesis analysis suggested that MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 recognized distinct regions in S glycoproteins, and the combination of 2 mAbs demonstrated a synergistic effect in neutralization against pseudotyped MERS-CoV.

We were interested in determining the germline origin genes of the most potent neutralizing Abs in a recovered patient with natural MERS-CoV infection. Workflow for generation of the human mAbs was shown in Figure 1 . Eighty-two B-cell cultures of \u223c2880 wells were positive (2.85%) against the S protein by ELISA, and 11 of 82 B-cell culture wells targeting the MERS-CoV S protein showed the most potent neutralizing activity (inhibition rate [IR] , \u226590%) against the MERS-CoV S pseudovirus ( Figure 1 ). The variable regions encoding the heavy and light chains (VH and VL/VK) were amplified from the above 11 exceptionally potent B-cell cultures and cloned into expression vectors (PBR322 based) for sequencing and immunogenetics analysis. To expand the screening of Ab genes, we sequenced and analyzed 110 VH plasmid sequences and found 39 distinct VH sequences originating from 16 germline genes ( Figure 2A , Supplementary Table S1). We sequenced and analyzed 220 VL plasmid sequences and found 56 distinct VL lambda and kappa sequences originating from 16 and 9 different germline genes ( Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S1), respectively. We noted that the 4 major families of the immunoglobulin heavychain variable region (IGHV) germline were IGHV1-69*04/09, IGHV4-34*01/02, IGHV1-46*01, and IGHV3-53*01, with percentages of 18.6%, 16.28%, 11.63%, and 11.63%, respectively. The major family of the immunoglobulin light-chain/kappachain variable germline were IGLV1-40*01/02, IGLV2-14*01, IGKV1-39*01, IGKV1-5*03, IGKV2-28*01, and IGKV3-11*01, with percentages of 16.66%, 11.90%, 21.43%, 14.29%, 14.29%, and 14.29%, respectively. Among neutralizing active mAbs, the VH1-69 gene usage was dominated in the heavy chains, whereas the V1-40 and V1-39 genes of the lambda and kappa chains were used with the highest frequencies in the light chains of the human IgG repertoire (Figure 2A ).",

As shown in Figure 5D , a constant ratio between MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 was set by their respective IC 50 concentrations, as determined above in Figure 3B and C. Dose-dependent neutralization activity for MERS-GD27, MERS-GD33, or the combination was then evaluated by serial 3-fold dilutions in concentrations from 81 times of the IC 50 to 1/81 of the IC 50 . Figure 5D showed the percentage of neutralization ( Figure 5D, left) , fractional effect ( Figure 5D, middle) , and the combination index (CI) (Figure 5D , right) using the CompuSyn program. Percentage of neutralization for combination was approximately 0.499-fold and 6.05-fold reduction in IC 50 compared with that for MERS-GD27 or MERS-GD33 alone. Furthermore, the CI values of combination at fractional effect values of effective dose 50%, 75%, 90%, and 95% (ED50, ED75, ED90, and ED95) were 0.36, 0.37, 0.39 and 0.40, respectively. Because a CI value of 1 indicates an additive effect, <1 indicates synergism, and >1 indicates antagonism, the combination was clearly in strong synergism (0.36 to 0.40) at ED50, ED75, ED90, and ED95 [31, 32] . Figure 5D , right, showed a logarithmic CI scale, and the combination demonstrated strong synergistic effect at lower and higher Ab concentration.",

            "text": "To elucidate the molecular mechanism of MERS-CoV neutralization by MERS-GD27, we reconstituted the complex of the RBD of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein with the Fab fragment of MERS-GD27 and determined its crystal structure at a resolution of 3.0 \u00c5 ( Figure 6A ). As previously defined, the MERS-CoV RBD has two subdomains: the core subdomain comprising a 5-stranded antiparallel sheet (\u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 , \u03b2 3 , \u03b2 4 , and \u03b2 9 ) and the receptor-binding subdomain comprising a 4-stranded antiparallel sheet (\u03b2 5 , \u03b2 6 , \u03b2 7 , and \u03b2 8 ) located between the \u03b2 4 and \u03b2 7 of the core subdomain. The MERS-GD27 binds the receptor-binding subdomain ( Figure 6A ), using a total of 20 residues from the 3 heavy-chain complementarity determining region (HCDR) loops and light-chain complementarity determining region (LCDR)1 to interact with 16 residues from the \u03b2 5 strand, \u03b2 5 -\u03b2 6 loop, \u03b2 6 -\u03b2 7 loop, \u03b2 7 strand, and \u03b2 7 -\u03b2 8 loop of the receptor-binding subdomain (Supplementary Table S4 ). The buried surface contributed by the heavy chain at the interface was approximately 770 \u00c5 2 , which was much larger than the approximately 100 \u00c5 2 buried surface by the light chain. The core at the binding interface was formed by the RBD \u03b2 7 strand and the 3 HCDR loops ( Figure 6A ), in which RBD Tyr540 interacted with Ab Ser34 and Tyr112, and RBD Arg542 interacts with Ab Ser34, Ser103, Gly104, and Tyr106. Around the binding core, RBD Glu536 and Asp539 formed hydrogen-bonding interactions with Ab light chain Tyr36 and heavy chain Ser109, respectively ( Figure 6B ). The superimposition of the MERS-GD27/RBD and DPP4/ RBD complex structures showed that the MERS-GD27 would directly compete with the binding of the receptor DPP4 ( Figure 6C and D) . By comparing the footprints of the MERS-GD27 and DPP4 on the RBD, we also found that most RBD residues recognized by the MERS-GD27, such as Trp535, Glu536, Leu506, Asp510, Glu513, Ser539, Try540, and Trp553, had been previously shown to be critical for DPP4 binding. Hence, MERS-GD27 bound to an epitope that likely would block viral attachment and entry.",

We successfully demonstrated the isolation and verification of 13 specific human mAbs from an individual who was naturally infected with MERS-CoV. We found that antiviral Abs targeting the S protein of MERS-CoV used diversity germline V genes as the origins (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table S1 ). The 13 mAbs demonstrated distinct binding activity and neutralizing activity. Of the 11 mAbs displaying strong neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV, 2 of the mAbs with an IGHV1-69-encoded heavy chain (MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33) that bound different epitopes on the S protein showed the most potency and largest range of neutralizing activity against the MERS-CoV in vitro. Furthermore, we identified the structural basic of MERS-GD27 neutralization and recognition by crystallographic analysis, which revealed that its epitope almost completely overlapped with the receptor-binding site.",

            "text": "Compared with the previous reports of human mAbs targeting the MERS-CoV S protein (Table 1) , our results showed a high diversity in the germline origin genes of mAbs in a recovered patient with a natural MERS-CoV infection; these covered all the VH germline genes except for two mAbs (MERS-27 was from the scFv-yeast display library and 4C2 was from immune mice). We also found that several VH germline genes were never reported in previous human mAbs against MERS-CoV. It is notable that various genetically distinct germline-encoded neutralizing mAbs existed in the MERS-CoV-recovered patient's immune repertoires. Another noticeable feature of our MERS-CoV natural infection-derived immune repertoires was the high frequency of IGHV1-69 allele usage, which suggested that this germline gene was a common precursor of MERS-CoV Abs and might recognize similar epitopes. The IGHV1-69 gene was also preferentially used by other antiviral Abs, including Abs against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 [33] , influenza virus [34] , and hepatitis C virus [35] . Accordingly, the VH genes of 13 mAbs originated from the VH1-69*04/09 with low SHM, suggesting that the clones arose from naive B cells, and each of them paired with the lambda (VL1-40*01/02, VL1-50*01, VL1-51*01, and VL2-14*01) and kappa (VK2-28*01) genes, respectively (Supplementary Table S2 ). The germline nature of these Abs implied that Abs could be elicited relatively fast because of the low number of SHM required for affinity maturation. This was in contrast to some Abs against HIV-1 and likely other chronic infections that could be highly divergent from their putative germline predecessors, and they may require extensive and complex affinity maturation pathways to obtain breadth and potency [36, 37] .",

Given viral infection and neutralization escape, we termed \"divergent combination immunotherapy\" [41] and suggested investigating the cooperation of the more potent neutralizing mAbs with the cross-neutralized protective mAbs. Our results indicated that 13 mAbs present diverse binding phenotypes of competing ability with MERS-GD27 or MERS-GD33, which suggests divergent epitopes. Mutagenesis analysis suggested that MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 recognized distinct regions in S glycoproteins, but more work would be required for the fine mapping of epitopes in the future. The epitope mapping of MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 could also be helpful for identifying residues critical for neutralization and for investigating virus evolution under immune pressure, which was a force selecting for virus mutation. In addition, synergistic effect was also found when MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 were used in combination for neutralization against pseudotyped MERS-CoV, providing a theoretical basis for the combined use in animal and clinical testing in the future.",

(A) Specific interaction between MERS-CoV S protein and MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 characterized by biolayer interferometry. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were captured on the 96-well microplate immobilized with anti-hIgG-Fc and tested for binding with gradient concentrations of MERS-coronavirus spike (CoV S) protein. (B) The apparent dissociation constants were calculated and summarized. (C) Neutralizing activities of MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 against live MERS-CoV and against plaque formation of Vero-E6 cells by plaque reduction neutralization test. Three different concentrations of Abs (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 \u03bcg/well) were incubated with 30 plaque-forming units/well live MERS-CoV. Cells were stained with crystal violet at the end of treatment, and the plaques were determined. The inhibitory activity is over 50% in the box. (D) Competition studies among MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33with other mAbs. The 96-well plate was first coated with MERS-CoV S 24 hours before the competitive binding test. The mixture of Ab-biotins and other antibodies was incubated in the concentration for 50% of maximal effect. Phosphate-buffered saline was used as a blank control. According to the different competitive binding, 3 groups were created (seeSupplementary Table S3).",

Pseudotyped viruses bearing 10 of 15 mutant MERS-CoV S glycoproteins could be neutralized by either MERS-GD27 or MERS-GD33. MERS-GD27 showed effective neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV, as indicated by the robust inhibition on infection by all but 5 pseudotyped viruses bearing the mutant S glycoprotein (Figure 5A), and 5 mutations (L506F, D509G, V534A, E536K, and A556V) resulted in substantial increases in resistance against neutralization of MERS-GD27. MERS-GD33 differed from MERS-GD27 based on the neutralizing activity against the MERS-CoV pseudoviruses (Figure 5Aand C). MERS-GD33 could effectively neutralize the virus with the E536K mutation but could not neutralize the virus with the R511P mutation.Because MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 bound to different epitopes of S protein (Figure 4D) and showed different epitope",
