A predesigned electronic questionnaire was sent to each participant via email which was completed by 485 participants. Different composite scores were calculated and compared to the sociodemographic and other technical variables. Results: The mean age of the participants was 36.92 \u00b1 9.12 (24-65 years), and 57.8% of the sample were male. Riyadh and the KSA's eastern province represented the highest two regions of participation, at (18.4%) and (14.2%) participants, respectively. About 70.8% were generally satisfied with HESN, while 86.6%% believed that it is better than the traditional paper-work system. Participants who used to work more frequently expressed more level of satisfaction compared to those with minimal use per week or month (P \u2264 0.001). Internet speed displayed a significant association with the general level of satisfaction with HESN (P < 0.001). Additionally, users who accessed HESN with the Google Chrome browser displayed higher levels of satisfaction when compared to users who relied on other browsers (P = 0.003).",

First stage was to train the staff about all components and the full usage of HESN, whereas the second stage was to let the trainees use HESN practically under the supervision.

Remarkably, users with a fast Internet speed were more satisfied than those with a moderate and slow Internet speed for all composite scores (P < 0.001). Similarly, participants who used HESN with the Google Chrome browser were more satisfied, compared to users of Firefox and Internet Explorer.

In the present study, users who rated their Internet speed as fast represented less than 20% of the sample. It is noteworthy, then, that a significant number of users employed HESN at home because the speed of their Internet connection at work was slow. This indicates that the infrastructure has yet to be improved, particularly with respect to the variable of the stability of the Internet connection. The same challenges have been encountered after establishing electronic health surveillance systems in China, where the evidence indicates that professionals have employed their mobile phones to overcome the unavailability of computers and the Internet [15] [16] [17] . In the case of HESN users with a reasonable internet speed, they tended to be more satisfied and recommend more improvements. Generally, therefore, it is possible to conclude that the unstable Internet connections are one of the major difficulties professionals encounter when working with electronic systems, especially in rural areas where infrastructure continues to be deficient [18] . At the same time, it is important to gain insight into the type of the Internet browser employed by HESN users, since certain key functions or software extensions may only be compatible with one browser but not others.

This goes in consistence with previous studies that have identified different challenges with electronic public health surveillance systems in Peru.

Indeed, HESN is a developed version of the Canadian \"Panorama\" software, which was built primarily using the English language [11, 12] . The high satisfaction level toward HESN among the non-Arab users may also be attributed to the use of the English interface.

As indicated by the results, user satisfaction was significantly affected by the frequency of use, Internet speed, and the type of Internet browser used to access HESN. Therefore, it is clear that the basic infrastructure requirements must be established adequately, particularly regarding the issues of Internet connection, computers, and staff. Further",
