As of July 15th, the confirmed cases reached, 16262 with a total number of 259 deaths, making it the third worst-hit country on the continent. Remarkable social and public health measures were implemented in order to control the disease spread and increase the healthcare system\u00b4s capacity. However, given the reality of scarce supplies and hospital resources in the face of the pandemic in African countries, the potential threat of COVID-19 to both our elderly and immunocompromised patients, is thought to be significant. As oncologists, we are most concerned by the \"distraction effect\" [1] of the pandemic on the continuous care on this large, heterogeneous group of vulnerable patients affected by cancer. In our daily practice, we have been ramping up to weigh up the balance of risks and benefits carefully when planning normal routine cancer care approach and making treatment decisions. In North Africa, so far, no clear data has been reported to reflect the impact of the pandemic on the management of cancer care. Based on our local experience and on a recent review of cancer guidelines issued by the Oncology societies, we aim to describe the unprecedented response and care models that have been adopted by a single Medical Oncology department located in an overwhelmed hospital, in the hard-hit region of the country whish, as of this day, has yet no positive case confirmed.",

A total of 223 papers were extracted, and 88 included and analyzed by a PRISMA diagram. Out of the 88 articles, six were written in French and 19 in Chinese with English abstracts. 59% originated from China and Italy (52 of 88). Most of the papers consisted of short editorials, letters, correspondence or comments. Nine case reports, one case series and ten Cohort studies were identified (retrospective, prospective or crosssectional analysis) which included only four exclusively cancer patients [2] . Most results concluded that patients with cancer were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and had a poorer prognosis. Liang et al. were the first to publish a nationwide analysis of data regarding cancer patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 [3] . Their Chinese cohort was the largest and the only prospective cohort of cancer patients to date. Of 1590 cases with confirmed COVID-19, 18 patients had a history of cancer (1%; 95% CI 0.61-1.65) which seems higher than the incidence of cancer in the overall Chinese population (0.29%, 285.83 per 100000 people, according to 2015 cancer epidemiology statistics [4] . The most frequent primary tumor was lung cancer. Compared with other patient groups, people affected by cancer had a 3.5 higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease (defined as the percentage of patients admitted intensive care unit, requiring invasive ventilation, or death) (39% vs 8%, p=0.0003). In this study, receiving chemotherapy or surgery in the past month was found to further increase this risk following adjustment for other variables (OR 5.34, 95% CI 1.80-16.18; P = 0.0026). A recent report from the WHO suggested that among cancer patients, vulnerable groups at risk are patients undergoing treatment for lung cancer and blood or bone marrow cancers, such as, leukemia or multiple myeloma (at any stage of disease) and stem cell transplants [5] .",

Since April 1st, the European consensus guidelines have been summarized and published in Lancet oncology in English, and in \"bulletin du cancer\" in French. The ASCO has released new recommendations and assembled guidance from American societies for the oncology community that have been published on the Journal of Clinical Oncology. As for ongoing research projects, the US Food and Drug Administration, the US National Cancer Institute and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have also issued guidance on managing clinical trials during the time of the pandemic. Most of these guidelines are directed toward reducing patient\u00b4s exposure to the virus, reduce the frequency of hospital admissions, including telemedicine as an alternative means to replace office visits, making clinical decisions regarding the delay of treatment with palliative intent, favoring oral drugs, shorter administration times, or larger intervals between doses.",

Infection control measures are strictly respected, and all patients and staff are socially distanced within the 3 areas, including the chemotherapy infusion room. Furthermore, daily phone calls are made to patients planned to be admitted the following day, to ensure they do not show any upper respiratory related symptoms or fever before their attendance at hospital appointments. As for \"the inpatient department\", the priority of admission is limited to patients undergoing complex chemotherapy regimens, those with severe toxicities, and patients with potentially life-threatening conditions or injuries that require immediate treatment. Further precautions are taken to provide safe patient care.",

Although weekly Paclitaxel has significantly lower risk for neutropenia and a trend toward lower risk for sensory neuropathy than 3 weekly paclitaxel. In the treatment of adjuvant and metastatic colorectal cancer, there is no significant difference in overall survival and overall response rates between the CAPOX regimen given every 3 weeks, and FOLFOX regimen given every 2 weeks, whereas neutropenia had a higher incidence in the FOLFOX group [9] . When supported by evidence, the reduction of chemotherapy doses or treatment duration represents an active alternate treatment.
