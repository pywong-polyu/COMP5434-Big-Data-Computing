In fact, people who are immunocompromised are doubly susceptible. On the one hand, people who are immuno compromised are more likely to suffer the gravest consequences of SARS CoV2 infection, including severe or fatal disease. 1,2 On the other hand, such individuals are less likely to mount a sufficient immune response to COVID19 vaccination.",

In a systematic review, seroconversion rates after two COVID19 vaccine doses (pooling across all studies and platforms) were 99% (95% CI 98-100) for people who are not immunocompromised, 92% (88-94%) for patients with solid cancer, 78% (69-95) for patients with immunemediated inflammatory disorders, 64% (50-76) for patients with haematological cancer, and 27% (16-42) for recipients of transplants. 3 Corroborating these findings, people who are immuno compromised exhibit reduced protection against symptomatic and severe COVID19 on the basis of realworld effectiveness data (available for mRNA and vectored vaccines), [4] [5] [6] and make up greater than 40% of hospitalised breakthrough cases despite representing a much smaller proportion of the general population. 7 To mitigate the risk of COVID19 among vaccinated people who are immunocompromised, countries have increasingly opted to offer these individuals an additional vaccine dose. As of Oct, 2021, this policy has been recommended by WHO for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. 8 Notably, such policies should be considered separately from those relating to booster doses-given once an initially sufficient immune response rate in a vaccinated population has waned over time. 9 Rather, offering additional doses to people who are immunocompromised should be considered part of an extended primary series that seeks to increase the proportion of individuals in the population who achieve a sufficient protective immune response to begin with.",

With this in mind, we did a rapid review of the safety, immuno genicity, and efficacy or effectiveness of additional vaccine doses in people who are immunocompromised, covering articles and preprints published between July 1, 2020 and Sept 27, 2021. Our aim was to capture emerging trends within the heterogenous body of available evidence. The primary outcome of interest was the prevalence of SARSCoV2 spikespecific binding antibodies before versus after a single additional dose of a COVID19 vaccine with a WHO Emergency Use Listing (for full literature review methods see appendix pp 1-2).",

These included two randomised controlled trials and 21 observational studies done in countries that were early to adopt a policy of offering an additional dose to people who are immunocompromised. 10 The evidence base is skewed towards mRNA vaccines (exclusively offered in 18 of the eligible studies), although several studies have explored the potential merits of a heterologous additional dose (Ad26. COV2.S or ChAdOx1S) following a twodose mRNA primary vaccination series. Study cohorts consisted of patients with solid organ transplants (13 studies), patients receiving dialysis (five studies), patients with cancer (three studies), and other groups of people who are immunocompromised (two studies). All available studies reported on one or more humoral immune response endpoints, with a subset reporting on cellular immune responses (ten studies) and on safety (17 studies). The additional dose was administered 1-3 months after completion of the standard primary vaccination series in 20 of the 21 studies reporting this information. No studies reported on the efficacy or effectiveness of an additional COVID19 vaccine dose among people who are immunocompromised.",

            "text": "Despite significant variation in terms of vaccination schedule, sample timing, and serological response criteria, several trends are apparent across the included studies. First, the reactogenicity profile of additional doses in people who are immunocompromised, where reported, has generally been consistent with that observed for earlier doses of the vaccine being administered, 11 with no major safety concerns identified. Second, receipt of an additional dose appears to have a modest additive effect on cumulative immunogenicity, with median antibody response rates increasing from 41% (IQR 23-58) after the standard primary series to 67% (55-69) after the additional dose among studies with paired data, albeit with notable variation among patient groups ( figure A) the primary vaccination series but is capable of inducing a de novo response in at least a portion of people who are immunocompromised who did not mount a detectable antibody response after the standard primary series. These findings must be interpreted with caution given the absence of an established correlate of initial protection or duration of protection. The significant methodological variation among studies (especially with respect to antibody response criteria and characteristics of the patient population; appendix pp 3-5) also represents a notable limitation of the present review, and probably contributes to the wide variation in response rates observed. Nonetheless, the benefits of an additional dose as part of an extended primary series among people who are immunocompromised are likely to outweigh the risks on the basis of the available data. Despite the imbalance in the evidence base towards mRNA vaccines, it is reasonable to expect this relative benefit to apply across other COVID19 vaccines and vaccine platforms. However, key evidence gaps must be urgently addressed, including the safety, effectiveness, and duration of protection provided by one or more additional doses in an extended primary series in people who are immunocompromised (including specific patient subgroups), especially for vectored, inactivated, and subunit vaccines for which extensive data are lacking; the relative benefits of heterologous versus homologous additional doses among people who are immunocompromised; the optimal timing of the additional dose; and the effectiveness of standard and extended primary vaccine series among subgroups of people who are immunocompromised that are underrepresented in the existing literature, including people living with HIV that is not wellcontrolled.",
