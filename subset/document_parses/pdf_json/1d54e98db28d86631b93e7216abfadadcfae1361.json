As it continues to threaten customers' health, it is expected to greatly influence their attitudes and behavior. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effects of threat and coping appraisals on consumers' co-creation behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Grounded in protection motivation theory and cocreation theory, the moderating effect of generational cohorts is also investigated vis-a-vis the relationships between protection motivation appraisals and co-creation behaviors in the restaurant industry. Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age completed survey regarding their dine-in experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study indicates that customers' perceived severity, self-efficacy, and response efficacy are significant predictors of customers' co-creation behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

According to the National Restaurant Association (NRA) (2020), the restaurant industry has been one of the industries most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, undergoing major sales and job losses. As of June 2020, stay-at-home orders and mandatory business closures have eased across the U.S., and restaurants have begun operating their businesses again with the adoption of new health and safety measures (NRA, 2020) . However, the COVID-19 outbreak continues to be a threat to consumers' health, and it is expected to influence customers' attitudes and behavior at restaurants greatly. Further, the spread of the virus is dependent in part on human behavior; therefore, collaboration for risk management and prevention between service providers and consumers is necessary (Brug et al., 2009) .",

Members of younger generations reported that the need for prevention did not impact their behavior greatly as they perceived the risk to be low (CDC, 2020) . Additionally, members of younger generations, such as Generation Z (i.e., individuals born after 1995), were particularly vulnerable to job loss and exposure to the coronavirus compared to members of older generational cohorts, as they were overrepresented in high-risk service sector industries such as restaurants (Parker & Igielnik, 2020) .

            "text": "Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) was originally proposed by Rogers (1975) to explain the adoption of protective behaviors in the presence of a threat stimulus. According to Rogers (1975) , PMT involves three key considerations: \"(a) the magnitude of noxiousness of a depicted event; (b) the probability of that event's occurrence; and (c) the efficacy of a protective response\" (Rogers, 1975, p. 93) . The theory has been adopted and revised in later studies, such as Burns et al. (2017) and Zhao et al. (2016) to explain an individual's protective action as a result of his/her cognitive process of assessing a threat and making coping appraisals under certain conditions. Burns et al. (2017) explain that threat appraisal consists of three components: threat vulnerability, threat severity, and maladaptive rewards. Threat vulnerability is the perceived probability that a threat will occur, and threat severity involves the perceived seriousness of the threat's consequences. Maladaptive rewards relate to the perceived benefits of not adopting the recommended protective behaviors (Maddux & Rogers, 1983; Rippetoe & Rogers, 1987) . Likewise, Burns et al. (2017) propose three subconstructs of coping appraisal: self-efficacy, response efficacy, and response costs. Self-efficacy is an individual's perceived ability to follow recommended behaviors. Response efficacy involves the perceived effectiveness of responses or recommended behaviors, and response costs are the individual's perceived costs from following recommended behaviors (Burns et al., 2017, p. 193) .",

The authors found that individuals' social principles and cultural systems influenced the way risks were perceived and self-protection reactions were shaped (Cho & Lee, 2015) . Further, several studies have demonstrated the influence of threat and coping appraisals on consumers' behavioral intentions. Zhao et al. (2016) found significant impacts of perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, self-efficacy, and response efficacy on consumers' intentions to engage in household green behaviors of low usage (i.e., control of water and electricity use and overall consumption at home) and high cost (i.e., recycling and switching to ecological products) under threats of environmental deterioration.

The authors' typology posits two dimensions in value co-creation behavior: customers' participation behavior and citizenship behavior. Customers' participation behavior is described as a behavior that is required for successful value co-creation, while customer citizenship behavior is considered a voluntary behavior directed toward the service provider and toward other customers (Groth, 2005; Yi & Gong, 2013; Yi et al., 2011) . When customers co-create value through participation and citizenship behaviors, they provide a strong competitive advantage for the service provider and improve the experience the latter provides (Ahn et al., 2020) . Yi and Gong (2013) posited four dimensions of customer participation behavior: information seeking, information sharing, responsible behavior, and personal interaction. First, information seeking helps customers to reduce uncertainty, become familiar with the co-creation environment, and more easily become integrated into the value co-creation process. Second, by sharing accurate information with employees, consumers ensure that their needs and expectations are addressed. Third, responsible behavior involves the recognition of the responsibilities by consumers as co-creators. This suggests that there are some policies and guidelines consumers must adopt if there is to be a successful value co-creation process (Roy et al., 2020) . The last dimension is the personal interaction between the consumer and employees-a positive and respectful environment is key to customer participation behavior.",

Finally, tolerance represents the willingness to forgive the service provider when the service expectations are not met, as in the case of service delays (Yi & Gong, 2013) .

Further, several authors have applied PMT within the context of health threats during pandemics (Cho & Lee, 2015; Prati et al., 2012; Teasdale et al., 2012) . Teasdale et al. (2012) found that intentions to engage in the government's recommended behaviors (i.e., staying home when ill and continuing to work when well) were significantly influenced by the variables of PMT. The study found that intentions to stay home when people were ill were positively related to perceived risk, self-efficacy, and response efficacy, whereas those intentions were negatively related to response costs. On the other hand, intentions to keep working when people were well were positively affected by self-efficacy and response efficacy, whereas they were negatively related to perceived risks and response costs (Teasdale et al., 2012) . In the same vein, Prati et al.'s (2012) research provided an account for recommended behaviors proposed during the influenza H1N1 pandemic, based on the concepts of PMT. Their research provided evidence of the effects of perceived seriousness, the likelihood of infection, personal impact, and the severity of the illness on the adoption of recommended behaviors. Based on the previous literature's support for the influence of perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, self-efficacy, response-efficacy, and response cost on engagement behavior, we propose that a similar relationship will be found with regard to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The level of participation in value co-creation behavior within the restaurant setting will be determined by customers' assessment of the threat and their coping appraisals. We propose the following hypotheses:",

As each individual's coping resources and competencies influence her/his adaptation process during times of crisis (Burns et al., 2012) , adaptation occurs as a social process based on the society's ability to behave collectively (Adger, 2009) . In a similar vein, Burns et al. (2017) propose that people may cope with crises by engaging in other-focused behavior. Fischer et al. (2006) further suggest two major cognitive thinking processes that take place before an individual makes a decision to help others during a crisis. The first step includes an assessment of the situation (i.e., determining perceived vulnerability and perceived severity of danger). When a situation is perceived as serious, people will be more likely to help others. The second step in the process involves selecting a course of action, based on the individual's assessment of the cost of helping others, the benefit created, and the likelihood of getting help from others (Fischer et al., 2006) . As some individuals may lack the knowledge, skills, or resources required to provide assistance, the course of action is directly related to their coping appraisals (i.e., self-efficacy, response efficacy, and response cost) (Maddux & Rogers, 1983) .",

Rosenbaum and Massiah (2007) suggested that consumers' participation, cooperation, and loyalty are forms of organizational citizenship behavior, which is embedded within consumers' voluntary performances. This conceptualization of consumer voluntary behavior is in line with the findings of Bettencourt (1997) and Yi and Gong (2013) that there is an intrinsic relationship between participation behavior and citizenship behavior. Customer participation behavior may need to be enhanced to trigger customer citizenship behavior (Groth, 2005) .

Their research on hotel customers found that Millennials were likely to contribute to different co-creation processes as compared to Generation X members (Shulga et al., 2018) . Further, while members of Generation X preferred the company to initiate co-creation practices, Millennials did not prefer the company to send a direct invitation to them. Rather, Millennials engaged easily in co-creation behaviors in order to enhance their experience (Shulga et al., 2018) .

            "text": "According to Ferrer et al. (2018) , risk perceptions are based on learned associations and are closely linked to previous experiences. This suggests that different generations' intentions to engage in protective behavior may vary as each generation possesses a unique set of values and beliefs. For example, Generation X members and Millennials were directly hit by the social, political, and economic aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, while most members of Generation Z were too young to understand the magnitude of the event (Soares et al., 2017) . Also, Millennials entered the workforce facing the height of an economic recession in 2008, which strongly influenced their beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. On the other hand, members of Generation Z were born in the digital era and are often stereotyped as anti-social individuals or social justice warriors (Soares et al., 2017) . As members of Generation Z grew up in a strong economy with a low unemployment rate, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be one of the most significant events that have affected them. Accenture (2020) also reported important changes in consumer profiles during the COVID-19 pandemic based on age. According to that study, members of Generation Z tend to focus on themselves and worry about maintaining self-comfort, while Millennials focus on helping others and their community and are very aware of the situation and of recommended health products. Moreover, members of Generation X have been found to carry on \"business as usual\" and to be less likely to engage in health-protective recommended behaviors (Accenture, 2020) . This indicates that members of different generations may have distinct views on the risk associated with COVID-19 and may respond to the event differently (Parker & Igielnik, 2020) . Therefore, the current study proposes the following hypotheses and the conceptual model can be found in Fig. 1.   H5 . Generation significantly moderates the relationship between consumers' protection motivation appraisals (a. perceived severity, b. perceived vulnerability, c. self-efficacy, d. response-efficacy, e. response cost) and participation behavior.",

            "text": "The current study performed structural model analysis using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with a bootstrapping method. The method is useful for testing the statistical significance of path coefficient weights and loadings (Chin et al., 2008) . Particularly, PLS-SEM has gained popularity in recent years and is widely used in social science studies due to its ability to measure latent variables under non-normality conditions or using small sample sizes (Hair et al., 2013) . R 2 is used to estimate the explanatory power of the constructed model in the study (Wasko & Faraj, 2005) . Results have indicated that perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, self-efficacy, response-efficacy, and response cost explain 16.7% of customer participation behavior, while the five dimensions of protection motivation behavior and participation behavior explain 21.1% of the total variance in citizenship behavior. This indicates that the current structural model has moderate validity (Chin et al., 2008) . Table 1 represents the construct validity and the reliability test results of all measurement items in the study. First, factor loadings were ensured with p-values less than 0.01 and loadings above the recommended value of 0.6, indicating reliability of the measurements (Chin, 1998) . Further, composite reliability (CR) indicated values between 0.83 and 0.91, and the average variance extracted (AVE) ranged from 0.60 to 0.77. All figures exceeded the thresholds of 0.7 (CR) and 0.5 (AVE), ensuring the reliability of the measurements. Additionally, a test of discriminant validity was performed for all constructs, and corresponding constructs' square rooted AVE figures were compared (Ramayah et al., 2013) . The figures for each construct were higher than the other constructs' square roots of AVE figures, so discriminant validity was confirmed. The results of the test of discriminant validity can be found in Table 2 . Therefore, the proposed model and the constructs in the study were satisfactory in terms of convergent validity and reliability. Table 3 show the detailed results of the structural equation modeling for hypotheses H1-H4. For H1a-H1e, the study tested the relationships between customers' protection motivation behaviors and their participation behavior. Among the five dimensions of protection motivation behavior, perceived severity, self-efficacy, and response cost were found to have significant effects on customers' participation behavior, supporting H1a, H1c, and H1d (\u03b2 = 0.13, p < 0.05; \u03b2 = 0.16, p < 0.01; \u03b2 = 0.16 p < 0.01, respectively). On the other hand, H1b and H1e were not supported (\u03b2 = 0.06, p > 0.05; \u03b2 = -0.03, p > 0.01, respectively), indicating that perceived vulnerability and response cost did not significantly influence customers' participation behavior. In H2a-H2e, the study examined whether the consumers' protection behavior influenced their citizenship behavior. The results showed that all the hypotheses were supported (H2a: \u03b2 = -0.14, p < 0.05; H2c: \u03b2 = 0.15, p < 0.01; H2d: \u03b2 = -0.12 p < 0.05; H2e: \u03b2 = 0.09 p < 0.05, respectively), except H2b (\u03b2 = 0.02, p > 0.05). Additionally, participation behavior was found to be a significant predictor of customers' citizenship behavior; thus, H3 was supported (\u03b2 = 0.42, p < 0.01).",

Additionally, significant differences were found between Generation Y and Generation X (\u03b2 = -0.58, p < 0.05) and between Generation Y and Generation Z (\u03b2 = 0.43, p < 0.01) in the response-efficacy-participation behavior link, supporting H5d.

This perception of the pandemic's severity leads them to engage in responsible behaviors and help others in protecting themselves against COVID-19. Interestingly, customers' perceptions of COVID-19 vulnerability are found to not be a significant indicator of their co-creation behaviors.

Customers' confidence in their ability to deal with COVID-19 (self-efficacy) encourages them to adopt participation and citizenship behaviors to control the pandemic collectively. This is consistent with the previous research finding that self-efficacy is a significant predictor of self-protective behavior in choosing restaurants (Choi et al., 2011) . This study also finds that response efficacy is positively related to participating behavior but negatively related to citizenship behavior. The results may indicate that customers adopt the recommended behavior, such as face covering and social distancing, as they perceive the behavior to be effective in protecting them from the COVID-19 threat. However, this perceived effectiveness of the recommended behavior suggests limiting human contact, thus it may discourage people from directly offering help to the service provider and other customers. In line with Teasdale et al. (2012) , high response cost may lead to less engagement in protective behavior. Thus, the insignificant effect of response cost on participation behavior and its low effect on citizenship behavior may be related to the fact that customers' perceived response cost to COVID-19 is high, discouraging them from engaging in co-creation behaviors.",

            "text": "Generations are characterized as groups of individuals who experience common socio-historical phenomena and share similar values, beliefs, and behavioral intentions (Mannheim, 1952) . The study results reveal that there are significant differences in the effect of self-efficacy on participation behavior between the members of Generations X and Z. Generation Z members show a stronger relationship than do those of Generation X. Members of Generation Z are considered to have lower COVID-19 risk than members of older generations (CDC, 2020), hence this may raise their self-efficacy in coping with COVID-19. On the other hand, Generation X members, often known as the \"sandwich generation\" that care for both their children and aging parents, may juggle their anxieties with stress from taking care of family members in the situation of COVID-19. Therefore, they may perceive the situation as more serious and complicated than do other generations, which lowers their self-efficacy to cope with COVID-19 (Cherry, 2020) . The study also finds the strongest effect of response efficacy on participation behavior in the Generation Y cohort, as compared with Generation X and Z members. The finding is in line with Shulga et al. (2018) that Generation Y members engage more easily in co-creation behaviors than do those of other generations. This generational characteristic is related to the fact that Generation Y members enjoy frequent contact with peers and tend to prefer working in teams than working individually (Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005) . Further, as the largest workforce of the U.S. (Lee et al., 2021) , members of Generation Y may utilize the recommended behavior (e.g., mask wearing, social distancing) more than those of the other generations and find it effective. This in turn increases their willingness to engage in participation behavior to protect themselves and others from the health threat. In addition, the effect of response cost on citizenship behavior is found to be positive and significant for Generation Z, while the effect is not significant for the Generation X and Y cohorts. The high response cost of COVID-19 may discourage customers from participating in co-creation behaviors. However, the positive effect of response cost on citizenship behavior for Generation Z members may be attributed to the fact that they have lower risk than members of the other generations (CDC, 2020), thus they are more prone to help others and engage in citizenship behavior as the virus continues to threaten public health.",

As the pandemic needs to be controlled through collaborative efforts among individuals, this study incorporates the concept of co-creation into customers' health protective behavior under the COVID-19 threat using the PMT model. This approach supports that PMT is a robust model for predicting restaurant customers' cocreation behaviors during the global pandemic and provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between PMT and consumer behavior.

Consumers' perception of the pandemic's severity influences them to adopt the behavior, and consumers with low self-efficacy and response-efficacy may prefer to buy food from drive-through restaurants or use delivery services instead of dining at restaurants. To incorporate these customers, restaurants not only implement responsive safety protocols but also improve their order fulfillment systems and digital interfaces with mobile orders and uncontacted food offerings. As part of their health protective behavior, customers will be more likely to visit restaurants that make efforts to lower the threat and to proactively engage in responsible behaviors by incorporating the restaurants' protocols. Thus, restaurants should pursue strategies to actively communicate messages related to customers' safety concerns and their preventive practices to gain the needed recognition and social agreement.",

Understanding each generation's characteristics and their responsive behavior during the pandemic would help restaurant operators to strategically target segments of customers who would participate in collaborative actions and build long-term relationships to respond to the situation (Shulga et al., 2018) . Notably, this study examines distinct characteristics of each generation and reveals that members of Generation Z are more actively engaged in co-creation behaviors than members of Generations X and Y. Likewise, restaurants need to customize services at every service encounter to accommodate members of all generations and actively collaborate with generations that have high interest in enacting co-creation behavior. As the generations examined in the study showed different preference regarding co-creation behaviors, restaurants need to be attentive to understanding the differences and providing dynamic approaches to different generation cohorts. This will be the key to success in making consumers return to the operations and build long-term relationships.",

First, this study collected data in the summer of 2020, so the study respondents' perceptions and experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic may have been relatively limited. Future research should replicate the study at different times or perform an experimental study to measure consumer behavior under different COVID-19 conditions and restaurants' preventive practices. Second, this study examined customer protection behavior in response to COVID-19 in the restaurant industry; thus, the study findings may not apply to other industries. Future research may extend this research framework to examine consumer behavior in other industries. Third, this study examined generational differences in response to COVID-19 among members of Generations X, Y, and Z. Baby Boomer were excluded from the study as they were considered to be at high risk from COVID-19. Therefore, future study can examine members of this generation in relation to their perceptions and behavior amid COVID-19 and investigate ways in which they are different from those of other generations. Lastly, this study excluded the participants who had no dine-in experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering that some individuals may choose not to dinein at restaurants due to their high sensitivity and vulnerability to the COVID-19 threat, their perceptions and protection behavior need to be further examined to increase our understanding and knowledge about the subject.",

The restaurant industry has been one of the industries most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is expected to greatly influence customers' attitudes and behavior. As the spread of the virus is dependent in part on human behavior, collaboration for risk management and prevention between service providers and consumers is necessary. Therefore, this study uses protection motivation theory to examine how consumers' coping and threat appraisals of COVID-19 influence their co-creation behavior. The study results provide empirical support for the conceptual model and indicate that consumers' perceived evaluation of both coping and threat appraisals greatly influence their participation and citizenship behavior under the COVID-19 threat. The study further reveals generational differences in coping with the pandemic, thus the study provides important theoretical and practical implications for the field.",
