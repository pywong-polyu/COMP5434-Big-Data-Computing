It examines perception, experiences, and alternatives of zero-tolerance policies in education, in relation to the call for action by Black Lives Matter at Schools. Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) students are affected at a disproportionate rate when it comes to school discipline, leading to high, inequitable incarceration rates. However, behavior analysis already has powerful tools and interventions that can stop this \"school-to-prison pipeline\" effect. A survey of school professionals investigated awareness of adverse outcomes from zero-tolerance policies and the use of effective, behavioral alternatives to exclusionary disciplinary practices. Results confirmed zero-tolerance policies still exist in North American schools, but that school professionals, including behavior analysts, support Black Lives Matter at School's call to end such practices. It is important to note that participants report already having the necessary skills to combat zero-tolerance; however, many still feel uncomfortable or ill-prepared to implement interventions specifically intended to decrease anti-Black racism in schools.",

Inequity and racism are not new; civil rights advocates have made calls for attention and intervention for hundreds of years. Yet, the sequence of current events, including a world-wide pandemic, has disproportionately affected BIPOC both physically and economically. The events stimulated a renewed sense of duty among behavior analytic professionals to advocate and act for change. The field of behavior analysis must be more involved in understanding racism and racist behavior at the individual and societal levels, and work as members of multidisciplinary teams to create change (e.g., Matsuda et al., 2020; Mattaini & Rehfeldt, 2020) . Although professionals need to act across a variety of areas, reducing systemic racism in the educational system is particularly critical. Black students receive exclusionary discipline at an inequitable rate compared to white students. Their behaviors are often punished more severely with consequences that often lead to the criminal justice system (National Association of Education, 2020). With the inequity that exists with disciplinary actions in education, it is important to come together and build \"accompliceship,\" a critical component in the efforts to dismantle systemic racism and promote equal rights. Accompliceship is established This article is being published on an expedited basis, as part of a series of emergency publications designed to help practitioners of applied behavior analysis take immediate action to address police brutality and systemic racism.

Although Black students made up only 15% of the student population, they received as many as 39.3% of all out-ofschool suspensions. The situation was particularly extreme for Black males; 17.6% of Black males received out-ofschool suspensions compared to 9.1% of Native American/ Alaskan Native males, 6.4% of Hispanic males, and 5.0% of white males. Although rates are lower for females, the pattern was the same. Black females are much more likely to experience out-of-school suspensions (9.6%) compared to Native American/Alaskan Native females (4.3%), Hispanic females (2.6%), or white females (1.3%). These patterns begin as early as preschool and continue across the students' academic careers (Ontario Ministry of Education [OME], 2020; Owens & McLanahan, 2020) . It is interesting to note that despite the significantly higher rates of out-of-school suspension for Black students, they are less likely than their Native American/Alaskan Native, Hispanic, or white peers to carry weapons to school They are equally or less likely to have access to illegal drugs at school (de Brey et al., 2019) .",

Similar proportions exist for referrals to law enforcement, as Black students made up 31% of students involved in law enforcement referrals or school-related arrests. Although the specific reasons for suspensions, expulsions, and law referrals/arrests may vary, many directly tie to zero-tolerance policies that affect BIPOC students disproportionally to white students (American Psychological Association [APA] Zero-Tolerance Task Force, 2008).",

However, there is not a singular definition. Though some situations may warrant serious consequences due to the level of risk to the student and the community, zero-tolerance policies prevent case-by-case analysis of risk, contextual variables, or consequences that may be in the best interest of students. Such policies fail to help students improve behavior, be successful, and stay in school. According to a report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, 2008), zerotolerance policies have resulted in significant increases in suspensions, expulsions, and law enforcement referrals-often for minor offenses. In interviews, law officials raised concerns that schools often use zero-tolerance policies to \"push out\" students they deem as challenging. Such an approach is particularly concerning for Black students, because research indicates that the application of zero-tolerance policies leads to stricter punishments for all students. Yet, those punishments are applied differently across ethnicity (ACLU, 2020). In particular, school staff more often punish the objective behaviors of white students (e.g., smoking, vandalism, using obscene language). In contrast, they more often punish behavior of Black students such as \"being disrespectful,\" making \"excessive noise,\" or \"acting threatening.\" School professionals' subjective interpretation of these behaviors (Losen, et al., 2015) contributes to biased and exclusionary discipline.",

These discrepancies can lead to systemic racism in the education system, because biases and prejudice affect interpretation of behavior and selection of consequences. Zerotolerance policies are often subjectively interpreted and implemented. Research suggests such variations in use specifically contribute to anti-Black racism, defined as \"policies and practices rooted in institutions such as, education, health care, and justice that mirror and reinforce beliefs, attitudes, prejudice, stereotyping and/or discrimination towards people of Black-African descent\" (Benjamin, 2003 , as cited by Black Health Alliance, 2018 . As a result, zero-tolerance has led to disproportionate rates of injustice for Black students, causing a school-to-prison pipeline in which students, predominantly Black males, are pushed into the criminal justice system through suspensions and expulsions (Bailey, 2017, p. 155; OME, 2020) . The APA Zero-Tolerance Task Force (2008) indicated that bias affected the implementation of zerotolerance policies, as handling of disciplinary issues was contradictory across student groups. School professionals can help end the school-to-prison pipeline, however. Understanding the intersectionality of zero-tolerance and anti-Black racism is a key step toward ending systemic racism in education.",

Systemic racism (also referred to as institutionalized racism) is a system of assigning value and allocating opportunity based on skin color with an unfair allocation of privileges assigned to different individuals and groups, such as in education (APA, 2020; Matsuda et al., 2020) . It is important to note that racism need not be \"purposeful\" by individual school personnel, but biased responding by many, even when done inadvertently or \"unconsciously,\" leads to systemic effects that are catastrophic for many students and communities. One push to eradicate systemic racism comes from the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. The BLM movement originated in 2013, aiming to eradicate systemic racism and white supremacy, and to \"build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes\" (BLM, 2020) . Through this work, they draw attention to how systemic racism deprives BIPOC of fundamental human rights and dignity, in areas such as education (Howard, 2016) .",

Their first demand, however, is to end zero-tolerance discipline. The Canadian chapter of the movement also presents 11 developing movements in education, including public apologies, creating community healing spaces for BIPOC students that have experienced anti-racism in schools, and creating Black advisory and student council committees (Black Lives Matter-Canada, 2020).

This review found that 2016 employee census data indicated only 25% racialized staff, countering the student body's demographics (OME, 2020). Also, they found existing policies and procedures designed to guide police interaction in schools were not working. There was a need for greater accountability by school administrators to inform and consult with parents when implementing progressive discipline that may trigger police intervention (OME, 2020). Further findings suggested school administrators needed more training with deescalation and restorative techniques to reduce the need for police involvement in schools (OME, 2020).",

More significant, however, is that school personnel did not consistently record suspension data, despite Ministry standards. Likewise, the school did not consistently report data on race; in several reports, individuals recoding the reasons for suspensions simply recorded other, without further description. In short, between 2013 and 2019, the OME (2020, p. 9) found that 78% of the secondary school suspensions and approximately 40% of elementary school suspensions (n = 20) did not meet the definition communicated by the MOE for the use of other incident codes. It is noteworthy that BIPOC youth reported they were held to higher standards and different codes of conduct in comparison to white or other racialized students (OME, 2020, p. 10). It is sad that this example is not unique. A similar report produced within the State of Missouri also found that data on student discipline is not easily accessible (ACLU, 2017), but based on available data, it was clear that Black students were disciplined differently than white students, with a higher proportion of Black students experiencing exclusionary discipline or referral to law enforcement.",

Practice guidelines, adapted from the APA Zero-Tolerance Task Force (2008, pp. 857-858) , can help us take action (see Table 5 ). From a behavior-analytic perspective, zero-tolerance policies are punishment procedures that do not produce a long-lasting effect on socially appropriate behaviors (Skiba & Peterson, 1999) . Exclusionary discipline of this sort does not teach new skills or build relationships as a proactive, culturally appropriate approach to school behavior issues. Most important, zerotolerance reinforces systemic racism for BIPOC. Widespread discipline practices of suspension, expulsion, and arrest for school behavior problems may turn students in crisis into criminal offenders (Skiba & Rausch, 2006) . Instead of using punishment-based procedures, the current literature supports implementing preventive measures or restorative justice approaches. For example, we should focus on improving classroom management, teaching social-emotional skills, involving parents and the community in the development of behavior programs, adopting early screening procedures for mental health issues, improving data collection on discipline, and ensuring effective and ongoing collaboration between educators, juvenile justice professionals, and law enforcement (Skiba & Rausch, 2006) .",

Behavior science has powerful tools that can help end the school-to-prison pipeline. Reducing anti-Black racism in schools requires action, even when it feels uncomfortable. It seems there are still skill gaps or blind spots around collecting, utilizing, discussing, and intervening against racial biases, racism, and inequity in school settings. As a group, behavior analysts are not yet skillfully culturally sensitive, and need more training in intercultural competence (Beaulieu et al., 2019) . Purposeful collaboration and consultation with professionals experienced in this area could help (e.g., with advocates and allies of the BIPOC community or with racism researchers in other fields). Future efforts should also help preservice professionals demonstrate the skills necessary for effective dialogue and intervention around racism, such as cultural humility (see Wright, 2019) . Other efforts may focus on training behavior analysts as change agents (Conners et al., 2019) , understanding how one's culture affects decision making and bias (Fong et al., 2016) , and researching ways to reduce racism in service delivery.",

            "text": "This survey had several limitations that can inform future research. First, a sample size of 111 participants may not represent the full range of behavior analysts and professionals working in schools. Replication with a larger sample and with professionals from diverse disciplines is recommended. Second, there was a possibility of response bias. Participants may have had a personal interest in decreasing punishment procedures in schools due to dissatisfaction with current social events involving BIPOC communities. Future research should replicate this study at different points in time when social disparities are not national news. Third, although zerotolerance was defined at the beginning of the survey, some participants indicated less familiarity with this type of exclusionary discipline. Thus, their direct experiences with such policies may have been limited. Future research can recruit participants with more extensive experiences and knowledge with zero-tolerance policies. Fourth, the length of the survey Note. This table provides data from the participant survey indicating percentages of participants who indicated agreement or disagreement with statements made in survey questions. Guidelines Foster a collaborative school team approach incorporating increased flexibility for implementing preventative measures to eliminate \"one size fits all\" discipline. Ensure consistent transparency in communicating discipline incidents with parents and caregivers. Consistently define violations and appropriately train all staff on proactive or reactive steps. Continuously evaluate current school discipline or violence prevention strategies and modify as necessary. Identify high-risk youth and use threat assessments procedures to develop a continuum of alternatives for meaningful interventions. Hire trained professionals (e.g., mental health counselors) who are adequately equipped to address the root of the problem behavior, to better account for minor violations caused by developmental contributions.",

A desire to work toward shared goals of eradicating racism is an essential aspect of multidisciplinary teams working toward an equitable and supportive educational system. Yet, few respondents reported taking action to implement evidence-based interventions for racism. Some don't yet feel comfortable discussing racial inequity in their workplace. So, although professionals in school settings may have the skills and willingness to implement alternatives to exclusionary discipline, the path forward is not easy. Eradicating racial inequity will require school teams to talk about the issues and take action together. This study suggests many professionals have the necessary motivation and skills to improve outcomes for all students, particularly BIPOC students disproportionately affected by discriminatory disciplinary policies.",
