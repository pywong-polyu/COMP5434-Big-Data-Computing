The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognize the importance of improving methods for assessing short-term predictions of influenza activity by hosting an annual influenza forecasting challenge [4] . Several data sources have been used to monitor the influenza activity in the USA and as calibration data for forecasting models. Data include both direct measures of influenza such as the official CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) data [5] and indirect measures such as Internet search queries. The validity of Internet search queries, which have included Google [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , Twitter [13, 14] and Wikipedia [15, 16] , as proxy measures of influenza activity have been the subject of some debate [12] .

This sort of discontinuity can lead to less smooth behaviour as depicted in figure 1 and can be addressed by introducing the smoothing factor a. We will use the partial smoothing in the main text as it seems to have the best performance (electronic supplementary material, figure A6 ). If a data point, x d i , is missing (this happens for 8 days in epidemic weeks 16 and 17 of 2009 and for 4 days in December 2011), the last previous valid data point is used.",

The CDC ILI data (and the Wikipedia proxy) reflect the daily or weekly number of incident infections. To apply the MSS method, we need to specify how to map observations y i , e.g. daily or weekly number of incident infections, to states n i (the number of susceptibles n (S) i , infected n (I) i and recovered n (R) i ). As in [27] , we describe the new cases y i in a time interval [t i21 , t i ] as the difference between the number of infected at the end, n (I) i , and number of infected at the beginning, n (I) i21 , plus the number of recoveries, denoted by R* i . This number of new recoveries is not simply the difference in numbers of people in the R compartment between the beginning and end of the interval [t i21 , t i ] as people might lose immunity and, hence, move from R to S. Therefore, we track the number of recoveries in each time interval [t i21 , t i ] by introducing an artificial compartment R* of newly recovered people that is initialized with 0 at the start of each interval.",

We described an approach to estimate CDC ILI based on Wikipedia data in the 'Wikipedia Data' section and use c ILI 0 or c ILI d 0 from equation (2.1) or equation (2.2) as nowcasts. The uncertainty around this estimate can be characterized using knowledge of its performance from past seasons (electronic supplementary material, Nowcasting). Figure 2 summarizes the main steps of our workflow.",

For all of our comparisons, we assume a one-week lag in publication of CDC ILI data. While this oneweek lag in reporting of CDC data accurately reflects the reporting delay, we note that the CDC ILI data are also sometimes revised at a later date [14] . Thus, while the corrected CDC ILI data may be delayed more than a week, we conservatively assume that the final ILI data are available after 7 days. We perform influenza forecasting retrospectively for the seasons between 2008/2009 and 2015/2016, excluding the pandemic season 2009/2010. We define an influenza season to begin at epidemic week 40 and last for 33 weeks. We assess the performance of the forecasts by calculating a logscore measure [35] which has been used for the judging of the annual CDC Influenza Prediction Challenge [4] . The log-score measure categorizes the per cent ILI in bins of size 0.1 (e.g. [1.0% ILI, 1.1% ILI], [1.1% ILI, 1.2% ILI]). The score is obtained by summing over the forecasting distribution that falls within the bin containing the true value plus the five preceding and five subsequent bins (electronic supplementary materials, Scoring System and figure A1 for details). While the log-score is a valuable instrument for comparing predictions, it is not an intuitive measure, so we also report the reduction in inter-quantile distance which we calculate as the difference between the 95%-quantile and the 5%-quantile of the posterior distribution.",

The benefit decreases over time because the relative shortening of the prediction period decreases with increasing absolute length.

By using daily Wikipedia data, we are able to achieve an absolute reduction in inter-quantile distance by an average 0.24% ILI for the two-week predictions, a 0.76% ILI reduction for the threeweek predictions and a 1.64% ILI reduction for the fourweek predictions ( figure 4 ). This narrower posterior translates to a reduction in prediction uncertainty.

To further investigate the source of this benefit, we analysed the posterior distributions of the parameters. Since the true values of parameters are not known, we cannot use a log-score measure, and instead we use inter-quantile distance to evaluate the parameter distributions. There is a substantial reduction in parameter uncertainty for R eff (figure 5) which can be largely attributed to an uncertainty reduction in the time-varying R 0 (t) (electronic supplementary material, figure A5 ). This reduction in parameter uncertainty in R eff likely explains the reduction in prediction uncertainty when using daily Wikipedia data. All of our model-based predictions can be found in the electronic supplementary material, Prediction results in influenza prediction challenge format; we use the same format as the CDC Influenza Prediction Challenge to facilitate replication and comparison by other modellers [4] .",
