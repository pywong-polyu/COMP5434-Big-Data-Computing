Using a direct-to-RT-PCR method with saliva self-collected from confirmed COVID-19 positive volunteers, we observed 32% false negative results. Confirmed negative and healthy volunteer samples spiked with 10 6 genome copies/mL of heatinactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 showed false negative results of 10% and 13%, respectively. Additional sample heating or dilution of the false negative samples conferred only modest improvements.

Scientists rallied quickly to gather and disseminate information to create sensitive molecular detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 to protect the population 1 . Public health authorities have relied heavily on the \"gold standard\" reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). However, this type of sample collection requires professional healthcare workers for procurement, which has prompted researchers to evaluate saliva as a simple, self-collectable specimen. Many studies have shown comparable diagnostic sensitivity for viral genomic RNA extracted from saliva specimens versus NPS when using RT-PCR for COVID-19 detection 2 . To further increase simplicity, several methods, such as the covidSHIELD test developed at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) 3 , the SalivaDirect test developed at Yale 4 and the SalivaSTAT method developed at the Medical College of Georgia 5 utilize direct analysis from unprocessed saliva to avoid the RNA extraction step.",

However, when SARS-CoV-2-spiked negative saliva samples were tested, amplification with both the E and RdRp primers failed while amplification with the N1 primers produced the expected result, as did amplification of the RNase P gene. Hence, only the N1 gene was tested going forward. We note that Vogels et al. 4 reported a nearly identical observation, in that only the N1 gene, and not the N2, E, or orf1 genes, worked with their SalivaDirect assay. All saliva samples included in this study gave a positive result for the human RNase P internal control using the processing method of the covidSHIELD RT-PCR laboratory developed test 3 (Supplementary Table S1 ). The time between off-site saliva sample collection, and receipt and freezing at the university laboratory (< 72 h) posed no concern with respect to sample integrity. In addition, we did not observe an appreciable difference in RT-PCR C t values when the same saliva sample was tested after a freeze-thaw cycle (see Tables S2 and S3 ). These observations are in agreement with results reported by Herrera et al. 9 and Ott et al. 10 who have reported that saliva samples are stable for up to 15 days at 4 \u00b0C 9 and unaffected by a single freeze-thaw cycle 10 . A trial experiment that included Proteinase K as a protective agent against RNA degradation from salivary RNases, as described in Vogels et al., 4 resulted in failed RT-PCR amplification and therefore was not included in the saliva processing protocol (see details in Supplementary Information).",

Physical examination of all the study samples revealed varying viscosity (ranging from water-like to highly viscous with a heterogeneous composition), clarity (clear, cloudy, turbid) and degree of particulate matter (< 10% to > 75% of the sample volume). We evaluated 50 representative SARS-CoV-2 negative saliva samples-from clear and watery to turbid and viscous-by spiking each with 10 6 gc/mL heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Despite having identical \"viral loads\", these samples showed significant variability in the C t values (average C t value of 31.0 \u00b1 2.2; Supplementary Fig. S2 ) that did not correlate with the physical quality of the sample, suggesting the presence of chemical components that interfered with the assay. We then questioned whether saliva samples collected from assessment center volunteers, who presented with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection or suspected exposure to the virus, caused greater interference than samples from healthy people. A set of 23 healthy volunteer saliva samples were spiked and analyzed as described above. A similar result was obtained wherein three of the samples produced a negative RT-PCR result even after spiking ( Fig. 1b: Healthy volunteer; Supplementary Fig. S2 ) (average C t value of 31.5 \u00b1 1.7; C t range of 28.5-34.1).",

Sample dilution was unable to produce correct results for false negative saliva samples (NPS positive, saliva RT-PCR www.nature.com/scientificreports/ negative) (Fig. 2b , grey circle and square), though this method did remedy false negative results from spiked healthy volunteer samples. While the utility of saliva as a diagnostic specimen cannot be disputed 15 , and even considering the documented reduction in detection sensitivity relative to NPS samples 16 , our observations provide evidence for a potentially significant issue with a high false negative rate when using minimally processed saliva samples for COVID-19 RT-PCR testing. Indeed, the original manuscript describing the covidSHIELD method 3 reported 11% false negative results upon initial testing, but 100% sensitivity upon retesting; Kandel et al. 17 reported 38 of 432 samples (8.8%) as invalid upon initial testing, improving to three invalid samples after retesting; and Sahajpal et al. 5 reported 5% invalid results (though no false negatives).",

We note that several other factors could lead to variability in saliva samples, such as the timing of sample collection with respect to disease progression, symptoms, and time of day; and the volume of saliva provided. Additionally, the distribution of the virus within the COVID-19 positive NPS samples and matching saliva samples may have differed, as the viral load within different regions of the upper respiratory tract is not necessarily equal or static 18 . We also recognize that disease prevalence in the population at the time of sample collection and our limited number of samples may have contributed to our observations. However, general agreement in the rate of false negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results across 137 samples from assessment center attendees and healthy volunteers presented here, and seen in other studies, points to unknown factors that produce significant false negative results with a widely used RT-PCR method. These results indicate that while direct use of minimally processed saliva is desirable to increase the simplicity and reduce the cost for COVID-19 testing, the relatively high rate of false negative results may require additional sample processing, such as RNA extraction, to reduce the possibility of COVID-19 positive citizens unknowingly transmitting the virus within the community.",
