            "text": "In February 2021, the patient received vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria). [1] The COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca is a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenoviral vector ChAdOx1, containing the SARS-CoV2 structural surface glycoprotein antigen (spike protein; nCoV-19) gene, that had received conditional marketing authorisation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older, based on the interim analysis of four pivotal studies where 13,661 individuals were randomised to receive COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca or the anti-meningococcal vaccine MenACWY. [2] Ten days after the vaccination, the patient experienced numbness in her left arm, homolateral to the site where she had received the jab. She had a medical consultation, but the symptoms were considered as a local adverse event of the vaccine and no neurological evaluation was suggested at that time. These symptoms resolved spontaneously in about 2 weeks. She had an anti-Spike IgG testing resulting positive, with a titre of 1244 BAU/mL (cut-off > 50). Fourteen weeks later (May 2021), she received the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca, as scheduled. Three days after the second dose, she awoke feeling numbness in her abdomen, and over the subsequent few days the numbness progressively involved the ulnar side of her upper limbs, and then her lower limbs. She accessed the emergency department, where her general examination was unremarkable, and the vital signs were within normal values. Sensory and motor evoked potentials did not show any abnormalities. She was then discharged, but due to the persistence of the neurological symptoms, a few days later (June 2021), she underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination that showed multiple hyperintense T2 lesions in the periventricular and infratentorial white matter, suggestive of a demyelinating disease. A spinal cord MRI revealed one enhancing lesion in the posterior columns of the cervical cord (C3 level), and two further non-enhancing lesions at C2 and T4 levels ( Fig. 1) . She then came to our attention in the last week of June 2021. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She had a pregnancy with regular delivery 3 years before. Upon specific request, she denied any neurological symptoms had ever occurred before the first abovementioned episode. The neurological examination showed broadened-base gate, mild bilateral dysmetria at the toe-heel test, brisk tendon reflexes, superficial hypoesthesia in the four limbs with thoracic level T4; nystagmus. She received a 5-day course of high-dose IV methylprednisolone with improvement of her symptoms. A spinal tap showed 3 white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, Link index 0.9, and the presence of oligoclonal bands. Anti-MOG and anti-AQP4 antibodies, as well as screening for autoimmune and infective diseases, were negative, and she was diagnosed with MS. At the end of July, she experienced blurred vision in her right eye and weakness in her right limbs; she was therefore treated with another course of IV corticosteroid and screening tests were carried out to commence a highly effective disease-modifying treatment. In the meanwhile, 5 weeks later, she experienced a further worsening of symptoms with numbness in her lower limbs and marked fatigue. She then started on ocrelizumab, without further clinical episodes since then.",

It cannot be excluded that the vaccine administration uncovered a prior central nervous system inflammation that had occurred without clinical signs, triggering its clinical manifestation through the activation of the immune system. It could be argued whether the administration of the second dose of vaccine could have somehow affected the subsequent MS course, triggering further attacks. This observation strengthens the need for careful monitoring of potential adverse events, given that the massive administration of anti-SARS-Cov2 vaccines to huge numbers of individuals might uncover potential rare adverse events that could not be detected during the pivotal trials involving relatively small samples. It is therefore of pivotal importance that the highest attention in monitoring and reporting any possible or suspected adverse events is adopted.",
