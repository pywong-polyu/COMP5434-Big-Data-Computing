Much of the discourse on Africa's response captured in scientific journals revolves around nations, public health agencies and organizations, but little is documented about how individual healthcare facilities have fared. This article reports the challenges faced in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria, including space constraints, diagnostic challenges, shortages in personal protective equipment and health worker infections. The opportunities and strengths that aided the response are also highlighted. The lessons learned will be useful to similar facilities. More information about health facility response at various levels is needed to comprehensively assess Africa's response to the pandemic.",

As first responders, public health agencies such as the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control made concerted and laudable efforts to contain the spread, thus preventing strain on inherently fragile healthcare delivery systems. Currently the pandemic has transitioned into community transmission in most countries, with 1 00 379 cases detected and 20 321 deaths as of 23 August 2020. 1 Besides a vigorous public health response, emergencies of this magnitude also require proactive and functioning healthcare facilities working to maintain services while ensuring patient and health-worker safety. 2 The preparedness and response by African nations, public health agencies and organisations are amply captured in scientific publications, but there is a dearth of information concerning how individual hospitals have prepared and fared.",

Foremost of these was the late start of the pandemic in Africa, allowing a lead time to study the epidemiology of the disease and other countries' responses through World Health Organization briefings, media sources and published scientific data. For instance, we adapted a risk stratification tool from the Individual Staff Risk Assessment Checklist for COVID-19 published by the National Health Service East and North Essex Foundation Trust Occupational Health and COVID-19 Incident Management Team to conduct risk assessments of the UBTH staff. 4 Second, we leveraged on the pool of experts domiciled in our facility, a number of whom are academic staff with research competence, to render consultancy services to the state government at a time when much of the attention of the nation's presidential COVID-19 taskforce was directed at Lagos, the epicentre of the epidemic in Nigeria. These services included modelling the projected trajectory of the pandemic in Edo, assessing the readiness of private facilities in the state to contribute to active case searches by screening and providing IPC training for health workers in state-owned facilities. 5 The initiative resulted in early buy-in into pandemic preparedness plans and ensured cooperation and immense support from the state government. Based on our recommendations, the state government promptly closed schools, prohibited public and social gatherings, including a National sports festival that was slated to kick off in April, and instituted a curfew. These actions contributed to flattening the curve and buying the hospital more time to prepare and plan a response.",
