Objective: Although management of cardiorespiratory changes is pivotal to a favorable prognosis during severe clinical findings, dysregulation of other systems caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may imbalance erythrocyte dynamics, such as a bidirectional positive feedback loop pathophysiology. Method and Results: Recent evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of affecting the genetics and dynamics of erythrocytes and this coexists with a nonhomeostatic function of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems during COVID-19. In hypothesis, SARS-CoV-2-induced systematical alterations of erythrocytes dynamics would constitute a setpoint for COVID-19-related multiple organ failure syndrome and death. Conclusion: The present review covers the most frequent erythrocyte-related nonhomeostatic findings during COVID-19 capable of providing mechanistic clues of SARS-CoV-2-induced infection and inspiring therapeutic-oriented scientific evidence.",

The internalization process of SARS-CoV-2 depends on TMPRSS2, a serine protease that cleaves and activates protein S (5) . In this case, the viral S protein, consisting of spicules of glycoproteins, is cleaved into the S1 and S2 (a protein involved in a viral entry, via the endosome). The S1 is responsible for membrane binding by coupling to the extracellular juxtamembrane domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed in different host tissues and lung cells (8) . However, drugs interfering with angiotensinergic components do not appear to modify the course and clinical severity of COVID-19 (9) . Furthermore, to date, the literature lacks clinical evidence of any pharmacological approach for the angiotensinergic counterregulatory branch during COVID-19, although the involvement of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered irrefutable (10-12) and a promising therapeutic target (13) .

This action of the serine protease, a limiting step for the adhesion of the virus to the cell plasma membrane, allows its entry into the cell, suggesting that the greater aggressiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 may be a consequence of an increase in the direct entry of the virus into the cells, mediated by the serine protease TMPRSS2 (15) . In addition to entry, via the S1, the virus can also enter through the fusion of some endosomal proteases, such as the Cathepsin L, and this turns this enzyme into a potential pharmacotherapy target.

At the 5' end, the largest gene ORF1ab is involved in the coding of 14 non-structural proteins. The 3' end that harbors genes encoding accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and ORF10) comprises structural protein genes that allow the entry to, and infection of, the host cell (17) . The ORFs are responsible for the replication and virulence (16) . The ORF7, for example, may be involved in the viral release, by reducing the expression of the tetherin protein (BST2 gene), which in regular conditions would block different enveloped viruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2, from leaving the host cell. When the virion sprouts out from the cell surface, the tetherin anchored to the cell membrane attaches to a new viral membrane, by hooking the virion to the host cell (18) . Additionally, the ORF7a overexpression may result in apoptosis, via the caspase, besides blockade of cell cycles at the G0 and G1 phases (19) . These modifications in the early stage of cell maturation may impact hematopoiesis. In this sense, the development of pharmacological tools that effectively and directly inhibit the ORFs activity would be innovative and determinant in a better prognosis for those infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

Possible influences on the reticulocyte production may interfere with the erythrocyte replacement in the circulation (27), as this period is necessary to complete the synthesis and maturation of hemoglobin (23, 25).

Starting from the premise that the primordial erythrocyte activity is the gases transportation, disorders related to the morphophysiology, production, function and/or lifespan of red blood cells may result in tissue hypoxia due to the lack of oxygenation. The infection generated by the SARS-CoV-2 reduces the blood oxygen level, which can lead to rapid desaturation, although in some cases, dyspnea may be initially absent (30, 31).",

            "text": "During metabolic processes, these free radicals mediate various biochemical reactions, including electron transfer for energy generation, activation of genes and defense mechanisms during the infection process (32-37). However, oxidative damage is often associated either with the overproduction of free radicals and ROS, that attack important structures inside the cells, or with the downregulation in the antioxidant systems (37) . Approximately 2% to 5% of the oxygen that is metabolized in the mitochondria is diverted to metabolic pathways that give rise to free radicals (38) . This suggests that changes in the gases exchange at the cellular level, as a consequence of COVID-19-related changes in erythrocyte dynamics, would contribute to these harmful metabolic routes. In addition, it is important to emphasize that inflammatory processes, such as those manifested during COVID-19, incisively participate in the inflammation-related oxidative stress due to the mechanism known as respiratory burst (39) , in which phagocytes, especially macrophages, are active sources of free radicals and ROS, while exerting phagocytosis (40) . (41), with the highlight for SOD, CAT and Glutathione (42) . Despite not being a free radical, as it does have an unpaired electron in its last electron shell, the H 2 O 2 is a highly reactive species, that can alter any nearby cell structure, proteins and organelles inside the cells. Unlike other free radicals, the H 2 O 2 is long-lasting and can cross cell membranes with toxicity levels that can be increased 10,000x by the presence of iron. The binding of iron and copper to transferrin, ferritin and ceruloplasmin, as a mechanism of transportation, using and storage of these metals, is capable of preventing and/or minimizing the free radical generation reactions catalyzed by these metals. At the cytoplasm of liver cells, free iron (not bound to ferritin) is easily dissociated as an ion, which makes it catalytically active and available to participate in oxidation-reduction reactions and, consequently, in the generation of free radicals (33, 43). Although iron is an essential metal for most biological organisms (34, 35) , it can modify the redox status and mediate the harmful oxidation of biomolecules, including DNA, proteins, lipids and others, when not tightly controlled (34) . In the light of this possible free iron-dependent pathophysiology, it is worth hypothesizing that the SARS-CoV-2 infection would affect erythrocyte-related iron control mechanisms. This shall be supported by evidence that COVID-19 patients display an unfavorable redox status and an increase in serum ferritin, as a result of erythrocyte damage (43) . The lower part of Figure 1 outlines the mechanisms underlying changes in the redox status in the hypothetical positive feedback loop-based oxidative effects probably involved in erythrocyte and tissue damages.",

These are plasma glycoproteins able to bind with lipophilic substances, such as hormones, medications and others (49) . This increases by 3-to 4-fold are found in cases of acute or chronic inflammation, which highlight glycoproteins as candidates for inflammatory biomarking. Conversely, viral structural proteins reduce liversynthetized \u03b12-macroglobulin, whose activity is implicated in the inhibition of enzymes of the kallikrein-kinin system and complement system (50) coagulation and fibrinolysis (6, 51) . This \u03b12-macroglobulin decrease is also present in the COVID-19 inflammatory phase, making it another severity biomarker (52). The ceruloplasmin, that contains about 95% of the serum copper, also plays a protagonist role in the regulation of iron by performing its oxidation for subsequent incorporation by the transferrin (a complex called haptoglobin), which is irreversibly bound to the hemoglobin and prevents iron loss via kidney excretion (26, 53, 54) . The correlation between free iron and the ceruloplasmin-haptoglobin ratio is considered a strong indicator of hemolysis (28) and a potential tool for COVID-19 prognosis, as an increase in its value provides a clue to the acute phase of inflammatory diseases with a direct hemostatic repercussion (55) . This idea is fully supported by data showing the incidence of iron-deficient anemia in patients who recovered from severe COVID-19 (56) and by the results indicating an association of alterations in anemia and iron metabolism biomarkers during the COVID-19 progression (45, 54, 57) . The event cascades resulting from red cell compromise in severe COVID-19 (58) and the possible early hemolysis triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection involve hemopexin (59) , which is responsible for free heme transport and recycle (60) . Therefore, the physiological levels of hemopexin could not be enough to metabolize excess free iron in this infectious condition. The excessive level of iron alters the metabolism of the hemoglobin and myoglobin, iron-carriers known as transferrin (61) . Such metabolic changes are closely related to inflammatory processes involving chemotaxis, cellular recruitment among other components of the immune system. In this manner, the hemopexin metabolism offers therapeutic targets and a prognosis for COVID-19 (56, 57, 62) .",

Heme is an important component of hemoglobin, composed of a porphyrin ring with iron (ferrous or Fe 2 + ), linked to 4 nitrogen atoms (63) . Increases in ferritin production by the liver, in an attempt to reduce oxidative damage, may be a metabolic reactivity evoked by the COVID-19 inflammation-induced excessive free iron (57) .

At the same time, the ORF1ab, ORF10 and ORF3a can coordinate the attack on heme in the hemoglobin 1-\u03b2 chain and dissociate iron to form porphyrin. The attack on the heme group will decrease functional hemoglobin levels, gradually affecting the oxygen and carbon dioxide transport. Consequently, lung cells may undergo extremely intense inflammatory toxicity due to their inability to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen. This finding coincides with chest radiographic images showing ground-glass opacities likely found in diffuse lung disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection (64, 65) .",

Such mutagenicity results from the viral capacity to store genetic information also in RNA molecules, and this is the case with the SARS-CoV-2 (74, 75) .

These hemoglobin-derived bioactive peptides are transported in the bloodstream and are in charge of regulating several functions throughout the body (83) . Some of these factors are the hemoglobinderived peptides, which are systemically delivered from hemoglobin degradation, that occurs at the end of erythrocyte lifespan. Following the death of these cells, the activity of the enzymes ensures that hemoglobin is adequately hydrolyzed and peptides are released as a result of these enzymatic effects (Table 1 ). By assuming that the activity of these hemoglobin-derived peptides may be part of the puzzle resulting in homeostasis, it is plausible to propose that the acceleration of the erythrocyte degradation by the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation in many systems. Although these studies mostly show the role of hemoglobin-derived peptides in physiological functions, it is likely that these peptides indeed participate in the pathophysiology of some diseases (81, 107), which are comorbidities representing the risk of becoming seriously ill during COVID-19 (65, 108) . In addition, there is evidence of an increase in the level of hemorphins in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (109) and this may share pathophysiological aspects resulting in the cognitive sequelae in patients who recovered from COVID-19 (110, 111) .",

The pyroptosis-originated cell debris would trigger different effects. For example, the activation of the inflammasome and the pyroptosis, induced by the SARS-CoV-2 at the alveolar macrophages, may aggravate the pneumonia status and provoke acute respiratory distress syndrome and fever (20). The combination of leukocytosis and pyroptosis may be the main contributor to the cytokine storm observed in patients with COVID-19, which rapidly results in alarming excessive tissue inflammation, erythrocyte phagocytosis, organ failure and death (20, 22). Therefore, a greater expression and activity of the ORFs could be the mechanism responsible for the chronification and worsening of the patient's clinical condition. In light of this evidence, it is possible to hypothesize that the SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced apoptosis, leading to lung damage, could share cellular and molecular mechanisms with the impairment of the blood cell dynamics and function during COVID-19.",

            "text": "is a blood sample taken from a critically ill COVID-19 patient showing hematological alterations that are also typically found during deficiency of the Band-3 protein in erythrocytes (32).The deficiency in the Band-3 protein in the red blood cell membrane often destabilizes multiprotein complexes(37), thus affecting the overall properties of the membrane morphology, mechanical stability and function. This can result in membrane detachment, with reduced cell deformability and loss of the biconcave morphophysiology. Such structural and biochemical changes can induce early cell removal from the circulation (36), thereby exacerbating the release of free radicals and other metabolites originated from the red blood cell death. In addition to being recently pointed out as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (67), the Band-3 structure and function may be also changed by the oxidative and inflammatory status of COVID-19, as a feedback loop-based mechanism potentially feeding the destructive cascades that affect erythrocyte, endothelium, pneumocytes and others. Inthe erythrocyte, an interrelation among the internal cytoplasm fluidity with the membrane deformability and the protein complex of its surface ensures the functions of transporting O 2 from the lungs and the CO 2 removal from the tissues to the lungs. This transport capacity depends on the conditions of circulatory adaptation, cytosolic hemoglobin and of a larger membrane polypeptide: the aforementioned Band-3. The Band-3 is primarily an ion exchange protein, also known as the anion exchanger levels (therefore, it can determine respiratory acidosis) and that Band-3 is in charge of Cl -/HCO 3 exchanges, a direct correlation of the Band-3 activity with an acid-base balance is undoubted. In addition, its interaction with lipids and other proteins allows for a cytoskeleton multiprotein complex that gives the erythrocytes mechanical and elastic properties (23, 36, 70), regulating blood viscosity. These erythrocyte membrane transport proteins are produced during the primordial stages of the erythroblasts (37). In light of this information, it is plausible to speculate that the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages of hematopoiesis can modify the expression and activity of the Band-3 and this would contribute to the infectious pathophysiology. Further scientific studies are expected to provide evidence of these modifications. Among the different proteins anchored at the erythrocyte membrane, the cytoplasmic (intracellular) domain of the Band-3 is a major organizational center that interacts with many other peripheral proteins or ligands, such as ankyrin, protein 4.1, protein 4.2, aldolase, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD), phosphofructokinase (PFK), deoxyhemoglobin, tyrosine kinase p72syk and hemichromes. This protein complex regulates the interaction of the cytoskeleton with glycolytic enzymes (68, 71). Therefore, besides binding to the extracellular domain of the Band-3, similarly to that speculated for the ACE2 and endosomal mechanisms (5), the SARS-CoV-2 can also modify the structure and function of the intracellular Band-3 domain, resulting in intracellular disorganization and destabilization, even before the viral entry into the cell. Figure 3 comprises the molecular mechanisms involved in Band-3-related morphofunctional changes in erythrocytes.Clinical Exam and Proteomics: PerspectivesChanges in the levels of plasma proteins involved in the COVID-19pathophysiology can be useful in the prognosis, if measured immediately after diagnosis and frequently during the disease progression. The modulation of inflammation, coagulation and immune response by these proteins could be a mechanism underlying the hematological effects of COVID-19, thus allowing for precise correlations with treatments, severity, prognosis and patient survival.High levels of ferritin are indicative of hemolysis and are implicated in the COVID-19 severity since the patient's admission(72,73). These ferritin changes were reported (57) as mediators of immune dysregulation, contributing to the cytokine storm (24). Therefore, assessing serum ferritin at different COVID-19 stages may clue important evidence on disease progression, consequently driving therapeutic approaches.",

The structural alteration of the hemoglobin molecule, especially via the \u03b2 chain, results in inefficiency and oxidation by excessive water entering the heme group(65, 77). This process would be followed by the disintegration of the tetramer and this disaggregated polypeptide precipitates inside the erythrocytes as the Heinz body phenotype(76, 77), as illustrated inFigure 4. However, despite the plausibility of the aforementioned hypotheses, the detection of polymorphisms in erythrocyte proteins and their causal relationship with mutations generated by the SARS-CoV-2 infection is another field necessitating future research. With clinical and laboratory outcomes, the hematologic profile can predict the disease worsening or aid in the clarification of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying viral attacks to different cells. The hemoglobin instability can be explained as a consequence of an abnormal connection between the alpha and beta globins, especially in the \u03b11\u03b21 contacts, and also the blockage of the side chain (SH radical) of the amino acid cysteine (Cis) that occupies position 93 of the \u03b2 polypeptide chain (76, 78). Decreases in the globin attraction to its heme groups are consequences of amino acid replacements that participate in the molecule stabilization and of changes in those aminoacidic residues spatially surrounding the heme group (79, 80). If these processes occur in the \u03b2 globin, reactive changes of side chains would be expected. The globin devoid of the heme is the main cause of the Heinz body formation, fixed on the erythrocyte membrane by double sulfur bonds (77).",

In healthy conditions, hemorphins have high stability in tissues (78) and in human plasma (86) in vitro. It can also be metabolized in the cytosol of renal system cells in vitro (93), degraded by cathepsin B (89), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (94), prolyl oligopeptidase (93), neurolysin and endopeptidase (92). The involvement of cathepsin, lysosomal proteases and other peptidases in the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (78) supports the implication of this virus in the enzymatic processes leading to the erythrocyte death and subsequent dysregulation of different systems. Hemorphins have several activities, such as: antinociception acting as opioid receptor agonists (91, 94, 95); modulation on the activity of the calmodulin-dependent enzyme (96); inhibition of encephalin degradation (97) and angiotensin-convertingenzyme (78); induction release central \u03b2-endorphins (82), and; oxytocinergic activation (79). Hemoglobin-derived peptides also display antinociceptive (91) and cardiovascular effects (98, 99), increases spatial learning (100, 101) and cholinergic neurotransmission (102), modulates the pituitary-adrenal axis and reduces the activity of calcineurin (103). These peptides further regulate the synapses and release of classical neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (104-106). Therefore, changes in the hemoglobin-derived peptide degradation during COVID-19 and other diseases may interfere with several functions.",

The body of evidence and a growing number of hypotheses support viral alteration of the erythrocyte membrane proteins prior to changes in cellular shape, function and final destruction. The possible clinical findings potentially linked to erythrocytic dysregulations, that are proposed throughout the current manuscript, necessitate being better addressed. The detection of the factors involved in the excessive release of the iron ions, free radicals and hemoglobin-derived peptides could unravel the puzzling combination of pathophysiological mechanisms, while providing a prognosis for the evolution of the SARS-Cov-2 infection.
