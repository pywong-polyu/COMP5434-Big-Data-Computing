However, the influence on attitudes and lifestyle due to lockdown amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the influence on attitudes and lifestyle due to lockdown amidst the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi residents. Methods: A cross-sectional survey carried out involving 1635 community dwellers across eight divisions in Bangladesh conducted from April 15, 2020 to May 10, 2020. A structured questionnaire incorporating sociodemographic, attitudes towards lockdown and adverse lifestyle amidst lockdown measures was employed to collect data using the Google Forms. Multiple regression analyses were executed to determine the associated factors of positive attitudes towards lockdown and adverse lifestyle.",

Since the first outbreak of the disease in Wuhan, China, the infectious virus started its ravaging effect all over the world except Antarctica [3] [4] [5] . The major symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea [6] [7] [8] . Lungs are the most affected organs as the virus enters through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 that are mostly prolific in the type 2 alveolar cells of the lungs [9] . Due to lack of sufficient knowledge about the disease, health care systems from third to first world countries struggled to treat the massive number of infected COVID-19 patients [10] . Since COVID-19 disseminates through social contact and there was no medicine available to cure the disease, billions of people all over the world went under lockdown measures to minimize the transmission rate [11, 12] . The active involvement of every person on earth with respect to testing, isolation, contact tracing, social distancing, home quarantine, self-quarantine, maintaining hygiene and using personal protective equipment has become important to combat COVID-19's impact as well as give sufficient time for developing treatment strategies [13, 14] . However, due to varying level of knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic prevention strategies has brought challenges in many countries [10, 15] .",

As of November 20, 2020 Bangladesh confirmed 4,41,159 cases with 6305 deaths and 3,56,722 recoveries [21] . Meanwhile, similar partial or complete lockdown measures were created in other countries; they have disrupted the daily routines of almost two-thirds of the world's population. Since the lockdown enforcement imposes restrictions on people's rights by refraining them from normal day-to-day activities, its usefulness remains a subject of debate among different groups of people, as evidenced by various poll studies during this pandemic [22] . Thus, it will be useful and timely to understand the specific public perception, activities, and attitudes during the lockdown so governments and policymakers can regulate, recommend, and take necessary steps to avoid any undesired outcome and fulfill their basic needs [23] . In addition, this lockdown has affected people of Bangladesh based on their knowledge, attitude, and practices; those who are older, more educated, employed, have a monthly family income over 30,000 BDT (Bangladeshi Taka), and reside in urban areas showed more positive attitude towards the COVID-19 pandemic [24] . Due to the restrictions of normal routine life activities during the complete countrywide lockdown the public's perception, attitude, and activities erupted, and therefore, it is crucial to understand their response for implementing further steps to alleviate their grievances in the long run given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic which is in the process of being under control.",

The present study was the first report on COVID-19, which covers the people living in both urban and rural areas of all divisions in Bangladesh, capturing the holistic dimension of the influence of attitudes and lifestyle due to lockdown of community people.

Lifestyles are interlinked with beliefs and attitudes, hence all of these factors play an important role in promoting health both physical and mental [34] . Since Bangladesh stands in the 18th position in terms of confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the globe as of October 24, 2020 [35] , it is crucial to ensure and implement quality health promotion strategy among people to mitigate the rising physical and psychological complications during and after COVID-19.",

However, an epidemiological survey accomplished in North-Central Nigeria stated that, nearly 80% participants positively supported government measures to control the pandemic in their region [1] . There were several variables among participants that showed a more positive attitude toward the pandemic in our findings. In terms of gender differences, our study showed that positive attitude was significantly higher in females (M = 68.9, SD = 7.0) compared to males (M = 67.3, SD = 9.1) which shows similarity with several studies conducted in Saudi Arabia population (female: M = 28.35, SD = 2.32 vs. male M = 28.06, SD = 3.27) [37] . Again, in terms of educational status, participants who have a higher education level (M = 71.8, SD = 5.2) showed more positivity than participants having secondary level education (M = 66.4, SD = 8.2) towards attitude. The findings show similarity with a study previously conducted on Bangladeshi people during COVID-19 outbreak, which was for higher education (74.1%) vs. secondary level education (52.2%) [24] . Another previous study of Pakistan about knowledge, attitude, practice and risk factors regarding COVID-19, also reported slightly higher scores for post-graduation students than undergraduate students [38] .",

In contrast, studies in Pakistan and China found that being involved in a occupation had a greater positive attitude than being unemployed or a housewife [38, 39] . However, in a multiple regression analysis, being students were associated with the more positive attitudes in the present study. In addition, according to the study finding, being divorced showed higher positivity towards COVID-19 outbreak than unmarried and it was similar according to the study conducted in Chinese residents [39] . Likewise, nearly half of the total participants (47.4%) had adverse lifestyle scores, while the rest showed fairly good lifestyle practice. This finding is consistent with several studies conducted in India, China and Iran [40, 41] . Additionally, adverse lifestyle scores were influenced by male gender, having no formal education/lower educational status, and rural residence as per as multiple regression analysis. In agreement with this finding, males are more vulnerable compared to females during the COVID-19 pandemic [42, 43] . Accordingly, a study in Iran also reported that higher level of education provides more practice scores [44] . Several studies provide similar evidence about education plays an influential factor for healthy practice [45, 46] . The present study found a significant association with residence factor which was seen in other studies [47, 48] . The present study found almost 59.6% participants had sufficient storage of food and 52% had enough medication in their home during lockdown which were asked because of the scarcity of supply. It shows consistency with a study conducted in India that demonstrated almost one-third of participants were motivated to buy and stock essential commodities in case of scarcity [49] . Further, studies in Germany and Kashmir valley in India stored sufficient food for more than a week during the pandemic [50, 51] . In addition, a sizeable minority (42.5%) reported a better relationship with their close one during this pandemic, which indicates a significant risk factor for developing a chronic anxiety disorder, and depression among the rest of them [52, 53] . Indeed, quality knowledge along with positive attitude towards the COVID-19 pandemic brings good hygiene practice among people [51, 52] . Overall, appropriate knowledge during a crisis plays a key role for changing individual behavior [54] . The findings of the study predict overall increasing positive attitudes and lifestyle practice towards COVID-19 during lockdown with lifestyle practice needing improvement. This study recommends that the marginalized group of people (i.e., those who don't have sufficient food or medicine at home), should be provided with necessary and consistent supports since the pandemic doesn't seem to be abated so quickly. In addition, there is also a need of promoting more quality health education program such as mass education programs both in rural and urban areas.",

The same proportion of data could not be collected from all eight divisions of Bangladesh due to the unavailability of spontaneous participants and data collecting volunteers as the country was under complete lockdown during the study period. Also, online data collection was interrupted several times because of limited internet connectivity in some rural areas. Most of the data, including socio-demographic, medical conditions, and lockdown activities were self-reported, so there was no scope to check their authenticity. In the case of some unfortunate and vulnerable people from remote areas, they might be shown to have a negative attitude in most responses due to inaccessibility or unaffordability of available health facilities or other services. However, special attention or support should be given to them for any further research. Furthermore, the present study employed limited factors due to the unavailable information at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak that should be warranted in a future study with more comprehensive factors.",
