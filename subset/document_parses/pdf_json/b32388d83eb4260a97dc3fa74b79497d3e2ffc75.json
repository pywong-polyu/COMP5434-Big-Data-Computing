Such hazards involve significant uncertainty, which must be translated into concrete plans able to be implemented by disaster workers. Little research has explored how disaster managers incorporate different forms of knowledge and uncertainty into preparations for simultaneous hazards or disaster events, or how front-line disaster workers respond to and implement these plans. In this paper I draw on ethnographic research working as a wildland firefighter, interviews with firefighters and fire managers, and state and agency planning documents to examine preparations for two events occurring in Central Oregon in August 2017: (1) the height of wildfire season and (2) hundreds of thousands of anticipated visitors for a total solar eclipse. I find that different qualities of risk, hazard, and uncertainty across these two events were central to the development and implementation of disaster plans. Agency leaders devised worst-case scenario plans for the eclipse based on uncertain predictions regarding hazards from the eclipse and the occurrence of severe wildfires, aiming to eliminate the potential for unknown hazards. These plans were generally met with skepticism by front-line disaster workers. Despite the uncertainties that dominated eclipse-planning rhetoric, firefighters largely identified risks from the eclipse that were risks they dealt with in their daily work as firefighters. I conclude by discussing implications of these findings for conceptual understandings of disaster planning as well as contemporary concerns about skepticism and conspiracy theories directed at government planning and response to disaster events.",

It was just after 8 a.m., and we had gathered for our morning briefing on a very unusual day. Two men sitting at the front of the room led us through day's forecast for the hot and dry day along with measures of atmospheric stability and fire risk. Locally, regionally, and nationally, wildfire response was at a \"Preparedness Level 5,\" indicating that fire danger remained high and virtually all available resources, such as fire crews and engines, were already assigned to fires. The daily safety discussion was about the risk management process, and after a crew member read from a printed handout, one of the Assistant Fire Management Officers (AFMOs) for Cascade National Forest, Matthew, asked the attendees, how can we apply that to today? 1 A firefighter joked, \"don't stare at the sun.\" Today was the solar eclipse.",

It was the height of fire season during a busy summer: nationally, over 18,000 firefighters were working on 89 large wildfires, including over 300,000 acres of wildfires in the Northwest (NIFC Sit Report 8/21/2017). Several months into an active fire season, firefighters were generally tired but not as exhausted as they would be a month later at the end of the season. Yet the energy of the morning was palpable, as our fire crews and nearly everyone in this part of the state geared up for the total solar eclipse, the first total eclipse to hit the continental United States since 1979. In many ways, the 2017 fire season crescendoed not toward the peak of fire season but toward eclipse day, jokingly called the \"eclipse-pocolypse\" by the firefighters with whom I worked.",

            "text": "The timing of a total solar eclipse during wildland fire season offers an unusual case study for exploring how disaster managers prepare for multiple or simultaneous hazards. The likelihood and severity of simultaneous disasters is increasing (Mora et al. 2018 ), yet there is little research on what preparation for multiple hazards or disaster events looks like on the ground. Given the significant uncertainty involved in developing and implementing disaster plans, research is needed to identify how multiple types of knowledge and uncertainty are considered in disaster management, and how front-line workers interact with disaster management plans. In this paper, I draw on my ethnographic research working as a wildland firefighter on the Cascade National Forest to examine how disaster managers and front-line workers-in this case, fire managers and federal agency officials, and on-the-ground firefighters-prepared for and thought about the convergence of two hazards on this National Forest and surrounding areas in August of 2017, (1) the height of a severe wildfire season and (2) hundreds of thousands of anticipated visitors for the total solar eclipse. I ask two related research questions: how do disaster managers develop plans for multiple hazards that involve different forms of knowledge and uncertainty, and how do front-line workers respond to and implement those plans? Merging organizational scholarship on street-level bureaucracy with theories of uncertainty from the sociology of science (Gross 2007; Henderson 2012; Lipsky 1980) , I examine how firefighters as front-line responders contend with uncertainty related to the likelihoods or hazards associated with disaster events. I draw on ethnographic observations and interviews with firefighters and disaster managers to identify how local and federal agencies developed and implemented their plans for the 2017 eclipse, how those plans overlapped and interfered with preparations for the wildfire season, and how those plans were received, challenged, and implemented on the ground. This research identifies unexpected commonalities in disaster preparations across these two types of hazards and demonstrates the importance of considering forms of knowledge and uncertainty in evaluating disaster preparation, particularly in an era of growing skepticism of public health interventions and intensifying global vulnerability to simultaneous hazards and disasters.",

A shift from the field's focus on natural hazards to the social construction of disaster impacts has allowed for greater attention to long-term, multi-scalar social processes and to issues of power and inequality, vulnerability and resilience, and organizational structure and culture (NRC 2012; Tierney 2019; Wisner et al. 2004) . Sociological attention to disasters and their impacts is particularly important as climate change increases the frequency and severity of events such as wildfires (Bachelet et al. 2007 ).",

            "text": "Disaster preparedness (or preparation) is one stage in the emergency management cycle, along with mitigation, response, and recovery (NRC 1991) . Preparedness involves predicting and preventing disasters and developing plans for before, during, and after disaster events to reduce harmful impacts. A key component of preparedness is a multi-stakeholder planning process to develop common understanding of the hazard, knowledge of capabilities and resources, and set of protocols for reducing risks (Buckle 2007, 500-501) . Rather than using different response frameworks for different types of hazards, disaster management increasingly follows an \"all hazards\" approach, which acknowledges the similar impacts of many seemingly distinct disasters, and thus involves consistent and effective response to any disaster or emergency (DHS 2007) . For example, All Hazard Incident Management Teams (AHIMTs) are organized and rostered year-round through the National Incident Management System to respond to all sorts of disasters, ranging from wildland fires to terrorist attacks (FEMA 2019; Miller 2012). 2 While practitioner writing and scholarly research on disaster preparedness is extensive, less is known about preparing and responding to two or more disasters simultaneously (Doan and Shaw 2019) , at least in part because these events can rarely be anticipated. Eclipses themselves are not disasters, but they are a type of mass gathering event, defined as an event with enough people in attendance to \"strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\" (WHO 2008, 7) . 3 Eclipses pose potential hazards because the significant number of visitors traveling to see a total solar eclipse has the potential to cause negative impacts and localized social disruption, overwhelm available resources, and inspire a social response. Thus, an eclipse provides a valuable case study for exploring preparation for multiple hazards, since its timing and potential to overlap with other hazard events (such as wildfires) can be anticipated by disaster managers.",

            "text": "Scholars have developed analytical and computational models for multiple hazard preparation and response, for example, modeling pre-positioning and operational allocation of resources to multiple wildfires (Minciardi et al. 2009 ), or the most effective allocation of resources across multiple cities to simultaneous disasters (Doan and Shaw 2019) . However, analytical models provide incomplete information about how disaster managers and front-line responders will actually act during these types of incidents. As scholars note, decision makers may lack analytical training and \"rely on experience and simple heuristics\" instead of formal models, leading them to \"non-optimal decisions\" (Doan and Shaw 2019, 701) . Similarly, research on organizational response treats \"humanness as a limitation\" or \"an obstacle\" (Henderson 2012, 219). The concept of street-level bureaucracy offers a useful approach for understanding and interpreting the \"humanness\" of front-line responders (Lipsky 1980) . Street-level bureaucrats are public service workers who interact directly with the public and have significant discretion in how they do their work (Lipsky 1980, 3) . 4 While this theory has been widely used to study the work of those in social service, medical, and law enforcement fields (e.g., Henderson 2013; Portillo and Rudes 2014), its relevance for disaster responders has been underexplored (Henderson 2012). Front-line workers actually implement disaster plans and interact with the public before, during, and after events, and thus \"the aggregated behavior of individual actors at the front lines of emergency response in essence becomes the response of organizations to critical incidents\" (Henderson 2012, 218).",

That is, how front-line workers' interpretations and evaluations of the knowledge underpinning the policies they are charged with implementing will influence the discretion with which they act and the ways in which they interact with the public. Additionally, the routine and standardization that defines much of street-level bureaucrats' work (Portillo and Rudes 2014) is challenged by unknowns and uncertainties, which are inherently incompatible with routinization. Research has shown that uncertainty related to rules and policies impacts how front-line workers interpret and perform their jobs (Raaphorst 2017). However, for front-line responders, an additional important area of knowledge and uncertainty relates to the definition and understanding of the disaster risk itself. This type of knowledge may be especially relevant in disaster response situations, since identifying something as a disaster or emergency is \"organizationally and situationally developed\" (Lipsky 1980, 137) . Little is known about how front-line workers or other stakeholders, including skeptical publics, mobilize \"resistance against risk management policies\" (Hagen 2019 (Hagen , 1235 . Qualitative and observational research can provide useful information about how plans are developed, implemented, and questioned by decision makers and disaster workers in real-time situations.",

            "text": "Disaster preparedness aims to reduce the risks from disaster events to impacted populations. Disaster risk can be conceived of as involving four components: hazard (how dangerous something is and what the dangers are), likelihood or exposure (how likely the hazard is to occur), the vulnerability of those impacted, and some evaluation of uncertainties (Tierney 2007; Wisner et al. 2004; Zinn 2008) . Disaster risks are socially determined, rather than being solely determined by the physical, geological, or climatic hazard, meaning that the impacts depend greatly on the vulnerability of potentially impacted populations and how social institutions organize themselves ahead of, during, and after the disaster (Tierney 2007) . Uncertainty is inherent in the concept of risk (Luhmann 1995) , both because risks refer to \"future, unrealized threats which can only be partially predicted\" and because \"the scope and scale of hazards and likelihoods is never fully known\" (Cordner in press) . Sociologists have long demonstrated that organizational form and culture can both directly contribute to catastrophic events and to inaccurate or incomplete assessments of risk (Clarke 1989; Pat\u00e9-Cornell 1990; Perrow 1984; Vaughan 1999) . For example, Vaughan found that mistakes related to the Challenger space shuttle explosion were \"socially organized and systematically produced\" by an organizational culture that normalized deviance from safety requirements (1996, xiv) .",

Extremely rare or unprecedented \"black swan\" events evade accurate risk characterization because they \"have never been encountered before (to the best of the observer's knowledge) and in principle, cannot be anticipated\" (Pat\u00e9-Cornell 2012, 1824). As Cerulo (2006) notes, stakeholders frequently claim that severe disasters could not be anticipated. Yet disaster management is devoted to the prediction and management of hazards and their impacts. The anticipation of worst-case scenarios lends itself to what Clarke (2006) terms \"possibilistic\" thinking, where even low-probability events inspire a collective response. However, more information does not inevitably lead to more complete risk characterization. As Gross (2007) notes, ignorance and knowledge exist in a \"dynamic and recursive\" relationship (742). Rather, \"knowledge about the limits of knowledge,\" his definition of ignorance, \"increases with every state of new knowledge\" (Gross 2007, 751) . Knowledge about disaster events typically involves estimation and interpretation, and thus depends on individual and collective social factors (Eiser et al. 2012) . Because knowledge about disasters is socially produced, relevant uncertainties are not merely derived from the absence of information but also include gaps due to historical knowledge and data collection; reliance on particular instruments, heuristics, or theories; and the use and measurement of particular interventions (Neale and Weir 2015) .",

            "text": "In disaster management, uncertainty is not simply the absence of information, but rather involves a complex interplay of multiple forms of knowledge and ignorance (Gross 2007; Kerwin 1993) . When emergency managers and institutions plan and prepare for disaster events, they are confronted with different forms and levels of knowledge related to the hazards associated with the disaster and the likelihood it will occur in a specific place and time (Table  1) . 5 Known knowns are areas of knowledge involving a clear, accepted understanding of hazard or likelihood, referencing a source of knowledge deemed sufficient by the group in question (Gross 2007; Kerwin 1993) , and include clearly understood hazards and precisely predicable occurrences of disaster events. 6 The source of this knowledge may be expertderived: disaster managers \"know\" when and where an eclipse will occur based on calculations and interpretations from astronomers, physicists, and geographers. The source of knowledge may also be experiential: firefighters \"know\" that wildfire likelihood increases under certain conditions based on their accumulated individual and collective experience. Known unknowns (what Gross calls non-knowledge) involve a clear, accepted understanding about what is not known \"while taking it into account for future planning\" (Gross 2007, 751) . In the case of known unknowns (or non-knowledge), a disaster's hazards or likelihoods are estimated or extrapolated from prior events, places, or other sources of data, and the assumptions and limitations of these estimation practices are acknowledged and considered in evaluating the hazards and likelihoods. A type of known unknown called extended knowledge involves explicitly taking non-knowledge into account in planning or research processes (Gross 2007) . Finally, unknown unknowns (what Gross calls nescience) refer to a complete \"lack of knowledge\" (Gross 2007, 751) . No prior data or experience allows for the accurate estimation or prediction of hazards or likelihoods, putting disaster managers into potential situations of \"total surprise\" (Gross 2007, 751) . Black swan events would fall into the unknown unknown category (Aven 2013; Pat\u00e9-Cornell 2012) because by definition they cannot be anticipated with present knowledge. Focusing on preparedness for two anticipated events (the solar eclipse and a severe wildfire season) allows for an examination of how emergency managers plan for multiple hazards, identifying and considering the different types of uncertainty with which those managers are faced, and how those plans are evaluated and implemented on the ground. In the case of wildfires in Central Oregon in late August, fire managers have a reasonable expectation that wildfires will happen somewhere in the region sometime in August, but they do not know the specifics of when, where, or what will take place. Thus, managers have a relative degree of certainty related to the hazard but do not know the exact likelihood (Fig. 1) . In contrast, an eclipse is an unusual type of event because disaster managers know exactly when and where the eclipse disaster will take place, but they do not know exactly what the social and environmental impacts will be: they know the likelihood with a high degree of certainty but have less certain information about the hazard. Preparations for these simultaneous events involve balancing one against the other. For example, improved preparation for the eclipse could mean limiting initial attack operations on new wildfires so that more resources are available to help with eclipse response, but this would increase the risks of local and regional wildfires growing beyond the initial attack phase and requiring a more significant mobilization.",

Mass gathering events include major sporting events (e.g., Olympics), entertainment activities (e.g., music festivals), or religious or cultural Fig. 1 Relationship between Uncertainty, Knowledge, and Risk activities (e.g., religious pilgrimage). The timing and location of most mass gathering events is typically known well ahead of time and thus impacted communities and stakeholders can develop preparedness and response plans. 7 Research and planning related to mass gathering events typically focuses on \"preventing, minimizing and responding to public health emergencies\" (WHO 2008, 14) by providing medical services and responding to public health incidents such as communicable disease outbreaks (Soomaroo and Murray 2012) .

However, a growing body of social science research on wildfires has focused on issues including community wildfire preparedness, manager interactions with local communities, public perception and support of wildfire policies and prescribed fire, public response during fires, and recovery, among other topics (Brenkert-Smith 2013; Meldrum et al. 2018; McCaffrey 2015; McCaffrey et al. 2013) . In recent years, wildland fires in the United States have grown in total number of acres burned and in measures of destructiveness (National Interagency Fire Center 2019). Anthropogenic global climate change contributes to higher temperatures, record droughts, stronger winds, and reduced snow packs (Bachelet et al. 2007 ), leading to drier fuels, less water available for suppression, and a longer wildfire season. Additionally, risks to people have increased as more people live in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), places where developed settlements abut or are intermixed with forest or brush lands. In the United States, over 120 million people live on 220 million acres of WUI (International Association of Wildland Fire 2013). Agencies and managers prepare for wildfire season and specific events using many strategies and procedures, including training and resource development, anticipating resource shortages, and prepositioning resources and people. Immediately preceding and during an event, they can also use regulatory interventions (e.g., area closures or fire bans) and enforcement tactics (e.g., increase patrols by law enforcement officers) to reduce risks from expected events.",

Wildfire operations on land managed by the US Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are managed collaboratively through an Interagency Fire Management Service (IFMS). Also located in the region are national-level wildfire resources that can be dispatched to non-local fires, including smokejumpers, rappellers, and hotshot crews. 9 The IFMS district in which I worked staffed two handcrews and roughly six engines every day during the summer with full-time firefighters who were a mix of seasonal and year-round employees. 10 Firefighters worked a minimum of 40 h a week, and overtime was common and expected during periods of high fire risk. 11 Risk management policies and plans are developed at high levels within agency bureaucracies, while the implementation of those plans falls to on-the-ground individuals much lower in organizational hierarchies. The fire management hierarchy in the IFMS with which I worked is summarized in Fig. 2 . 12 Office-based leadership develop the plans and procedures, and spend their days largely in the office. High ranking \"agency administrators,\" including forest superintendents or district rangers, do not necessarily have experience as wildland firefighters, though they would have some training in fire organization and operations. The \"office overhead,\" who come from a firefighting background, typically spend little time at this point in their careers working boots-on-the ground in firefighting roles, though most are members of AHIMTs and are dispatched to large fires several times per season in leadership roles. The fire operations staff, on the other hand, are based in the field. \"Field overhead,\" fire operations leadership with decades of experience, go into the field on a regular basis, though they are rarely swinging tools themselves. \"Field operations\"-crew members, squad bosses, and captains-are in the field every day engaged in physical labor as firefighters.",

Parts of Central Oregon were within the \"path of totality,\" the area where the sun is completely blocked by the moon, allowing for several minutes of surreal darkness.

Their preparations involved extended knowledge (Gross 2007 ) from two main sources: previous eclipses in other parts of the world and previous large gatherings in the region. USFS managers queried their counterparts in other parts of the country and world who had experienced eclipses in the past, since Central Oregon had not experienced a total solar eclipse in over a century (Time and Date 2019). They also drew on their experiences with other large influxes of visitors, notably \"Rainbow Family of Loving Light\" festivals (also called Rainbow gatherings) that bring tens of thousands of visitors to National Forest lands every summer (Rainbow Family 2018). The Rainbow gatherings have a troubled relationship with the USFS, since organizers refuse to seek the permits required for such a large event. Concerns related to past Rainbow gatherings in Oregon and elsewhere include impact to public lands, limited access to sanitation facilities and safe drinking water, interpersonal violence, drug use, and infectious disease outbreaks (CDC 2000; Hamway 2017a; Pillai et al. 2010) .",

Some things were clearly known: the date and time of the eclipse, and the astronomically-determined path of totality. Other topics blurred the line between certainty and uncertainty: the number of visitors, where they would be, how long they would stay, and what their impacts might be. Local and state emergency managers took as fact that the crowds would be substantial while acknowledging significant uncertainty regarding visitors' plans: they knew it would be bad, they just didn't know how bad it would be. This uncertainty was reflected in contemporaneous media coverage. A newspaper article in February quoted a Forest Service public affairs officer laughing at the idea of visiting the region during the eclipse for any other reason: \"If you don't care about the eclipse, don't come at that time\u2026 Everything is booked; we already know there will be traffic issues and problems with resources in general\" (Madsen 2017) . Early predictions also linked eclipse traffic with wildfire risk. As the emergency manager for another Central Oregon county told a reporter, \"If we're going to have a big fire, we're going to have it that week\" (Hamway 2017b ). Yet while some aspects of the eclipse were described with relative certainty-the crowds of visitors and the heightened risk of traffic problems and wildfires-forest managers also emphasized uncertainty: \"This is not an event we can get a list of RSVPs for,\" said a BLM spokesperson (Hamway 2017b) .",

Throughout the spring and early summer, planning operations continued within the wildfire operations system. Regularly scheduled meetings, such as the district's weekly fire leadership meeting, added the eclipse as a standing agenda item. The USFS developed detailed written plans for numerous aspects of the eclipse, covering topics ranging from staffing extra wilderness rangers in peak viewing locations to plans for extra porta-potties and garbage collection. Fire managers were actively working to move eclipse hazards from the uncomfortable territory of the unknown unknown to the more familiar space of known unknowns by trying to \"think of everything.\" I observed the ubiquity of eclipse preparations starting on my first day returning to fieldwork in 2017, at an all-day training in late May for Incident Commanders of Type 4 and 5 fires, wildfires that are generally small and low in complexity and risk. Over one hundred people gathered at a county fairground in a high-ceilinged building filled with rows of folding chairs. After a couple of brief welcome messages from agency administrators, the training turned to the eclipse. Two office overheads, Allen and Barry, talked about planning for the eclipse and for a (relatively) smaller gathering of the Rainbow Family that was expected to take place in July and blend into the eclipse celebrations in August. Barry said that the eclipse will be big: \"we don't know exactly how big, but estimates range from 100,000 to 500,000.\" The eclipse would travel across the whole country, he explained, 'but according to meteorologists, the Northwest has the best potential for clear skies. ' Barry ran through expected problems around the time of the eclipse: major resource shortages, no hotel rooms available for out of town firefighters, impacts on travel routes, and damage to public lands: 'it may be hard to respond and it will be hard for resources to travel to or across the eclipse route.' Allen added, 'there may not be cell service, just like if you're in a stadium and you can't get service because it overwhelms the cell towers.",

Barry agreed: according to the Northwest Coordinating Center, which tracks wildfire statistics and resources, on average the region has four or five large wildfire incidents in mid-August and three or four emerging incidents.

That's how most people get killed on the job, is driving.\" Others noted that the volume of traffic would delay response to other emergencies, including wildfires, and could make it difficult for them to do their jobs. As Nathan, a member of the field overhead team with over 20 years of fire experience, explained, Driving is going to be the biggest risk, you know, getting people to a fire and back home from a fire is the biggest risk. We're all very good at our jobs. We've pounded in the safety thing with hazards and snags all summer long, and we've been really good at that. It's just the driving aspect.

Several days before the eclipse, leadership scrapped the plan to station firefighters at distant guard stations but left in place a 6:30 a.m. start time. The morning before the eclipse at briefing, Chris, another field overhead, emphasized the quality of preparation: 'we have a lot of resources. We've prepared a lot\u2026 we're ready.'

The only wildfire call we had that day was a smoldering campfire in a dispersed campground area, lit in spite of fire restrictions, which we quickly dug into the dirt. Other engines and the handcrews had similarly quiet days. Beyond the fire district, the worst expected impacts of the eclipse did not materialize. There were localized traffic headaches and some isolated fuel shortages, but Forestville did not need to use its back-up morgue and the fire district did not mobilize for eclipse-related wildfires. According to Oregon's Office of Emergency Management, \"State emergency managers received no reports of eclipse-related deaths or injuries\u2026 [and] no human-caused wildfires started in the path of totality\" (Schmidt 2017) .",

Yet when it came to the impacts of a disaster event with which they had no prior familiarity, they showed general skepticism of plans made based on known unknowns or that hinted at the possibility of unknown unknowns. These front-line workers generally dismissed risks based on estimations or possibilistic thinking (Clarke 2006) . They pushed back on plans to be stationed out in the field for eclipse week, identified hazards consistent with their regular jobs, and generally downplayed the severity of those hazards. This shows that those who are \"boots on the ground\" during disaster response recognize the limits of knowledge in disaster planning. It also suggests possible constraints on the all hazards approach that currently dominates emergency management in the United States, as disaster workers may be less comfortable veering outside of their training and prior experience to respond to different types of disaster events. This aligns with research on historical disasters identifying conflicts between those in positions of authority, on the one hand, and workers and the public, on the other (Remes 2017) .",

My research demonstrates that front-line workers' responses to uncertainty is not merely a function of their position in a hierarchy, levels of discretion in their daily rounds, and how they interact with the public, key features of existing street-level bureaucracy research. Rather, it also reflects their evaluation of the knowledge that underpins the policies they are called to implement. In situations such as disaster preparedness and response where routinization and standardization are challenged by unknowns and uncertainty, front-line workers draw on the familiar to evaluate the unknown. In this case, firefighters evaluated the potential hazards associated with the solar eclipse through the lens of their daily rounds: driving and public interactions. Future research could explore whether this occurs in other cases: for example, how did front-line emergency medicine workers evaluate the hazards of COVID-19 early in the outbreak of the illness when uncertainties abounded, compared to months later when the arc of the pandemic was better understood?",

Uncomfortable with the idea that eclipse effects might include unknown unknowns, disaster managers developed extended knowledge (Gross 2007 ) based on prior events and experiences. Even though Central Oregon had not experienced a total eclipse in recent history, planners rejected the idea that the eclipse's hazards represented an area of non-knowledge or nescience. Instead, they identified known knowns and known unknowns related to the eclipse's impacts, drawing on eclipses elsewhere, other mass gathering events in Central Oregon, and creative thinking to identify and plan for worst-case scenarios. However, this worst-case planning was resisted by those charged with implementation, resistance that intensified as early predicted hazards associated with the eclipse, such as overwhelmed cell communications and inundated local businesses, failed to materialize. How different stakeholders respond to, minimize, deny, or accept uncertainty is central to how those stakeholders do their work, making sociological understanding of this phenomenon essential for disaster research moving forward.",

Focusing on the preparedness phase of the disaster lifecycle for both the eclipse and the fire season, my ethnographic research was able to identify unexpected commonalities between these dissimilar hazards. Both involved preparing for worst-case scenarios which may not necessarily materialize, with significant implications for disaster management systems and for the allocation of resources. Both involved preparations that were hierarchical and top-down, with few opportunities for input and feedback from on-the-ground workers to in-the-office overhead. This has the potential to decrease buy-in from front-line workers, who may act with greater discretion in areas of their work that they see founded on uncertain information or unknowns. Just as crews were reluctant to camp at distant guard stations for the week of the eclipse, front-line responders may push back against other risk management policies (and the messages around those policies) perceived to be developed with little grounding in experiential knowledge or by office overhead staff who are not (or no longer) engaged in on-the-ground work.",

While skepticism of hierarchical power structures is central to many conspiracy theories (Hagen 2019), firefighters' pushback against disaster plans was instead a reaction to uncertainty, in particular a skepticism of predictions and management decisions based on non-knowledge and unknown hazards. Therefore, my research suggests that skepticism of disaster preparation and response may be particularly likely when significant uncertainty is associated with disaster hazards or likelihood. Understanding responses to disaster preparation is particularly urgent as the risks from wildfires, other hazards, and associated uncertainties are expected to increase with climate change and intensifying demographic vulnerabilities.",

Rappellers lower themselves out of helicopters on cables. Hotshots are members of handcrews with specialty training and certification. All three are considered to be elite wildland firefighters and are deployed to fires around the country, not just locally. 10 The experience of full-time firefighters employed by government agencies such as USFS or BLM is very different from that of contract crew firefighters, most of whom are on-call for extended periods of the fire season and work only when their crew is ordered to a specific fire (Pomeroy and Moseley 2007) . 11 Overtime is expected by all involved. Supervisors expect firefighters to be willing to work overtime and up to 14 consecutive days to staff crews during peak season, and firefighters expect to receive significant overtime to counter their relatively low hourly wage. First-year firefighters (GS-3 pay scale) earn less than $12 an hour following the federal pay scale, while an engine captain (GS-8) earns around $20 an hour, for physically and mentally demanding and dangerous work. 12 This figure reflects the hierarchy I observed during my fieldwork.
