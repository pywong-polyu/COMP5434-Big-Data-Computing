Relational Agents are designed to simulate face-to-face counseling, build rapport, and establish a therapeutic alliance, 25 and can be tailored to respond to incoming information from patients in real-time. Relational Agent interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting behavior change, 26 but have rarely been used to address substance use. 27 However, previous research suggests that Relational Agent interventions are just as effective in screening for AUD as commonly used selfreport measures, 28 and are well-accepted by patients. 27 To bridge the gap between innovation and implementation and increase access to quality SBIRT intervention within primary care, we developed the first Relational Agent to deliver brief intervention and referral to treatment to veterans within VA primary care clinics. As part of this Hybrid Type I implementation trial, 29 an initial sample of veterans participated in a three-phase RA development process to assist in the design and development of the Relational Agent. After participants completed the clinical trial, we conducted qualitative interviews about their experience (results reported separately).",

In addition to reducing provider burden, Relational Agent interventions could address or circumvent entirely patient barriers to care, including stigma associated with disclosing alcohol use and treatment seeking. 11, 19, 20 It would be possible now to develop Relational Agent interventions to deliver SBIRT to patients through their own electronic device in their own home, thus increasing privacy and eliminating travel burden associated with in-person care, and increasing efficiency with respect to patient flow within VHA primary care clinics. This is an especially appealing advantage of Relational Agent technology in light of recent social distancing measures in response to COVID-19. Extensions of this technology could improve clinic efficiency and AUD treatment engagement, but also offset risk associated with clinic closures or inperson treatment restrictions in response to ongoing or future pandemic restrictions. Though we did not find that adding the Relational Agent to intervention by PCP staff improved drinking outcomes, the Relational Agent did deliver brief intervention and referrals to treatment more frequently to patients presenting with a wider range of AUDIT-C scores compared to VA primary care providers. As such, Relational Agent interventions might prove to be important tools to help address AUD concerns remotely, in a structured yet adaptable manner that could be scaled to increase efficiency of clinic operations, decrease provider burden, and potentially improve treatment access.
