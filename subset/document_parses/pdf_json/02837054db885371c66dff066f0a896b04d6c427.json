In addition, the neutralizing antibody response was significantly improved with the heterologous VP prime-DNA boost regimen, and the neutralizing antibody induced with the heterologous prime-boost regimen did not decrease against the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC). The heterologous VP prime-DNA boost regimen not only significantly increased S-and N-specific IFN-\u03b3 T-cell responses, but also induced an equivalent level of T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

VP vaccines are manufactured through an inactivation process of the virus, which leads to a loss of infectivity but retains the main viral antigenicity. VP vaccines also have the advantage of being easily stored and transported for years at 2-8 \u00b0C, making them suitable for use in many low-income countries and locations with limited cold storage capacity.

Heterologous prime-boost regimens using DNA and VP In this study, six-week-old female mice were primed with a VP vaccine and boosted with the VP vaccine or GX-19N DNA vaccine four weeks later for booster vaccination. Immune responses were evaluated two weeks after the last vaccination. The Spike-specific binding antibody was evaluated by ELISA using the receptor binding domain (S RBD , Wuhan) and nucleocapsid (N, Wuhan) proteins. The heterologous VP vaccine prime-GX-19N DNA vaccine boost induced a significantly higher S RBD -specific antibody response than the homologous VP vaccine prime-boost regimen. Compared to VP prime, VP boost increased antibody titer by 1.7fold, whereas DNA boost increased antibody titer by 181-fold. (Fig. 1A) . The ratio of IgG2a to IgG1 antibody titer was, albeit statistically insignificant, increased after GX-19N boosting (Fig 1B) , indicating the enhancement of Th1-polarized immunity, as reported previously 22, 23 . Likewise, the heterologous prime-boost vaccination also induced significantly higher NP-specific antibody responses than the homologous prime-boost vaccination. VP-prime followed by VP-boost increased antibody titer by 1.4-fold, whereas GX-19N DNA-boost increased antibody titer by 512fold. (Fig. 1C ). In addition, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody responses to the Wuhan and VOCs (B.1.351 and B.1.617.2) using the surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), which is highly correlated with the conventional virus neutralization test (cVNT) and pseudovirus-based VNT (pVNT) 24 . In contrast to the previous report that the boosting with 2 \uf06dg VP vaccine increased about 2-fold neutralization titer, the booster immunization with VP vaccine in our experiment did not further enhance neutralization antibody responses in mice primed with VP vaccine. This discrepancy may be due to the differences in immunization dose (0.4 \uf06dg vs. 2 \uf06dg), and assay methods for evaluating neutralization antibody responses (sVNT vs. cVNT).",

            "text": "Heterologous vaccination induced a significantly higher neutralizing antibody titer than the homologous VP prime-boost vaccination. The neutralizing antibody titer obtained through the T-cell responses were also evaluated following the homologous and heterologous vaccination regimens. A higher Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IFN-\u03b3 response was detected by ELIspot in mice that received a heterologous vaccination regimen. Compared to VP-prime, VP-boost increased T cell response by 1.6-fold, whereas GX-19N DNAboost increased T cell response by 38.3fold. (Fig. 3A) . As expected, we observed similar levels of cellular responses to the B.1.351 (mean = 1,644 SFUs/10 6 splenocytes) and B.1.617.2 (mean = 1,753 SFUs/10 6 splenocytes) spike peptides (Fig.   3B ). Similar to the results for the spike peptides, a higher N-specific IFN-\u03b3 response was observed in the heterologous VP vaccine prime-GX-19N DNA vaccine boost regimen. VP-prime followed by VP-boost increased cellular response by 2.9-fold, whereas GX-19N DNA-boost increased cellular response by 8.8-fold. (Fig. 4A) . We also observed similar levels of IFN-\u03b3 T cell response to B.1.351 (mean = 739 SFUs/10 6 splenocytes) and B.1.617.2 (mean = 794 SFUs/10 6 splenocytes) nucleocapsid peptides (Fig. 4B) . This is consistent with previous findings that cellular immunity is relatively unimpaired by VOCs compared to neutralizing antibody responses 26 Comparison of data between groups was performed using two-tailed Student's t-tests. Statistical significance was set at P <0.05. Balb/c mice (n=4/group) were immunized at weeks 0 and 4 as described in the methods, and antibody responses were measured in the sera of mice collected 2 weeks after the last immunization.",

Interestingly, the neutralizing antibody titer obtained for the B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 variants through the heterologous regimen were comparable to those obtained for the Wuhan (Fig. 2B), presumably due to the induction of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. It is worth noting that level of neutralization antibody responses induced by an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) was reduced about 5-fold against variants (B.1.351, B.1.617.2), compared to the wild-type 25 .",

            "text": ". Similar results showing enhancement of neutralization antibody and T cell responses by GX-19N booster immunization were also obtained in a separate independent experiments with different dose and boosting interval.Clinical studies are underway to compare the immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost regimens using approved COVID-19 vaccines. Some studies have already reported that heterologous prime-boost immunization induces a superior immune response compared to homologous primeboost immunization27,28,29 . However, these studies are limited to adenoviral vector-based vaccines (ChAdOx1nCoV-19) and mRNA-based vaccines (BNT162b2), and heterologous prime-boost studies for other platform vaccines such as DNA vaccines and VP vaccines are not in progress. The COVID-19 VP vaccine is one of the most commonly used vaccines in the world. However, some studies have demonstrated that a significant proportion of antibody responses are reduced within six months of vaccination, indicating the need for an additional immunization strategy for VP vaccines30,31,32 , and one plausible approach may be a heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy. Here, we have shown that a highly effective antibody response and T-cell response can be induced by heterologous prime-boost using the VP vaccine and the GX-19N DNA vaccine. Thus, GX-19N boost vaccination is likely to compensate for the weakness of VP vaccines, which are known to induce weak T-cell responses compared to other vaccine platforms such as DNA, mRNA, and viral vectors33,34,35,36 . Finally, based on our results, together with good safety and stability of DNA vaccine, GX-19N DNA vaccine is expected to be optimal as a heterologous booster for VP vaccines.Methods Vaccines. The COVID-19 DNA vaccine, consisting of GX-19 and GX-21 at a 1:2 ratio, was constructed by inserting the antigen genes of SARS-CoV-2 into the pGX27 vector. GX-19 (pGX27-S \u0394TM/IC ) contains the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene lacking the transmembrane (TM)/intracellular (IC) domain, and GX-21 (pGX27-S RBD -F/NP) is designed to express the fusion protein of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, the T4 fibritin C-terminal foldon (S RBD -Foldon), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The S, S RBD -Foldon, and N are preceded by the secretory signal sequence of the tissue plasminogen activation (tPA). The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine produced from Vero cells contains 4 \u03bcg of viral antigens and 0.225 mg of aluminum hydroxide adjuvant in a 0.5-mL dose. Mouse immunizations. Female BALB/c mice aged 6-8 weeks (Central Lab Animal) were intramuscularly immunized with 0.4 \u03bcg/ animal VP vaccine at week 0 and boosted with 12 \u03bcg/animal GX-19N, in a total volume of 50 \u03bcL PBS, into the tibialis anterior muscle with in vivo electroporation with the OrbiJector\u00ae system (SL VAXiGEN Inc.) at week 4. The mice were sacrificed two weeks after the final immunization. Antigen binding ELISA. Serum collected at each time point was evaluated for binding titers. In this assay, 96-well immunosorbent plates (NUNC) were coated with 1 \u03bcg/mL recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-His protein (Sino Biological 40592-V08B) in PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Plates were washed three times with 0.05% PBST (Tween 20 in PBS) and blocked with 5% skim milk in 0.05% PBST (SM) for 2-3 h at room temperature. Sera were serially diluted in 5% SM, added to the wells, and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Following incubation, plates were washed five times with 0.05% PBST and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 115-035-003), IgG1 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 115-035-205), or IgG2a (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 115-035-206) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After the final wash, plates were developed using TMB solution (Surmodics TMBW-1000-01), and the reaction was stopped with 2N H 2 SO 4 . The plates were read at 450 nm using a SpectraMax Plus384 (Molecular Devices).Surrogate virus-neutralization assay Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) analyzed the binding ability of RBD to ACE2 after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum. Serum collected two weeks after final immunization was quantified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sugentech, CONE001E). Briefly, sera were serially diluted in dilution buffer and reacted with HRPconjugated RBD for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The reacted samples were added to a plate coated with human ACE2 protein and incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. Following incubation, the plates were washed five times with wash solution. After the final wash, plates were developed using TMB solution, the reaction was arrested with a stop solution. The plates were read at 450 nm using a SpectraMax Plus384 (Molecular Devices). The reciprocal of the dilution resulting in a binding inhibition rate of 20% or more (PI20) was defined as the neutralizing antibody titer.IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT. The Mouse IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT set (BD 551083) was used as directed by the manufacturer.ELISPOT plates were coated with purified anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3 capture antibody and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Plates were washed and blocked for 2 h with RPMI + 10% FBS (R10 media) Then, 5 \u00d7 10 5 splenocytes were added to each well and stimulated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 with R10 media (negative control), concanavalin A (positive control), or specific peptide pools (2 \u03bcg/ml).Peptide pools consisted of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids and spanned the entire S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (GenScript). After stimulation, the plates were washed, and spots were developed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plates were scanned and counted using the AID ELISPOT reader classic. Spot-forming units (SFU) per million cells was calculated by subtracting the number of negative control wells.Statistical analysis. Data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software).",
