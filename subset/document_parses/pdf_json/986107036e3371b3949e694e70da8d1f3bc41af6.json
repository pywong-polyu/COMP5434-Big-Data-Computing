Causes, mechanisms, incidence, and prevalence of HF in children are more different from those in the adult population. Primary or secondary HF diagnosis in children could often be associated with congenital or vascular malformations or cardiomyopathies, in lower prevalence with infective endocarditis, myocarditis, rheumatic fever, pneumonia, anthracycline toxicity, and renal disorders [2] . In the last year, an increased rate of HF and myocardial dysfunction requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission seemed to be largely spared due to the SARS-CoV\u22122 inflammatory multisystem syndrome [3] . Thus, the prognosis for children with HF is poor, and many cases progress to requiring emergency hospital management and need heart transplantation when drug therapy failed. However, in rare cases, pediatric HF could arise during hospitalization, especially in critically ill patients with severe baseline conditions, leading to a further worsening of the patients' clinical status. Due to the rarity of the phenomenon, to our best knowledge, there are no studies about patients who developed HF during PICU stay.",

However, as this condition could rarely arise during PICU stay, it is necessary (i) to use large registries that collect a vast amount of clinical information about PICU patients and (ii) to apply statistical methods that can both manage a high number of considered variables and account for the significant imbalance between the groups (low number of events vs. high number of non-events). Several methods have been employed to develop prediction models and risk scores in patients with cardiovascular diseases, from traditional statistical approaches to more advanced machine learning techniques (MLTs). In the adult population with HF, machine learning algorithms create risk scores estimating the likelihood of a heart failure diagnosis and the probability of outcomes such as all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and hospitalization [4] [5] [6] [7] . MLTs are also increasingly used for hard outcome prediction in the clinical setting (e.g., in-hospital cardiac arrest) since they present several advantages over traditional methods and show promising performance and better power than existing prediction systems [8, 9] . They help extricate complex relationships between covariates and outcome of interest, even though a low number of events have occurred with respect to the many variables to be tested.",

If this happens, in training an MLT model for risk stratification purposes, it could be biased for patients without HF (majority class) due to the imbalance in data and eventually increasing Type II errors. In such cases, MLT methods should be accompanied by imbalance management procedures to prevent them from becoming a null model, i.e., systematically tending to make incorrect predictions about the least represented HF class (minority class) [10] .",

Breiman proposed the classification and regression tree (CART), the best-known methodology for constructing decision trees (DT) [15] . The basic goal of a DT is to repeatedly decompose data into smaller subsets using a set of splitting rules until a specific stopping criterion is encountered. The key advantage of this method is that the tree structure is easily interpretable; however, this algorithm is prone to over-fitting [16] . \u2022 Random forest is a supervised ensemble learning method that builds a collection of decision trees obtained via bootstrap aggregation, resulting in a forest of trees to predict the outcome of interest.

The purpose is to compute a weighted sum based on 'neurons' importance and to provide an output [18] . \u2022 A single-hidden-layer neural network (NNET) representing the simplest form of the neural network, in which there is only one layer of input nodes that send weighted inputs to a subsequent layer of receiving nodes has been considered for the computation. \u2022 XGB is a decision-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression problems, increasing model accuracy.

They reported that at 24 h before the occurrence, the RF and XGB models achieved the most accurate prediction, with AUCs of 0.80 and 0.79, respectively [31] . More recently, Yun et al. compared different machine learning algorithms' abilities to predict in-hospital death of critically ill patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit. They found that the decision tree showed higher classification results (AUC = 0.96) [32] . Moreover, Wu et al. found that the XGB algorithm was the most accurate compared to the other seven algorithms and showed promising discrimination for detecting in-hospital cardiac arrest, reporting accuracy of 88.9%, sensitivity of 73%, and F1 score of 80% [9] .",

However, no studies have investigated the development of a severe condition such as HF in patients admitted to PICU. This can certainly be justified by the fact that it is a sporadic event. In fact, in our cohort of almost 30,000 subjects, only 1.3% showed this outcome.",

Comparing MLTs in predicting hard outcomes in adult ICUs setting (e.g., in-hospital mor-tality) is under debate but remains under-addressed in the pediatric ICU environment. However, the results agree with the literature concerning the mortality outcome prediction via MLT models in the ICU setting [36] . For example, the gradient boosting (GB) model showed the highest ROC (0.79 (0.77-0.80)) for the 30-day mortality prediction in mechanically ventilated patients, followed by the random forest model (0.78 (0.76-0.80)). Other studies conducted to predict the ICU mortality outcome in COVID\u221219 patients confirmed that the random forest model, followed by the GB predictive tool, outperformed the other MLTs [37] . Furthermore, the XGB model performs better, in comparison with the other MLTs, in predicting the adverse outcome of critically ill influenza patients admitted to the ICU [38] . Generally, the random forest, GB, and XGB methods are demonstrated to make more accurate predictions than an individual MLT model since they are ensemble methods combining the predictions from multiple learners [16] .",

This research revealed that the downsampling method handles the imbalance between classes more successfully than the upsampling one, achieving a more real trade-off between predictive sensitivity and specificity.

At the same time, the organ failures, comorbidities, and admission types played a minor role in the HF development prediction. However, it is worth pointing out that it is difficult to compare results from the literature since this outcome has never been explored before. Notably, we found that the most important variables in the random forest model have also been shown to be important predictors in prior research in pediatric settings [12] . Recently, Lee et al. developed a machine learning model for predicting pediatric mortality in the early stages of intensive care unit admission and compared it with PIM 3 score [33] . Interestingly, they found that the random forest model performed better than PIM 3 score in predicting mortality. Furthermore, as in our results, base excess was among the more significant clinical variables associated with the outcome. However, in the present study, laboratory data and instrumental parameters have not been used in prediction models, but it would be interesting to explore a different set of baseline variables for predicting such an outcome.",
