            "text": "Dry powder inhalers (DPI) represent, in several cases, a valid alternative to liquid forms for inhalation therapy, namely to nebulizers and pressurized metered-dose inhalers [1, 2] , due to their more favourable physicochemical stability, and low environmental impact. Usability and simplification of administration manoeuvres and procedures represent further features of DPIs [3] . Good inhalation performance from a DPI includes several aspects, such as reproducibility and adequate availability of the active ingredient at the site of action [4] . These aspects are related to the dispersibility of the powders during the inhalation act and the aerodynamic behaviour of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) particles, which are mainly related to particle size distribution and particle density. The large majority of drugs administered in the lungs with DPIs are micronized powders at very low dosage. The most popular approach to increase the performance of these DPIs is founded on carrier-based formulations which imply the formation of an adhesive mixture between the micronized API and a coarse carrier. It is common knowledge that mixture stability, from one side, and the DPI performance, from the other side, result from the balance between adhesive and cohesive forces between the API and carrier [1, 5] . Lactose is by far the most commonly used carrier in these applications, although it presents some limitations related to specific categories of lactose-intolerant patients [5] . Moreover, emerging novel APIs may require an increased loading capacity of the carrier [6] or carrier compatibility with APIs carrying primary amino groups such as, for instance, peptides and proteins [5, 7] . For these reasons, the search for alternative carriers such as mannitol for DPIs formulations is getting a great deal of interest [4, [8] [9] [10] . In this respect, mannitol is a nonreducing, nonhygroscopic compound showing promising aerosolization properties [5, 11, 12] . Moreover, its safety on lung administration has been established [13, 14] .",

Della Bella et al. [18] demonstrated the strong relationship between lactose crystal phase and aerosolization performance both with hydrophilic and lipophilic model drugs. The role of solid-state properties, such as those induced by grinding/micronization [19] , on respirability performance has been evidenced by several other authors [5, 8, 20, 21] .",

Therefore, the effect of the crystal phase of D-mannitol used as a carrier in binary adhesive mixtures needs to be addressed in a systematic manner and deserves investigation. To this end, the availability of kinetically stable D-mannitol polymorph powders with particle size distribution suitable for DPI application is a mandatory prerequisite. An interesting cospray drying process for the production of the kinetically stable D-mannitol \u03b4 form in the presence of PVP was reported by Vanhoorne and coworkers [31] .",

Figures 1-4 show the PXRD patterns of the crystallized mannitol \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b1 and hydrate forms in comparison with the relevant theoretical form from CCDC. Considering the supposed \u03b1 form (Figure 1 ) in the absence of PVA (e) [23] , the diffraction pattern substantially differed from that obtained from CCDC (deposition number 224,658, [22] ). The positions of the observed peaks, and in particular the presence of a peak at around 2\u03b8 = 22.6 \u2022 , suggest that in this condition we obtained a mixture of \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms. The addition of 2% PVA (g) resulted in good matching with the reconstructed pattern, as testified in particular by the presence of the diagnostic peaks at 2\u03b8 = 8.91 \u2022 , 2\u03b8 = 10.45 \u2022 , 2\u03b8 = 13.17 \u2022 and the most intense peak at 2\u03b8 = 16.77 \u2022 . At 1% PVA (f) the presence of the latter peak at low intensity suggests the formation of a mixture of phases rather than the pure \u03b1 form, as also indicated by the absence of the peaks at 2\u03b8 = 8.91 \u2022 and 2\u03b8 = 10.45 \u2022 (see Supplementary Table S1 ). Thus, 2% PVA appears to be the lower polymer concentration suitable for obtaining the pure \u03b1 form. Although the use PVA in formulation for inhalation has already been proposed [34] it is worth underlying that PVA has not yet been approved for such applications. Therefore, a low concentration of PVA in the carrier would be beneficial for reducing the polymer burden that may reach the respiratory tree, although it should be considered that most of the carrier deposits in the oropharyngeal region and is eventually swallowed.",

[26, 31] who added 5% of PVP to obtain the stable mannitol \u03b4 form. Similar to the approach adopted for the \u03b1 form, the rationale here was to figure out the lowest amount of polymer necessary to obtain the crystallographic pure (and possibly kinetically stable) \u03b4 form in order to minimize the polymer potentially reaching the lower airways. Thus, five different PVP concentrations (from 0 to 3% w/w of mannitol) were investigated (Figure 3 ). Without PVP (e), as well as with 0.5% w/w polymer (f), the highly intense peak at 2\u03b8 = 9.35 \u2022 , which is characteristic of the \u03b4 form, was observed. However, in the trace from CCDC (c) no peaks were present in 2\u03b8 region between 9.5-18.5 \u2022 , whereas 0 and 0.5% PVP-containing powders showed small peaks at 2\u03b8 = 13.43 \u2022 and 2\u03b8 = 17.05 \u2022 , likely ascribable to the presence of traces of the \u03b1 form (see Supplementary Table S3 ). These two peaks disappeared as the PVP concentration increased, 1% w/w PVP (g) being the minimum polymer concentration to obtain the crystallographically pure \u03b4 form. This powder did not differ from those containing 2% (h) and 3% PVP (i).",

In detail, the BUD deposition profile from the RS01 \u00ae device were not significantly different between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 form, while the mixture BUD with the \u03b4 form resulted in a significantly lower deposition of fine particles on the impactor.

These results are partly in agreement with those reported in the study of Nokhodchi and coworkers who showed that the highest percentage FPF of budesonide was obtained with the formulation of mannitol compared to other carriers, and attributed this better aerosolization performance to the elongated shape of the carrier rather than to its specific surface chemistry [8, 35] .",

Formulations prepared with \u03b1 and \u03b2 polymorphs behaved similarly affording better aerosolization performance with respect to the formulations prepared with \u03b4 mannitol polymorphs or the reference lactose MM50. In the case of the \u03b2 form, the better performance might be ascribed to the small particle size distribution and, in particular, to the greater percentage of micronized particles (see Table 1 ). In fact, in the case mixtures with lactose, it is common knowledge that the presence of fine particles improves the aerosolization performance [5, 18, 39] . However, this was not the case for the mixture prepared with mannitol \u03b1 polymorphs that showed a particle size distribution practically superimposable to that of mannitol form \u03b4. Thus, the differences observed among mannitol polymorphs performance may more likely be ascribed to the different characteristics of the particle solid state rather than to a physical property such as size, whereas this latter cannot be excluded a priori when considering the comparison with lactose (Dv50 = 53 \u00b5m vs. nearly 23.05 \u00b5m for \u03b1 and \u03b4 mannitol).",

Similar mixtures with SS and BUD were also investigated by Della Bella et al. [18] using a Turbospin \u00ae device at a flow of 70 Lmin \u22121 . Therefore, by combining the data reported in this work with those of Della Bella et al., it is possible to study the correlation between resistance of the device (calculated according to Equation (3)) and FPF for both SS and BUD ( Figure S4 ). In agreement to data reported by Hassoun et al.

Moreover, taking into consideration the particle size distribution of the mannitol powders proposed here as carriers for inhalation (Table 1) , it would not be unlikely that some small carrier particles would reach the lung while the biggest ones would deposit in the oropharynx and be swallowed.

It was assumed that this amount would dissolve in the available volume of the lung lining fluid, which has been reported to range between 10 and 30 mL [33] . A worst-case scenario (more concentrated solution) was assumed; thus, 0.2 mg/mL mannitol was considered as reference concentration to be evaluated in the cell viability assay. PVP and PVA alone were taken as references and tested at concentrations of 2 \u00b5g/mL and 4 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, reflecting their relative ratios with mannitol in the carrier particle (1% w/w and 2% w/w, respectively). Figures 9 and 10 report, respectively, cell viability values obtained from the MTT assay after incubating Calu3 or A549 cell lines in the presence of different forms of mannitol for 24 h, as well as PVP and PVA alone, with respect to the untreated control. It can be observed that the crystallized mannitol polymorphs had no deleterious effect on cell viability, as no significant difference could be detected between control cells and treated cells at all concentrations considered, up to 8 times above the reference value (0.2 mg/mL), which was estimated as a \"worst case scenario\" concentration. For A549 cell line ( Figure 10 ), a generally higher variability was observed on viability, which never fell below 85% with respect to control and increased with higher concentrations of mannitol polymorphs, confirming that no cytotoxic effects were ascribable to excipients. These results suggest that not only the recrystallized mannitol, but also PVA and PVP, could be considered as relatively safe excipients for lung administration, thus adding further support to data previously reported in the literature for PVA [40, 41] and PVP [42] [43] [44] .",

The pseudopolymorphic form, namely mannitol hemihydrate, on the contrary, tends very rapidly to convert into the \u03b2 form, which represents the thermodynamically stable form at standard conditions.",

However, we are aware that a limit of the present approach is the fact that we did not take into account the API polymorphism related to the surface modification often associated with mechanical micronization processes such as jet milling [45] . In fact, in the present work we used a single crystal phase for each of the investigated model drugs. As stated elsewhere [5] , the aerosolization process of adhesive mixtures is the result of the summation of several factors which are often interconnected. Our effort consisted in dealing analytically with one of these factors, e.g., the carried solid-state properties. Indeed, the polymorphism of the API represents another fundamental factor that can influence surface energy, aerosolization, flow crystal shape and mechanical properties of the adhesive mixture [46] , and will deserve attention for further research works.",
