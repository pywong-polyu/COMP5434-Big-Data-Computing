The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes severe acute respiratory syndrome yet a majority (>80%) of symptomatic infections have the mild disease [2] whereas approximately one-third of the infections are asymptomatic [3] . It is expected that more than half of all transmissions came from asymptomatic transmission either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals [4] . The gold standard of investigation is the real-time RT-PCR to detect the viral RNA from the nasopharyngeal swab. A systematic review observed a pooled sensitivity at 87.8% (95% CI, 81.5%, and 92.2%) for an initial RT-PCR test [5] . False-negative real-time PCR testing is notable especially in asymptomatic patients, which can be reduced by performing multiple tests [6] . Other limitations include high costs, taking time to get the result, and requirements of experienced staff and sophisticated equipment.",

While the seroprevalence of medical personnel demonstrates 6.7% positive IgM results who required further investigation (real-time PCR) and management (self-quarantine). The rapid antibody test ensures, while reducing anxiety, patients and healthcare workers at the point of care and facilitate the management of PPE more efficiently, at least in the low to moderate COVID-19 prevalence area. Nevertheless, more data is needed to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of the test kit especially in the upscaled pandemic and in the vaccine era in comparison with standard RT-PCR and serologic immunoassays, respectively.",
