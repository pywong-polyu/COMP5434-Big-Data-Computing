Among the pioneering candidate technologies for 6G belong the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which are artificial planar structures with integrated electronic circuits that can be programmed to manipulate the incoming electromagnetic field in a wide variety of functionalities. Incorporating RISs in wireless networks has been recently advocated as a revolutionary means to transform any wireless signal propagation environment to a dynamically programmable one, intended for various networking objectives, such as coverage extension and capacity boosting, spatiotemporal focusing with benefits in energy efficiency and secrecy, and low electromagnetic field exposure.",

We also present a thorough overview of the channel estimation approaches for RIS-empowered communications systems, which constitute a prerequisite step for the optimized incorporation of RISs in future wireless networks. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the RIS technology in the latest wireless communication standards, and highlight the current and future standardization activities for the RIS technology and the consequent RIS-empowered wireless networking approaches. 2 nel among end terminals can be controlled by network operators [8]- [18] . Software-controlled RISs are able to manipulate their impinging signals over-the-air to improve the performance of target communication systems, particularly suffering from severe attenuation and blockage. In the past decade, there has been a growing interest in novel communication paradigms that exploit the implicit randomness of the propagation environment. In this context, index modulation that exploits the indices of building blocks of target communication systems to convey information, appeared as an intriguing alternative to well-established MIMO modes and waveforms used in standards [19] . RIS-empowered communications take this paradigm one step beyond, by exploiting the wireless channel itself, not only to convey information as in index modulation schemes, but also to boost various communication objectives, such as the error performance, capacity, secrecy, outage, and energy efficiency. In other words, smart radio environments enabled by software-defined RISs can be regarded as one-step beyond software-defined wireless communication networks.",

This technology is different from existing massive MIMO transceivers [21] and active beamformers [22] , as well as the cooperative relaying [23]-[25] and backscatter communication [26] paradigms. The most distinguishable property of RISs is their cheap and nearly passive panel of unit cells, each being capable of applying a controllable phase shift to the impinging field (e.g., via two-state reflection coefficients in one of the first RIS designs in [27] ). When used as pure tunable reflectors, RISs do not require radio frequency (RF) signal processing, amplification, filtering, mixing, or up/downconversion. In light of these, RIS-empowered communication can be regarded as a alternative/complementary technology to massive MIMO and active relaying systems.",

Compared with the currently used transceiver technologies in wireless networks, the most distinctive characteristics of the RIS concept lie in making the environment controllable by providing the possibility of fully shaping and controlling the EM response of the environmental objects that are distributed throughout the network. An RIS structure is usually intended to operate as a signal source or wave collector with reconfigurable characteristics, especially for application scenarios where it is used as a passive reflector with the objective of improving the communication performance. Existing RISs can be roughly categorized as contiguous and discrete RISs, while on the basis of power consumption, RIS also can be classified into the active and passive types. We also discuss the different operation modes that an RIS can be used, identifying the hardware requirements per distinctive mode.",

Hardware Designs 1) Active RISs: The term active RIS is adopted when energy-intensive RF circuits and consecutive signal processing units are embedded in the surface [70] , [71] . On another note, active RIS systems comprise a natural evolution of conventional massive MIMO systems, by packing more and more software-controlled antenna elements onto a two-dimensional (2D) surface of finite size [72] . In [73] , the authors name an active RIS as a large intelligent surface (LIS), where the element spacing reduces when the element number increases. A compact integration of a large number of tiny active RIS elements with reconfigurable processing networks can realize a practical continuous antenna aperture. The active RIS structure can be used to transmit and receive signals across the entire surface utilizing the hologram principle [70] , [71] . The discrete photonic antenna array is another practical implementation of active RISs. It integrates active optical-electrical detectors, converters, and modulators for performing transmission, reception, and conversion of optical or RF signals [70] . In [74] , RISs consisting of passive RIS elements and a single receive RF chain for baseband measurements were presented. Very recently in [75] , an active RIS structure where each reflecting element is equipped with a power amplifier is proposed.",

Their circuitry and embedded sensors can be powered with energy harvesting modules, an approach that has the potential of making them truly energy neutral. Regardless of their specific implementations, what makes the passive RIS technology attractive from an energy consumption standpoint, is their capability to shape radio waves impinging upon them, forwarding the incoming signal without employing any power amplifier nor RF chain, and even without applying sophisticated signal processing. Moreover, passive RISs can work in full duplex mode without significant self interference or increased noise level, and require only low-rate control link or backhaul connections. Finally, passive RIS structures can be easily integrated into the wireless communication environment, since their extremely low power consumption and hardware costs allow them to be deployed into building facades, room and factory ceilings, laptop cases, or even human clothing [9] , [11] .",

The so-called hybrid RISs are realized by adding a waveguide to couple to each meta-atom. Each waveguide can be connected to an RF chain. This makes it possible to locally process a portion of the received signals in the digital domain. However, the coupling of the RIS elements to the waveguides makes it impossible for the incident wave to be perfectly reflected. Actually, the coupling level determines the ratio of the reflected energy to the absorbed energy. Its footprint can be reduced and the coupling to the sampling waveguide can be mitigated by keeping this waveguide near cutoff. Such hybrid RISs were recently considered in [49] , [50] for facilitating explicit and implicit channel estimation as well as flexible network management with reduced overhead compared to cascaded channel estimation with passive RISs.",

It consists of mushroom structures, each loaded with a varactor diode; this reconfigurable capacitance results in a reconfigurable resonance frequency, and consequently, a reconfigurable effective impedance. This element was selected since it provides a simple mechanism to realize high reflectivity with reconfigurable phases.To address each meta-atom independently, as required for forming desired refection patterns, the via of the mushroom structure extends through the bottom conductive plate. An annular slot separates the via from the ground plane beneath the substrate. This annular slot allows for coupling the incident wave to another layer. In previous designs, an RF choke (in the form of a radial stub) was placed at the end of this via to diminish RF coupling. In [48] , however, this annular slot was exploited to sense the incident wave. This sensing information can be then used for various network management tasks. 5) Simultaneously Transmitting and Reflecting RISs: The concept of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) was recently presented in [78] . This new type of RIS variant is also referred to as the intelligent omni-surface (IOS) [79] , allowing wireless signals incident on the surface to be simultaneously reflected and transmitted. STAR-RISs can assist in achieving a full-space reconfigurable wireless environment that has a 360-degree coverage [80] . In Fig. 5 , the schematic illustration of the STAR-RIS element is presented, where the tunable surface impedance can be configured to adjust the intensities and distributions of the surface electric and magnetic currents. This, in principle, enables an independent control of both the reflecting phase \u03c6 R and the tranmsission phase \u03c6 T appearing at a STAR-RIS.",

            "text": "The key to achieving tunability for both the reflected and transmitted (refracted) signals is that each element has to support both electric and magnetic currents. As reported in [81] , several prototypes have been implemented which support simultaneous reflection and transmission, e.g., the transparent dynamic metasurface designed by researchers at NTT DOCOMO [82] and the PIN diode empowered by the STAR-IOS prototype [83] , [84] . Similar to the approach of studying conventional reflecting RISs, the hardware modeling of STAR-RISs comes with additional challenges, because transmitted (refracted) signals need to be considered. The authors of [78] studied a general hardware model and near/farfield channel models for STAR-RISs, where the reflection and transmission coefficients of the unit elements were assumed to be independently adjustable. However, in practical cases, the unit elements at STAR-RISs have to be passive-lossless to maintain good scalability. Therefore, the authors of [85] , [86] considered the constraints that should be imposed on the reflection and transmission coefficients of a given passive STAR-RIS element. 6) Amplifying RISs: An amplifying RIS design that incorporates a single power amplifier (PA), enabling reflection amplification, was recently proposed in [69] . Its motivation lies on the double path loss problem and the lossy reflection with passive reflective RISs. In fact, only when the passive RISs are positioned close to terminals can they perform efficiently. Otherwise, they cannot go beyond being a supportive technology for future wireless communications systems. According to this very recent amplifying RIS design, the impinging signal is received by a portion of the RIS. Then, the received EM field is phase configured and fed to the single power amplifier, who in turns feeds it to the remaining portion of the RIS that reflects it with the controllable phase configuration. The amplifying design works solely in the RF domain similar to the waveguide-based approach in [48] . This is different from the full-duplex multi-antenna decode-and-forward relays, as down-conversion and baseband processing is performed [87] .",

In approximately continuous microwave aperture, the meta-particle structure uses the varactor loading technique to broaden its frequency response range, and achieves controllable reflection phase. It is a continuous monolayer metallic structure, and comprises a large number of metaparticles. Each meta-particle contains two metallic trapezoid patches, a central continuous strip, and varactor diodes. By independently and continuously controlling the bias voltage of the varactors, the surface impedance of continuous RISs can be dynamically programmed, and thus manipulate the reflection phase, amplitude states, and the phase distribution over a wide range of frequency bands [88] .

As such, it has attracted great interest in the scientific community of wireless communications the recent years. From the viewpoint of characterization, many measurement campaigns [91] , [92] have studied wireless channels from a static point of view. From these measurement campaigns, we learned that there are some propagation paths available when the LOS component (or another strong path in case of non-LOS propagation) is blocked. However, in real situations such as in street canyon environments, all propagation paths are within the same beam and are blocked simultaneously, leading to a significant performance decrease [93] . The increasing demand for higher frequency bands has recently stimulated the proposal of new models for above 100 GHz [94] , providing first results on angular characterization of the sub-THz channel [95] . On the scenario side, going beyond the classical enhanced mobile broadband, the industrial environment motivated new studies also addressed by 3GPP. Very recently, there exists increasing research interest in propagation channel models that incorporate the change of the wireless environment itself via the inclusion of RISs.

            "text": "Dating back to 1992 to the concept of time reversal [96] in conjunction with its very recent feasibility demonstrations in high frequency bands with large available transmission bandwidths [97] - [99] , as well as the recent interests for RISempowered smart wireless environments [8] - [18] , it becomes apparent that controlling waves in complex media is a major topic of interest. In [100] , the authors experimented with an RIS inside a cavity, emulating a rich scattering environment, and showcased that by maximizing the Green's function between two antennas at a chosen time, yields diffraction-limited spatiotemporal focusing. In addition, by changing the photons' dwell time inside the designed cavity, the relative distribution of the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom were modified. Such RIS-enabled tunable rich scattering conditions were recently considered in [15] for analog multipath shaping. In particular, the RIS was deployed to create pulse-like channel impulse responses that can maximize the channel capacity. In [57] , the authors used a coupled-dipole-based simulator, which faithfully models the underlying wave physics in RISempowered communications inside cavities, to simulate fast fading conditions in rich scattering environments. A stochastic cascaded model for RIS-empowered wireless communications was initially presented in [9] , [12] , where the impact of the RIS in the signal propagation was encapsulated through the reflection coefficients of its state-tunable unit elements. In this generic model which has been extensively adopted up to date, typical channel models can be incorporated (e.g., Rayleigh, Ricean, and Nakagami-m) and the RIS is mainly assumed to be capable of controlling the phases of its unit-amplitude reflection coefficients. Considering realistic circuitry for resonant RIS elements and capitalizing on the transmission line model, [101] presented a practical model for its RIS-induced reflection coefficient, where the phase configuration depends on the amplitude. Very recently in [102] , the authors considered a transfer function approach and introduced a physics-compliant model for the Lorentzian frequency response of the RIS elements, which captures the parameters one can externally control to modify the surface's reflection profile. Based on this RIS frequency response model, an optimization framework for setting the RIS controllable parameters in order to maximize the achievable average sum-rate in the uplink of wideband RIS-empowered multi-user MIMO systems with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling was presented. A multipath signal propagation channel model based on the cascaded channel model was considered in [103] , where the authors presented an optimization framework for RIS-enabled equalization, aiming to reduce the inter-symbol interference (ISI).",

The proposed propagation model unveiled that the phase shifts of RISs can be optimized by appropriate configuration for multipath fading mitigation. In particular, four types of RISs with different configuration capabilities were introduced and their performances on improving received signal power in virtue of the assisted path to resist fast fading were compared through extensive simulation results. An end-to-end channel model including frequency selectivity for RIS-enabled wireless communications was presented in [105] , together with a framework for the potential of RISs for performing equalization. It has been theoretically shown that the RIS can be adjusted according to the incoming signals to maximize the magnitude of the first channel tap tap, making the ISI terms negligible, hence, maximizing the achievable rate performance. In a similar manner, RISs have been used in [47] to confront the Doppler effect in mobile RIS-empowered communications.",

Using this model, each RIS tile is then optimized in two stages. In the offline stage, the RIS units of each tile are jointly designed to support different transmission modes, with every transmission mode effectively corresponding to a given configuration of the phase shifts that the units of the tile apply to an incident EM wave.

It was proved for this deterministic propagation model (i.e., free-space LOS) that an RIS cannot achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than MIMO setups when the array sizes are equal, despite the fact that the SNR in the RIS setup grows with the square of its number of elements in the far-field. A closed-form expression showcasing how large an RIS must be to beat conventional massive MIMO or half-duplex massive MIMO relaying was derived.

With the aid of the stationary phase method, the authors identify sufficient conditions under which an RIS acts as an anomalous mirror, indicating that the received power decays as a function of the reciprocal of the sum of the distances between the transmitter/receiver and the RIS. It is shown that in short distances, an RIS acts as an anomalous mirror, and in the far distance regime acts as a scatterer. Based on the vector generalization of the Green's theorem, a free-space pathloss model for homogenized RISs, made of sub-wavelength scattering elements and being capable to operate either in reflection or transmission mode, is introduced in [33] . The model is formulated in terms of a computable integral that depends on the transmission distances, the polarization of the radio waves, the size of the RIS, and the desired surface transformation. Closed-form expressions are obtained in two asymptotic regimes that are representative of far-field and near-field deployments. A summary of the available path loss models was recently provided in [110] with some of them being experimentally validated inside an anechoic chamber in [31] . Very recently, pathloss models considering THz frequencies are presented [111] , [112] . In [112] , a near-field channel model is proposed that accounts for the size of the RIS elements in the path loss calculation, as well as in the spherical wavefront of the radiated waves. It is shown that a typical THz RIS is likely to operate in the Fresnel zone, where conventional beamforming is suboptimal and hence can reduce the power gain.",

Based on this model, an open-source channel simulator MATLAB package has been finalized, which can be used in channel modeling of RIS-based systems with tunable operating frequency, terminal locations, number of RIS elements, and environments.",

It was shown that the asymptotic SNR limit is equal, but the convergence rate and rank of the spatial corre-lation matrices are different. A channel model for isotropic scattering was presented, whose properties were characterized, including the rank and channel hardening. The derived channel properties were also applied for massive MIMO arrays with the same form factor, called holographic MIMO [20] , [73] . Kronecker-product covariance matrices for the incoming and outgoing channels to/from RISs were recently proposed in [37] , which relate the field's mean direction of arrival/departure and its angle spread with the spatial correlation in planar arrays. The presented model enables the investigation of the role of the channel conditions near RISs in wireless communications empowered by multiple RISs. Based on this model, an asymptotic closed-form expression was derived for the mutual information of a multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple RISs, in the large-antenna limit, using the random matrix and replica theories. Under mild assumptions, asymptotic expressions for the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the channel covariance matrices were derived. It was found that, when the channel close to an RIS is correlated (e.g., for instance due to small angle spread), the communication link benefits significantly from the RIS optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. Furthermore, when the desired reflection from the RIS departs significantly from geometrical optics, the surface can be optimized to provide robust communication links. Building on the properties of the eigenvectors of the covariance matrices, the authors of [37] were able to find the optimal response of the RISs in closed form, bypassing the need for brute-force optimization.",

This model yields a physically meaningful spatial correlation function, whose power spectral density (in the spatial-frequency or wavenumber domain) is impulsive with support on the surface of a sphere of radius \u03ba = 2\u03c0/\u03bb (with \u03bb being the wavelength), and can be uniquely described by a spectral factor that specifies directionality and physically characterizes the propagation environment in its most general form. This structure of the spatial correlation function leads to the two-dimensional Fourier plane-wave spectral representation for the field, which is given by a superposition of a continuum of plane-waves having zero-mean statisticallyindependent Gaussian-distributed random amplitudes. It is shown that the small-scale fading has a singularly-integrable band-limited spectrum in the wavenumber domain that is defined on a disk of radius \u03ba. This is a direct result of the Helmholtz equation, which acts as a two-dimensional linear space-invariant physical filter that projects the number of observable field configurations to a lower-dimensional space. The band-limited nature of the two-dimensional Fourier plane-wave spectral representation is exploited to statistically characterize the small-scale fading over holographic MIMO arrays of compact size.

In this case, channel estimation can be done in a longer periodicity. Conversely, due to the mobility of the UE, the coherence time of the RIS-UE channel is significantly shorter, and the channel estimation needs to be done in shorter periodicity than that of the BS-RIS channel. In another possible scenario where RIS is deployed on glasses of high speed trains, the BS-RIS channel is dynamic while the RIS-UE channel can be regarded as semi-static.

In [138] , two anchor nodes are deployed near the RIS to estimate the BS-RIS-UE channel and two cascaded channel estimation frameworks are presented accordingly. The first approach takes advantage of the fact that all users share the BS-RIS channel. Within the coherence time, a part of the BS-RIS channel is estimated based on anchor-assisted training and feedback, and then the cascaded channel is estimated using user pilot signals more frequently. The second approach estimates the relevant channels of the anchor point A1 and A2 first, namely the BS-RIS-A1 and A1-RIS-A2 channels, then estimates the A2-RIS-UE channel to restore the cascaded BS-RIS-UE channel. In [139] , a transmission protocol for RIS CE and configuration optimization is proposed for RIS-empowered OFDM systems. However, the presented RIS reflection pattern is implemented by ON/OFF switching, which can be costly in practice, and the estimation accuracy suffers since only a portion of RIS elements are activated during the CE period. Recently, a novel transmission protocol with quasi-periodic training symbols is proposed in [140] to perform channel estimation and passive beamforming simultaneously. This adaptive protocol adopts RIS elements grouping and the time interval of adjacent training symbols can be adjusted to balance data transmission delay and effective transmission rate for supporting delaysensitive transmissions.",

In [141] , a novel RIS elements grouping method is proposed as each group consists of a set of adjacent RIS elements that share a common reflection coefficient. The training overhead is greatly reduced as only the combined channel of each group needs to be estimated. Similarly, a novel hierarchical training reflection design is proposed in [142] to progressively estimate the RIS-empowered channels over multiple blocks by exploiting RIS-elements grouping and partition. Moreover, the pilot length can be reduced if only the aggregated channel from the BS to the users, instead of every individual channel coefficient, is estimated [143] . In the two-timescale scheme [144] , the BS beamforming is designed based on the instantaneous aggregated CSI and the length of the pilot sequences only needs to be larger than the number of users instead of the number of RIS elements.",

For comparison, [151] studies the channel estimation performance of the fully passive RIS architecture and the hybrid RIS architecture.

The path with multiple reflections is usually ignored, and only the direct path and a small amount of singlereflection path can reach the receiver. High-frequency channel usually has sparse characteristic, being significantly helpful for simplifying the RIS CE. In [152] , a two-stage channel estimation for parameter decoupling is considered. The AOD of BS-RIS and the DOA of the RIS-UE channel are estimated in the first stage. The parameters estimated in the first stage are used to estimate the azimuth, elevation, and path gain of the RIS cascaded channel in the second stage. Low-overhead CE is achieved through ESPRIT or compressive sensing algorithm. The inherent sparse quasi-static BS-RIS channel assumption is adopted in [134] , and the long-term statistical information of the slow-varying channel components are utilized to carry out jointly BS-RIS and RIS-UE channel calibration and estimation. The cascaded channel can be inferred through Bayesian posterior estimation, and the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm is used to reduce the complexity of estimation approximation. Moreover, [153] considers the illconditioned low-rank channel where RIS is deployed near the UE, transforming the RIS CE problem into a dictionary learning problem. The reliable and robust bilinear adaptive vector AMP algorithm is used to estimate the BS-RIS-UE channel, and the sparsity of the RIS phase shift matrix is utilized in the training phase to eliminate the restored channel permutation ambiguity.

Correspondingly, different subcarriers may point towards different directions for transmitting and cause dispersion problems. It is proved in [156] that the cross-correlation function between the spatial steering vector and the cascaded channel has two peaks in the angle domain, that is, the frequencydependent actual angle and the frequency-independent error angle.

The Newton OMP algorithm is proposed to detect the channel parameters, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to provide strong support for performance evaluation. In [158] , the problem that different incident angles bring different path phases due to beam squint while the RIS phase shift matrix has the same value for all frequencies is analyzed.

The high-dimensional channel can be equally split into multiple low-dimensional channels, greatly reducing channel estimation complexity. An ON-OFF-based MMSE channel estimation method is designed in [159] , splitting the RIS into multiple elements and setting them as ON state at different times. CE is performed for each RIS element separately, achieving low complexity channel estimation. It is assumed in [145] that there is no prior knowledge about the channel and linear square estimation is used to estimate channel through each RIS element (or group). It aims to minimize CRLB under the constraints of attenuation and phase quantization models, and the optimal design is guided by the minimum variance unbiased estimation criteria. Also, it shows that the estimation performance depends on the activation mode of RIS. Actually, the ON/OFF method [133] , [136] , [159] generally yields sub-optimal CE results. In [160] , the channel passing through each RIS element is modeled as a keyhole channel, and the rank-one feature is considered to simplify the estimation. This paper designs a channel splitting expansion scheme and uses eigenvalue decomposition to perform cascaded channel estimation for RIS-empowered communications, greatly reducing the estimation time overhead. Similarly, a sub-channel estimation scheme is designed [161] based on multiple rounds of pilot training.

It derives a closed-form solution based on the Khatri-Rao decomposition of the cascaded channel. An iterative alternate estimation scheme promotes the tensor signal model to the BS and multiple UEs scenarios. Similarly, inspired the promising results of the PARAFAC decomposition [163] in CE for relay systems, two iterative estimation algorithms through PARAFAC of cascaded channels are proposed in [164] . Alternate least square (ALS) and vector approximation message passing (VAMP) algorithms are designed to reconstruct the unknown segmented channels. This paper gives feasibility conditions and computational complexity evaluation, showing promising CE performance gains. In [165] , the adaptive PARAFAC decomposition scheme is adopted to get the initial estimate and track the time-varying channel for the uplink of RIS-enabled MU MIMO systems. Moreover, the Generalized Approximate Message Passing (GAMP) is utilized to recover the RIS-UE channels with reduced the pilot overhead.",

If the mobility cannot be well handled, it becomes challenging to avoid channel estimation deviations, leading to channel matching regardless of link adaptation or beamforming and resulting in a gap between the actual achievable capacity and the ideal channel capacity. In [166] , the cascaded channel is represented as a mobile state-space model. A Kalman filter-based scheme is designed to track the time-varying channel and improve estimation accuracy using the channel time correlation and prior information. The time-varying cascaded channel estimation problem is exploited in [167] by designing a deep learning channel extrapolation scheme. It decomposes the neural network into the timedomain section and the antenna-domain section. In the time domain, the dynamic channel is accurately described by combining the neural network and the cyclic neural network. In the antenna domain, the neural network is modified, the structure of the feedforward neural network is changed, and the enhanced feedforward neural network is designed to enhance the network performance. Moreover, the doppler effect is considered in [168] , and a wideband CE scheme is designed based on doppler shift adjustment for multipath and single path propagations. A quasi-static channel estimation mechanism is proposed for multipath scenarios, adjusting doppler distortion through the joint RIS phase shift matrix design and timefrequency domain conversion.",

The atomic norm optimization method extracts the channel angle and other parameters to achieve the estimation performance with a predetermined beam codebook. It effectively accelerates beam alignment and the channel parameter estimation process.

A low-dimensional parameter space search algorithm is designed to reduce the dimensionality of the four-dimensional parameter estimation problem.

In [171] , the influence of RIS on the positioning is analyzed from the perspective of how to design RIS phase shift matrix to improve positioning accuracy.

A datadriven nonlinear solution based on deep learning is proposed, achieving denoising and approximating the optimal MMSE through convolutional neural networks.

In the second stage, partial CSI obtained in the first stage is used to handle the spatio-temporal correlation between adjacent users. The mapping of the channels of active and inactive users can be realized. The channel extrapolation method of activating part of RIS elements is studied in [181] . The proposed three-stage CSI acquisition of BS-UE comprises direct channel estimation, partial RIS cascaded channel estimation, and overall cascaded channel prediction through deep neural networks. The cumulative estimation error of DNN training in the prediction stage can be overcome effectively through the BS antenna mapping relationship.

Robust beamforming based on non-ideal cascaded channel is investigated in [185] . For the bounded CSI error model, the BS precoding matrix and the RIS phase shift matrix are jointly designed to minimize the total transmission power under the constant modulus constraint and the worstcase QoS constraint. For the statistical CSI error model, modulus constraint and rate interruption probability constraint are considered to achieve better performance with minimum transmit power, low convergence speed and complexity. In [186] , the channel hardening effect is analyzed, assuming that the interference channel is the spatially correlated Rician fading. The UE uplink data rate and the RIS system performance limit are derived. It concludes that the hardware impairments and noise from estimation errors and the non-line of sight (NLOS) path could be ignored with massive RIS elements. The statistical CSI of the BS is utilized in [187] to design the best transmission covariance matrix and RIS phase shift matrix. The achievable data rate is optimized through iterative water-filling optimization and the RIS phase shift matrix is optimized by the projected gradient ascent method.",

            "text": "As extensive research efforts are invested on RISs globally, the standardization work has also taken off, mainly on a regional-level. In China, one of the largest single market for wireless devices, RIS-related standardization work has already been initiated in two different organizations, namely, the FuTURE Mobile Communication Forum and the China Communications Standards Association (CCSA). In the FuTURE forum, a working group (WG) to study approaches to integrate RISs into next generation wireless networks was established in December 2020 [189] . This WG studies the use cases and key technologies to support RISs towards commercialization, and a white paper is planned to summarize the technical trends for further promoting RIS-assisted wireless systems. Compared to the FuTURE forum, CCSA is a more formal standards developing organization (SDO) which can produce normative specifications instead of on top of informative reports. During its 55th meeting, the CCSA technical committee 5 -working group 6 approved a proposal to establish a study item (SI) on RIS [190] . The SI aims to conclude in June 2022 with a technical report as the major deliverable. The scope of this SI includes channel modeling, channel estimation and feedback, beamforming with RISs, AI and RISs, as well as network protocols for RIS-assisted networks. In June 2021, a new industry specification group (ISG) on RIS was approved by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). During the second plenary meeting of ISG RIS, three new work items were approved, which focus on channel and system modeling, use cases and deployment scenarios, and impact to current standards, respectively. All work item descriptions and related contributions can be found on the ETSI portal [191] . The draft group reports of the 3 WIs are targeted to be released in the middle of 2022 and stable report shall be made available by the end of 2022. The ISG will focus on studies and generating informative reports till the year of 2023, after which normative specifications may be considered. The regional efforts to standardize RISs have some echos in global SDOs. During the ITU-R WP 5D meeting in October 2020, countries submitted their candidate proposals for next generation wireless technologies, which will be considered for inclusion into the IMT Future Technology Trends report. According to the draft report [192] , RISs are depicted as critical components for the physical layer of next generation networks. In 3GPP, there was a first proposal submitted to 3GPP during the March 2021 meeting [193] by ZTE Corporation, after which more and more companies are also showing interests in supporting RIS to become a key component of 5G-Advanced networks and beyond, especially the network operators.",

In regional SDOs, the standardization of RISs is under way already as described in the previous part of this section. For future standard activities, it is unlikely for RIS to be established as a dedicated focus group or a WI in the ITU since the ITU mainly focuses on regulatory, spectrum and business aspects. However, RIS related channel modeling is possible to be studied in the ITU. As far as the 3GPP is concerned, the current focus is starting the second stage of 5G by Release 18, and there is no formal plan for 6G yet. According to past experience, each generation of wireless communication standards usually lasts for a decade, indicating that it is reasonable to expect that possible discussions on requirements for 6G systems will begin after 2027. Based on the current standardization progress on 5G, we estimate the first 6G release will be between Release 20 to Release 22. With the COVID-19 pandemic and its profound impact to the global economy and society, the future schedule of 3GPP may be delayed. To standardize RIS as a whole new technology, some preparation work needs to be done and one of the most important work is channel modeling [194] . Due to the novel structure of metamaterials, new channel models are required to model the channel between the antenna of the base station or the UE and reflective elements or regions on RIS.",

One is to first initiate an SI on use cases, deployment scenarios and channel models in Release 19 and then to initiate a WI after the completion of the corresponding SI. This would allow RISs to be deployed as a component of 5G networks, which will help maturing this technology and manufacturing processes. In this case, RISs will be part of 5G standards and, therefore, will be automatically inherited to 6G standards. Another possible approach is to standardize RISs as part of 6G standards together with other new features for 6G. This implies that the deployment of RISs will be delayed to around 2030s and is subject to uncertainties. Since the RIS technology can be seen as generic and band-agnostic, standardizing it as early as possible would enable opportunities for RISs to be combined with other technologies, thus contributing to greener, safer and more reliable wireless networks. On the other hand, there are still some challenging problems to be tackled, which requires a certain amount of time and efforts. Considering the current research status and the maturity of this technology, the year to start studying RISs in 3GPP is likely to be 2023.",

What's more, although carrier aggregation is widely used in different generations of cellular networks, single carrier operation can be prioritized and studied first. Some key aspects of standardization also relates to specific frequency bands on which RIS will be deployed, for example the channel modeling and estimation, and it is more efficient to consider lower frequency bands as a starting point.",

The incorporation of RISs in wireless networks has been recently advocated as a revolutionary means to transform any wireless signal propagation environment to a dynamically programmable one for various networking objectives, such as coverage extension, environmental perception and positioning, and spatiotemporal focusing. In this paper, we provided an overview of the latest advances in RIS hardware architectures and their operational considerations, as well as the most recent developments in the modeling of RISs and RIS-empowered wireless signal propagation. We also presented the up-to-date channel estimation approaches for RIS-empowered communications systems, which constitute a prerequisite step for the optimized incorporation of RISs in future wireless networks.
