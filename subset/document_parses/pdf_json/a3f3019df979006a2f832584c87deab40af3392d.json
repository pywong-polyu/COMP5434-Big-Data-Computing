In the earliest phases, as the needs for medical care grew to inordinate levels, various schemes were formulated to allocate scarce medical resources, facilitate life-or-death decision-making, maximize the saving of human lives, and achieve just and equitable outcomes. In general, allocation guidelines prioritize individuals most likely to benefit from these scarce medical interventions. However, historically marginalized communities in the US -particularly Indigenous-Americans, Native Alaskans, African Americans, and Hispanic-Americanshave disproportionately suffered and died from COVID- 19 We believe the best explanation has to do with entrenched inequalities -(i) most clearly perhaps, unequal access to quality healthcare itself given, for example, limited or non-existent health insurance; greater distance to hospitals; and fewer physicians serving the community, (ii) but also, and perhaps even more significantly, disparities with respect to other social determinants of health, such as crowded and/or sub-standard housing, poor quality education, lower income, inadequate nutrition, and higher risk work settings [3] [4] [5] . These factors, obtaining prior to the pandemic, account for the higher incidence of pre-existing conditions such chronic respiratory illnesses, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.",

However, they provided no data on hospital resources, particularly the ratio of patients to nurses or physicians, hospitals and ICU beds, number of hospital admissions, or independent measures of pre-pandemic hospital performance; and they did not adjust for the case load or for the stage or severity of COVID-19 at the time of admission across the hospitals [14] . We contend that the quality of care that is customary of the best and most resourceful hospitals can be easily degraded by a sudden and persistent surge of patients with COVID. During a pandemic, the primary concern of municipal, state, and federal public health authorities is to save as many lives as possible, rather than to respect individual autonomy or achieve a more equitable society. Absent allocation guidelines, in the context of rapidly rising caseloads, healthcare professionals run the risk of applying traditional \"first-come, first-served\" models of care with disastrous results. To address acute maladies and shortages created by a pandemic, allocation guidelines have been developed by physicians, public health experts, social scientists, bioethicists, and others [15] .",

But even this seemingly controversial prioritization is subject to some criticism because the roles in question -despite working to the advantage of all, at least \"ex ante\" -may not be as \"open to all\" on a fair opportunity basis, as \"ideal\" Rawlsian theory would require. Younger people may in general be prioritized by virtue not only of greater likelihood of benefiting from treatment (because of less co-morbidity, for instance) but also on account of both greater chances to live through several life's stages and greater future life-expectancy [18] .

As to the virtue and merits of the states that do have guidelines, the situation is complex and variable. We attempt to put this complexity in perspective through an assessment of a few guidelines as conveyed in Fig. 2 . Maryland, for example, implements a Deliberative Democracy methodology that engages laypeople and healthcare professionals into informed discussions about how they would like to see their values reflected in policies [21] . Cooperation is foreseeably more likely when the development of allocation protocols is transparent and inclusive of prevailing public sentiments [21] . Colorado, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania deliberately avoid the use of exclusion criteria because of the risk of discrimination against marginalized populations [20] . Alabama abandoned previous allocation policies that limited ventilator access to individuals with severe mental retardation, advanced dementia, or severe traumatic brain injury, without providing new guidelines [22] (Fig. 2) . Several provisions of allocation guidelines in New York and other states appeared to be inspired by the 1918 influenza pandemic and other viral outbreaks at the turn of the twenty-first century [23] . Reliance on historical precedents, particularly at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, may have led to erroneous empirical calculations or arbitrary clinical judgments, perhaps because of prognostic uncertainty and a lack of clinical data. As our understanding of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 improved, COVID-sensitive guidelines were proposed in Colorado, with deliberations about ventilator withdrawal after ~ 21 days of intubation [20] .",

In mid-2020, Blacks, comprising 13% of the US population, made up to 30% of COVID-19 cases [28] . At several subsequent time points, the rate of infection among minority groups was higher than that of their White counterparts (Additional file 3: Appendix C) [7, 28] . Of all ethnic groups, Indigenous-Americans -with a long history of unjust treatment at the hands of the US government -have suffered the greatest rates of infection and mortality from COVID-19 [7, 29] . The UPMC and NYSTF frameworks claim that \"race, ethnicity, gender, insurance coverage, and social worth\" [16] do not influence allocation decisions. However, these guidelines do not adequately reflect today's greater understanding of the role played by disparities regarding the social determinants of health. Thus, their proponents struggle in articulating a cogent argument of fairness in the setting of moderate or extreme scarcity and they acknowledge the inabilities of these allocation frameworks to mitigate \"the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on disadvantaged groups\" in the US [30] . An alternative methodology of a \"give back\" scoring systemthat shifts a 45-year-old Black man with COVID-19 and a low SOFA score from ineligibility to eligibility for ICU care after adjusting for markers of vulnerability (race, low income status, and residence in a socioeconomically disadvantaged community) -has been proposed [31] . Others have considered randomly allocating scarce resources through a lottery system, regardless of prognostic indicators [30] .",

The solution also requires a renewed commitment to social justice and deeper respect for the inherent dignity of each person [34, 35] . To arrive at principles of justice, philosopher John Rawls proposes that decision-makers act behind a \"veil of ignorance\" (VOI) of citizens' characteristics (such as financial status, race, or gender) in order to promote a social order that respects all individuals rather than one that is based upon personal circumstances [17, 36] . The COVID-19 pandemic prompts consideration of how transition to a more just society might be guided by VOI reasoning, only applied to the \"non-ideal\" background circumstances of historically generated and systemically embedded inequities. Studies suggest that VOI reasoning is most useful when people must make and justify decisions involving difficult trade-offs; observers are highly suspicious of decision-makers who rationalize their choices using utilitarian principles [36] , but more accepting of otherwise uncomfortable compromises, if such solutions can be appreciated from a perspective (such as VOI) designed to give practical expression to their fundamental equality as persons.",

Compounding this, data reveal that in the US, where income inequalities have risen to their highest level, healthcare outcomes by specific counties are significantly influenced by residents' wealth [40] .

More should be done to holistically address end-of-life planning, not for the sake of primarily saving scarce resources but rather to honor patient self-determination. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Colorado Program for Patient-centered Decisions published information for patients about life-support and its physiological effects, duration, and ramifications [45] . When more fully informed about their options, adult patients of any age group with respiratory failure from severe COVID-19 may decide against a trial of mechanical ventilation. Pandemic preparedness requires attention to high-quality palliative care for patients who will die. These considerations should not be confused with age-discrimination. They are about respecting patient autonomy under some of the most difficult end-of-life circumstances [46, 47] .",

These workers must be afforded PPE as the pandemic will render their work high-risk and turn them into significant vectors of disease transmission. Also, there must be substantial improvement in education, housing, and jobs for presently impoverished populations [50] . The overarching goal of allocation protocols is to maximize return out of extremely scarce life-saving resources. There is a limit to how far one can depart from the usual guidelines while deriving the full life-saving value of those resources. Indeed, in the absence of deeper societal reforms, both the standard schemes and the alternatives fall seriously short.",

Otherwise, they inflict double jeopardy and disserve large swaths of the US population. Therefore, to be better prepared for the inevitable next pandemic, we must urgently begin two monumental undertakings. First, we must explore new allocation guidelines that incorporate social determinants of health. Second, we must address and reform the structural inequities in US society that account for the strikingly disparate COVID-19 attack, hospitalization, and mortality rates.",
