Efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), is one of the most potent chemical compounds proposed to treat COVID-19 infection. We, therefore, performed virtual screening on FDA approved drugs that are similar to the efavirenz moiety. Subsequently, the compounds were subjected to screening by analyzing their drug-likeness, such as Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET properties. Molecular docking study revealed that Met165, His41, His163, and Phe140 were important interacting residues for COVID-19 main protease receptor-ligand interaction. Five top-ranked compounds, podophyllotoxin, oxacillin, lovastatin, simvastatin, and gefitinib, were selected by virtual screening and docking studies. The highest occupied molecular (HOMO) orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and energy gap values was calculated using density functional theory (DFT).

The redocked results after MD simulation revealed an increase in the binding affinity of simvastatin and lovastatin (8.2 and 7.9 kcal/mol), respectively. Notably, there was a decrease in the binding affinity of podophyllotoxin (7.7 kcal/mol), and the binding affinity of oxacillin and gefitinib (7.7 kcal/mol) remained constant. The docking results showed that H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions might play important roles in contributing to the molecular interactions between the active compounds and the COVID-19 main protease. The DFT calculations and molecular docking showed that lovastatin and simvastatin may be considered as potential hits as anti-coronavirus agents and can be selected for further studies like modification of the scaffold, characterization, and in vitro evaluation.
