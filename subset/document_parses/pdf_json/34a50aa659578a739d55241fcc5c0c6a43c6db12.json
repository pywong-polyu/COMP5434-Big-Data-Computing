Underpinning that response has been a highly effective virus containment strategy which relies on identification, isolation, and contact tracing of cases. The dramatic emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic rendered traditional paper-based systems for managing contact tracing no longer fit for purpose. A rapid digital transformation of the public health contact tracing system occurred to support this effort.",

A multidisciplinary team was established consisting of clinical informaticians, developers, data strategists, and health information managers. An agile \"pair-programming\" approach was undertaken to application development and extensive change efforts were made to maximize adoption of the new digital workflows. Data governance and flows were changed to support rapid management of the pandemic. Results The digital coronavirus application (DCOVA) is a web-based application that securely captures information about people required to quarantine and creates a multiagency secure database to support a successful containment strategy. Conclusion Most of the literature surrounding digital transformation allows time for significant consultation, which was simply not possible under crisis conditions. Our observation is that staff was willing to adopt new digital systems because the reason for change (the COVID-19 pandemic) was clearly pressing. This case study highlights just how critical a unified purpose, is to successful, rapid digital transformation.",

This response has been acknowledged as a globally successful COVID-19 response. 1, 2 COVID-19 has challenged traditional public health methods, as they were reliant on paper-based workflows, spreadsheets, and isolated databases. 3 This pandemic presented a new challenge to public health, whereby intense public focus on the virus, a political and public demand for accurate, real time reporting on number of cases, combined with rapid spread and a 24/7 news cycle has fuelled an insatiable appetite for up-to-the minute information, and low tolerance to adjustments on reported numbers. Many organizations globally are facing similar challenges. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] It was necessary to shift the workflows and data management for the COVID-19 response from traditional siloed information systems, clinical registries, and paper-based workflows to creating a real-time integrated digital data flow to manage COVID-19. The usual processes and structures of a large-scale digital transformation project, such as staff and consumer engagement during the planning of the project, extensive consultation, planning, and detailed workflow training were simply unachievable in the crisis conditions of the pandemic. This digitization of public health workflows at scale to provide real time data was challenging, but essential to support containment efforts and minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in our jurisdiction.",

Working within the constraints of an environment of rapidly changing policy direction meant we had to implement new functionality at a pace that exceeded the rate of system requirements change. Traditional relay processes for health information and communication technology development were too slow for this process. We adopted a \"pairprogramming\" approach to expedite the development time, where the clinical informatician (medical and nursing backgrounds) and the developer worked together in real time to develop the application rather than laborious develop/review cycles. 10 This accelerated the work significantly. Development occurred in the Microsoft Powerapps environment which allows configuration for both mobile and desktop devices, and a low-code strategy was followed by the in-house development team of eight people. Costs were minimal as existing staff and resources were diverted to the COVID effort, and no private contractors were needed. A continuous improvement approach has been taken, with continuous iterative improvements. Agility of development was essential as government policy changed rapidly, often changing quarantine criteria (which needed to be reflected in DCOVA immediately). This flexibility was created by having a dedicated development team on call continuously in a crisis environment.",

Challenges included working with stakeholders to avoid use of free-text fields for key linking elements and ensuring data elements collected were fit for purpose to avoid laborious workflows. Equally important was ensuring data input had sufficient identifying information to allow linkage and the avoidance of duplication. In addition, as a result of the rapidly evolving situation, the business requirements rapidly altered over the crisis response period, with often only a few hours' notice for major policy changes which required complex configuration management in DCOVA and workflow education and retraining for hundreds of staff.",

Passport numbers were common among all travelers and were static (as opposed to phone numbers, addresses). As these consumers then progressed to COVID-19 testing and contact with health care services, a probabilistic matching algorithm was used to interrogate existing records and pathology testing. It would have been much more efficient if we could have used a unique identifier created at the time of the serving of the public health orders.

We had permission to \"fail fast,\" and correct direction as we encountered issues with initial approaches. We followed a horizon approach to digital transformation, a conceptual framework which fortunately had already been established in our jurisdiction (\u25baTable 2; \u25baFig. 3). 17 On reflection, many of the difficulties encountered map back to known syndromes of digital disruption in health care. 18 We experienced digital deceleration as our initial digital procedures were slower than the paper processes, causing staff to initially resist adoption, particularly those with low digital literacy. As they navigated the learning curve, the digital processes became more efficient and adoption increased. We saw data discordance as we navigated mapping the new digital data elements back to the existing spreadsheets and identified duplicates and the need to define the elements in both systems. Digital churn was evident, with a small number of the staff members unable to transition to the digital workflows. We attempted to minimize this digital disruption by providing training and \"at the elbow\" support. Support from senior leadership within the organization was also critical to ensuring various teams \"stay the course,\" and not revert back to manual workflows. DCOVA has now transitioned to business as usual, although ongoing improvements are planned to optimize function and workflow. Data workflows are now timely and allowing sharing of data securely and appropriately to maximize the efficiency of the COVID response (\u25baFig. 4). Global experience of informatics enabling COVID-19 response has recently shown that informatics is critical to a successful response, 3, 19, 20 and the lessons learnt from this case study provide further weight to the premise that clinical informatics is an essential component of effective and timely pandemic containment.",

Our observation is that staff and consumers were willing to rapidly change their work and behaviors because the reason for change (COVID-19 pandemic) was clearly articulated and pressing. This unified driver for change fuelled the digital transformation, despite the lack of traditional preparation measures usually deemed essential to successful transformation. In fact, many of the characteristics of this project (lack of time, limited change management resources) should have doomed this project to failure.
