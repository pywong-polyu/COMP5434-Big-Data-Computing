There has been a massive investment to bring technology to universities; however, there are some significant gaps that must be addressed. The first is the availability of university online platforms and the second is the digitalization of the curriculum combined with teachers' confusion and anxiety around the ability to adjust to the new digital environment. The study is aimed to research the current situation at two Russian universities: RUDN (People's Friendship University of Russia) and PNRPU (Perm National Research Polytechnic University) and describe what changes have been implemented into teaching by the university administration and professors. The research questions include two groups: 1) Learning management system (LMS): Did the university offer a teaching platform to be used by all teachers? Or was it an individual choice of every teacher? 2) Curriculum: Did teachers have to modify the content of their course? In what way? Our study contributes several meaningful findings regarding understanding the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges in changing the education landscape.",

For example, a researcher Petar Jandri\u0107 classifies current reality as post-digital viral modernity with viral education, viral post-truth, and viral open science [8] . Sir John Daniel proposes a selection of professional development resources that educators can adopt during remote learning: The Commonwealth of Learning is an intergovernmental agency of the Commonwealth tasked with helping developing countries use technology effectively in education and training at all levels; UNESCO's list of educational applications (digital learning management systems), platforms (collaboration platforms that support live-video communication) and resources (self-directed learning content), Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platforms; collected resources on digital tools and general tutorials for online teaching. The tutorials were prepared by David Gaertner, an Assistant Professor and a settler scholar in the First Nations and Indigenous Studies Program at the University of British Columbia [9] .

That is why the majority of lecturers of the Mass Communication Department used MS Teams for online seminars or virtual meetings (see Fig. 2 ). Our survey revealed various challenges in online education. The most frequently identified obstacles are struggling with a lack of experience in online programs (63%) and a lack of knowledge about converting paper-based exercises into digital forms (59%). The administration of RUDN University organized training courses for academic staff to reduce techno-anxiety. But the question of how to adapt the style of teaching to digital space fell on teachers' shoulders and intuition. The next obstacle is an attempt to balance online teaching with parenting (23%). According to educators, there were a lot of confusing situations when teachers' kids' heads popped into a virtual lesson. Respondents also said about zoombombing (14%), where uninvited participants interrupted meetings and distracted students' attention. So many teachers decided to switch from Zoom to Microsoft Teams. Moreover, the study demonstrated a lack of participation in online discussions (41%), especially compared with face-to-face interaction during traditional lessons.
