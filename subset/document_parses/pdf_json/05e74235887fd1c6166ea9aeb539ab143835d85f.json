It is associated with a nonspecific clinical presentation, often with alteration in mental status occurring about 12 to 72 h after a viral illness, and imaging often displays symmetric thalamic lesions with edema, petechial hemorrhage, and necrosis [1] . Three cases of ANE have been reported in association with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and there are no reported cases of ANE occurring in pregnancy [2] [3] [4] . Treatment is with immunomodulating therapy and, if started early, can improve outcomes [5] .",

The differential diagnosis includes acute encephalitides (bacterial, viral, autoimmune inflammatory), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), Wernicke's encephalopathy, and acute cerebrovascular disorders such as acute ischemic stroke involving the artery of Percheron or top of the basilar or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis involving the vein of Galen or straight sinus [8] . Based upon laboratory and imaging findings, we were able to exclude infectious and cerebrovascular etiologies. There were no clear antecedent events to cause PRES or HIE. It is useful to obtain CSF in these patients to aid in excluding certain infectious or inflammatory conditions. Two-thirds of ANE patients have elevated CSF protein with no pleocytosis [5] . The lack of inflammatory cells is a key differentiator from inflammatory immunemediated processes such as acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) [5] . Unfortunately, lumbar puncture was unable to be performed in our case given significant thalamic edema. Based upon imaging, inflammatory conditions such as ADEM were deemed less likely in our patient, as this usually presents with asymmetric involvement of the central semiovale, basal ganglia, and thalamus [8] .",

Limitations of this report include the inability to obtain CSF studies, including CSF SARS-CoV-2. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, ANE should be considered in the differential diagnosis for bilateral thalamic lesions, as prompt detection and management can result in favorable outcomes. While bilateral thalamic lesions often portend a poor prognosis, our patient made an excellent recovery, suggesting outcomes depend on the etiology of the lesions.",
