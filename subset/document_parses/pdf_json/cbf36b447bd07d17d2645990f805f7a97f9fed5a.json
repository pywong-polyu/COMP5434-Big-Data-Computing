During June 2016 to June 2018, because of the Zika epidemic, patients with acute onset of generalized maculopapular rash, arthritis or arthralgia, or non-purulent conjunctivitis were eligible for participation, regardless of fever occurrence. Prior to enrollment, informed consent was obtained. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Ponce Medical School Foundation (PMSF) Institutional Review Boards approved the study protocol. Using a case investigation form (CIF), vital signs, signs and symptoms of current AFI, history of exposures and chronic disease, and clinical laboratory results were recorded at enrollment. All study participants had blood (5 mL in EDTA, 7 ml whole blood), urine (15 mL) , and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs collected at enrollment. Convalescent blood (5 mL in EDTA, 5 mL whole blood) and urine (10 mL) were collected at the follow-up visit or hospital discharge.",

We defined monthly total arboviral infections as the sum of confirmed dengue, chikungunya and Zika infections; and monthly combined respiratory infections as the sum of confirmed IAV, IBV, HMPV, HRSV, AdV, PIV-1, and PIV-3 occurring in each month. Total respiratory infections served as a proxy for ILI cases. We examined the seasonal trends of total arboviruses, as opposed to the individual arboviruses, because chikungunya and Zika case data were only available for at most two years and wavelet methods rely on longer time-series (i.e. >2 years) to identify seasonal trends. First, each case count time-series was log transformed (first adding 1 to all counts) and normalized (subtracting the mean of the time-series then dividing by the standard deviation). To extract the seasonal patterns of each time-series, normalized case count time-series were transformed into continuous wavelet transforms using Morlet wavelet decompositions (using the dplR R package) and filtered all components with a frequency in the range of 8 to 16 months, a common time-frame used to examine arboviral seasonality [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

Coherence is a metric of relatedness between two timeseries at the same time-scale regardless of the temporal relationship between the two, where 1 indicates the series are identical in pattern and 0 indicates series have no similarity. We estimated the timing of the seasonal pattern for an individual pathogen using phase angles, and also estimated the lag (i.e. difference) in timing between two pathogens using the phase difference. The phase difference serves as a metric of similarity in timing of two time-series' patterns relative to each other, i.e. if the patterns of two time-series are occurring at the same time or if one is occurring earlier or later in time (months) relative to the other. Average phase angle transforms for individual pathogens were estimated as the circular average of periodicity-specific phase angle (8-16 months) and was used to examine seasonal cycle in radians for each individual and total infections. Phase differences were derived as the pairwise difference in phase angles between two pathogens, as previously described [27] [28] [29] . Phase differences were calculated to assess the lag (in months) between time series. A phase difference of 0 indicated the two seasonal disease time-series are occurring at the same time (i.e. in phase), which may or may not have high coherence.",

The distinct seasonal patterns of the two infection groups observed in Fig 2A and 2B were confirmed through moderate estimates from the coherence analysis. The mean seasonal coherence between arboviruses and respiratory viruses was 0.48 (Table 3) , reflecting similar, but not identical, seasonal patterns, in both pathogen types.

We found a trend of increasing proportion of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya diagnosis with increasing age. It is important for clinicians to suspect arboviruses infections in children of all ages in endemic areas, but especially in those older than 5 years old. Several factors should guide clinician diagnostic suspicion in a febrile child, including the local epidemiology. Clinicians should be aware of any ongoing outbreak or increase of number of cases for fever-causing diseases and use this information during the evaluation of patients in the pediatric ED. Clinicians should also consider the distinct seasonality of respiratory viruses and arboviruses when considering possible differential diagnoses. For diseases like dengue, that can be life-threatening, for which a specific treatment doesn't exist, and vaccines are not yet available in Puerto Rico yet, improved clinical suspicion based on the seasonality found in AFI surveillance studies like ours can have important effects on the clinical outcome of pediatric patients, as early in-patient observation and intervention with adequate supportive treatment has been shown to reduce mortality [37] .",

            "text": "Our analysis is one of few to quantify the differences in timing between the two main etiologic causes of AFI in Puerto Rico, and to show there are distinct seasonal patterns for pediatric respiratory and arboviral infections, particularly in a tropical setting. Arboviral peaks corresponded to major outbreaks and introduction of the new individual arboviruses (i.e. CHIKV and ZIKV), while seasonal peaks of individual respiratory infections varied in their timing. As expected, dengue infections peaked in summer and early fall, in the months that correspond to the rainy season in Puerto Rico (May to November) and that have been previously associated with an increase in dengue incidence [38] . In temperate zones, IAV, IAB and HRSV have very well-defined seasonality, being considered winter viruses, while AdV, HMPV, and PIV viruses circulate all year round with specific peaks for AdV subtypes in the fall (AdV1) and the spring-summer (AdV3) [32, 39, 40] . In our study, respiratory infections among pediatric participants generally peaked in the winter months, with IAV and IBV, HRSV, and AdV contributing the most to the overall infections. IAV was the most similar in frequency and timing to the overall respiratory infection patterns, followed by HMPV. Seasonal peaks varied for each respiratory pathogen, though some infections, such as IAV and HMPV, shared similarity in timing. AdV had the asynchronous pattern compared to overall infections, peaking in the spring and summer months. Though HRSV had high coherence with the overall respiratory pattern, it was more varied in its timing compared to the pattern of overall infections. For tropical and subtropical regions, previous reports have found similar patterns to those found in this study, with year-round incidence of respiratory viruses, and the presence of seasonal peaks. Most commonly, HRSV seasonal peaks have been reported in the rainy seasons and cooler seasons, respectively, with overlapping seasonality with influenza viruses peaks [34, 39, 41] . However, there are specific variations in the timing of the seasonal peaks by each place, that can be helpful to guide clinical suspicion for local health providers. For example, in Vietnam, a country with a tropical monsoon climate with high humidity, studies have found seasonal peaks of IAV during April to June [30] , while in our study IAV peaked during December to January. In Egypt, a recent study showed that HRSV activity started in early winter and finished in early spring, similar to our findings, and found distinct annual peaks of HRSV that varied in duration and magnitude across the six tropical and subtropical countries included in their analysis [39] . They also found variation among participant countries regarding the timing of the peaks for influenza viruses and HRSV.",

After the restrictions in travel, local mobility, and social gatherings related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), changes in respiratory viruses' trends have started to be noticed [43] . Changes in dengue transmission dynamics have been reported in other countries like Thailand, with additional cases being expected as a result of the mobility restrictions in place [44] . Additional analyses of data after the implementation of COVID-19 related restrictions will be needed in Puerto Rico to establish their effect in the transmission of arboviruses and respiratory viruses in the island.",

First, the study focused diagnostic testing on arboviruses and respiratory viruses, leaving out systematic testing for parasitic, bacterial, or other viral etiologies. While arboviruses and respiratory viruses are clearly important pathogens for AFI in this population, we didn't find a clear etiology in 52% of enrolled participants, and other types of pathogens should also be studied further in order to have a comprehensive understanding of AFI etiology. Second, this study includes only patients enrolled in one geographical area of Puerto Rico and the results are not necessarily generalizable to the rest of the island. Since CHIKV and ZIKV were introduced later in our time-series (2014-2015, and 2016), we could not evaluate their seasonal coherence and phase patterns. Additional years of surveillance will help to elucidate their patterns in the future.",

Dashed line at 1 refers to identical seasonal patterns and coherence at 0 refers to no association of two seasonal time-series. C) Phase differences comparing the timing of individual to total respiratory infections. Dashed line at 0 refers to patterns of individual and overall respiratory infections occurring at the time (i.e. no difference in phase). Grey shading reflects the cone of influence, where edge-effects of the time-series become important. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247481.g004",

Seasonal arboviral and respiratory infections are relatively asynchronous, with coherence varying over time, and having long lags (3.8 months) in timing of their patterns. The abnormal summer-month respiratory outbreaks of 2013 likely impacted the lower coherence in 2013-2014, with coherence increasing over later years until 2017. Similarly, the decreasing coherence from 2017-2018 is likely due to low arboviral incidence in 2017-2018.",
