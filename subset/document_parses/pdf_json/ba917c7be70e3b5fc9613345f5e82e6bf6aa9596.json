However, allowing local land use decisions to proceed as usual represents a major gap in the state's climate policy framework. Climate mitigation rules and formulae are utilized to claim zero net emissions for large-scale land development at the urban fringe. Such developments continue to destroy habitats and radically transform landscapes. Newhall Ranch, a subdevelopment at the edge of urbanized Los Angeles County, has claimed emissions offsets such that the development of 60,000 homes will have less than zero greenhouse gas emissions. Offsets largely rely on using disadvantaged communities, and significant threats to endangered species on site are compensated by payments to the project's environmental opponents. The net result is land development as usual, with a veneer of solarization and investments in GHG mitigation projects with poor quantification and verification. This situation demonstrates the enduring structures of land use development that drive GHG emissions and environmental change, and calls for stronger requirements for local compliance with state emissions-reductions targets.",

With increased awareness of the impacts of climate change and land-use change on resources, the state has enacted a host of environmental protection and climate control policies, including cap-and-trade emissions markets, protection of endangered species, payment for ecosystem services, climate action plans, sustainability plans, and more. While lauded for its ambition, there remains a lack of understanding in terms of the extent to which California's much-admired policy framework is serving to accomplish its goals, particularly as increasingly complex technologies of environmental and climate regulation interact with the state's archaic and highly localized processes of land use regulation. Local control over land use in California remains a toughly defended prerogative. Local land-use authority not only limits certain forms of state-driven environmental and climate regulation, but, as we demonstrate, plays a crucial role as complex technologies of climate regulation articulate with the political and material dimensions of development in the urban periphery.",

We use the example of Newhall Ranch to examine the relationship between an increasingly market-oriented framework of environmental regulation in which environmental attributes can be exchanged and substituted through market mechanisms, and the material processes of land-use change at the local level. In doing so, we critically evaluate whether regulations regulating carbon emissions, now seen as urgent and potentially leading to the moderation of Earth system changes (such as extinctions and loss of wetlands, for example), in addition to existing environmental regulations, ultimately shift contemporary land-use patterns toward a goal of fewer greenhouse (GHG) emissions and impacts. We find that given the use of offsets, negotiations about off-site mitigations for endangered species, and clustering of some of the dwelling units, sprawling development and associated land use transformation is unstoppable given the current regulatory regime, despite widespread recognition of its climate and environmental impacts.",

The California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA (1969) , requires that public agencies assess the environmental effects of proposed actions in order to prevent or limit potential harm to the environment. As with the federal Endangered Species Act, CEQA does not usurp local authority over land use decisions. Rather, CEQA's function is primarily informational, aiming to prevent or minimize avoidable environmental damage by requiring analysis and disclosure of potential environmental impacts associated with specific projects (Fulton & Shigley, 2005) . While environmental damage may be prevented through development of project alternatives, in practice, environmental damage is typically 'minimized' through use of mitigation measures, and mitigation monitoring. In the context of addressing GHG emissions reductions, such mitigation measures may include reductions in emissions resulting from a project through implementation of project features, project design, or other measures, or off-site measures, including offsets that are not otherwise required, to mitigate a project's emissions (California Natural Resources Agency [CNRA], 2010). Ultimately, however, decisions over whether to reject environmentally harmful projects or how to minimize environmental damage remain the purview of local governments.",

In 2013, the ARB launched a cap-and-trade program, which set a statewide limit on sources responsible for 85 percent of California's greenhouse gas emissions and established a price signal intended to promote investment in cleaner fuels and more efficient use of energy. ARB developed an allowance allocation, as well as price minimums and maximums, compliance flexibility mechanisms, and an offset system for a class of large emitters.

In terms of energy efficiency, low-income communities face significant barriers to applying for incentives (California Energy Commission, 2016) , and subscription to these programs is low among the broader population. SB 375 is grounded in the assumption that reducing VMT will also reduce GHG emissions. Yet, there is little evidence that climate plans have affected routine practices, such as how the road network is managed or maintained (Hoffmann (2011) in Bulkeley & Betsill, 2013) or beyond conventional approaches to traffic management. Focusing solely on VMT obscures that the production and reduction of GHGs are inextricably intertwined with land-use decisions, both in California and globally, that extend well beyond VMT. Road construction and maintenance, for example, is a significant contributor to GHG emissions and requires a great deal of resources (Hanson et al., 2012) . In sum, while SB375 and SB350 introduced new planning processes, local land use prerogatives remain unchanged. As we demonstrate, allowing local land use decisions to proceed as usual represents a major gap in California's climate policy framework. Climate regulation such as California's effort to increase transit-oriented development remains in tension with local land use powers and the pressures on localities to ensure sufficient revenues. As we illustrate in the following sections, this tension has profound implications for patterns of urban expansion and their environmental impacts. ",

For example, localities must comply with the Endangered Species Act requirements but may develop their own solutions. Local control over land use enables cities and counties in their unincorporated territories to determine what types of land use they wish and where, including parks and open spaces, housing and its type and density, commercial and industrial amounts, and locations. It is also vital to local budgets as land use types generate different amounts of tax revenues that may or may not entirely offset services (Chapple, 2018) . As Seto et al. (2012) , Liu et al. (2015) , and others have shown, urbanization patterns are ever more land Fig. 1 Location of the Newhall Ranch development within Los Angeles County extensive, and California is no exception. Several forces continue to create the desire for ease of and permitting of exurban developments on greenfields in the state. Despite a growing market for infill development and state interest in additional infill developments to meet GHG emissions reductions goals, there remains a strong market for single-family homes and/ or residing outside of the already built urban areas (Syphard et al., 2018) .",

Infill development, by contrast, is complex, unique, site-by-site, must appease existing residents and specific requirements that may vary from place to place in the same jurisdiction (Farris, 2001) . Often the time from land purchase through permitting and construction is unpredictable. Further, the market is less stable for such development, and the costs per square foot much higher, making it more challenging to build for a broad market from families to singles to the retired. In the urban periphery, large-scale developers are more able to build 'affordable' housing due to sufficient land for commercial use and high-end housing, which can compensate for the affordable units. While several studies have demonstrated little difference in aggregate residential construction costs for infill and multifamily units (Elkind et al., 2017) , profit rates for developers are generally lower on these types of units. And there may be other costs to developers in existing urban areas, including land costs, demolition, and site remediation (Elkind et al., 2017) . Neighborhood opposition is often better organized in the already built areas, and lawsuits over many development aspects have long been common (Monkkonen & Livesley-O'Neill, 2019; Pendall, 1999; Whittemore, 2012) .",

The County is characterized by dense sprawl, dominated by single-family housing in a continuous pattern that is not conducive to widespread public transportation access nor to energy efficiencies gained by common wall development (Salat, 2009; Salat & Bourdic, 2012) . While the city of Los Angeles's downtown itself is experiencing an unprecedented development boom, County voters passed another $0.05 sales tax increase (by over 2/3rds majority vote) to expand the public transit system in November 2016. This tax increase will continue indefinitely to fund the expansion of the region's transit network, leaving intact the extensive, single-family home land-use pattern. Transit and housing projects are targeted for the city of Los Angeles' ample boulevards and primarily for lower-income residents in the transitoriented design strategy favored by SB 375 to help reduce transportation GHGs. Single-family zones may still rely on the automobile. One must add to this the fiscal impacts on transportation agencies due to COVID-19 and the health concerns about riding public transportation.",

They state that as EVs become more common due to reduced costs, increased availability of infrastructure and other incentives, members of the neighborhood/community without EVs will be increasingly more likely to purchase and use an EV. Citing additional studies, they state that EVs will be preferred to other vehicles when there is a choice. Using these studies, the project developers claim significant GHG emissions reductions from their programs, including transportation demand management. Such assumptions run counter to a growing body of empirical research on electric vehicle adoption practices, which finds that consumers tend to resist rather than embrace new technologies that are considered alien or unproved (Egbue & Long, 2012; Li et al., 2017) . In this case, inflated assumptions regarding EV uptake will likely translate into higher than anticipated GHG emissions as the use of conventional vehicles continues. In addition, household ZNE does not appear to consider electric vehicle charging directly. If EV charging happens at night, which is likely for commuters, the energy mix will have a larger, in absolute quantities, natural gas component, though this energy use may be mitigated somehow.",

The developers and their consultants are responding to the regulatory framework and objectives put in place at multiple levels of the administrative state and are thus offering solutions that comply with this framework while maintaining their business-driven imperatives for appropriate levels of return on investment. The state's climate and habitat protection legislation has provided FivePoint (Newhall) pathways to claim mitigation of the immediate and bounded greenhouse gas and habitat impacts of fuel utilized during the construction phase of 12,000 acres and housing 60,000 people. Using credits and, in our specific case, offsets, is an ideologically driven mitigation strategy that has yet to be proven in the measurements of the real world. These are virtual techniques. If GHG generation is to be mitigated and curbed, it must be through the reality of bricks, mortar, and life. This specific Newhall Ranch example points to the larger issues not only regarding the curbing of dependence on fossil fuels and the reduction of GHGs but how to tackle, within the current regulatory regime, unrelenting Earth systems changes. If the Newhall example holds precedence, state environmental policy seems unlikely to lead to significant land use policy changes in the state. Newhall can claim zero GHG emissions and even negative emissions by utilizing carbon offsets, deploying EVs, and modest modifications of building energy use through solar panels. The extensive transformation of the landscape, including the razing of hilltops to supply fill upon which houses will be built-to mitigate the potential of flooding from the Santa Clara River-for example, is unaccounted. Instead, nature's attributes, which are free, are enrolled in land development and exploited. The mitigation strategies that are being utilized fail to fully account for the GHGs, based as they are, on accounting formulae developed from modeled performance and projections over a 30-year period. These models fail to account for the specificity of emissions across sources under particular conditions, a problem exacerbated by the inherent uncertainty associated with any long-term projections. Also, the environmental impacts of sprawled urban morphology are addressed only by saving some habitat for endangered species elsewhere and monitoring to ensure the Santa Clara River modifications will not cause the stickleback fish's demise. This is because current environmental protection strategies, including carbon offsets, cannot account for the impacts of permanent and irreversible land-use change and its significant and enduring externalities.",

Rather than using its financial capital to build or rebuild in the already urbanized Los Angeles region, creating more livable and affordable communities, the regulatory regime for environmental protection allows FivePoint to build on greenfields, using free nature to externalize its impacts (such as razing entire hilltops) and to use low-income neighborhoods as mitigation zones.

In exchange for compensation of this sort, the environmental coalition led by the Center for Biological Diversity, the Wishtoyo Foundation/Ventura Coastkeeper, the California Native Plant Society, and the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians dropped their lawsuit against the company and will not oppose the development of new homes, golf courses, schools, recreation centers and 13 million square feet of commercial space. FivePoint will also provide about $16 million to establish an independent conservancy led by representatives of the environmental groups and an additional $8 million to manage spineflowers and enhance their habitat (Sahagun and Agrawal, 2017) .",

As Bigger (2015) notes, the creation of financial products or offsets that represent intangible atmospheric gases is a highpoint in the career of financialization [or using money for mitigation] (p. 142). The process is made all the more abstract because the object of management is information rather than some material quantum of carbon dioxide. Referring to Knox-Hayes, '[e]missions credits [or in our case off sets] are not in practice different from other types of financial commodities. However, because they are commodities constructed from the absence of space and time, they represent the extreme end of spatial and temporal abstraction. Also, carbon credits [offsets] are particularly problematic because of the extent of the separation of the complexity of carbon emissions and sequestration processes on the one hand, and the simplicity of financial representation [or transactionability] on the other (Knox-Hayes, 2013; MacKenzie, 2006 in Bigger op cit) .",

The shift to GHG emissions reductions as the metric of choice for environmental and climate policymakers has important implications, particularly when viewed through the land use-climate nexus. While carbon emissions can be abstracted with relative ease, their production remains inextricably linked to the materiality of land-use change. But in the new regulatory regime, carbon emissions are disconnected from land-use change itself. A ton of carbon emissions in California can be removed from the global balance sheet by purchasing offsets: investing in a forest project somewhere in the U.S is estimated to sequester one ton of carbon emissions. Offsets enable emitting carbon in one place and its sequestration in another, in a way that one cannot do with a unit of biodiversity, which is, by its very essence, unique to place. This type of abstraction, and the assumption of commensurability (e.g., carbon sequestration potential is the same as a ton of produced carbon and is the same everywhere and anywhere), obscures both local and broader social and environmental implications associated with the production of emissions. Landscape change, for example, entirely eludes commensurability metrics.",
