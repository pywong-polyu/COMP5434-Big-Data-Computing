What this paper adds \u2022 The paper identifies and characterizes the educational process, the technological tools used in this new educational setting and personal adaptation of higher education students and teachers during these unprecedented times. \u2022 The results show the following: an increase in teacher-student interaction (outside classes), new opportunities and content development; difficulties in control evaluation fraud, constraints in attaining the desired learning outcomes and lack of training; resilience to adapt and adopt the new technologies, despite the negative personal experience lived in terms of productivity, motivation, workload and mental health. Implications for practice and/or policy \u2022 The paper makes evidence-based recommendations on how higher education institutions can leverage this experience to prepare for future disruptions and increase the use of ICT tools in their regular learning environment. than 1.5 billion students, representing 91.3% of the total enrolled learners, in 194 countries, were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (UNESCO, 2020) . In higher education the impact of the pandemic was equally grievous. Globally, 91% of higher education institutions reported that in-person teaching had been replaced or was in process of being replaced, by remote activities (Marinoni et al., 2020) . Information and communication technology (ICT) progress supported the shift from F2F to remote learning in higher education institutions, avoiding a more considerable interruption in the education process during the pandemic. This change was already underway before the pandemic, with research indicating that an educational model based solely on classroom interactions is becoming outdated (Ally & Prieto-Bl\u00e1zquez, 2014) . Despite online learning (OL) being already adopted in some higher education institutions, for others, such adoption was a complete novelty that entailed many challenges. The uniqueness of OL during the pandemic relates to what Watermeyer et al. (2021) call 'afflictions' derived from the rapid and complete transition to online provision and early 'entry-level' use of digital pedagogies. This emergency transition brought many challenges, and research is already underway to analyse the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in educational institutions, mainly regarding the challenges and opportunities that arose from this emergency (Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020; Dhawan, 2020; Lassoued et al., 2020) . Namely, it is of critical importance to evaluate the experience with emergency remote education (ERE) in higher education institutions to inform the design of future, well-planned, distance or OL efforts (Hodges et al., 2020) .",

Burde et al. (2017) conclude that school attendance is critical before other interventions can occur because conflict reduces education access. Crisis drive alternative learning systems such as accelerated learning programmes, community-based education and temporary learning spaces to support EiE. Research shows that providing students with structured, meaningful and creative activities in a school setting or informal learning spaces improves their emotional and behavioural well-being (Ager et al., 2011; Berger & Gelkopf, 2009; Kostelny & Wessells, 2008) . Group activities in a school-like setting represent an important healing tool (UNESCO, 2003) and may redirect students' energies and anxieties to acquire knowledge and skills. However, a significant body of literature in EiE focuses mainly on primary or secondary education groups in settings where the educational physical infrastructure is severely affected. This includes the impact of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina (Gardner et al., 2007; McCullar, 2011) , earthquakes (Wolmer et al., 2005) or armed conflicts, such as the Syrian war (Hos, 2016) .",

In the most similar situation in recent history, the H1N1 pandemic, research found a lack of preparedness of higher education institutions for OL (Meyer & Wilson, 2011) . However, the conceptualization of this learning method migration is not consensual. OL is deeply rooted in adequate planning and instructional design and has several available theories and models. However, the migration process of higher education institutions to OL becomes questionable because these processes witnessed the absence of adequately planning, design and development of online instructional programs due to the pandemic (Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020) . Hodges et al. (2020, p. 7) pointed out that \"the distinction is important between the normal, everyday type of effective online instruction and that which we are doing in a hurry with bare minimum resources and scant time: emergency remote teaching\". According to Mohmmed et al. (2020, p. 2), emergency remote teaching \"comprises ultimate exploitation of the available remote teaching tools for delivering the curriculum or educational materials that would normally be delivered physically or as hybrid or blended courses [\u2026] .\"",

            "text": "Within the scope of this article, considering our interest in teaching and learning during this unprecedented time, this phenomenon is referred as ERE. This migration from F2F to ERE came with several challenges and opportunities. One major issue is that the migration has caused a compulsory modification in the attitudes of education administrators, instructors and learners on the significance of ERE (Ribeiro, 2020 ). Among ERE system major disadvantages are the lack of direct interaction and communication between the teacher and the learner. This is consistent with Lassoued et al. (2020) four categories regarding the major barriers and obstacles to achieving quality in ERE under the COVID-19 pandemic: (a) personal (self-imposed obstacles which indicate the students' resistance and rejection); (b) pedagogical (obstacles conducting tests and the evaluation of electronic exams or obtaining feedback for identifying the weaknesses and strengths of students); (c) technical obstacles (weak internet speed, security and confidentiality of data, piracy in websites); and (d) financial and organizational obstacles (lack of capabilities to communicate remotely, and the difficulty of obtaining computers by some students). This is also in line with Watermeyer et al. (2021) regarding teachers' negative feelings and experiences about migration from F2F to ERE during the pandemic, eg, preparedness, confidence, support from the institution, access, impact on workload, afflictions, and affordances. Noticeably, the lack of faculty online technology readiness and the disruption transitioning to online teaching are reported by several studies as the main challenges in adopting technology for teaching in blended and OL environments (Brown, 2016; Cutri et al., 2020; Hung & Chou, 2015; Rasheed et al., 2020) . Moreover, Adedoyin and Soykan (2020) summarize the challenges of this digital transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic for higher education institutions: (a) compatibility gap of OL in some disciplines cannot be effectively and efficiently applied (remote laboratories limitations for sports sciences, engineering and medical sciences); (b) technology (outdated technological devices with accessibility problems); (c) academic performance of students might be affected by racial, economic and resource differences, (d) while the majority of students are digital natives and tech-savvy, the larger part of instructors were not effectively ready to deliver high-quality instruction remotely; and (e) regulate and control evaluation cheating is more complicated, strongly suggesting a considerable modification of grading systems (Flaherty, 2020) .",

This personal constraint concerning the new living situation is related with the unexpected appearance or interruption by family members, friends and or pets that may cause disruption or diversion of ERE participants' attention during the educational process (Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020) , as some students have no dedicated workspace or separate OL studio/library (Gillis & Krull, 2020) . Furthermore, instructional techniques (such as, Live Zoom lecture; Live Zoom discussion, individual worksheet/lesson, forums, small group video chat) are regarded by students as accessible rather than effective and less enjoyable (Gillis & Krull, 2020) . These findings are also in line with Dhawan (2020) regarding radical transformation's weaknesses and challenges in all aspects of education. This quick and sudden digital transformation process of higher education institutions brought a huge workload (eg, full migration into external applications, increased tolls and communication overload) and added stress for teachers and students, leading to negative effects on their academic performance or, ultimately, on their mental health.",

For example, through the question \"What do you think about this shift between face-to-face education to remote education?\" for both students and teachers, it was possible to identify the participants' positioning concerning the new learning environment (related to Premise 2). Premise 3, for example, helped to understand how teachers were using student feedback to improve teaching through the question \"What are you doing to keep students interested in your classes?\". Aiming to identify which technologies were being used and how to apply them, as suggested by Premise 4, teachers were asked, \"How are you teaching your classes?\" and for students, \"Can you explain to me how you are attending your classes?\". The scripts used to guide the interviews are available in Appendix A.",

Data collection and analysis proceeded concurrently to ensure that insights from data analysis could support further data collection. The first author of this study performed the initial open coding of the data collected and, collaboratively with the second author, developed the axial and theoretical coding (Charmaz & Belgrave, 2015) . As a result, themes of first, second and third order emerged, supported by TML theory (Bower, 2019) that was applied as a theoretical framework. TML offers a holistic framework to structure the categories that emerged from the thematic analysis, as depicted in Figure 1 . Following a member-check procedure (Birt et al., 2016) , a synthesis of the results was presented to eight interviewees that were available for this follow-up. These interviewees recognized their own experience in these results, without proposing any significant change. Based on the thematic analysis performed, the ERE can be characterized by three main themes: (a) educational process, that describes how the interaction between students and teachers unfolded in this emergency context; (b) ICT usage, referring to the experience with the ICT tools that mediate the teaching and learning process; and (c) personal adaptation, that focuses on the changes on student and teacher's practices, and their personal feelings. In the middle, the ICT platforms are detailed in Table 1 . Following this structure, the next section presents the results of this study.",

            "text": "The results of this study showed that the ERE brought a mix of positive and negative experiences. As all learning was mediated by technology during the pandemic, this study resorted to Bower's TML theory (2019) to support data collection, data analysis and the discussion of the results. The results can be broadly encompassed by the first premise (P1), that states that 'digital technologies can perform a mediating role for participants in their attempts to achieve learning goals'. However, when analysed in more detail, it is possible to see where TML excelled or lacked. Considering TML's second premise (P2), related to participants' beliefs, knowledge, practices and the learning environment, it is possible to see that these were mostly related to the theme personal adaptation and were associated with a negative experience regarding ERE. These findings show that neither students, teachers nor the learning environment was prepared for such a momentous change. However, it is interesting to note that, at odds with related research (Lassoued et al., 2020) , this study found that privacy was not a concern for teachers and students. Furthermore, these findings are aligned with some early research about the impact of the pandemic (Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020; Flaherty, 2020) , namely, the constraints in attaining the desired learning outcomes given the considerable restrictions in some classes (eg, practical and laboratory classes), the added workload and the lack of regulation, control of evaluation, training, and overall preparedness for the ERE context. Also, the personal adaptation theme highlights the burden and struggle to fully adopt technology for teaching, triggering disruption to instruction, derived from teachers' technological anxiety, complexity, illiteracy and competency (Brown, 2016; Hung & Chou, 2015; Rasheed et al., 2020) . Additionally, teachers were having to adjust to the challenges of working from home whilst accommodating general workload intensification, affecting their work-life balance (Watermeyer et al., 2021) . As such, the theme personal adaptation is especially relevant as it marks a clear distinction between ERE and regular, well-planned, distance and OL programmes. TML's third premise (P3) encompasses the outcomes of technology-mediated education, as well as learning design, and was connected with the class content theme, which deals with the need to adapt the content that was previously taught F2F and became remote, and with the themes outcomes and evaluation, which deal more directly with accomplishing the learning objectives. Unfortunately, the latter themes are associated with a negative experience, showing that it was challenging to achieve the desired outcomes during the ERE, despite the positive experience with the adaptation of class contents.",

However, Cutri et al. (2020) findings related to the faculty readiness for transitioning to online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out that such transition during a crisis changed the typical perceptions of preparation and readiness. The negative connotations of risk taking and making mistakes while teaching and learning online seem to have been moderated by a combination of affective factors (such as humility, empathy and even optimism), bringing them into partnership with their students.",

As such, universities need to be prepared for crisis before they occur (Stein et al., 2007) , ensuring that they have the right affordances in place, before a crisis emerge. This includes reliable and adequate ICT platforms, namely, the development of remote evaluation instruments and grading systems. To minimize concerns about evaluation fraud or academic dishonesty, a combination of various assessment methods (eg, report submission with online presentation, oral examination, open questions) gives the teachers a chance to collect further evidence from the students' educational process. Furthermore, institutions that do not traditionally use online assessment can learn adequate practices from other institutions that already engage in such assessments.",

Consequently, post-emergency education response requires higher education distance learning programmes and teacher training. Innovative approaches need to be explored to increase outreach, including distance education programmes, especially to leverage teachers' newly gained competences and upgrading them quickly in the perspective of a post-pandemic world. Crisis such as this one provides an opportunity for change by teaching to all community members new skills and values. The shift to remote education is not about substituting the F2F for ERE, but to develop a new and transformational approach that can extend higher education institutions' reach, constituting an opportunity to alter and reflect upon their practices. Part of this shift may reflect the emergence of new bimodal approaches (blended learning, a combination of OL and F2F) to facilitate learning outcomes and integrate students and teachers. This will require a curation of learning experiences (Bryson & Andres, 2020) where appropriate and institutional-wide platforms need to be adopted, and training must be given to ensure that teachers and students are competent users of these platforms, while ensuring privacy and security.",

Even though most premises (1-6) matched the emerging ERE (sub)dimensions, there is a gap between Premise 7 'communities of practice' and ERE context. This may be explained by the unplanned pandemic environment and the ultimate post-emergency recovering concerns. Consequently, this gap brings important implications for developing and maintaining communities of practice, within remote education environments. The design of new OL environments, such as the spaces (including digital spaces, virtual classrooms) in which learning occurs, can have a considerable influence upon learning outcomes (Bower, 2019) . Furthermore, higher education institutions need to adjust their organizational design to meet the needs of the university community during a crisis (Zdziarski et al., 2007) . As such, designing virtual learning spaces layout including chat or meeting rooms and coffee break areas for example will be vital to reduce the loss of sense of community or link to the community and the anxiety caused by the pandemic crisis, fostering collaborative action and social bonds. These interactions may be crucial to increase learner engagement with institutions. The longer the pandemic lasts, the more likely the students will lose strong ties to the institution and to the community they are linked to.",
