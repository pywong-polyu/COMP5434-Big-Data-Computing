Diagnostic guidelines are available for classical immunocompromised patients and also for nontraditional groups, where varying diagnostic approaches are warranted. [1] [2] [3] The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and critically ill COVID-19 patients with pneumonia have provided a new opportunity to characterize patients with invasive fungal infections. Analogous to postinfluenza opportunistic fungal infection, invasive aspergillosis has become an important superimposed infection among COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and is associated with poor outcomes [4] [5] [6] . However, risks for IA in COVID-19 patients are likely quite different [7] . Factors that may predispose to CAPA include leukopenia or lymphopenia, immune response dysregulation, lung damage or other chronic diseases, antibiotic use, or therapies for COVID-19 such as corticosteroids or immunomodulators. [4, [7] [8] [9] COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has become an emerging and welldescribed problem, yet it remains a challenge to find a definition that is applicable to clinical care worldwide. Recent cohorts have described CAPA disease incidence ranging from 2 to 33%. [6, [10] [11] [12] [13] This variability is partly related to the heterogenous populations, with differing underlying co-morbidities; but, more importantly variability is related to the criteria employed for definition of CAPA. Indeed, there are now at multiple guidelines described and consensus criteria are available [1, 2, 14] . Current challenges in diagnosis include nonclassical risk factors (fewer immunocompromised patients) in COVID-19 patients, nonspecific radiographic presentations, decreased ability to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage testing due to SARS-CoV-2 transmission precautions, and decreased sensitivity of fungal biomarkers The incidence of CAPA ranged from 5-10% depending on definition used. The authors identified several risk factors for CAPA, including pulmonary vascular diseases, liver disease, coagulopathy and solid tumor malignancy, among others. Importantly, they confirmed poor outcomes such as duration of oxygen use, duration on a ventilator or ECMO, and hospital length-of-stay, when compared to controls. These poorer outcomes were observed regardless of the CAPA definition used. There was not a significant mortality difference.",

Beyond using standard, more restrictive criteria for probable CAPA, they included a definition for possible CAPA, which was relevant to clinical care during the study period, as a standardized surveillance process for invasive fungal infection was not instituted during the entirety of the cohort duration. Another important finding is that poor outcomes were associated with both definitions of CAPA. However, there This potentially had an impact on differences in outcomes, including mortality. The reasons for lack of antifungal therapy may be multi-factorial, but underscores the challenges of identification of aspergillosis in a pandemic setting, where we continue to learn best practices and limitations of diagnostic testing.",

Among patients with COVID-19, fewer have underlying immunocompromising conditions, although steroids and other biologic therapies for COVID-19 may increase risk. Interpretation of radiologic findings as a criterion for risk remains problematic and less helpful with the background of diffuse lung damage and infiltrates related to COVID-19 or bacterial superinfections. Traditional radiologic findings observed in IA patients with hematologic malignancies, such as nodules, cavities, and the \"halo\" sign are less frequent or may be hidden. [3] Microbiologic studies from BAL samples, although ideal, are less feasible in the pandemic setting due to risk of for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from bronchoscopy procedures. There is still much to learn of the value of fungal biomarkers in non-BAL respiratory samples and predictive value of Aspergillus growing from respiratory cultures. [14, 15] Barriers persist for availability of fungal biomarkers and PCR testing in low-income countries, making a restrictive definition of CAPA poorly applicable.",

Many of these patients are critically ill, and larger cohorts with multivariable analyses will be necessary to identify confounding variables. As treatment practices are evolving, we must also adapt. As an example, Permpalung et al. identified that glucocorticoteroids (mostly hydrocortisone) increased the odds for CAPA, but among the whole cohort just over 50% received corticosteroids. With recent guidelines recommending 10-days of dexamethasone use for most critically ill patients with COVID-19, there will now be a large background of steroid use among COVID-19 patients, so it will be necessary to identify novel factors associated with CAPA to guide diagnosis, prevention and treatment [16] .",
