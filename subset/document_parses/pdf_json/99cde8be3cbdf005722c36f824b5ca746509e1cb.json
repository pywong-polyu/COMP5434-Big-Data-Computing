Patients are required to provide a single stool sample which is tested for the presence of occult human blood. The result provided gives a quantitative value proportional to the amount of blood detected. Faecal immunochemistry tests have been shown to be an accurate detector of significant bowel pathology (colorectal cancer, high-risk adenomas or inflammatory bowel disease) and a useful risk stratifying test [11] . Given the ability to carry out the test in the community and its high level of accuracy, it will be a valuable test to prioritize patients waiting for further investigation during the coronavirus pandemic. Carrying out any further investigation during the pandemic must take into consideration the risk to patients and healthcare staff related to viral exposure. CT of the abdomen and pelvis has been suggested as a triage tool for use during the coronavirus pandemic [6] . This would allow patients to be effectively prioritized for colonoscopy once services resume. However, CT carries the inherent risk of radiation to patients and increases footfall within hospitals potentially increasing the spread of COVID-19. There is a paucity of evidence supporting a CT of the abdomen and pelvis as the primary method of detection of colorectal cancer but small studies have demonstrated its sensitivity to range from 72.4% to 100% and specificity from 83.6% to 95.7% [12, 13] .

A recent Danish surveillance study has used CCE as a filter to colonoscopy and demonstrated a reduction in the number of colonoscopies required [16] . Given CCE's high sensitivity for detection of pathology, we suggest its use as a triaging tool, particularly when pressure on endoscopy units is likely to be high. This would allow more appropriate prioritization of patients for colonoscopy. Preliminary results of the current ScotCAP study suggest that CCE can reduce the requirement for colonoscopy in up to 70% of symptomatic patients referred to colorectal services (private communication).

There is currently a lack of training for these readers in the UK which would need to be addressed for any expansion of CCE use. Unfortunately, there is no published work comparing the cost effectiveness of CCE to colonoscopy. However, an economic evaluation comparing CCE to CT colonography in a Canadian population has been carried out [19] . This study calculated that replacing CT colonography with CCE would have moderate cost implications. A CCE procedure was reported to cost $1120 in this study which included all direct costs and those incurred by potential complications. Further work is needed to establish whether CCE will be cost effective considering the likely reduction in hardware cost and the savings associated with a reduction in colonoscopy requirements.",

CCE is a potentially beneficial method for investigating colorectal patients by reducing the burden on reinstated endoscopy units. Significant planning and innovation will be required to guide the healthcare service back to normality through any recovery phase. The current coronavirus pandemic offers surgeons an opportunity to optimize the interface with primary care, to reconfigure current surgical services, to evaluate changes to colorectal practice and to realize the potential of cutting edge innovation to enable safe and timely investigation and treatment for patients during the era of COVID-19.",
