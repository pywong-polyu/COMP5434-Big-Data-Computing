Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the virus causing COVID-19 1 . SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus. It spreads easily through the air when people are physically near each other. As of 18 December 2020, more than 75 million cases had been confirmed, resulting in more than 1.6 million deaths. Researchers have tried several strategies to develop drugs and vaccines to treat SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Viruses usually encode very limited viral genes and proteins and thus need to recruit many host proteins to complete the viral lifecycle. Therefore, identifying proteinprotein interactions between viral proteins and their host cellular cofactors is an important and efficient way to understand the virus and uncover potential drug targets. Such host-virus interactome analysis has been reported recently 3 .",

AP-MS is a widely used and highly reproducible method that allows identification of physiologically relevant interaction proteins. However, this method may miss weak or transient binding proteins during the pulldown process, even when it is performed in a mild buffer. In addition, AP-MS may not capture poorly soluble protein partners, such as membrane-associated proteins, which are critically important for the viral lifecycle. The proximity labelingbased strategy solves these problems by labeling nearby proteins before harvesting cells. This method is based on an enzyme-substrate reaction with an effective labeling radius of about 10 nm. The drawback of this method is that it may fail to label the binding proteins located outside of this labeling range. Therefore, combining these two strategies should allow us to generate a comprehensive host-virus interactome network that is important for the SARS-Cov-2 lifecycle.",

With an interactome analysis of 29 SARS-CoV-2 cDNAs, we uncovered key human proteins involved in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle of infection, replication, and budding. This interactome dataset not only confirmed some previously reported host-virus interactions but also uncovered numerous new interacting proteins that may be critical for the SARS-Cov-2 lifecycle. This dataset will benefit further investigations of the mechanisms underlying viral infection and lifecycle and potential new drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, we compared the interactomes of two critical viral genes, NSP1 and N protein, among different human coronaviruses. These analyses will help us to fight SARS-CoV-2 and future pandemics caused by new coronaviruses.",

In total, we obtained 314 HCIPs from SFB-TAP and 130 HCIPs from BioID2 experiments ( Table   S2) . We combined these two datasets and generated a list of HCIPs, which included 437 pairs of virus-host interacting proteins ( Figure 1C ). GO analysis of these 437 viral interacting proteins showed that the preys were localized in various subcellular locations ( Figure 1E ). Many of the preys localized on various plasma membrane structures, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi membrane, or cell membrane. Protein function analysis also showed that many of the preys had roles in transporter, ion channel, and peptidase processes ( Figure 1F ). The biological processes enriched included vesicle organization, organelle localization, and vesicle-mediated transport ( Figure 1G ). These preys may assist SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and budding.",

The use of ORF7b as the bait led to the identification of more SNARE complex components, including STX12, STX16, VAMP2, VAMP3, VAMP4, VAMP8, NAPA, NAPG, and SNAP29. The SNARE complex is involved in eukaryotic membrane fusion and vesicular transport. This complex is known to be targeted by viruses during early infection, late viral production, and viral exit 8, 9 . Many components of the HOPS complex, including VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, VPS39, and VPS41, were identified in interactions with the viral protein ORF3a (Figure 2) . This complex plays a role in vesicle-mediated protein trafficking to lysosomal compartments and mediates tethering and docking events during SNARE-mediated membrane fusion through interaction with the SNARE complex 10 . The interactions of different viral proteins with distinct cellular complexes suggest that these associations are coordinated by the virus to maximize viral protein trafficking between different membrane-associated compartments. Additionally, ORF3a interacts with TRAPPC9 and TRAPPC10 (Figure 2) , subunits of the trafficking protein particle complex, which is known to have a function in vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. ORF6 binds to several components of the COPII complex (Figure 2) , including SEC23A, SEC24A, and SEC31A, and may be involved in the formation of transport vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum 11 . These host transportation systems are likely recruited by SARS-CoV-2 to facilitate its own gene expression, production, and transportation following viral infection.",

In Figure 3A , we confirmed the interactions of ORF3a with CLCC1 and VPS11. These host proteins bind specifically to ORF3a. Furthermore, we examined the localization of CLCC1 with or without ORF3a overexpression ( Figure 3B ). CLCC1 is characterized as an endoplasmic reticulum protein, which was confirmed by our immunofluorescence results in cells without ORF3a overexpression. ORF3a is reported to be an endosome and lysosome-associated protein 12 , which was also validated by our immunofluorescence results. When ORF3a was overexpressed, the localization of CLCC1 changed to strong co-localization with ORF3a in the endosome and lysosome. Early reports suggest that chloride channel function may be required for the viral lifecycle 13, 14 . Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may take over the function of CLCC1 protein to promote its own lifecycle. Although the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated with future functional analysis, the strong interaction between ORF3a and CLCC1 indicates that disrupting this interaction and/or CLCC1 function may affect the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle.",

Interactome analysis of NSP6 revealed that it interacted with a few subunits of ATP synthase (Figure 2 ), e.g., ATP5F1B, ATP5F1D, ATP5PB, ATP5PF, ATP5PO, ATP6AP1, and ATP13A3, indicating that the virus may interfere directly with the machinery involved in cellular energy production.

NSP6 also binds to PHB and PHB2, which are components of a large ring complex, the prohibitin complex, which stabilizes mitochondrial respiratory enzymes and maintains mitochondrial integrity 40 .

            "text": "Host cells have developed efficient antiviral systems to counter viral infections. Similarly, viruses find ways to inhibit host antiviral systems to ensure survival. The interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral pathway is one of the major innate immune responses against viral pathogens. We expressed the 29 SARS-CoV-2 coding genes in HEK293T cells and then analyzed the activity of IFN-beta luciferase reporter response to infection with Sendai virus, or the activity of ISREluciferase reporter response when viral proteins were co-expressed with IRF3 ( Figure S2 ). We found that two viral proteins, NSP1 and N protein, most significantly suppressed the activation of IFN signaling based on these two assays. NSP1 acts as the strongest gene product in SARS-CoV-2 that helps evade host cell antiviral defense. It suppresses global gene expression in the host as we mentioned above. Our host-virus interactome results showed that NSP1 interacts with nine components of the EIF3 complex to suppress the translation machinery. Translation of host antiviral genes is also inhibited by this global translation suppression function. Therefore, NSP1 acts as the strongest viral protein that inhibits IFN-beta signaling when overexpressed. Similar to a previous study 3 , we identified strong interactions between N protein and Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1/2 (G3BP1/2; Figure 2 ). G3BP1 plays essential roles in innate immunity by activating the cGAS/STING pathway and acting as a platform for antiviral signaling 46 . In a previous study of an RNA virus, G3BP1 was found to enlist an antiviral response by positively regulating RIG-I 47 . The strong binding of G3BP1 and G3BP2 with N protein may inhibit cGAS activation when the SARS-CoV-2 genome is released into host cells.",

The membrane association of EGFR and ERBB2 was increased during viral infection to benefit the processing of hepatitis C virus in previous studies 58, 59 . Moreover, ERBB receptors are potent factors promoting cellular growth and survival, which could prolong host cell survival 60, 61 and modulate host immune responses 62, 63 to benefit viral production.

Therefore, we analyzed potential drug targets and drugs using bioinformatics tools, Metascape 65 or Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Of the 29 viral proteins and 437 SARS-CoV-2 and host HCIPs, we found 18 viral proteins with 60 host interaction proteins that could be targeted by various drugs (Figure 4 and Table S3 ). Of these potentially drugs targets, some well-studied drugs are available and/or being developed. SIGMAR1, which binds to NSP6, was tested as an important drug target candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 3 . Many of our candidate proteins are well studied as drug targets, such as DHFR and VDAC1/VDAC2, which interact with NSP6; GSK3B, which interacts with N protein; FLT4, which interacts with M protein; EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4, which interact with ORF7b; A2M, which interacts with S protein; and ANXA5, which interacts with NSP15. Multiple drugs targeting these host proteins have been developed, which should facilitate the testing and developing treatments for COVID-19 patients. Two potential drugs proposed in our study were tested with real-world COVID-19 treatment, haloperidol (SIGMAR1 antagonist) and tamoxifer (ERBB2/ERBB4 inhibitor) (Figure 4) .

To compare all HCIPs among different human coronavirus strains, we first identified proteins for each coronavirus NSP1 with a SAINTexpress Bayesian false discovery rate \u22640.01 in at least one of the seven coronavirus NSP1 interactions. Using these HCIPs, we identified all PSMs captured for that prey in the raw identification data for each coronavirus NSP1 (Table S4 and S5) . Principal component analysis grouped SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 together (Figure 5B) , indicating that these two viruses with high NSP1 sequence identity share similar interactomes and may adopt similar mechanisms to suppress host gene expression.

In BioID2-MS analysis, we identified the EIF3 complex, including eight of the thirteen subunits in our NSP1 HCIP list ( Figure 5C ). The EIF3 complex stimulates nearly all steps of translation initiation and is essential for most forms of cap-dependent and cap-independent translation initiation 18 . In our TAP-MS analysis, a translation initiation factor, EIF4G2, was identified in all seven coronavirus NSP1 interactomes ( Figure 5D ). When the cell is infected by coronavirus, the viral NSP1 protein may recognize translation initiation factors and suppress almost all translation activities of the host cell, which may be similar to the situations reported for human immunodeficiency virus and other important human pathogens 19 . Additionally, several other transcription and translation regulators, such as BCLAF1, TDRD3, SSRP1, SMG6, and DIS3L2, were identified across all seven coronavirus NSP1 interactomes. The analysis of common NSP1-binding partners across all seven coronaviruses may explain why NSP1 proteins with only 10% to 20% sequence identity have similar functions in suppressing host gene expression.",

            "text": "In contrast to the common HCIPs for all coronaviruses, some HCIPs were unique or showed significantly higher binding signals to NSP1 from one or several coronaviruses. For example, the subunits of DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex, POLA1, POLA2, PRIM1, and PRIM2, were identified with NSP1 of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, which was reported recently 6 . However, there was no or weak signal of this complex in other coronavirus NSP1 interactomes (Figures 5C and 5D) . We identified more than 500 PSMs for both PYCR1 and PYCR2 in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 purifications (Figure 5D) , indicating that these two viruses have some unique mechanisms. We further confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 NSP1-PYCR1/PYCR2 protein-protein interaction by immunoblotting ( Figure 5E ). PYCR1/PYCR2 proteins catalyze the last step in proline biosynthesis. This process is critical for tumorigenesis 69, 70 and may be hijacked by human herpesvirus for tumorigenesis 71 An RNA-mediated gene silencing component, AGO3, was identified in several coronaviruses, but with much higher signal in HCoV-HKU1 ( Figure 5D ). Another protein, RIPK1, which is a key regulator of tumor necrosis factor-mediated apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammatory pathways, was also identified as binding with all seven human coronavirus NSP1 proteins, but the strongest interaction was in HCoV-HKU1. Both AGO3 and RIPK1 play a role in NF-kappaB signaling, which may regulate NF-kappaB activation, constituting a major antiviral immune pathway 72 . A general transcription and DNA repair factor, IIH core complex, was identified as uniquely binding to HCoV-229E; we identified several of its subunits, including GTF2H1, GTF2H2, GTF2H4, ERCC3, and ERCC5 ( Figure 5D) . DICER1, which plays a central role in post-transcriptional gene silencing and exogenous RNA degradation, was identified with significantly higher PSMs in HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 than in the other coronaviruses ( Figure 5D) . Together, these findings suggest that different and unique mechanisms may be utilized by each coronavirus after infection to suppress host gene expression. These differences in NSP1 interactomes may also explain why different coronaviruses have different symptoms in humans.",

As shown in Figures 6C and 7C , we recovered around 400 PSMs for these two preys in the purification of SARS-CoV-2 N protein, which was several times higher than those in MERS-CoV and other four common human coronaviruses. We confirmed these bindings with immunoblotting ( Figure 7D ). G3BP1 and G3BP2 bind more strongly with the N proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 than with the N proteins from other human coronaviruses, and the binding to MERS N protein was the weakest. G3BP1 and G3BP2 are important for innate immunity, as described above.

            "text": "In the current study, we generated a comprehensive host-virus protein-protein interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 by identifying HCIPs using two different interactome approaches, i.e., TAP-MS and BioID2-MS. We identified a total of 437 HCIPs that bind to one or several of the SARS-CoV-2 genes. These findings not only validate several known protein-protein interactions but also identify many new protein-protein interactions with potential functions in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. This dataset reveals new mechanistic insights into the diverse functions of SARS-CoV-2 genes, which need to be further investigated. Moreover, this dataset suggests potential drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Surprisingly, we found that only seven proteins overlapped between these two methods, as shown in Figure S5A . When we examined the details of the HCIP lists, we found that the TAP and BioID2 methods have their own biases. The TAP method is effective in identifying HCIPs for soluble proteins, whereas BioID2 facilitates the detection of binding partners of baits with transmembrane domains, which is similar to previous studies using this method 4 . In our SARS-CoV-2 interactome results, we identified many HCIPs for three baits when using the BioID2 method. All three proteins are predicted to have multiple transmembrane domains according to our analysis using TMHMM, i.e., NSP3 (four domains), M (three domains), and ORF3a (three domains). However, for the baits with only one predicted or known transmembrane domain, such as S, E, and ORF7b protein, our TAP method worked efficiently.",

            "text": "Another possible explanation for the difference between the TAP and BioID2 methods may be influence from the data obtained and the subsequent data analysis. Because the TAP method employs TAP, whereas BioID2 uses one-step purification with streptavidin beads, we uncovered much shorter raw protein/peptide lists with the TAP-MS method, which allowed the MS instrument to capture much more PSMs for each HCIP. For example, the ORF9a-TOMM70 interaction was uncovered as an HCIP by both methods. However, we detected an average of 1518 PSMs of TOMM70 from three biological replicates in our TAP-MS experiments, but only an average of 31 PSMs in the BioID2-MS study. Our current data analysis of HCIPs may not be adequate to deal with this technical issue, because it is challenging to distinguish true binding partners from contaminants in a long raw protein/peptide list with few prey PSMs for each protein. The third explanation for differences between the two methods is the restriction of BioID2 or any other proximity-labeling method, which limits the coverage of binding partners located beyond the small labeling reaction range. The overlap between the interactomes revealed by different strategies is quite low 6, 73 (Figure S4B) . This is still a common issue in protein-protein interaction studies, and it may due to the purification strategy, experimental design, and/or data filtration/analysis. Additionally, we compared NSP1 and N protein interactomes among different human coronaviruses. These comparisons expand our knowledge of these viruses. Although NSP1 and N proteins from different coronaviruses share limited sequence identity, they have many common host binding partners, which match their biological functions. Such as the suppression of host gene expression by NSP1 proteins may be mediated through their binding to the EIF complex. The regulation of viral replication, transcription, and translation in all human coronaviruses may through the interaction between N protein and host ribosomal proteins or proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Besides these common interaction proteins, we also uncovered some host proteins have different interaction ability among the seven human coronaviruses, and this may explain differing pathogenesis patterns among the coronaviruses.",
