While severe dengue is related to pre-existing non-neutralizing dengue virus (DENV) antibodies, the role of T cells in protection or pathology is unclear. Using cutaneous DENV infection in immunocompetent mice we previously showed the generation of PNA? germinal centers (GCs), now we assessed the activation and proliferation of B and T cells in draining lymph nodes (DLNs). We found a drastic remodelling of DLN compartments from 7 to 14 days post-infection (dpi) with greatly enlarged B cell follicles, occupying almost half of the DLN area compared to *24% in na\u00efve conditions. Enormous clusters of proliferating (Ki-67?) cells inside B follicles were found 14 dpi, representing *33% of B cells in DLNs but only *2% in noninfected mice. Inside GCs, we noticed an important recruitment of tingle body macrophages removing apoptotic cells. In contrast, the percentage of paracortex area and total T cells decreased by 14-16 dpi, compared to controls. Scattered randomly distributed Ki-67? T cells were found, similar to non-infected mice. CD69 expression by CD4? and CD8? T cells was minor, while it was remarkable in B cells, representing 1764.7% of change from basal levels 3 dpi. The apparent lack of T cell responses cannot be attributed to apoptosis since no significant differences were observed compared to noninfected mice. This study shows massive B cell activation and proliferation in DLNs upon DENV infection. In contrast, we found very poor, almost absent CD4? and CD8? T cell responses.",

To evaluate more precisely the effects of cutaneous DENV inoculation upon the B and T cell compartments in situ, and the putative cell proliferation in each compartment, we probed for Ki-67 marker. We found that the B cell follicle area is increased 7 days after DENV infection, rising from 22.3%\u00b1 2.3% of the total DLN area in na\u00efve DLNs to 29.7% \u00b1 0.3% in DLNs from infected animals. The B cell area of DENV-infected mice is hosting much more Ki-67? cells than na\u00efve follicles do (Fig. 1A, 1B) . The number of follicles that become Ki-67? start to rise after 7 days of DENV immunization (Fig. 1C) . While in the na\u00efve follicles there were very few and small Ki-67? cell aggregates (1.0% \u00b1 0.7%), at day 7 p.i. a big portion of the follicles was occupied by Ki-67? cells (28.2% \u00b1 4.5%, Fig. 1D ). In contrast, the total T cell area (in the paracortex) seems slightly decreased in DENV-infected mice at 7 days p.i., from 64.6% \u00b1 1.6% to 47.4% \u00b1 1.0% (Fig. 1A, 1B) . To evaluate the potential role of the sole presence of viral antigens upon lymphocyte activation and proliferation we inoculated mice with UVinactivated virus (iDENV), which contains all the viral componentes but is unable to replicate. We observed the DLNs of mice inoculated with iDENV behaved similar to the control non-infected group, but the Ki-67? area started to increase at this time (day 7 p.i.). However, at 14 days post-DENV infection, the B cell area in DLNs is highly expanded, from 22.3% \u00b1 2.3% in non-infected conditions to 43.0% \u00b1 6.3% in infected animals, containing an increased number of proliferating (Ki-67?) follicles, with Ki-67? cells occupying up to 42.0% \u00b1 3.8% of the follicular area ( Fig. 1A-1D ). In contrast, the DLNs paracortical zone seems decreasing, from 64.6% \u00b1 1.6% to 36.0% \u00b1 5.5 at 14 days p.i. A very similar pattern regarding both compartments was observed at this time point with the iDENV immunization ( Fig. 1A-1D ).",

While assessing the GC reaction to cutaneous DENV infection we performed H&E staining and noticed many condensed nuclei which at a higher magnification looked apparently ''clustered'' in defined separate groups, suggesting that several apoptotic bodies were probably phagocytosed by macrophages (Fig. 3A) . We demonstrated by TUNEL assay many clusters of apoptotic cells inside the GCs (Fig. 3B ). To corroborate that the phagocytic population involved were TBMs with apoptotic bodies inside the DENV-induced GCs, we double-labelled DLN sections using CD68 as a pan-macrophage marker and IgD to identify na\u00efve B cell follicles. In DLNs from PBS- inoculated control mice, we found very few and small CD68? macrophages inside non-reactive (IgD?) B cell follicles. In these control animals the majority of the CD68? cells were rather small macrophages and were widely scattered all along the medullar areas and the T cell zone (Fig. 3C ). In contrast, in DLNs from iDENV-and DENV-immunized mice there were big, reactive, IgDnegative B cell follicles indicating an ongoing GC reaction. The distribution of big CD68? macrophages was now remarkably confined into the GCs, while some were in the medullar areas and the T cell zones. This was more clearly seen at panoramic view at lower magnifications, suggesting a massive TBM recruitment into the GCs 14 days after DENV infection (Fig. 3C ). Inside these large GCs, we found high numbers of big CD68? TBMs representing 37.6 \u00b1 4.0 per follicle in DENV-and 28.5 \u00b1 4.5 in iDENV-inoculated mice, respectively, compared to only 6.6 \u00b1 0.8 of them in control DLNs (Fig. 3D ).",

To evaluate this phenomenon with a more specific approach, we looked for active caspase-3 in situ, a key enzyme in the execution of apoptosis. Furthermore, another hallmark of apoptosis is the cleavage of DNA, which can be revealed by the TUNEL assay. Thus, we performed both techniques in DLNs of control and DENV-infected mice to ascertain the apoptotic cells in the whole paracortex (Thy 1.2? area). We found very few T lymphocytes expressing caspase 3 under infection (Fig. 7B) . Likewise, scarce TUNEL? apoptotic T cells were found in the paracortex of DLNs from DENV-infected mice. In both cases, the percentages lacked statistically significant differences, compared with the noninfected mice (Fig. 7C ).",

            "text": "Since one of the crucial risk factors to develop severe dengue is the prior immune response to DENV and considering that T and B lymphocytes encompass the specificity and memory of adaptative immune responses, it is conceivable that they could be involved in DENV immunopathology (Burke et al. 1988; Graham et al. 1999; Endy et al. 2002) . However, their potential protective versus pathological role in the disease is not fully understood, especially for T lymphocytes (Malavige and Ogg 2013; Screaton et al. 2015; Rivino 2016) . This, in part might be due to the fact that DENV specific T cells represent a very low proportion of circulating cells during the acute phase (median 0.75%, mean 2.3%) (Friberg et al. 2011) ; no response, up to 0.1% and 2.5% (Mongkolsapaya et al. 2006 ); 0.02%-2.5% (Mongkolsapaya et al. 2003) , when the severe symptoms start. Rather, a differentiated form of B cells, the plasmablasts, have been found as high as a 1000-fold increase, constituting up to 30% of the total PBMCs, in some cases even mimicking a plasma cell leukaemia during acute DENV infection (Gawoski and Ooi 2003; Balakrishnan et al. 2011; Wrammert et al. 2012 ). Most of these plasmablasts (70%) recognize DENV inoculation. B Bar graphs represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of the percentage of Ki-67? cells showing a massive B, but not T cell proliferation, both at 7-and 16-days p.i. Two independent experiments from 4 mice each were pooled and graphed. Statistical significance was calculated using two way-ANOVA test and Bonferroni's test for multiple comparison, **P \\ 0.01and ****P \\ 0.0001. Most of DENV research has been performed in circulating blood cells from infected patients, in our study we evaluated the corresponding lymph nodes (DLNs) as crucial lymphoid organs evolved to facilitate the potential encounters between antigens and the low frequency of antigen-specific lymphocytes (Flajnik 2018) . Using a previously established model of cutaneous DENV infection in immunocompetent mice (Yam-Puc et al. 2015) , we found by in situ evaluation and single-cell analysis, a nearly absent T cell proliferative response to DENV infection (measured by the expression of Ki-67), in both the CD4? and the CD8? T cells. In line with this, a lack of T cells expansion, an impaired proliferation, defects on IFN-c production, and suboptimal T cell degranulation in the acute phase have been documented in patients, some reports attributed the poor T cell response to apoptosis (Mongkolsapaya et al. 2003 (Mongkolsapaya et al. , 2006 Dung et al. 2010) . To explore this last possibility in our model, we assessed cell death in DLNs by three different approaches but we did not find a significant increase in T cell apoptosis ratio under DENV compared with non-infected controls, suggesting that apoptosis might not be the major determinant for T cell unresponsiveness.",

Other authors have shown decreased T cell proliferation in vitro due to defects in the accessory cell population in PBMCs (during acute dengue illness), seemingly related to low supply of IL-2 and IL-7 cytokines (Mathew et al. 1999) . Dendritic cells as targets for DENV infection (Wu et al. 2000) and replication might be impaired to prime T cells.

Another possibility is the upregulation of inhibitory molecules such as PD-1, LAG-3 and CTLA-4, indeed they have been found increased in T cells during DENV infection (Chandele et al. 2016 ).

We found a prominent increased expression of CD69 in B cells mainly at 3-days and until 23-days after cutaneous DENV infection. In contrast, T cells showed a very minor expression of CD69 compared to basal conditions, and it was much lower when compared to CD69 upregulation by B cells. Downregulation of CCR7 on T cells has been reported (Chandele et al. 2016 ) and together with the low expression of CD69 that we observed, this could indicate that T cells might not be retained inside DLNs, since is reported that CD69 participates in preventing lymphocytes leaving the lymph nodes (Cyster and Schwab 2012) .",

The idea of B cell proliferation in lymphoid organs during the natural infection is supported by the fact that numerous plasmablasts are found in the circulation of DENV-infected patients (Wrammert et al. 2012; Garcia-Bates et al. 2013) . In line with the lymphocyte retention theory, we found CD69 strongly expressed in DLN B cells.

As we previously reported big GCs in DLNs after cutaneous DENV infection, plus the high rate of proliferation inside B cell follicles, made us to consider the possibility that B cell responses or maturation via the GC reaction could be altered. It is worth mentioning that the classical compartmentalization of GCs in light zone and dark zone was absent in our studies, apparently due to the large expansion of proliferating B cells inside follicles upon DENV infection. Of note, along with the extensive B cell proliferation, we found a high number of CD68? TBMs and many dead cells, but exclusively in the B cell proliferating area (dark zone). This was detected by histology and confirmed by TUNEL. Normally, most TBMs (75%) would appear in the light zone (Hardie et al. 1993; MacLennan 1994) .
