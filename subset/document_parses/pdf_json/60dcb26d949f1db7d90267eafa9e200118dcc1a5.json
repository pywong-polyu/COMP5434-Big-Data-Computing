In this study, we investigated the effects of the siRNA targeting HCV-RNA in vivo. Methods: We constructed recombinant retrovirus and adenovirus expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and transfected into replicon-expressing cells in vitro and transgenic mice in vivo. Results: Retroviral transduction of Huh7 cells to express shRNA and subsequent transfection of an HCV replicon into the cells showed that the cells had acquired resistance to HCV replication. Infection of cells expressing the HCV replicon with an adenovirus expressing shRNA resulted in efficient vector delivery and expression of shRNA, leading to suppression of the replicon in the cells by~10 -3 . Intravenous delivery of the adenovirus expressing shRNA into transgenic mice that can be induced to express HCV structural proteins by the Cre/loxP switching system resulted in specific suppression of virus protein synthesis in the liver. Conclusion: Taken together, our results support the feasibility of utilizing gene targeting therapy based on siRNA and/or shRNA expression to counteract HCV replication, which might prove valuable in the treatment of hepatitis C.",

Recently, successful suppression of various human pathogens by RNAi have been reported, including human immunodeficiency viruses, 5, 6 poliovirus, 7 influenza virus, 8 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus 9 and hepatitis B virus (HBV). [10] [11] [12] [13] We and other researchers have reported that appropriately designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting HCV genomic RNA can efficiently and specifically suppress HCV replication in vitro. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] We have tested siRNA designed to target the wellconserved 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) of HCV-RNA, and identified the most effective target, just upstream of the translation initiation codon. Furthermore, transfection of DNA-based vectors expressing siRNA was as effective as that of synthetic siRNA in suppressing HCV replication. 14 In this study, we explored the further possibility that efficient delivery and expression of siRNA may be effective in suppression and elimination of HCV replication and that delivery of such HCV-directed siRNA in vivo may be effective in silencing viral protein expression in the liver. Here, we report that HCV replication was suppressed in vitro by recombinant retrovirus and adenovirus vectors expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and that the delivery of the adenovirus vector to mice in vivo specifically inhibited viral protein synthesis in the liver.",

To construct shRNA-expressing DNA cassettes, oligonucleotide inserts were synthesized that contained the loop sequence (5\u2032-TTC AAG AGA-3\u2032) flanked by sense and antisense siRNA sequences (Fig. 2a) . These were inserted immediately downstream of the human U6 promoter. To avoid a problem in transcribing shRNA because of instability of the DNA strands arising from the tight palindrome structure, several C-to-T point mutations, which retained completely the silencing activity of the shRNA, were introduced into the sense strand of the shRNA sequences (referred to as 'm'). 23 A control plasmid, pUC19-shRNA-Control, expressed shRNA directed towards the Machado-Joseph disease gene, which is a mutant of ataxin-3 gene and is not normally expressed. We have previously described the sequence specific activity of the shRNA-Control. 24 Prior to construction of the virus vectors, we tested silencing efficiency of five shRNA constructs of different lengths that covered the target sequence (Fig. 2a) . The shRNA-HCV-19, shRNA-HCV-21 and shRNA-HCV-27 had target sequences of 19, 21 and 27 nucleotides, respectively. Transfection of these shRNA constructs into Huh7/pRep-Feo showed that shRNA with longer target sequences had better suppressive effects (Fig. 2b ). Therefore, we used shRNA-HCV-27m (abbreviated as shRNA-HCV) in the following study.",

            "text": "The requirements to achieve a high efficiency using RNAi are: (i) selection of target sequences that are the most susceptible to RNAi; (ii) persistence of siRNA activity; and (iii) efficient in vivo delivery of siRNA to cells. We have used an shRNA sequence that was derived from a highly efficient siRNA (siRNA331), and constructed a DNA-based shRNA expression cassette that showed competitive effects with the synthetic siRNA (Fig. 2 ). 14 The shRNA-expression cassette does not only allow extended half-life of the RNAi, but also enables use of gene-delivery vectors, such as virus vectors. As shown in the results, a retrovirus vector expressing shRNA-HCV could stably transduce cells to express HCVdirected shRNA, and the cells acquired protection against HCV subgenomic replication (Fig. 3 ). An adenovirus vector expressing shRNA-HCV resulted in suppression of HCV subgenomic and protein expression by around three logs to almost background levels (Fig. 4) . Consistent results were obtained by using an HCV cell culture (Fig. 6 ). More importantly, we have demonstrated in-vivo effects on viral protein expression in the liver using a conditional transgenic mouse model (Fig. 7) . These results suggest that efficient delivery of siRNA could be effective against HCV infection in vivo. An obstacle to applying siRNA technology to treat virus infections is that viruses are prone to mutate during their replication. 32 HCV continuously produces mutated viral strains to escape immune defense mechanisms. Even in a single patient, the circulating HCV population comprises a large number of closely related HCV sequence variants called quasispecies. Therefore, siRNA targeting the protein-coding sequence of the HCV genome, which have been reported by others, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] may vary considerably among different HCV genotypes, and even among strains of the same genotype. 33 Our shRNA sequence targeted the 5\u2032-UTR of HCV RNA, which is the most conserved region among various HCV isolates. 33 In addition, the structural constraints on the 5\u2032-UTR, in terms of its requirement to direct internal ribosome entry and translation of viral proteins, might not permit the evolution of escape mutations. Our preliminary results have shown that the siRNA-HCV suppressed replication of an HCV genotype 2a replicon 34 to the same extent as the HCV 1b replicon.",

            "text": "Although the siRNA techniques rely on a high degree of specificity, several studies report siRNA-induced non-specific effect that may result from induction of ISG responses. 18, 31 These effects may be mediated by activation of double-strand RNA-dependent protein kinase, toll-like receptor 3, 35 or possibly by a recently identified RNA helicase, RIG-I. 36 It remains to be determined whether these effects are generally induced by every siRNA construct. Sledz et al. have reported that transfection of two siRNA induced cellular interferon responses, 37 while Bridge et al. report that shRNA-expressing plasmids induced an interferon response but transfection of synthetic siRNA did not. 31 Speculatively, these effects on the interferon system might be construct dependent. Our shRNA-expression plasmids and adenoviruses did not activate ISG responses in vitro (Fig. 5a,b) or in vivo (Fig. 7b) . We have preliminarily detected phosphorylated PKR (P-PKR) by western blotting, and found no apparent increase of P-PKR (data not shown). These results indicate that these target sequences and structures are of sufficient specificity to silence the target gene without eliciting non-specific interferon responses. Beside the canonical action of siRNA, a sequence-specific cleavage of target mRNA, the siRNA could act as a micro-RNA that suppresses translational initiation of mRNA, 38 or it could mediate transcriptional gene silencing. 39 Regarding our in-vivo experiments, it was difficult to differentially analyze the effect of siRNA at individual sites of action because post-translational effect of siRNA concomitantly destabilizes target mRNA, which leads to apparent decrease of mRNA transcripts. (c) Immunofluorescence microscopy of HCV core protein in the liver tissue. Liver sections of mice were stained using rabbit anticore polyclonal antibody and normal rabbit IgG as a negative control. The upper photographs were obtained at 400\u00a5 magnification, and the lower photographs were at 1000\u00a5. (d) Immunofluorescence microscopy of albumin in liver. Liver sections from the mice were fixed and stained using rabbit antialbumin antibody and normal rabbit IgG as a negative control. Efficiency and safety of gene transfer methods are the key determinants of the clinical success of gene therapy and an unresolved problem. There are several reports of delivery of siRNA or siRNA-expression vectors to cells in vivo; 12, 40, 41 however, gene delivery methods that are safe enough to apply to clinical therapeutics are currently under development. Adenovirus vectors are one of the most commonly used carriers for human gene therapies. [42] [43] [44] Our present results demonstrate that the adenoviral delivery of shRNA is effective in blocking HCV replication in vitro and virus protein expression in vivo. Adenovirus vectors have several advantages of efficient delivery of transgene both in vitro and in vivo and natural hepatotropism when administered in vivo. The AxshRNA-HCV specifically blocked expression of HCV structural proteins in a conditional transgenic mouse expressing those proteins. The current adenovirus vectors may cause inflammatory reactions in the target organ, 45 however, and produce neutralizing antibodies which make repeated administration difficult. These problems may be overcome by the improved constructs of virus vectors with attenuated immunogenicity or by the development of non-viral carriers for gene delivery. 46 In conclusion, our results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the siRNA expression system. The efficiency of adenovirus expressing shRNA that target HCV suggests that delivery and expression of siRNA in hepatocytes may eliminate the virus and that this RNA-targeting approach might provide a potentially effective future therapeutic option for HCV infection.",
