Combination regimens comprised of drugs with different mechanisms of action have shown better outcomes than single-drug or single-approach-based treatments; however, to date, combination regimens investigated as part of conversion therapy strategies have been two drug combinations with reported issues of relatively low surgical conversion and objective response rates. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of triple combination therapy with angiogenesis inhibitors, programmed death-1 inhibitors and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy for surgical conversion of advanced HCC.",

Owing to the absence of symptoms in the early stages of the disease, more than 70% of patients with HCC are diagnosed at an advanced stage, long after transplantation, surgery or locoregional treatment are feasible (2) . Palliative systemic therapy is usually the only remaining treatment option for these patients. However, in the past few years, treatment of advanced HCC has evolved rapidly with the introduction of novel systemic therapies.",

In Japan, HAIC is considered a safe and effective alternative to sorafenib and is recommend for use in patients with advanced HCC (17) . Recent clinical trials have also shown that sorafenib plus HAIC with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) improved the objective response rate (ORR) versus sorafenib in patients with HCC and portal vein invasion; however, the survival benefit was unsatisfactory (18) . Immune combination therapy is associated with the 'survival drag effect' in which patients with an effective immune response will achieve a highly durable antitumor response from a particular time point (the onset of the immune response) (19) . In summary, the ORR of HAIC is high, but does not translate to an increase in OS. This can be compensated through use of a dual combination of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and immune checkpoint blockade.",

An effective way to improve OS with combination therapy is to proactively conduct radical treatments, such as conversion surgery or ablation (20) . Indeed, salvage surgery following surgical conversion has been reported to achieve favorable outcomes in some studies (21) . However, challenges reported with previously investigated approaches include relatively low objective response rates (ORRs) and surgical conversion rates, highlighting a need for the identification of more effective combination regimens with manageable side effects in order to allow a higher proportion of patients to achieve conversion to resectable disease. The present study investigated the efficacy and safety of a triple combination therapy strategy including angiogenesis inhibitors, programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors and HAIC in patients with initially unresectable advanced HCC.",

Three kinds of angiogenesis inhibitors and two kinds of anti-PD-1 antibodies, which are commonly used in clinical practice, were used by patients in this study. To be more specific, eligible patients had received a triple combination of an oral antiangiogenic drug (in order to reduce side effects and ensure curative effect, a low dose was used, based to the prescribing information: apatinib 250 mg/day, lenvatinib 8 mg/day, or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily), a PD-1 inhibitor (camrelizumab 200 mg or sintilimab 200 mg every 3 weeks) administered intravenously, and HAIC with FOLFOX administered every 4-8 weeks with the catheter and sheath removed at the end of infusion. The choice of anti-angiogenic agent was at the discretion of the patient. The FOLFOX regimen comprised oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 as a 2 hours infusion, calcium folinate 400 mg/m 2 as a 2-3 hours infusion and fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 as a bolus injection, followed by fluorouracil 1200 mg/m 2 administered over 23 hours on day 1. HAIC dosing was adjusted appropriately according to the patient's liver function with a minimum dosage of one third of the standard dose. Imaging evaluations (MRI was preferred and CT was used if MRI was not available) were conducted every 4-8 weeks after at least one HAIC treatment. Tumors were assessed every 2 months using serum markers and imaging examination with abdominal ultrasound as the primary method and contrast MRI on suspicion of recurrence. Patients determined to have sufficient residual liver volume after tumor resection, verified by senior surgeons during multidisciplinary meetings, received surgical intervention followed by oral angiogenesis inhibitors and PD-1 inhibitors.",

However, the reported conversion rates are far from satisfactory at 15-20% (25) . Recent studies have suggested that the combination of HAIC-based locoregional therapy with targeted therapy and immunotherapy is a promising multimodal approach for advanced HCC (20) . In the present study, we demonstrated a high ORR (96.0%) achieved in a relatively short time (median TTR 50.5 days) compared with previous reports of combination regimens (ORR: 23.1-54.4%) with the triple combination of angiogenesis inhibitors, PD-1 inhibitors and HAIC with FOLFOX, as well as a relatively high surgical conversion rate (60.0%) (3, 6-9, 11, 14) . Our study investigated the combined effects of drugs with different mechanisms without limiting the types or brands of angiogenesis inhibitors and PD-1inhibitors. However, all combination regimens investigated in this study showed similar positive results, indicating universal applicability of the triple combination therapy. Furthermore, the high pathologic CR rate suggests that triple combination therapy can provide greater survival benefits, which is supported by the favorable 6-and 12-month PFS. However, evaluation of median overall survival requires an extended followup period and could not be evaluated in this analysis. Ninety-two percent of the patients in this analysis had macrovascular invasion (n = 23), including 10 patients (40.0%) with invasion of the main trunk of the portal vein or inferior vena cava, which was an exclusion criteria in most previous clinical trials of treatments for HCC. Although the small sample size of this study may have led to biased results, the results showed that this group of \"super-advanced\" patients had an ORR of 100% following triple therapy and a surgical conversion rate of 50.0% (5/10), including four patients (40.0%) who achieved a pathologic CR ( Table 3) . This result needs further validation over a more extended follow-up period.",

Although the endoscopic hemostasis delayed subsequent treatment and AFP level was elevated, the tumor and emboli of the left portal vein showed complete necrosis after the second cycle of triple combination therapy ( Figure 4) .

Surgical resection allowed patients to minimize tumor load before tumor progression due to drug resistance, thus increasing their chances of an effective cure and prolonged survival. Of the 14 patients who underwent surgery, nine (64.3%) had Vp3-4 portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT); after a median follow-up time of 18.13 months (range: 9.23-20.67months), only one postoperative intrahepatic recurrence was observed and treated with radiofrequency ablation. This is significant when compared with previous reports which have shown a median survival time of only 0.5-0.8 years in HCC patients with Vp3-4 PVTT (26) . Furthermore, of the 14 patients who underwent resection, only the one patient who relapsed had an AFP level of >7 ng/mL after surgery, which suggests that AFP can be used as an indicator of postoperative recurrence. At the end of follow-up, the other 13 post-operative patients had no recurrence or metastasis on imaging assessment; however, median relapse-free survival could not be assessed.",

As the triple combination regimen rapidly reduced the tumor load and retracted the vascular carcinoma thrombus, the liver blood supply improved, increasing tolerance to the treatment. As a result, no grade 4 adverse events occurred and only two patients with portal hypertension experienced gastrointestinal bleeding that resulted in treatment delay. The reasons for failure to complete treatment according to the protocol were: 1) the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic during the treatment period, which made it difficult for patients to seek medical attention, especially trans-provincial patients who could not be treated and re-examined on time; 2) fear of complications of treatment; and 3) financial reasons. Presently, the COVID-19 outbreak has been effectively controlled in China, and the difficulties of patients seeking treatment have been resolved. Regarding complications, the triple combination therapy demonstrated a high level of safety with no grade 4 treatment-related side effects or treatment-related deaths throughout the analysis period. Treatment-related side effects were manageable with symptomatic treatment and adjustment of the drug dosage. For example, gastrointestinal bleeding was safely managed with endoscopic therapy. The inactivation and regression of the main stem thrombus due to the treatment can also reduce the portal pressure and risk of rebleeding. Moreover, for patients with severe gastric fundus varices, endoscopic ligation before treatment can also reduce the risk of severe bleeding. Financially, the triple combination protocol allows for various combinations of different angiogenesis inhibitors and PD-1 inhibitors, which provides patients with options that suit their economic circumstances. Furthermore, our study extended the treatment interval of HAIC to 4-8 weeks, reducing the number of hospitalizations and medical costs, with the efficacy of treatment unaffected.",
