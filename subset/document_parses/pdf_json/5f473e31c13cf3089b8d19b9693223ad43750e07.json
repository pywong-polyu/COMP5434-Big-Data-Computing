            "text": "We derive a novel model escorted by large scale compartments, based on a set of coupled delay differential equations with extensive delays, in order to estimate the incubation, recovery and decease periods of COVID-19, and more generally any infectious disease. This is possible thanks to machine learning algorithms applied to publicly available database of confirmed corona cases, recovered cases and death toll. In this purpose, we separate i) the total cases into 14 groups corresponding to 14 incubation periods, ii) the recovered cases into 406 groups corresponding to a combination of incubation and recovery periods, and iii) the death toll into 406 groups corresponding to a combination of incubation and decease periods. In this paper, we focus on recovery and decease periods and their correlation with the incubation period. The estimated mean recovery period we obtain is 22.14 days (95% Confidence Interval(CI): 22.00 to 22.27), and the 90th percentile is 28.91 days (95% CI: 28.71 to 29.13), which is in agreement with statistical supported studies. The bimodal gamma distribution reveals that there are two groups of recovered individuals with a short recovery period, mean 21.02 days (95% CI: 20.92 to 21.12), and a long recovery period, mean 38.88 days (95% CI 38.61 to 39.15). Our study shows that the characteristic of the decease period and the recovery period are alike. From the bivariate analysis, we observe a high probability domain for recovered individuals with respect to incubation and recovery periods. A similar domain is obtained for deaths analyzing bivariate distribution of incubation and decease periods.",

This will be achieved using publicly available database 27 of the total number of corona-positive cases, recovery and death toll. Using the novel model, demonstrated here, we divide the publicly available database into thousands of groups, and these separated classes are the key source for estimating all the key periods. This approach is free from any special type of samples in order to produce the distributions of those periods; it only involves large scale computations for estimating about thousand model parameters. After a single calculation of this method, we can generate the current distributions as well as previous distributions of those periods. In the statistical based approaches, it is usually difficult to consider large incubation, recovery and decease periods if the sample size is small. However, in our approach, we can go well beyond 14 days, the maximum incubation period that we have set in this paper, and beyond the interval 2 weeks to 6 weeks, the range of recovery as well as decease periods that we have considered in the current computations. As of May 23, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) had confirmed a total of 1,359,180 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including 25,231 deaths 2 . As of May 23, 2021 there are five provinces in Canada with death toll more than 1000 ( Fig.1(a) ), and the recovery and death rates are respectively 96.1% and 0.7% (Fig.1(c) ). During the first wave of COVID-19 in Canada, January 22, 2020 to July 16, 2020, the recovery and death rates were respectively 66.5% and 8.1% ( Fig. 1(b) ). Here, we assume that the recovery and decease periods of COVID-19 remain unchanged i.e., these periods during the first wave and the present time are almost identical, and under this assumption we merely consider the database of first wave for the calculation.",

The key periods may depend on age 28 (median-age / country), hard immunity, public health system, corona testing capacities, daily corona cases, etc. For a better estimation of the key periods for a particular region, we need to study local patients. Data collection is a bottleneck in studying those key periods for COVID-19 or other infectious diseases using clinical survey, and we need a sample of large size for bivariate analysis. However, key periods can easily be estimated using the approach we propose here, the publicly available database along with machine learning algorithms.",

We describe the decease period in the same way as the recovery period. Understanding the recovery period of disease is very useful information in the struggle against the disease. If the incidence of a disease is remarkably high and the recovery period of the disease is also high then the prevalence of the disease in the country is likely to increase which in turn puts extra health, economic and social burden on this country. Understanding the recovery period of the disease will help governments to plan proper strategies to counter the disease and to organize the requirements such as hospitals, doctors, medical staffs, medical equipment's, etc. It will also help to implement different social and economic policies which will be essential to fight the disease.",

There are two peaks at the points (3, 19) , i.e., for \u03c4 i = 3 and \u03b6 k = 19, and (8, 20) , i.e., for \u03c4 i = 8 and \u03b6 k = 20, corresponding to the high densities of recovered individuals. We estimate the histogram using a bivariate normal distribution Fig.3(b) ) where the variables \u03c4 and \u03b6 represent the incubation and recovery periods, respectively. The mean m (r) \u03c4 and standard deviation \u03c3 (r) \u03c4 of the incubation period are 6.43 (95% CI 6.27 to 6.59) and 3.06 (95% CI 2.96 to 3.18), respectively; the mean m \u03b6 and standard deviation \u03c3 \u03b6 of the recovery period are 21.91 (95% CI 21.63 to 22.18) and 5.33 (95% CI 5.14 to 5.53), respectively; the correlation between incubation and recovery periods \u03c1 \u03c4\u03b6 is -0.11. The two dimensional representation of the bivariate normal distribution (Fig.3 (c))shows that the highly probable recovery region (red in the figure) is a nested domain of \u03c4 = 6.43 and \u03b6 = 21.91. To precisely analyze the highly probable region, we estimate the histogram ( Fig.3 (a)) using a nonparametric density function with a width of 33%, low and high percentage give a more local and global estimation, respectively, and we obtain a distribution with two peaks (Fig.3(d) ).

The model itself and the procedure to solve it, are the core of this work, and it can be applied to any infectious disease in any region provided that similar data are available. In conclusion, we obtain the distributions of the key periods from the population, considering all types of cases (non-hospitalized, non-ICU, ICU) of recovered individuals and deaths, which is naturally better than any sample-dependent result. In this approach, we do not need any clinical survey; the publicly available data on confirmed cases, recovery and death toll, are sufficient to analyze univariate and bivariate distributions. The current model can be extended to study age-based key periods, and for this purpose we need an age dependent database. The monotonic iteration scheme, introduced for better estimation, can be applied to machine learning as well as numerical analysis problems.",

It is believed this is the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in Canada, and according to the government report, the novel coronavirus arrived on the Canadian coast on January 25, 2020, first reported case. The above information suggests that the start date of the current pandemic in Canada is possibly to be January 22, 2020. Additionally, some research studies reported that the estimation of the incubation period is from 2 days to 14 days, and recovery as well as decease period of COVID-19 is from 2 weeks to 6 weeks 2, 33 . As a consequence, in the present study we consider J = 14 i.e, 14 delays for the incubation period, and M = 29 i.e, 29 delays for the recovery as well as decease periods.
