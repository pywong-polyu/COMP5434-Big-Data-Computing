At least 340 participants were required from each country for the sample to be representative. The target population of the survey was healthcare workers of any discipline or training background who were caring for patients with COVID-19. These healthcare workers included physicians (medical doctors who have completed a specialization, are undergoing training for a specialization, or are working as general doctors), nurses, auxiliary nurses, and other professionals (psychologists, physiotherapists, and respiratory therapists). Participants were required to specify their area of work and to specify whether the institution was a part of the public health system or a private hospital. Healthcare workers from different cities in each country were invited to participate so as to include a more representative sample. Participants were divided into two groups: performance of aerosol-generating (those working in intensive care units, general wards, and emergency departments) and no performance of aerosol-generating procedures (those providing primary care and radiology services). This categorization was performed as aerosol-generating procedures are associated with an increased risk of infection and normally require additional PPE.",

In this study, 12.6% of the participants worked in ICUs and 29.9% worked in emergency departments. This group needs to be well protected so that the capacity of treating patients can be maintained throughout the pandemic. This study reports a novel finding: there are a number of professionals who supply their own PPE and/or undergo a PCR test on their own. Up to 3 out of 5 of public health professionals had to undergo a PCR test on their own and had to continue working as long as they did not present with symptoms or obtained the test result. The reasons for this were not analyzed, but this could be due to a lack of resources and the distress of professionals of becoming ill or infecting their loved ones. Future research on this aspect is warranted.",

The availability of PPE is essential for the health system to continue functioning and cope with the pandemic; yet, the general perception of healthcare workers is that they have not been able to access adequate PPE to protect themselves from COVID-19. Healthcare workers must feel protected and be aware of the proper PPE needed in each scenario. If this is not the case, diminished work morale could harm the professional's resilience to endure the pandemic. Policymakers should ensure access to diagnostic testing and adequate PPE for healthcare workers.
