It was first reported in New Zealand in 1957 and is a common global infantile infectious disease (3) . The disease occurs in infants under 5 years old and is characterized by stomatalgia, anorexia, low fever, skin, or mucosal ulcers of the hands, feet, and mouth. However, a small number of children may experience myocarditis, pulmonary oedema, aseptic meningoencephalitis, and other complications. EV71 is often associated with serious central nervous system diseases and other complications, and the disease can develop rapidly in some severe cases, even leading to death. Since the discovery of EV71 (in Vietnam) in 1969, there have been HFMD outbreaks of varying degrees throughout the Asia-Pacific region, including China (4) . In a populous country such as China, an average of approximately 2 million cases of HFMD are reported every year. Thirty-one provinces across the country have reported cases of HFMD infection. HFMD is one of the top three class C notifiable infectious diseases with the highest incidence and highest number of deaths in China. Although the first EV71 vaccine in China was approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) at the end of 2015, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine has not been evaluated in a wide range of people for an extended period. Thus, the effectiveness of the EV71 vaccine is limited (5) (6) (7) . Therefore, in addition to continuing to develop multivalent vaccines, epidemic prevention departments should pay more attention to the potential factors and transmission mechanisms that cause outbreaks of HFMD.",

            "text": "Many studies have shown that the spread of HFMD has complex seasonality, that some areas have a multi-peak epidemic, and that the time rhythm of the epidemic peak varies with latitude. For example, the epidemic peak of HFMD occurs twice a year in subtropical areas such as Hong Kong (8) and Taiwan (9) , and in tropical regions such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia (10) . In contrast, there are unimodal epidemic characteristics in high latitude areas such as Japan (11) and Finland (12) . In northern China, HFMD reaches its peak in summer while HFMD in the south reaches its peak in spring and autumn (13, 14) . These countries show different HFMD epidemiological characteristics, and the various differences show that the outbreak and prevalence of infectious diseases have a series of potential influencing factors (15) , such as natural factors, socio-economic factors, and regional policies (16, 17) . These may have an interactive impact on the transmission characteristics of the disease. Among the health effects caused by climate change, one of the most important aspects is the impact on the spread of infectious diseases, and the intervention of pathogens, hosts, transmission route, and other intermediate links first reflects the mode of action of meteorological variables, which ultimately affect the incidence of the disease. Currently, there is an urgent need to solve the \"black box\" problem in this process, i.e., in what manner and what intervention role do a series of meteorological variables play in affecting the incidence of HFMD? Thus far, there have been relatively few studies and direct evidence on this issue. In China, the annual incidence rate in the southern and eastern provinces is higher than that of other provinces, and the annual incidence rate in Fujian Province is reported to be higher than the national average. The incidence of HFMD in Xiamen is always at the forefront in Fujian Province. Therefore, it is necessary to perform timely prevention and control measures for HFMD. In this study, the effective reproduction number (R eff ) obtained by mathematical model fitting was used to quantify the transmissibility of HFMD and as an intermediate variable to explore the relationship between key meteorological factors and HFMD. This can effectively restore the action mechanism of meteorological factors, and help establish preventive measures and an early warning mechanism for HFMD in the study area by combining real events.",

The first stage was the analysis of the relationship between the collected meteorological factors and the daily incidence rate, accounting for the delay in the incubation period and diagnosis of HFMD. In the correlation analysis, according to the incubation period of HFMD (3-7 days), we selected a lag of 10 days as the maximum lag in the incidence of HFMD. Thus, the number of cases was adjusted by a lag of 0-10 days.

Based on the incidence epidemic curve, the peak of incidence was mainly concentrated in summer and autumn, where the peak in summer was slightly lower than that in autumn. However, an abnormal situation occurred in 2017, when the peak in summer was significantly higher than that in autumn. The Spearman rank correlation analysis ( Table 1) showed a significantly positive correlation between the average temperature and incidence of HFMD (r = 0.596, p < 0.001), and a significantly negative correlation between the average air pressure and the incidence of HFMD (r = \u22120.511, p < 0.001). There was no correlation between the average wind velocity or amount of precipitation and incidence. Considering that the influence of lag may have distorted the results of the correlation analysis, the lag time of each meteorological variable was set to 0-10 days. After the adjustment, the correlations were slightly enhanced compared to those of the initial results. There was a weak correlation between the average wind velocity, amount of precipitation, and incidence, but overall, the results did not change significantly. The second set of results showed that there was a strong correlation between the average temperature and average air pressure (r = \u22120.841, p < 0.001). Therefore, these meteorological parameters and incidence rate were included in a multiple linear regression model (F in > F \u03b1 ). The model indicated that the average air pressure should be eliminated. The multiple correlation coefficient was 0.527, and the significance test of regression was P < 0.05, indicating that the degree of regression was significant.",

We assumed that this phenomenon was because the spread of enteroviruses requires certain temperature conditions; thus, the growth and reproduction of enteroviruses will be limited if they are below or above a certain temperature range. Therefore, at this stage of the analysis, the Spearman rank correlation was used to analyse the correlation between the average temperature and R eff in each period (Figure 4) . As the peak incidence of HFMD occurred in Xiamen twice a year, it had significant seasonal characteristics. Therefore, our results presented two situations according to the season (Figure 5) : in spring and summer, the temperature threshold of R eff was 13.4-18.4 \u2022 C, whereas in autumn and winter, the temperature threshold of R eff was 14.5-29.3 \u2022 C.

Although this type of model can partially avoid the influence of confounding factors, it has not completely restored the complete action path of meteorological factors.

            "text": "The seasonal transmission characteristics of infectious diseases are closely related to the infectivity of pathogens (26) , human activities, human susceptibility, and other mechanisms. Meteorological factors play a role by promoting or suppressing these mechanisms. HFMD can be spread through the gastrointestinal tract or respiratory tract (such as spraying, coughing, and sneezing). When the climate in Xiamen changes from spring to summer, the frequency of children's outings and outdoor sports (such as swimming) increases, which increases the probability of contact between people (27) . At the same time, indoor or public places are often enclosed to maintain warm temperatures, ignoring the importance of ventilation, which will increase exposure to pathogens in the air and increase the risk of HFMD. When Xiamen transitions from summer to autumn, the climate is relatively cool, people often conduct family oriented short-distance tourism during this period, and some local scenic spots have large-scale crowd gatherings. In addition, kindergartens, primary schools, and other educational institutions are at their peak school opening in autumn, and school opening times are relatively concentrated, which makes collective infection more feasible during the epidemic period of HFMD. In our study, the peak value of HFMD in autumn was slightly higher than that in summer, which was related to the large-scale inflow of foreign tourists into Xiamen. Xiamen, a city with a well-developed tourism industry, has large numbers of tourists at different stages every year. However, autumn is the peak tourism period, when foreign tourists can play the role of pathogen carriers, spreading pathogens and viruses to areas that do not have infectious diseases, resulting in an epidemic. Additionally, the visiting population (28) may have a temporary maladjustment to the sudden change in geographical environment and eating habits, resulting in a decline in their immunity, making them more susceptible to infectious diseases. Thus, the seasonal drivers of infectious diseases are highly complex. In addition to some of the main factors discussed above, the seasonal pattern of HFMD may also be related to social and economic policies (29) and other factors, which require further exploration.",

            "text": "Meteorological factors have a lag effect on the incidence of HFMD. This is because they first act on the intermediate medium and then affect the final incidence of HFMD through the intermediate medium. This intermediate process must complete its cycle over a certain period. In this study, there was no significant change in the results of the correlation analysis between the weather and HFMD after adjustments for the lag phenomenon, indicating that the lag of the disease had an impact on the correlation analysis but had no decisive impact on the final results. Most studies have found that one or more meteorological factors are related to HFMD (9, (30) (31) (32) , and our study draws a similar conclusion. However, the ways in which meteorological factors affect the occurrence of infectious diseases and their innate path of action are rarely discussed. We suggest that theoretical epidemiology is an important means to reveal this \"intermediate chain.\" In this seasonal study on HFMD in Xiamen, R eff was used to measure the transmissibility of HFMD. Under the premise that the average temperature was the main factor affecting the disease, we further explored the relationship between the R eff and average temperature to observe the action pathway of meteorological factors. Our findings showed that the transmissibility of the virus increased with the increase in temperature, but decreased rapidly after reaching a temperature threshold, after which there was a decrease in virus transmissibility. This indicates that temperature has a significant influence on the survival and transmission of enteroviruses in the external environment and in hosts as well as on the behavior of hosts. The sensitivity of EV71 and CVA16 to temperature has been confirmed in previous studies (33, 34) . Furthermore, studies have shown that the increment efficiency and speed of EV71 at 32, 35, and 40 \u2022 C are inhibited compared with that at 37 \u2022 C (35). Moreover, temperature sensitivity is the decisive factor for the survival of the virus in hosts. For example, the temperature-sensitive mutant of EV71 is less infectious and pathogenic to hosts than the temperature-tolerant mutant, which limits the transmission of the virus between hosts (36) . In other studies, temperature can not only directly affect the trajectory of human activities but also have a great impact on the behavior and physical condition of the human body (37) . Therefore, the changing characteristics of the R eff of HFMD reflected the comprehensive effect of a variety of intermediate media.",

Related studies have also shown that the main pathogens of HFMD change in different seasons and years, as well as a high mutation rate of human enterovirus (38, 39) . Besides, as current research on the temperature threshold of transmissibility is relatively limited, there is no unified threshold judgment standard. At present, this study is unable to effectively solve these problems. To obtain more practical research results, these aspects should be included in further explorations of the methods.",
