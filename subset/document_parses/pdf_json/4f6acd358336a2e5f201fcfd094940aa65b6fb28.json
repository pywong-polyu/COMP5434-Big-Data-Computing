This study included interviews with 12 faculty members at one research university in the U.S. to better understand their perceptions of their sabbatical experiences in relation to the model of faculty professional growth. Findings underscored that faculty were agentic in their learning, the professional relationships they sought out to do this learning, as well as the commitments they made in this learning and growth, including that of their own work-life balance.",

Studies that have demonstrated faculty scholarly production -or the lack thereof (Mamiseishvili & Miller, 2010; Sima & Denton, 1995) -are common, therefore, in the literature about faculty sabbatical leaves but tend to omit the other positive benefits that result from this experience.",

            "text": "Since its inception in the United States, the purpose of the faculty sabbatical leave has been somewhat unclear. Originating from the ancient Hebrew word sabbath and the biblical day of rest (Kang & Miller, 1999; Kimball, 1978) , sabbaticals are generally granted after the sixth year of the faculty career at either a half year with full pay or a full year with half pay (Eberle & Thompson, 1972; Eells, 1962; Kang & Miller, 1999; Kimball, 1978) . While typically considered a benefit for full-time faculty at many research-oriented institutions, faculty sabbaticals have long been in place across all institutional types, including community colleges (Academic Senate for California Community Colleges, 2007; Eells & Hollis, 1962; Schuster & Finkelstein, 2006) . In what may be the most recent national data collected on the offering of faculty sabbaticals, the 1992 edition of the Digest of Education Statistics reported nearly 74% of all 2-year and 4-year institutions in the United States offered sabbaticals (as cited in Kang & Miller, 1999) . Most often associated as a benefit granted after an assistant professor earns tenure and promotion, sabbaticals have also been documented as occurring throughout the faculty career (Zahorski, 1994) . At the same time, sabbaticals have often found to be on the budgetary chopping block in tough financial times (AAUP, 2009) as they tend to be seen as expensive benefits to offer. At the same time, many institutions' financial support of the sabbatical can vary, wherein institutions tend to only partially fund the salary of the faculty member, resulting in cost savings for institutions who tend to hire much less costly contingent faculty to replace them (Otto & Kroth, 2011) . The irony of this, of course, is that as institutions continue to face financial challenges, more contingent faculty are hired to replace these full-time faculty members (AAUP, 2009) and these contingent faculty are not known to be provided with sabbatical leaves.",

Others have seen the sabbatical as a mutual benefit to the faculty member and the institution (Eells, 1962; Miller et al., 2012; Rosser, 2004) , including Columbia University, which in 1907 stated the purpose of its sabbatical was \"for the good of university education\u2026for the real University teacher an intellectual and practical necessity\" (as cited in Eells, 1962, p. 253) .",

            "text": "Indeed, the purposes espoused in the existing literature underscore the mutuality of benefits emanating from the sabbatical. Sima and Denton (1995) summarized the purposes as such: (a) to conduct research; (b) to engage in uninterrupted study; (c) to write journal articles or a book; (d) to enhance artistic performance and creative growth; (e) to improve teaching; (f) to promote course and curriculum development; (g) for refreshment, new experience and travel; and (h) to complete graduate work. From this perspective, the activities and products in which a faculty member engages during the sabbatical leave provide not only professional development and enrichment for the faculty member but also products, outcomes, and long-term effects for the higher education institution in which the faculty member is employed. Interestingly, despite the long history of faculty sabbaticals, as well as the multiple institutional types at which they have been offered, relatively little empirical research exists about them, faculty experiences with them, or the outcomes that emanate from them. The sparse research on the faculty sabbatical that does exist is characterized by a focus on outcomes that are predominantly tangible in nature; meaning, a focus on the output of articles, grant applications and grant dollars, as well as other countable outcomes (Davidson et al., 2010; Mamiseishvili & Miller, 2010; Sima, 2000; Sima & Denton, 1995) . Outcomes that are more personal to the faculty member, such as rest, refreshment, and rejuvenation (Sima & Denton, 1995) , are much less visible in the empirical literature and instead more prevalent in anecdotal accounts (Baruch et al., 2014) . Of course, metrics are easy to account for but mask the less tangible outcomes that also emanate from the faculty sabbatical, including that of learning and professional growth.",

Agency allows the faculty member to decide what kinds of learning are most meaningful to them, which at times may result in taking intellectual risks, or in deciding to choose life balance over their professional experiences (O'Meara et al. 2008) . Agency is particularly important when a faculty member engages in purposeful decision-making about the work they will take up in their careers, particularly in light of which kinds of work tend to be rewarded or diminished in the academy (Baez, 2000; Gonzales, 2014) .",

Faculty sabbatical experiences have received similar short shrift in the empirical literature focusing generally on quantifiable outcomes rather than less measurable outcomes. Therefore, I chose to utilize the framework of faculty professional growth as a way to best understand the less tangible outcomes of the faculty sabbatical through the lived experiences of faculty members at one institution during their sabbatical leaves, thereby addressing this gap in the literature about both faculty learning and the faculty sabbatical.",

For all of the faculty members, an initial agentic action as it concerned the sabbatical was the decision to take a half or a whole academic year for their leave. While much of this was dictated by finances -given that LGU pays full salary for one semester of leave and half salary for the entire academic year -a substantial part of this decision rested on the familial obligations or needs of the faculty member.

For Ashley, the sabbatical provided her with a chance \"to regroup, take care of myself. I put so much energy into my students. I just needed to give something back to myself.\" Claire echoed this sentiment, \"It allowed me to take some time for personal reflection and nurturing the life part of the work-life balance stuff, which I think was ultimately critical to my success.\" Three of the faculty members -George, Adia, and Julie -also shared that they used their sabbatical time to schedule surgeries, recover from health-related concerns, or even to battle cancer. George said, \"It was fortuitous that I was on leave to have this major surgery. There would have been no way that I could have handled my ordinary duties as a faculty person without the sabbatical.\" Nevertheless, some expressed a sense of guilt over the time they used for themselves -whether for physical or mental health.

The sabbatical provides the faculty member with a benefit of time, whether a semester or a full year (Kang & Miller, 1999; Miller et al., 2012) . Months with \"no distractions,\" a \"space to think,\" and \"the chance to focus,\" were all common refrains in the faculty members' interviews. The sabbatical provided this time and space to think deeply, engage fully, and -in the words of several participants -the opportunity to take risks, to fail, and to pivot to new topics and ideas. The reality well known by most faculty members is that concentrated learning requires time, which is perhaps \"the scarcest resource of all\" (O'Meara & Terosky, 2010, p. 48) . As such, without the concentrated time provided by the sabbatical, faculty members in this study would not have been able to produce scholarship, remain conversant in their discipline, and bring such benefits to their teaching. Agency and the sabbatical leave are also connected in that -perhaps for the first time in their professional academic careers -these faculty members were able to construct how they would use this time without the external structures of classes, meetings, and other academic-related responsibilities. Nevertheless, scholarly productivity was omnipresent in their recollections of their sabbatical leave, pointing to the constraining forces that academia inserts and that may not allow for true agency (Baez, 2000; Gonzales, 2013) and, for some in this study, resulted in feelings of guilt or even shame by pushing back against these constraining forces.",

Agency was again at work in these faculty members' sabbatical experiences as they chose to utilize their leaves to not only engage in the scholarly productivity expected of them but also to willingly provide time for themselves and their loved ones.

In other words, sabbatical leaves can be helpful tools for all kinds of faculty at all kinds of institutions to meet many of the institutions' coveted outcomes, including teaching effectiveness, research productivity, and community engagement.",

At the same time, being realistic about how much they could get done or should get done was important to balance with family time and rejuvenation. Over planning for the individual faculty member's sabbatical might result in feelings of guilt or anxiety, for example, that do not lend to any of the positive, personal outcomes that were mentioned in this study.",

Future research should consider how various differences make a difference in faculty members' sabbatical experiences. For example, gendered differences. While not a standout aspect of this study -indeed, more of the men faculty discussed how their sabbaticals provided for more opportunities to connect with family than did the women faculty -it is perhaps this \"out-of-theordinary\" role that these men were able to take on during their sabbatical that would provide fodder for future exploration. The participants in this study were predominantly white and mid-career at a research university, providing limited transferability of findings to more diverse institutional settings. Similarly, racial/ethnic differences as well as the intersecting identities of faculty members are worthy of further exploration in future studies of the sabbatical as it is clear that underrepresented faculty members experience less job satisfaction and more negative working environments than their white counterparts (Baez, 2000; Perna, 2001; Trower, 2009) .",
