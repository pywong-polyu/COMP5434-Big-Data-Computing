Email allowed specificity around delegation of tasks and that details such as pertinent history could be gathered. Template responses could be provided in a timely manner, meaning that all contacts received interim advice whilst more specific processes were being developed. However, in this very challenging and novel situation, it was imperative to re-establish a sustainable and effective telephonebased response as soon as possible. This was considered particularly pertinent where staff may be anxious or distressed and therefore find it more difficult to communicate or interpret email responses effectively. Therefore, the psychology & counselling team lead on the rapid implementation of a telephone support line for individuals without symptoms to access very brief emotional support, containment and signposting to emotional support and other advice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The telephone line was launched and advertised from 24 March 2020; 1 day after a nationwide 'lockdown' was announced in the UK.

Details of how to contact the support line were added to the Trust intranet page and communicated weekly through the trust daily COVID-19 updates sent by email to all staff. Managers were encouraged to print off information to share with staff unable to access email. The OHS department also had an automatic email response to anyone contacting the department containing guidance on how to access the support line. The support line was advertised as suitable for staff who felt affected by the current situation. It was made clear that this service was not suitable for symptomatic staff and that responders were unable to give specific advice on health-related medical concerns. These concerns were instead directed to email where medical and nursing resources were deployed to respond in a more systematic way. A recorded message indicated the scope of the service and re-directed staff with medical concerns to the appropriate route.

Concerns were expressed by front-line medical workers in regular proximity with the public and/or confirmed COVID-19 patients. However, those working in non-clinical roles also felt conflicted by attending work while the rest of the country was encouraged to self-isolate. Staff members were also concerned about the risk of working when they have a family member at home who they perceive to be vulnerable (5%). This indicates that a notable proportion of individuals who contacted the telephone line for support were those struggling due to concerns that themselves or a loved one were at risk. Staff also accessed the support line to discuss anxiety relating to the severity of their symptoms and concerns upon whether they are likely to spread the virus to others (7%). There was some confusion around processes of isolation and fear of social stigma upon return to work. Similarly, staff members expressed worry that they would be seen as not contributing to the team effort or seen as letting their patients and colleagues down by missing work (2%). Concerns around missing work also included fear of being reprimanded. Some calls featured discussion of more general mental health difficulties as staff members struggled to cope with changes triggered by the pandemic (4%). Others discussed how long-term mental health difficulties, such as anxiety and depression, had been exacerbated by COVID-19. The support line also received calls from staff members who were frustrated and/or confused by the changing guidance delivered by the trust (3%).

In addition, it considers the rapid deployment of non-medical capacity within an established multi disciplinary OHS team services. A strength of the use of thematic analysis is the provision of a flexible tool, allowing rich and detailed understanding of preliminary data [9] . Despite this, there remains an unavoidable level of bias from researchers when coding data which means that interpretation is limited beyond description of themes identified. A further limitation is that the population who were able to access this service was limited to staff members working in the North East of England as part of Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals. As the description of this service is based on calls from a specific group of staff, some caution should be taken in generalizing findings to healthcare workers across different localities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 391, "end": 394, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In an attempt to systematically manage the unprecedented demand of enquiries related to COVID-19, the implementation of a psychology-led telephone support line represented an efficient use of staff capacity in the early stages of the situation. The service could provide responsive communication and support to staff who may have been emotionally affected by COVID-19. As a best attempt at rapid response, the system had face validity to the OHS and wider trust team and informal positive feedback was received from managers. This could be considered to provide a valuable 'interim' service whilst other approaches were planned and implemented. Calls peaked during the first week of implementation and tapered off in the following weeks. Reduction in calls could be due to development of other resources including the NHS national line implemented on the 8 April 2020 and release of comprehensive guidelines for specific groups including advice from the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists, the British Heart Foundation and other medical charities. Increased capacity for OHS responsiveness to email queries over time also likely reduced staff member use of the support line. Further exploration of mechanisms is required before the reduction in demand could be interpreted fully; however, areas of interest include the development of improved guidance, the implementation of other services and resources, staff developing skills and confidence in novel situations and successful resolution of outstanding queries.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The results of the thematic analysis of calls did however indicate that despite attempts to be clear that the main role of the support line was for emotional support, the majority of calls were still related to symptoms, guidance and clarification of advice. In response to this, the psychology team developed a quick reference guide to help call handlers signpost staff to guidance resources, whilst reinforcing the importance of avoiding inadvertent 'clinical decision-making' during the calls. This pattern aligns with reports from Chen et al. [11] who implemented a telephone support line with the possibility of further psychological interventions. They report that staff early in the pandemic were resistant to this and were seeking more practical support (e.g. protective equipment, skills training, food, places to sleep). Although initial intentions for the emotional support line were not fully realized, staff utilized increased access to information and resources, which could be anticipated to have a positive effect where no other resource was available. This emphasizes the need for rapidly implemented systems to continually evaluate and be responsive to staff needs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 547, "end": 551, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Many enquiries related to clarification of guidance or advice that had already been provided. Brooks et al. [12] suggest that perceived 'poor' information from authorities can be experienced as a stressor leading to confusion about the most appropriate action to take. Whilst understandable, Mishel [13] identified that perceived uncertainty related to illness can influence psychological distress, and additional information seeking due to distress may place additional demand on services. When conceptualized as an additional stressor influencing emotional distress, the implementation of psychologically informed informational interventions may be increasingly pertinent. Indeed, an area of interest for preventative interventions going forward is the management of informational interventions and how these may mitigate or contribute to distress.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 108, "end": 112, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 299, "end": 303, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although calls related to guidance, symptoms and transactional concerns made up a large proportion of calls; 30% of calls were still directly related to selfidentified emotional distress in healthcare workers in the very early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK.

Our findings and initial informal feedback suggest that access to clear, timely information is useful to staff in a healthcare setting, whether this relates to practical and medical considerations or concerns related to well-being. Frustration can be experienced by staff when responses are subject to delay or where guidelines feel unclear and rapid interventions should evolve and change based on feedback and demand.
