Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test. The outcome of interest was hospitalization anytime within three days of a positive COVID test. The model was built using a development cohort (patients with COVID positive test resulted before May 1, 2020), and subsequently tested in a validation cohort (patients with COVID positive test resulted between May 1 and June 5, 2020). This allowed us to test the model's validity over time. A full multivariable logistic model was initially constructed to predict hospital admission with COVID-19 based on demographic variables, comorbidities, immunization history, symptoms, travel history, lab variables, and medications that were identified pre-admission. For modeling purposes, methods of missing value imputation for labs variables were compared using median values and using values from multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) via the R package mice. Restricted cubic splines with 3 knots were applied to continuous variables to relax the linearity assumption. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm was performed to retain the most predictive features. A 10-fold cross validation method was applied to find the regularization parameter lambda which gave the minimum mean cross-validated concordance index. Predictors with nonzero coefficients in the LASSO regression model were chosen for calculating predicted risk. The final model was internally validated by assessing the discrimination and calibration with 1000 bootstrap resamples. Discrimination was measured with the concordance index [14] . Calibration was assessed visually by plotting the nomogram predicted probabilities against the observed event proportions over a series of equally spaced values within the range of the predicted probabilities. The closer the calibration curve lies along the 45\u02daline, the better the calibration. A scaled Brier score, called the index of predictive accuracy (IPA) [15] , was also calculated, as this has some advantages over the more popular concordance index.
