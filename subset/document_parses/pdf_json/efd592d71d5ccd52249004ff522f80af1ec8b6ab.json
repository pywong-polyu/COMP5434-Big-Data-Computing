In the UK, the first full national lockdown commenced on 23 March 2020. 1 This included requiring people to stay at home except for essential reasons, closure of public venues and all non-essential businesses, and prohibition of public gatherings. The national lockdown, and other policies implemented in an attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus, led to changes in hospital and general practitioner care, and alterations in environmental and societal factors. Thus, air quality improved in many highly populated urban areas, 2 but reports of mental stress, domestic violence and child abuse increased. 3 ",

The rapidity of spread led to redeployment of healthcare staff and prioritised allocation of resources, such as personal protective equipment, to areas of greatest need. There have been eight previous reports evaluating preterm births in relation to the onset of the pandemic: seven describe a reduction [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and one no change. 13 The spontaneous onset of preterm labour is associated with a number of factors, including infection, systemic illness, severe stress and physical injury. From an epidemiological perspective, seasonal effects, socioeconomic factors and population characteristics also affect the preterm birth rate. 14 The pandemic might have additionally influenced rates of elective caesarean section, with and without medical indication, which are an iatrogenic cause of late preterm births, and a well-recognised cause of respiratory and other problems that lead to neonatal unit admission. 15 However, the incidence of births by elective caesarean section varies by population demographics, across healthcare systems and with time. Thus, for many reasons, identifying any causal determinants of preterm birth is problematic.",

Neonatal care in England and Wales is delivered in a networked operational model, with babies transferred to higher or lower designation neonatal units according to care needs. Data management procedures for the NNRD therefore include linking episodes of care across neonatal units to provide a complete, single record from admission to discharge for each baby.

We adopted an empirical Bayes approach to provide a post hoc measure of confidence, or relative strength in the estimate of the difference in rates. 21 For each measure and GA category, we held out the two 3-month periods for the COVID-19 difference (ie, the spring (April 2020-June 2020) and winter (December 2019-February 2020) periods). We then used the 14 corresponding pre-COVID-19 spring and winter 3-month periods to estimate the seven background spring-winter differences against which to assess the COVID-19 spring-winter difference. For the 14 pre-COVID-19 3-month periods, we identified posterior distributions over the binomial probabilities, approximating them with Gaussian distributions by moment matching and applying shrinkage assuming the individual 3-month rates are drawn from a common distribution. We then drew 10 000 independent samples from the 14 posterior distributions to yield a posterior distribution for each of the seven spring-winter differences. For the seven sets of 10 000 posterior samples, we evaluated the proportion that did not meet our criterion for 'highly unusual'. This provides an estimate of the probability (the p value) that the COVID-19 period was not 'highly unusual'. We used a 0.05 threshold as a measure of the strength of the evidence for this conclusion.",

However, we also found a highly unusual fall in extremely preterm admissions, those born below 28 weeks' gestation, a change that appeared confined to the two lowest IMD quintiles representing the most deprived groups. In both, the fall continued into the period July-September 2020. The absolute numbers of extremely preterm babies, even in a whole population dataset, are small, hence it is unsurprising that even though highly unusual, the fall did not meet our stringent statistical threshold. There have however been seven previous reports of a fall in preterm births during the immediate COVID-19 period, though all involved substantially smaller numbers than our study.

Philip et al compared births at a regional hospital in Ireland over 1 January-30 April 2020 with the same period of the preceding 19 years, identifying only three very and extremely low birthweight infants compared with a predicted number of eight. 7 However, Ireland implemented lockdown measures in early March, not in early January, weakening the inference of a temporal association. Been et al used a difference-inregression-discontinuity approach to study the impact on preterm births of COVID-19 mitigation measures introduced at three points in March 2020 in the Netherlands. They identified a statistically significant reduction only in moderate-to-late preterm births and only in relation to the first time point. 8 Hedermann et al compared the period 12 March-14 April 2020 with the average rate in Denmark over the previous 5 years. 9 They identified only 58 extremely preterm births over the 5-year period and noted extremely preterm births were significantly lower in 2020, but not very or moderate-to-late preterm births. They were unable to exclude the possibility of a corresponding rise in late abortions or stillbirths. Matheson et al studied births in three maternity hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, identifying 9 extremely preterm births over July-September 2020, compared with 20 during the same period in 2019. 10 Lemon et al describe a decrease in preterm births in a single US hospital limited to white women from more advantaged neighbourhoods. 11 Maeda et al studied records from 186 Japanese acute care hospitals noting a decrease in preterm births but the 95% CI for the adjusted incidence rate ratios included or were close to one (below 34 weeks' gestation: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.00; below 37 weeks: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.98) and the extent of population coverage is not known. 12 Handley et al noted no decrease in preterm births in two ",

All these studies compared a COVID-19 period with earlier periods. In such a direct comparison, there is an implicit assumption that COVID-19 is the only agent likely to have influenced the outcome. However, as we show, there have been marked fluctuations in outcomes over previous years. As the onset and duration of other influences are unknown, subsuming them into the residual error term of a model risks derived a flawed estimate. In contrast to these studies, we considered the differences between 3-month pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods and compared them with the corresponding 3-month differences over previous 7 years. By comparing differences, we are able to assess the strength of a change during the COVID-19 period taking other, unknown, influences into account. We acknowledge, however, that a limitation of our approach is that our measure of exceptionality may be too conservative, potentially hindering detection of a COVID-19 effect. We also acknowledge that we made no adjustment for multiple comparisons as our p values were used solely for evaluating the relative strength of evidence. Our approach is aligned with other Bayesian approaches 27 and our exploration of population-based data should be regarded more as a hypothesis-generating rather than a hypothesis-testing analysis.",

In the UK, all extremely preterm babies are admitted to an NHS neonatal unit, hence the fall likely reflects a genuine reduction in live births in this GA group. Though a small study from a single London hospital, employing a before and after approach, suggested stillbirths rose during the immediate COVID-19 period, 28 this is not supported by data from the Office for National Statistics. Our finding that the highly usual reduction in extremely preterm admissions during the immediate COVID-19 national lockdown occurred in the most deprived socioeconomic groups and was sustained into the following 3 months is intriguing. Globally, preterm birth rates are increasing, with a strong association with poverty, disadvantage and deprivation. 29 Attempts to lower the preterm birth rate have remained stubbornly resistant to a range of medical interventions over the years, from widespread use of tocolytics, bedrest, cervical cerclage, vaginal progesterone and enhanced surveillance. Thus, the possibility that non-healthcare-related interventions may be effective is important.",

Our findings should also provide impetus to study the effects on preterm births of public health interventions, such as improved air quality, reduced exposure to crowded environments, altered working during the second trimester of pregnancy, and their interactions with other trigger events, and with socioeconomic status and ethnicity. The reasons for the fall in admissions of more mature babies are more likely to be related to changes in clinical thresholds. Together with evidence of perturbations in care pathways, these findings justify consideration of preparedness and public messaging during national crises adding weight to calls for an official COVID-19 inquiry into UK government actions, 30 such as the recommendation to rely on the call service NHS111 for medical advice, 31 that has now been agreed but deferred until the spring of 2022. 32 Finally, the highly unusual rise in admissions of full-term black ethnicity babies, contrasted with a fall in all other ethnic groups, adds to the growing evidence of a disproportionately higher adverse impact on this demographic group and speaks to the moral imperative to address ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities urgently, as well as growing calls for investment in research to improve maternal and newborn health. 33 Twitter Neena Modi @NeenaModi1",
