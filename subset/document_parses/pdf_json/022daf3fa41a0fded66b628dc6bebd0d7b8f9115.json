For this purpose, we first estimated the conditional skewness of the return distribution from a GARCH with skewness (GARCH-S) model as the proxy for the equity market crash risk of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. We then constructed a fear index for COVID-19 using data from the Baidu Index. Based on the findings, conditional skewness reacts negatively to daily growth in total confirmed cases, indicating that the pandemic increases stock market crash risk. Moreover, the fear sentiment exacerbates such risk, especially with regard to the impact of COVID-19. In other words, when the fear sentiment is high, the stock market crash risk is more strongly affected by the pandemic. Our evidence is robust for the number of daily deaths and global cases.",

            "text": "Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant decline in stock market prices, which has placed unprecedented pressure on global financial markets. In this regard, existing studies have examined the impact of COVID-19 on either stock market returns or volatility, with some conclusions supported by empirical evidence (Baker et al., 2020; Al-Awadhi et al., 2020; Phan and Narayan, 2020; Ashraf, 2020; Kartal et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Sharif et al., 2020) . In addition, because of the co-movement in global stock markets (Dai et al., 2019; Wen et al., 2019a , 2019b , 2019c , Dai et al., 2020 , global equities have plummeted, followed by a spike in market volatility. In a related study, Baker et al. (2020) concluded that the level of market volatility (as of March 2020) could be equivalent to or even surpass previous crises, such as Black Monday (October 1987) , the Global Financial Crisis (December 2008), the Great Crash (1929) , and the Great Depression (the early 1930s). Schell et al. (2020) also emphasized that this time period is indeed different, implying that only COVID-19 exhibits negative returns from the Public Health Risk Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) announcements. Thus, motivated by the literature, the present study focuses on another pivotal downside risk during the pandemic: the stock market crash risk and investor sentiment in China. Notwithstanding the literature on infectious disease outbreaks and stock market performance, this study not only quantifies the stock market crash risk in the country but also investigates the role of investor sentiment via the Baidu Index and the number of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths. In doing so, this study sheds light on how COVID-19 proxies and investor behaviors may predict equity market crash risk at the onset of a future pandemic.",

Finally, we investigated the role of fear sentiment with regard to the impact of COVID-19 on stock market crash risk. More importantly, our findings carry several policy implications, including alleviating investor panic to mitigate equity market crash risk and offering a preventive measure related to the number of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths. Our findings may also provide policymakers with a deeper understanding of how to respond to and cope with investor pessimism about equity markets in a timely and comprehensive manner, especially during financial downturns.",

There is also a common trait that investors' risk preferences or moods toward certain events might vary considerably, leading to an increase in fear-induced sentiment (He et al., 2019; He, 2020; Liu et al., 2020a Liu et al., , 2020b Zhang et al., 2020b; Dai et al., 2021) . While previous disasters have occurred in specific regions of the world with partial disruptions, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted travel as well as economic transactions on a global scale. Hence, the effects of the pandemic on the overall economy will not only significantly influence domestic demand but will also limit supply, negatively impact firms' future cash flows, and foster public pessimism about the future.",

Interestingly, negative effects were more pronounced in specific industries such as the crude oil, real estate, entertainment, and hospitality sectors. Their study also confirmed the findings of Mishkin and White (2002) , who found that the equity market crash could result in a drop of 20%-25% in the United States (U.S.) equity index, compared to previous crises (e.g., World War I, World War II, etc.) due to the sequence of panic selling.

Addressing these questions will not only benefit practitioners by increasing caution over extreme market shocks but also increase the academic understanding of the empirical evidence. Based on the aforementioned arguments, our research questions are closely related to the literature on financial market reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have examined the effect of investor sentiment, especially fear sentiment, on systematic risk in emerging economies during the onset of COVID-19. Moreover, the majority of the research has only addressed the advanced markets (e.g., the U.S. or European markets), with few studies focusing on the phenomenon in emerging economies.

However, with regard to the skewness index (representing market crash risk), we observed a significant difference in the mean between the two periods. More precisely, the level of the market crash in 2020 was significantly higher than that in the previous period (t-stat = 2.50, \u03c1 = 0.01). Thus, H 1 was not rejected, implying higher extreme volatility in the Chinese equity market during the COVID-19 pandemic. Table 2 presents the estimation results of the GARCH-S model. As expected, there was the presence of significant conditional skewness. Specifically, the coefficient of lagged skewness was positive and significant (0.148 with t-statistic 58.079), indicating that skewness is persistent. In addition, the coefficient of the shock to skewness was positive and significant (0.036 with t-statistic 15.373), which is similar to the variance case. Overall, the majority of the coefficients were significant, implying the appropriateness of using the GARCH-S model to estimate the skewness of the market returns. Fig. 2 presents the trajectory of conditional skewness, from which we can visually observe that skewness is time-varying and clustering. In particular, a significant number of cases showed negative skewness, indicating that the crash risk at these points was high. In fact, the largest negative value of skewness (\u2212 0.76) occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak, i.e., on February 4, 2020.",

In this regard, we employed Model 4 to conduct our empirical analysis, the results of which are shown in Table 7 . Overall, the results were consistent with our previous findings. We also substituted the number of global cases for the number of cases in China for another robustness check, as the people in China not only focused on the progress of COVID-19 at the country level but also at the global level. Table 8 presents the empirical results of Model 5. Furthermore, we utilized global death cases to replace global confirmed cases in Model 5. As for Model 6, it comprises Equations (14), (15), and (16): Table 9 presents the empirical results of Model 6.

We also found that even when the number of confirmed cases is not significantly large, people's fears about the virus will increase stock market crash risk. Finally, we found that fear sentiment not only directly increases crash risk but may also boost the negative impact of COVID-19 on stock market crash risk.",

First, closer observation by lawmakers of the financial markets with regard to the dynamics of fear and the number of cases is necessary. In this regard, regulators should determine how to immediately and effectively support the market when fear is overwhelming. By doing so, market crash risk can be managed in extreme cases. Second, investors are not only likely to be sensitive to local information (i.e., Chinese domestic infected cases or deaths) but also to global news. Therefore, clear and timely communication regarding the COVID-19 pandemic could bring about effective prediction in the market. More importantly, both investors and regulators should be more cautious about stock market crash risk when the number of cases (or deaths) significantly increases. Then, hedging or safe haven strategies could be implemented, as suggested by previous research .",
