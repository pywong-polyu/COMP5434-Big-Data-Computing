            "text": "Learning burnout is a pressing issue among Chinese medical undergraduates and Postgraduates and has drawn continuous attention worldwide. Studies have found that problematic smartphone use could affect learning burnout, but more research is needed in this direction. Furthermore, few studies focused on the mediating effect of psychological capital on the relationship between problematic smartphone use and learning burnout. The present study was a cross-sectional survey that recruited 1,800 participants from a medical university in Chongqing, China. A questionnaire based on the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale, Psychological Capital Questionnaire, Learning Burnout Scale, and demographic variables were administered to these students, and 1,475 provided valid responses (81.94%). 771 were undergraduates (52.3%) and 704 were postgraduates (47.7%). Hierarchical regression and the bootstrap method were used to examine the mediating effect of psychological capital. After controlling for demographic variables, problematic smartphone use positively predicted learning burnout in undergraduates (\u03b2 = 0.328, p < 0.01) and in postgraduates (\u03b2 = 0.342, p < 0.01). The partial mediating effect of psychological capital was 0.068 in undergraduates and 0.074 in postgraduates, accounting for 20.67 and 21.64%, respectively, of the total effect of problematic smartphone use on learning burnout. All the 95% confidence intervals (CI) did not contain 0. Problematic smartphone use can directly predict learning burnout and their relationship was mediated by psychological capital in Chinese medical undergraduates and postgraduates. Strategies to alleviating problematic smartphone use and enhance psychological capital in medical undergraduates and postgraduates may provide useful suggestions for future interventions on dealing with learning burnout in Chinese medical undergraduates and postgraduates.",

China, the most populous country in the world, experienced a lack of doctors leading to a gap between health service demand and healthcare supply . The doctor-patient ratio was 2.77 doctors for 1,000 patients in 2020 in China (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2020), immensely lower than that in some developed countries (Wan et al., 2018) . Over the past 10 years, the attrition rate of medical graduates and physicians in China has been high (Lien et al., 2016) . Therefore, Chinese medical students have drawn continuous attention worldwide. Learning burnout is an urgent problem among Chinese medical students, with an incidence of about 50% (Jinghua et al., 2014 ) and a high-risk rate of up to 10% (Liu et al., 2018) .",

Learning burnout is a phenomenon that refers to energy depletion and negative attitudes toward learning (Zhang et al., 2007) . The enthusiasm for learning gradually fades away, and attitudes toward classmates become increasingly cold and alienated due to prolonged academic pressure . Learning burnout, also called student burnout or academic burnout syndrome, involves emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a low sense of achievement (Lin and Huang, 2012) . Studies have found that learning burnout strongly affects the academic performance (Fiorilli et al., 2017) , concentration (Xie et al., 2019) , and physical and mental health of medical students; for example; learning burnout is associated with sleep disorders, anxiety, depression (Njim et al., 2019) , loneliness, and interpersonal problems; and can even lead to suicide and withdrawal from school (Stockman, 2010) . Therefore, for future interventions, it is important to investigate the variables related to learning burnout.",

Psychological capital is related to the achievements and well-being of individuals (Marga\u00e7a et al., 2020) , and it can be exploited like social resources (Luthans et al., 2006) . Several studies have indicated that internet addiction is negatively correlated with psychological capital (Simsek and Sali, 2014) . Problematic smartphone use also belongs to addiction behaviors (Zou et al., 2017) , which also go against positive organizational behaviors and demonstrates performance. Study confirmed problematic smartphone use was positively associated with psychological factors, such as depression, anxiety, and loneliness (Darcin et al., 2015) , and also associated with poor mental health (Contractor et al., 2017) ; psychological capital has a theoretical intervention model (Luthans et al., 2005) , but mental health does not have, and mental health involves many factors, which is not conducive to follow-up targeted intervention aimed at learning burnout, so we assumed psychological capital rather than mental health as a mediating variable based on the exploitation of psychological capital. Mental health is positively correlated withpsychological capital. Therefore, students with problematic smartphone use are more likely to develop poor psychological capital. However, according to existing literatures, psychological capital may have an effect on learning burnout. Previous studies confirmed that psychological capital could affect performance (Luthans et al., 2005) and wellbeings (Avey et al., 2010) and reduces burnout (Ding et al., 2015) among employees, such as nurses and bank clerks (Li et al., 2015) . As positive psychological resources, psychological capital is highly likely to reduce burnout among Chinese medical students; also, poor psychological capital is highly likely to lead to bad academic performance, resulting learning burnout (Fiorilli et al., 2017) .",

Descriptive analysis was used to describe the demographic characteristics of the participants. Enumeration data were described as percentages. Normally distributed continuous data were described as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. A t-test or one-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences in learning burnout (depression, improper behavior, and low personal accomplishment) among groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the corrections among the research variables. Hierarchical regression was used to explore the mediating effect of psychological capital on the relationship between problematic smartphone use and learning burnout (Zimet et al., 1990; Yang et al., 2020) . The variance inflation factor (VIF) values were less than 10, and there was no multicollinearity in this study. In the hierarchical regression analysis, learning burnout and it's three dimensions were took as dependent variables, respectively; in step 1, variables in univariate analysis (p < 0.05) were entered, in other words, these variables where learning burnout and it's three dimensions were differences in t-test or oneway analysis were entered in step 1 to control their influences on the dependent variable, because our ultimate goal was to analyze the mediating effect of psychological capital; In step 2, the independent variable, problematic smartphone use, was entered, this step was to analyze it's impact, and also to control its impact on the dependent variable for the next step. In step 3, psychological capital was entered as a mediating variable, this step was to analyze the effect of psychological capital on the dependent variable. We also set psychological capital as the dependent variable to analyze the effect of problematic smartphone use on it; then, we calculated the mediating effect value. Bootstrap method was used to examine the significance of the mediating effect of psychological capital. We bootstrapped 5,000 samples from the data, and calculated the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (CI). If the CI did not contain 0, the mediating effect was considered significant . SPSS20.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis, and the level of statistical significance was two-tailed p < 0.05.",

In this study, 36.4% undergraduates and 27.6% undergraduates had a score higher than the mid-value (60), indicating that they had a high level of learning burnout. The objective of this study was to further investigate the relationship between problematic smartphone use and learning burnout, as well as the mediating effect of psychological capital in this relationship. Meanwhile, researches confirmed that psychological capital could be exploited like social resources (Luthans et al., 2006) , and everyone has psychological resources at various Un, undergraduates; Pos, postgraduates.*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. levels, which can be the basis for intervention on dealing with learning burnout among Chinese medical undergraduates and postgraduates in the future. This study found that learning burnout had significant differences between Chinese medical undergraduates and postgraduates, the level of undergraduates' learning burnout was higher that of postgraduates, consisting with previous studies (Erdogan et al., 2012) . A positive shift toward deep and strategic learning existed among postgraduates, which was not found among the undergraduates (Samarakoon et al., 2013) . Moreover, the psychological and academic stress of undergraduates was significantly higher than that among graduates (Liang et al., 2009) . Therefore, the undergraduates were more prone to learning burnout than the graduates. We analyzed undergraduate and postgraduate students separately because of their different psychosocial development stages.",

The results showed that problematic smartphone use of medical students was positively associated with their learning burnout (Bian et al., 2018) ; this result finds consonance in the literature. Problematic smartphone use indicates frequent usage and much time consumption (Liu et al., 2016) , indicating that students spent less time in studying, thus negatively affecting academic performance gradually. Many studies have also confirmed the negative impact of problematic smartphone use on academic performance Samaha and Hawi, 2016) ; academic performance is closely related to and can be considered an antecedent for learning burnout. Besides, studies have found that problematic smartphone use has a negative effect on people's physical and mental health, such as headache, ear pain (Gao et al., 2017) , sleep disorders (Liu et al., 2017) , and suicidal ideation (Wang et al., 2014) ; these problems can consume so much energy of students that they can't devote themselves to learning. Students who with problematic smartphone use are hard to disengage from smartphones quickly when stopping the use of it; thus, medical students cannot concentrate on their studies, resulting learning burnout. And the results of this study also showd psychological capital mediated this relationship; reasons might be found in the literature. The results are discussed as follows. Psychological capital includes four dimensions: selfefficacy, hope, optimism, and resilience (Luthans et al., 2007a) . Problematic smartphone use is identified as an impulse control disorder (Leung, 2008) ; it can make someone uncontrollably anxious and irritable because of the prolonged absence of the mobile phone (Ch\u00f3liz, 2010), which could affect their conviction (or self-confidence) in their ability to mobilize themselves. As such, self-efficacy is destroyed (Luthans et al., 2008) . Moreover, being addicted to mobile phones for prolonged periods can lead to mental health problems such as depression (Smetaniuk, 2014) ; this can have a negative impact on optimism and hope, which represent a \"positive motivational state (Snyder et al., 1991) .\" Resilience represents relative protection for an individual against environmental stresses (Cadet, 2016) . However, poor mental health such as depression and anxiety can be detrimental to resilience. Previous studies have shown that addiction behavior has an impact on resilience (Mak et al., 2018) . Whereas resilience can protect one from Internet addiction (Robertson et al., 2018) , self-efficacy may allow individuals to control themselves better (Luthans et al., 2008) , and optimism and resilience are related to perseverance (Luthans et al., 2008) . These positive psychological traits can lead to better self-control and prevent addiction behavior. In this study, problematic smartphone use of medical students had a negative impact on their psychological capital, but psychological capital worked as a protective factor against problematic smartphone use. Previous studies show that self-efficacy can compensate for increased learning burnout (Maricutoiu and Sulea, 2019) . Students who had sufficient conviction and abilities to mobilize themselves would decrease improper behavior; resilience was associated with lower levels of learning burnout and emotional exhaustion (Rios-Risquez et al., 2016) . Hope and self-efficacy may promote academic achievement (Feldman and Kubota, 2015) , which is highly negatively correlated with learning burnout. Studies have also confirmed that psychological capital has a strong effect on burnout (Leon-Perez et al., 2016; Gong et al., 2019) . This study demonstrated that psychological capital can mediate the relationship between problematic smartphone use and learning burnout, which is highly consistent with studies mentioned above. The results may have important implications in professional practice. Interventions for learning burnout can possibly conducted by exploiting the psychological capital of medical students in the future.",

Further research, such as cohort studies and intervention trials, is needed to increase its reliability. The researchers intend to elaborate further on the current findings in future research, for example, an intervention trial of learning burnout among medical students can be conducted by improving psychological capital. Second, the participants in this study were recruited from one city. This sample does not represent all medical students in China. However, Chongqing is known as a \"miniature of China (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2019), \" and this is the only medical university in Chongqing. Future research is needed to show if these inferences can be applied to the medical students in other parts of China. Additionally, despite this study having a large sample covering almost all majors, the convenience cluster sampling method may have caused a selection bias and the external validation was not good enough. Third, the accuracy of self-reports is of concern and more measures must be taken to improve it in the future.",
