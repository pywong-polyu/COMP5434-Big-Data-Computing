            "text": "Concerning the third aspect, more than 70% of all causes mentioned in the medical certificate in the three capitals concentrated on five conditions classified as the chain of events and six as contributing causes. As conditions that describe the chain of events that led to death by COVID-19, different respiratory complications were often mentioned as SARS, unspecified pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure. Nevertheless, the high proportion of sepsis concerns and the mention of nosocomial conditions (Y95) may be associated with the quality of the health attention in-hospital during the pandemic. An analysis of this question goes beyond the objectives of this study. This finding suggests further new studies on sepsis, such as the trend (23) and association with other causes of death through more specific multiple cause of death analysis.",

Our study also observed that the most frequent contributing conditions are hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and complications related to kidney diseases. Our results were consistent with other studies about COVID-19 associated outcomes (18) . Nevertheless, it is important to note that deaths from COVID-19 are closely related to the presence of chronic conditions for the old ages (26-28). In contrast, in adults under 50, this situation is less common (19) .",

Nevertheless, this average varied according to age, place of death, and capital. For the first characteristic, we observe that the mean number of conditions increases with age. From 2.48 mentions (IC 95%: 2.30-2.66) on average for the age group 30-39 to 3.16 mentions (IC 95%: 3.08-3.24) for 60-69. Deaths that occurred inside a hospital or health center present a higher number of conditions mentioned on average than deaths that occurred elsewhere (3.07 vs. 2.53). Belo Horizonte presents a higher number of conditions mentioned on average than the other two capitals. In Belo Horizonte, the mean number of conditions mentioned was 3.39",
