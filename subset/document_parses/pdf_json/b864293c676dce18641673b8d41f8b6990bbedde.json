            "text": "The Human Capital Index for Africa puts the region at 40 percent of its potential, with a projected growth in GDP if goals for health and education are achieved [12] . The most important phase for human capital development is the first 8000 days of life [42] . Africa's growing youth population and high prevalence of early childbearing [43] highlight the urgent need for strategies such as SFPs for improved nutrition throughout adolescence. Although average fish consumption across Africa is lower than the global average (almost 10 kg/capita/year in comparison to 20.5 kg/capita/year), it accounts for a much greater percentage of animal protein in diets in Africa, as it is often the most consumed animalsource food. Official statistics from the FAO show that fish accounts for more than 50% of ASF in the diets of coastal populations in countries such as Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mozambique, Cameroon, and Ghana (with other studies evidencing as high as 80%) [44, 45] . In countries with inland water bodies such as Zambia, Malawi, and Uganda, fish accounts for 30-40% of dietary animal protein (these figures are based on apparent consumption, which is not equal to actual dietary intake) [45] . These figures demonstrate that fish, and particularly small fish, which are often dried and consumed whole [9] , are the most accessible ASF, particularly for poor communities in SSA. Projections for 2030 show that per capita fish consumption will increase in all regions except Africa due to a rising population, contrasted by the slow development of aquaculture on the continent [46] . However, there is much evidence that catches from African inland fisheries are underreported and underestimated, and there is potential to increase consumption of freshwater fish if direct human consumption is prioritized [47] .",

When SFPs source foods locally from smallholder farmers, it is called home-grown school feeding (HGSF) [48] . HGSF can be seen as a channel to stimulate local economies and livelihoods by providing a market and regular source of income for small-scale food producers, while also ensuring that a variety of fresh and nutritious foods are included in school menus [31] , thus contributing to an accelerating progress towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) such as zero hunger (SDG 2) and poverty eradication (SDG 1). Depending on the objectives and implementation models, HGSF can also contribute to other SDGs in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including SDGs 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, 15 , and 17 [49] . The integration of fresh or perishable foods, such as fish, in SFPs and HGSF are often disregarded based on logistic or hygienic concerns such as processing, preservation, and storage. These concerns prevail despite the current practice in SSA of fish supply chains reflecting that the majority of fish (particularly the more affordable small fish) are distributed and consumed in dried or smoked form [9, 50] .",

Increasingly, low-and lower-middle-income countries commit to implementing HGSF programs with the aim of stimulating local food production, markets, and economies while incorporating locally produced foods into the diets of school children [31] . Rigorous trials have demonstrated both the economic and non-economic benefits from SFPs and HGSF, although the cost-per-meal and funding varies [12] . In most middle-income countries, national budgets support school feeding programs, whereas investments and support are still needed in low-income countries, where the cost of the meal, although relatively low, may represent a larger proportion of education costs [12] . Recognizing the need to enhance child nutrition and support local producers, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), now African Union Development Agency-NEPAD (AUDA-NEPAD), recently made HGSF one of their flagship programs under the food and nutrition security program [51] . Despite the good intentions of these commitments, these programs may be chronically underfinanced and there is little known evidence of the inclusion of locally procured fish in SFPs.",

A sustainable food system has to be equitable and inclusive, ensuring the production, processing, and distribution of good quality, safe, acceptable, and affordable food, reducing food loss and waste, and that food system actors earn enough money to live free from poverty, both now and in the future [53, 54] . The food system provides many entry points for HGSF and, at the same time, can strengthen food systems in supporting smallscale producers and organizations through a stable demand for locally procured products, improved food safety and quality, and the provision of social protection to vulnerable populations [48] .",

The literature search was conducted by the lead author between May and August 2020, and the search was replicated in May-June 2021 to validate initial results and assess if any additional literature qualified for inclusion prior to submisssion for publication. Figure 1 displays the search strategy, eligibility criteria, number of articles included and excluded, and the process of consultation with informants from key institutions involved in school feeding and fisheries, such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the WorldFish Center. Search terms were initially used in the English language; however, key informants noted that examples of SFPs in Africa may be described in other languages including French or Portuguese. No limitation on the publication date of studies was included, as a key informant informed the lead author that fish protein concentrate (FPC) was used in SFPs since the 1950s; however, few documents from before the 1970s were publicly accessible through search engines. The results in this review include evidence from SFPs in SSA, and are not intended to be an in-depth systematic review but rather to provide a broad summary of available evidence from journal articles and grey literature, such as impact evaluations and program reports and summaries of SFPs including fish and fish products. The results present the various challenges and opportunities of implementing SFPs and particularly HGSF programs within the food systems framework ( Figure 2 ). The discussion attempts to further analyze challenges and opportunities to replicate and scale the best practices for the inclusion of fish in SFPs, looking at food production; food handling, storage and processing; food trade and marketing; consumer demand, food preparation and preferences, and broader impacts (social, environmental, and economic), as well as the various drivers that influence the food system.

Table 1 summarizes the evidence of SFPs including fish, and Appendix B gives more detail about the source and form of fish included in each study. SFPs included in this review were financed through various mechanisms-some were fully implemented by the national government, some were implemented through collaboration between WFP, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the national government, and others were financed or co-financed by parents and community donations of money, food, or other necessary items (fuel wood, etc.). Seventeen (n = 17) records stated that fish was sourced from small-scale producers (fisheries or aquaculture). The degree of focus on fish within each record varied, from only one mention of fish in the SFP menu to the specific focus on the development, testing, and supply-side interventions for ensuring a sustainable supply of acceptable and safe fish products for SFPs.

The same study recommended several strategies, including raising awareness about objectives, reinforcing accountability, and allowing for different types of contributions (money, goods, or services) from stakeholders (government, parents, sponsors) to support HGSF programs and ensure continuous supply from local producers [63] .

The infrastructure, technologies, and methods for processing vary across communities, but the most common product in the SSA region are dried or smoked fish. The dehydration of fish enhances the nutrient density, enables longer storage life and eases the transportation of fish and fish products across greater distances. Few studies noted that schools lacked infrastructure and equipment for fish preservation, and one study noted that workload of school cooks increased in school canteens due to increased processing or preparation of fish [63] . Few studies included fish protein concentrate (a bland-tasting powder produced from fish, involving a step of extraction, with higher concentrations of protein than the raw material) [109] , fish powder (powder produced from grinding whole fish) [70] [71] [72] 101] , or tuna frame powder (powder produced from grinding bones or frames of larger fish) [66, 67] . Most of these studies utilized hammer mills to grind whole small fish or fish by-products such as tuna frames into powder; however, in all three examples, the fish processing was completed in pilot plants connected to research laboratories [66, 67, 106] .",

Four records indicated that the cost of school meals including fish (and other ASFs) was as a challenge [63, 73, 88, 105] , two of which noted that fish is either supplied in canned form or through aquaculture [73, 88] , while a key informant informed the author that fish fillets were used in the third study (in Cabo Verde) [63] . In Cabo Verde, the inclusion of fish in school meals raised the cost by 20%, although it is not noted how this has impacted consistent feeding of children or inclusion of fish. In Togo, local groups of women responsible for cooking (\"femmes-mamans\") were allotted an amount of USD 0.31 per child, which was noted as insufficient to afford adequate amounts of meat or fish, as cost varied due to several factors including distance to food markets, seasonal price variations, and regional fluctuations in food prices [105] . A lack of monitoring of school meals meeting minimum standards was linked to reported differences in meal composition, as some groups of women were found to reduce amount per serving of the more expensive ingredients (often meat or fish) and served larger portions of staple foods to increase their profits [105] .",

Four local dishes were prepared and assessed by school children for their acceptability based on a hedonic scale-with particularly high scores for anchovies and okra stew, rice with tuna frame powder stew, and rice with flying gurnard stew.

National HGSF programs, such as that of Brazil's, require a certain percentage of food for school meals to be sourced from local producers [48] ; however, these requirements apply to the full basket of foods and not to a percentage of each type of food, thus often resulting in vegetables or other foods purchased from local producers while fish may be sourced in canned form or from imports or donations [97] . As noted in one study [75] , caterers sometimes sourced canned fish instead of locally produced fish products due to cost, posing another challenge, as small-scale fisherfolk may be unable to compete with cheap imported or donated canned fish products. The use of fish products processed from by-products is advantageous for the government, as noted in a case from Brazil, where procurement costs reduced and processors increase yield while reducing waste [111] . In Odisha state, India, farming of small, nutritious fish species is encouraged to ensure a regular supply of fish to SFPs [112] .",

However, considerations for fish handling, storage, and technologies to efficiently process these products, ensuring food safety and consistent supply and access to safe raw materials, are of the utmost importance. Fish by-products, traditionally thrown away, used for livestock, aquaculture or pet feed, fur production or as silage, are regaining attention for human consumption, as they represent a significant source of nutrition while also offering an opportunity to reduce food loss and waste [46, 115] . Fish by-products include the head, viscera, skin, bones, and scales, accounting for approximately half of the fish (but a much greater percentage of micronutrients), thus allowing for twice as many servings per whole fish utilized in SFPs. Many fish species-particularly small fish-are already commonly consumed whole (with head, viscera, skin, and bones) in dried or smoked form in SSA countries [50] . Whole small fish and fish by-products can be processed into fish products, such as fish powder, and incorporated or 'hidden' in traditional dishes and snacks. A recent study of small fish species common in Ghana [44] complements studies cited in this review [66, 67] to show the high nutrient content of small indigenous fish species.",

Simultaneously, strengthening the capacity of local supply chains and fisheries organizations to sustainably supply safe fish products for SFPs is necessary, and good practices such as supporting small-scale fishers in Cabo Verde (Box 1, [63] ) have the potential for scaling. Innovations in technology and infrastructure can help drive the transformation of food systems, particularly in areas that have poor infrastructure and lack cold chain technologies, as addressed in two studies mentioned in this review [58, 96] . The majority of fish in Africa are dried and/or smoked in their whole form, using small-scale infrastructure for sun-drying, salting, or smoking the fish [50] . FPC and fish powder are shelf-stable products that can be stored for up to two years in ideal conditions (or three months in local storage regimes), with no need for refrigeration-a great advantage in remote areas without electricity [122, 123] .

In some of the studies mentioned, processed fish products were highly acceptable; however, there is a need to consider access to equipment and the empowering of small-scale producers, particularly women, as they are more involved in the post-harvest sector of fisheries value chains [46, 50] . Small-scale processors may or may not have access to hammer mills which can be used to grind fish (as well as other technologies for drying, smoking, etc.), thus reducing efficiency, compromising the quality of fish products, and increasing time constraints. Hammer mills have been tested in other studies for producing fish powder at the household and community level and have been proven to reduce the time burden for women and food loss when compared to traditional methods, such as mortar and pestle [124] . Ensuring that fish processors have adequate equipment for not only processing but also for transportation is essential, as fish and fish by-products are highly perishable and timely collection is crucial for processing [46] . However, no studies in this review have addressed issues related to transportation and distribution along the supply chains of fish products for SFPs. Building organizational capacity through technical and entrepreneurial training, while also ensuring sustainable sources of funding for small-scale fishing and aquaculture organizations, as well as fish processors' organizations is integral to ensure a sufficient and consistent supply of safe and good quality fish products for SFPs.",

Trends and the seasonality of fish availability are an important consideration when planning HGSF [48] , and can vary depending on available fish stocks or seasonality. Fish stocks at higher trophic levels may be less available due to overfishing, while pelagic small fishes such as anchovy and sardine are fished below biologically sustainable levels [46, 125] . Pelagic small fish species have higher productivity per unit of biomass than species at higher trophic levels, offering huge potential for a sustainable supply of fish for consumption in SFPs and more broadly [126] ; however, they are highly susceptible to climatic changes [46] .",

Wild small fish are more often produced and traded in low-income countries [129] , and while the growth of fish exports from the Global South contributes to an increasing national GDP, it is also criticized for undermining food and nutrition security in developing countries [130, 131] . For example, a recent study indicated that some developing countries' wild catch would be enough to ameliorate micronutrient deficiencies if it was kept for domestic consumption rather than exported [132] . There is no single \"answer\" to whether small fish should be prioritized for human consumption, as it is necessary to consider the interests of people depending on pelagic fisheries for food and livelihoods, availability, accessibility, and consumer preferences for small fish and other foods [133, 134] . To increase access to and desirability of nutritious small fish, there is a need to develop innovative, affordable products from small fish which are easily conserved and accessible to the poor and nutritionally vulnerable [133, 134] . The promotion of small fish, by-products, and diverse aquatic foods for human consumption through social protection schemes such as SFPs, can increase food systems resilience [135, 136] , positively impact ecosystem resilience [125, 137] , and reduce inequalities in food and nutrition security for those most vulnerable.",

The list of countries identified may not include all countries in SSA which include fish in their school feeding programs, as the authors were limited by literature that was easily accessible through search terms and by knowledge from key informants on which countries may include fish in their school feeding menus. Further research is needed to explore solutions for identified challenges as well as unexplored food system entry points for the inclusion of fish in SFPs and HGSF. A lack of information on the source of fish included in SFPs and HGSF was apparent in this study, highlighting the need for further investigation into the source of fish in order to gain a better understanding of who benefits from SFPs and how SFPs can shift towards HGSF programs and ensure that the benefits of public procurement are distributed more equitably within local communities. Although there are positive examples from some countries of preferred fish species and acceptance of products made from underutilized species and by-products, this research should be context-specific and adapted to local situations. In addition, training for the development, sensory evaluation, nutrient and contaminant analysis of safe and acceptable fish products, alongside studies assessing the availability and cost of raw materials for SFPs (for example, by using the Fill the Nutrient Gap analysis [138] ) is needed in order to expand and scale the use of fish in SFPs.",

A first step in this process is increasing the recognition and understanding of the nutrient composition of fish extending beyond protein, but for their important contribution to the intake of essential micronutrients and fatty acids. Coupling SFPs with the promotion, information sharing, and awareness raising of the importance of fish in children's diets is evidenced as a good practice to ensure healthy eating habits for children at school and at home. Regular monitoring of the quantity and quality of fish in school meals can ensure that meal composition and food safety are assured, and defining a minimum percentage of different food items such as fish to be procured from local producers can ensure an equitable distribution of the benefits of HGSF programs for local producers from various sectors. Lastly, product development, sensory evaluation, nutrient and contaminant analysis, and the promotion of nutritional benefits of consumption of fish products produced from underutilized fish-such as pelagic small species-or fisheries by-products can be a cost-effective solution to extend the available supply of fish to feed more students while also reducing food loss, diversifying school menus, and building resilience in the food system.",
