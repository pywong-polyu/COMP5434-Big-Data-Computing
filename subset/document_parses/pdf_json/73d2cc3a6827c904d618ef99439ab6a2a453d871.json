The majority of oral medicine specialists work in academic settings in urban areas making it challenging for patients living in rural areas to easily access oral medicine services (e.g., dental schools or academic medical centers) [17] . A study from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA showed that patients traveled a median distance of 18.9 miles (range 0.2-525) to see an oral medicine specialist, with over 85% living within 60 miles away from the oral medicine clinic [17] . Similarly, another study conducted at the University of Alberta, Canada showed that the average distance traveled by patients to access the oral medicine clinic was 55.5 km (34.5 miles) and the average wait time for the patients to be seen was 105.5 days [18] . In our study, patients would have traveled a median distance of 65 miles (range: 0.9-100) if they had been seen in person. Since traveling long distances may result in increased costs to patients, Telemedicine offers a unique opportunity for patients who otherwise do not have an oral medicine specialist in the vicinity.",
