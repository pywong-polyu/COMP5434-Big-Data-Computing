In the big data era, decisions concerning the implementation of quarantines and travel restrictions are still being taken based on incomplete public health data, despite the myriad of information our society provides in real time, such as mobility data, commuting network structures, and financial patterns, to name a few. To advance towards an effective data-driven, quantitative policy making, we propose a computational framework where a predictive epidemiological model is fitted by feeding both public health and Google mobility data. The resulting model is then used as a basis for designing mobility reduction strategies which are optimised taking into account both the healthcare system capacity, and the economic impact of an extended lockdown. For the COVID-19 pandemic in England and France, we show that it is possible to design lockdown policies allowing a partial return to workplaces and schools, while maintaining the epidemic under control.

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has put quantitative decision-making methods (and the lack thereof) in the spotlight. Designing informed non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies (NPIS) to mitigate the pandemic effects has been a controversial issue worldwide. In particular, the planning of effective lockdown policies and their posterior lifting based on real-time data still remains a largely open problem. A vast amount of research efforts has been dedicated to model the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on the various aspects of the system dynamics, such as estimating the value of the basic reproductive number [1, 2] , evaluating the effect of containment measures and travel restrictions [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , assessing the effect of age on the transmission and severity of the disease [1, 7] and estimating the impact on Health Services [8] . It is remarkably hard, if not impossible, to capture every aspect of this complex phenomenon in an integrated and computationally tractable mathematical model. With this in mind, our goal in the present work is to study the dynamics of COVID-19 spread by integrating a dynamical epidemiological model with mobile phone data from the population. Such an adjusted model yields an accurate account of the real displacement of the population between different locations (e.g. workplaces, schools, etc.) during the pandemic, and serves as the basis for determining lockdown and exit strategies which are optimised according to public health and socio-economic constraints. We would like to stress here that, in order to define the model dynamics, we have considered some assumptions (on the contact matrices, the connection between mobility data and contacts, the initialisation of the compartments and the definition of the cost functional) which may not be easily tested in real a life scenario.",

Given the current knowledge of the COVID-19 disease, this constitutes a complete description of the possible states. Among the works based on the aforementioned state space representation, [5] , one of the main inspirations behind our work, uses an age-structured model to quantify the effect of control measures imposed in Wuhan, China and concludes that there exists a large potential on the use of NPIS for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the authors recommend a gradual relaxation strategy in comparison to an early lifting of the imposed lockdown measures to avoid possible second and third waves of the pandemic. Using a stochastic modification of a compartmental model without age structure, [2] reaches similar conclusions and quantifies the effectiveness of lockdown measures by estimating the reproduction number, which decreased from a median value of 2.35 before travel restrictions were imposed, to 1.05 one week after the implementation of travel restrictions.",

The authors consider a threshold-based sanitary cost functional aiming at releasing the largest possible population without exceeding the availability of hospital beds, and their conclusion is to favour the second strategy. [12] consider multiple control levers, such as the number of tests (both virologic and anti-body tests) and the increase of ICU beds in addition to the reduction of social contacts, and uses a cost functional involving both economic and sanitary costs. The authors suggest an optimal lockdown policy which involves a quick and strong isolation, followed by a large increase in the number of tests.",

Hence, they cannot be directly applied to populations with different spatio-temporal patterns. In contrast, the main goal of this paper is to propose a framework which calibrates the model using epidemiological and real-time mobility data from a specific population, measured by Google Mobility through Android devices, and computes an optimal lockdown strategy for that population at any point of the pandemic. To achieve this, we combine parameter estimation for an epidemiological model with a subsequent optimal control step. Secondly, our framework includes the computation of the optimal lockdown policy in a nonlinear model predictive control framework, leading to a robust feedback protocol which allows not only real-time adaptation of the release strategy but also a partial lockdown, as opposed to a switching on/off strategy which can be too restrictive.",

Further, exploiting Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) [13] , we calibrate this model using data on daily deaths and the number of people in hospitals with COVID-19 released from public health authorities (Public Health England (PHE) and the National Health Service (NHS) in England, and Sant\u00e9 publique France (SpF) in France) [14] [15] [16] [17] . In ABC, we assume a prior distribution for each parameter value and, given a dataset with an inherent observation noise, we obtain a nonparametric estimate of the joint probability distribution of the parameter values. This allows us to estimate parameters of our model for the specific cases of England and France, as opposed to inheriting parameters from epidemiological models from other countries. Some key attributes of our model are the inclusion of age-dependent transition probabilities between the different compartments which are also estimated from data, as well as age-dependent social distancing, and the use of Google mobility data to quantify the effect of social distancing measures in reality. Having calibrated our model, we design a lockdown strategy which is differentiated according to social contact categories including schools, work, and others. This allows us to assign a different economic penalty for each one of them. Borrowing a leaf from optimal control theory, we synthesize an optimised lockdown and exit strategy which minimizes the number of COVID-19-related casualties in the population, but also takes into account economic constraints. In order to perform this task, we quantify the relation between the decrease in social contacts with the reduction in the population mobility and optimise with respect to the latter, which is an effectively measurable quantity compared to an abstract decrease in social contacts. A methodological summary is depicted in Fig 1, illustrating the interaction among the different building blocks of our approach. It is important to note that the proposed methodology transcends the design of lockdown strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be applied for more general epidemiological models, different datasets, and a variety of control objectives. What is fundamental in our approach is the existence of a dynamical model, the assimilation of data for the optimal estimation of model parameters and uncertainties, and the optimization of an external input action to control the system towards a desired state. Flow diagram of the data-driven approach for the synthesis of optimal lockdown policies. The initial step consists of a policy maker defining a performance measure based on sanitary and economic objectives, and a modeller selecting a consistent generic epidemiological model. Then, public healthcare/mobility data is used in conjunction with Approximate Bayesian Computation to calibrate the dynamical model and determine the degree of uncertainty in the model parameters. This assists the formulation of an optimal control problem where the original sanitary + economic performance measure is optimized constrained to the calibrated epidemiological model. An optimal lockdown policy is then computed via global optimization techniques, and the final output is an optimal lockdown policy. The optimised lockdown is then applied and its real-time effects can be sensed through public data, which fed back into the learning and optimization framework for re-computation and update.",

Afterwards, some of them will recover (R) and others will need clinical help (I C ); we model this by splitting I SC into two categories: the ones recovering straightaway (I SC2 ) and the ones in need of clinical care (I SC1 ). The split happens with an age-dependent probability \u03c1 i . After some time, people in I SC1 will go to hospital, therefore moving to the I C state; similarly as before, the latter state is split in two categories according to the final outcome: the ones in I C1 will decease (D) after some time, while the ones in I SC2 will recover (R).

The mobility data obtained after the aggregation and smoothing operations described above is presented in the right panel of In order to connect the reduction in mobility to the reduction in the number of contacts, we proceed in the following way: first we assume that the number of residential contacts stays constant; in fact, we expect the behavior of people at home not to differ too much with respect to what it was prior to the introduction of lockdown measures; for our model, this amounts to fixing a home i \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1; 8t; 8i. With regards to the remaining contributions to the total number of contacts, we expect data on mobility reduction to be representative of the subset of the population which mostly uses smartphones, which is likely to be younger than 60 years old. Moreover, a large part of the population older than 60 years old does not take part in work or school In the raw mobility data, which is scaled with respect to a baseline value representing average mobility in the months prior to the pandemics, a strong weekly seasonality is present, which we mostly removed using a Savitzky-Golay filter. Moreover, we note that the mobility towards \"residential\" (which is not used in our analysis) locations is larger during the lockdown months than before, as people spend more time in their homes. Finally, we note the very large increase in people's mobility towards parks around the end of the winter season.

ABC is suitable for the considered task as it relies only on simulations from the model, and works by looking for values of parameters such that the integrated dynamics is close to the observed one. In this way, it provides the user with samples from an approximate posterior distribution of the parameters given observed data (\u03c0 ABC (\u03b8|x obs )). The better the match between the simulation and the observation, the better is the approximation of the true posterior \u03c0(\u03b8|x obs ). However, this comes at higher computational cost, so that the level of approximation needs to be balanced with computational considerations. We discuss additional Flow diagram of the data-driven optimal control approach. Starting from a generic-type SEIRD model, we learn optimal model parameters based on mobility/healthcare datasets and Approximate Bayesian Computation. The output is a posterior distribution of model parameters, which is used to generate calibrated SEIRD dynamics and a cost functional accounting both for sanitary and economic costs of a lockdkown. These two ingredients determine the formulation of an optimal control problem, which is solved by means of a global optimization algorithm. The final output of our approach is an optimal lockdown policy which can be recalibrated as new data is fed into the system. ",

For France, numbers reach higher values; however, we keep the same value of H max = 10000, in order to penalize a large number of infected people in the same way across the two countries, and to have comparable values in the optimization strategy. As a final measure of the sanitary cost, we introduce a final time cost, where we penalise the basic reproduction number (R) at the end of the optimisation horizon R\u00f0t 0 \u00fe T h \u00de (details about R number for our model can be found in Section 1 of S1 Appendix). This terminal penalty ensures that the control strategy does not simply output an optimal solution which switches off the reduction on mobility towards the end of the optimisation horizon. While such a solution is consistent with the optimal control design and is an interesting instance of the turnpike phenomenon [31] , it is not suitable in our context. Finally, to account for the economic cost of lockdown, we penalise the mobility reduction by introducing a quadratic cost of the form k1 \u2212 m loc (t)k 2 , for loc 2 {school, other, work}.",

We hide the explicit dependence for notational convenience. The cost is computed by taking an expectation over the posterior distribution for the parameters, since each parameter value will lead to a different realisation of the dynamics. Due to the nonlinearity of the system, this is clearly not the same as minimizing the objective using the posterior mean of the parameters only. In practice, we use 50 i.i.d. samples from the posterior distribution and approximate the expectation with an average over the trajectories obtained with those parameter values. Minimizing an expected cost in this way is much more computationally expensive than a cost computed on a point estimate of the parameters (for instance the posterior mean).

As the values of \u03b1 are between 0 and 1, a reasonable assumption is to expect the m loc to be in the interval As can be seen from Eq (13), the controls m loc , loc 2 {school, work, others} are time-dependent, and they are computed by minimising the cost functional (13) subject to the state constraints (1)- (8) . Ideally, the numerical realization of the optimal control strategy would be driven by the calculation of first-order optimality conditions and a reduced gradient approach to minimise J \u00f0m\u00de. However, the nonlinearities in the dynamics and in the terminal penalty, where the reproduction rate is expressed as an eigenvalue of a parameter-dependent matrix, make our problem highly non-convex. Moreover, the penalty F(I C ) is non-differentiable. For the purposes of this paper we will compute the optimal control by using generalized simulated annealing (or dual annealing) [32] . The use of meta-heuristics for the solution of large-scale nonlinear optimal control problems has been assessed in [33, 34] . We embed the solution of the optimal control problem (13) in a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework [35] . To this end, we select a prediction horizon T opt , and optimise the control variables m loc (t), t 2 [t 0 , t 0 + T opt ] using the current state at t 0 as our initial condition. From the optimal control sequence we recover the optimal action for a single day, that is m loc (t), t 2 [t 0 , t 0 + 1] and evolve the dynamics for the same amount of time, and repeat the optimisation procedure in the updated time frame [t 0 + 1, t 0 + 1 + T opt ]. This process is then repeated until the complete optimisation interval [t 0 , t 0 + T h ] is covered. The NMPC methodology recovers a robust optimal control law in feedback form that can be adjusted to account for disturbances in the control loop. Therefore, instead of using the current state predicted by the model as initial condition, we can update this to be the current state of the population in the considered country estimated from data, every time new data becomes available. This ensures that the control methodology accounts for noisy observations, or for unexpected variations in the data.",

For small prediction horizons, the optimal action tends to be instantaneous and loses its capability to foresee long-term consequences of the policy. On the other hand, a sufficiently long prediction horizon will enforce a stabilizing control law, but its numerical realization becomes increasingly complex. Therefore, at the core of the selection of a suitable prediction horizon there is a trade-off between short-sightedness, stabilization capabilities of the policy, and computability. This is exemplified in Fig 7, where we illustrate the role that is played by the prediction horizon in the performance of the control loop for a fixed value of \ufffd loc , for loc 2 {school, work, others}. It can be observed that a short-sighted policy, with a prediction horizon of 20 days (left panel), is less stringent in the mobility reduction, causing a larger number of hospitalized people in the long term and a large uncertainty in the end result.",

In this context, there are two important properties to explore: the relative weight between the sanitary and economic costs of our lockdown strategy, which is represented by how large the values of each of \ufffd school , \ufffd work , \ufffd other are, and the relative importance between each of the \ufffd school , \ufffd work , \ufffd other .

We observe that higher values of \ufffd loc result in the strategies which open workplaces earlier, as keeping them closed is more expensive, but also result in higher uncertainty. Interestingly, however, we observe that both control strategies keep m other constant at a value of approximately 0.41, which is the minimum value allowed for this parameter. This behaviour is consistently reproduced for any of the values \ufffd loc that we explored as we will see below; the only situation in which we did not observe this behaviour was by attributing an unreasonably high weight to the economic cost, in which case all the lockdown measures are lifted, leading to a large increase of the number of infected people and to a second wave of the epidemics. To better understand this phenomenon, we inspect the contact matrix relative to the \"other locations\" category (Fig 3) . There, it can be observed that the setting in which there are more contacts between the part of the population in which our optimisation strategy acts, (under 60 year-olds), and the older population is the \"other locations\".

For this reason, we will attribute the highest economic costs to closing workplaces, followed by schools and then others. We point out that this is ultimately a choice of the policy maker, and in principle any combination of values for each \ufffd loc could be considered. We tested a variety of combinations of these cost weights, each providing us with a lockdown strategy. In this case, we compare the efficiency of each strategy in Figs 9 and 10. As can be seen in Fig 9, all of the strategies propose to open workplaces and schools earlier or later (or not at all, in the case of schools) depending on the relative weights between sanitary and economic costs, and, as before, keep other locations at its minimum value. We show an additional comparison in Fig 10, where we plot the reproduction number R\u00f0t\u00de resulting from each strategy, compared with what it would be if the mobility values remained unchanged from their estimated values on the 29th of May.

We repeat the procedure on the 11th and 23rd of May, resulting on a proposed strategy allowing schools to be open even further at the first instance, and then remaining almost unchanged, with an increased mobility towards workplaces around mid-June. We also note that, with the exception of the time interval between the 11th and the 26th of Aprilwhere the high value of R\u00f0t\u00de is due to the fact that for the current values of the parameters the epidemic is predicted to increase rapidly, independently of the lockdown measures-the predicted R\u00f0t\u00de value always stays below 1. This dynamic update of the model allows us to rely less on long-term predictions from the model, which are more computationally expensive and become more biased the farther in the future the prediction is. Together with the knowledge on model-specific biases coming from fitting the model to different horizons in the past, this approach enables a policy maker to assess the validity of the proposed optimal mobility strategy and update it on a periodic basis as new data becomes available.",

The current work focused on a study of the COVID-19 pandemic in England and France, however the underlying methodology can be extended to other spatio-temporal locations. It can be applied to epidemiological models in general, assuming the availability of healthcare and mobility data for a suitable calibration of the dynamics. Our systematic approach provides a computational tool to assist the design of lockdown strategies which can be periodically rectified as the model is fed with incoming public data. Moreover, the proposed strategies are parsimonious in the sense that they encode both healthcare and socio-economic factors, and realistic as they are expressed as mobility reduction parameters which can be effectively measured, as opposed to switching on-off strategies.",

This discrepancy may be caused by our model not taking into account the increased capacity of the health system to fight the disease through better treatments and more extensive testing. Specifically, it is reasonable to assume that a larger proportion of people in the subclinical compartment get tested as the epidemics progresses; ideally, these people will adhere to stringent social isolation regimes with the expectation to slow down the spread of the disease.

Such a refined model, whose numerical treatment will necessarily require the use of high-performance computing resources, would allow the design of space-time adaptive lockdowns. Our progress along these lines will be documented on the companion website [37] . Code implementing the described experiments is available at https://github.com/OptimalLockdown.

The initial step consists of a policy maker defining a performance measure based on sanitary and economic objectives, and a modeller selecting a consistent generic epidemiological model. Then, public healthcare/mobility data is used in conjunction with Approximate Bayesian Computation to calibrate the dynamical model and determine the degree of uncertainty in the model parameters. This assists the formulation of an optimal control problem where the original sanitary + economic performance measure is optimized constrained to the calibrated epidemiological model. An optimal lockdown policy is then computed via global optimization techniques, and the final output is an optimal lockdown policy. The optimised lockdown is then applied and its real-time effects can be sensed through public data, which fed back into the learning and optimization framework for re-computation and update.",
