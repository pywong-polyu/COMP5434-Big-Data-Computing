There are four major types of the protein lipidation, i.e. myristoylation, palmitoylation, prenylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. N-myristoylation refers to the attachment of 14-carbon fatty acid myristates to the N-terminal glycine of proteins by N-myristoyltransferases (NMT) and affects their physiology such as plasma targeting, subcellular tracking and localization, thereby influencing the function of proteins. With more novel pathogenic N-myristoylated proteins are identified, the N-myristoylation will attract great attentions in various human diseases including infectious diseases, parasitic diseases, and cancers. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of N-myristoylation in physiological processes and discuss the hitherto implication of crosstalk between N-myristoylation and other protein modification. Furthermore, we mention several wellstudied NMT inhibitors mainly in infectious diseases and cancers and generalize the relation of NMT and cancer progression by browsing the clinic database. This review also aims to highlight the further investigation into the dynamic crosstalk of Nmyristoylation in physiological processes as well as the potential application of protein N-myristoylation in translational medicine.",

In addition, various lipids and lipid metabolites are also generated for modifying proteins in eukaryotic cells in a process known as 'protein lipidation'. Generally, there are four major types of protein lipidation: myristoylation, palmitoylation, prenylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring. These lipid modifications have been defined by different functional properties that are classified according to the characteristics of lipid attachment, the covalent bond, the specific sequence on the protein and the enzymes involved [1, 2] . These lipidation distinctions impact the charge, hydrophobicity, and other aspects of targeted-protein chemistry, resulting in marked differences in the physiology of the targeted protein, such as its conformation, trafficking, localization, and binding affinity for cofactors. Therefore, due to the deregulated lipid metabolism that occurs, protein lipidation may contribute to various diseases.",

            "text": "N-myristoylation consists of the addition of the 14-carbon fatty acid, myristate, to the N-terminal glycine residue of a protein via a covalent amide bond. In rare cases, including those of Ras GTPases and TNF [3, 4] , myristic acid is attached to a lysine residue [5] through an amide bound, a process named lysine myristoylation. Previously, it was observed that the myristate attaches to the nascent peptide in the first 10 min of translation during protein biosynthesis. Therefore, N-myristoylation is considered a cotranslational modification with the most accurate step occurring after the removal of the methionine initiator by methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) (Fig. 1a, b) . Furthermore, it is recognized that Nmyristoylation can also occur posttranslationally on an internal glycine exposed by caspase cleavage during apoptosis (Fig. 1c) . For many protein signaling systems, the N-myristoyl moiety represents an essential feature and contributes to numerous effects, including changing protein stability, influencing protein-protein interactions, enhancing subcellular targeting to organelles or the plasma membrane, and so on [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Some well-studied structural and biochemical investigations of yeast and human NMTs revealed an ordered Bi Bi kinase mechanism (Fig. 1d ) that involves a structural transformation of NMT1 during NMT catalysis. In fact, NMT is ubiquitous in eukaryotes while no protozoans possessed it. Typically, lower eukaryotes (e.g., S. cerevisiae and Drosophila) have only one isoform of NMT. However, for some mammalian species, including humans and mice, two isozymes have been identified, referred to as NMT1 and NMT2. These isozymes are encoded by distinct genes but share approximately 77% peptide sequence identity with unique substrate specificities in the N-terminus, suggesting a distinct physiologic role of each isozyme in mammals. Additionally, each isozyme has a conserved sequence in the catalytic domain of divergent species, implicating an essential role for each gene family throughout evolution.",

            "text": "Physiological roles of NMTs Unequivocally, NMTs play essential roles in the survival and cell proliferation of diverse species [14, 15] . Some evidence suggests a principal role of NMT1 in the embryonic development of mice. In normal mice, the expression level of NMT1 is similar to that of NMT2 in a wide variety of tissues, but it is higher than the NMT2 levels in embryos. Knocking out NMT1 severely impaired the differentiation ability of embryonic stem cells. Homozygous NMT1 \u2212/\u2212 -knockout mice were not born alive, and induction of NMT2 activity alone was unable to elicit the survival of heterozygous NMT1 +/\u2212 mice. In addition, it was reported that the subcellular localization and catalytic activity of both NMT1 and NMT2 were altered during apoptosis. NMT1 was transported to the cytosol from ribosomes and membranes following caspase-8-and caspase-3-mediated NMT1 cleavage, and 40% of the NMT1 activity was eliminated 8 h after the induction of apoptosis. However, the relocalization of the cytosolic fraction to the membrane and reduced activity of NMT2 were also found under the same conditions. In addition, the depletion of NMT2 caused a 2.3-fold increase in the apoptosis rate compared to the apoptosis rate upon depletion of NMT1 [16] . This evidence led to the speculation that NMT1 may be responsible for ribosome-based cotranslational N-myristoylation, while NMT2 may be the major contributor to apoptosis-related posttranslational N-myristoylation.",

The crystal structure implied that, in complex with a thiomyristoyl peptide, SIRT2 has a dominant hydrophobic pocket that can adopt a myristoyl group. The hydrophobic acyl pocket of SIRT2 resembles that of SIRT6, which has been previously demonstrated to possess efficient fatty acid deacylase activity [18] . In addition, the two pockets are different in certain aspects, suggesting differential adoption of fatty acid chains.

Although N-myristoylation is irreversible, it cannot shield the myristoylated protein from cross talk. In contrast, cross talk is regarded as a means of interfering with N-myristoylation functions. It has been proposed that one protein modification might initiate the signaling that leads to the addition or removal of a second protein modification or the binding of another protein, suggesting that cross talk between protein modification components may serve as an important bypass of regulating protein functions.

            "text": "In one scenario called the 'ligand-dependent switch' (Fig. 2a) , the conformation of a protein is changed upon ligand binding, exposing the myristoyl motif that attaches to a component in the lipid bilayer. For example, the GTP-myristoyl switch facilitates the membrane interaction of ARF [22, 23] . The exposed myristoyl motif and the basic hydrophobic residues in the N-terminus facilitate the interaction of ARF1-GTP with the membrane. The second scenario refers to a cluster of positively charged amino acids that are associated with a cofactor, such as calcium (Fig. 2b) , or are phosphorylated (Fig. 2c) ; the former cluster accumulates a positive charge to strengthen membrane binding, while the latter attenuates the positive charge to weaken membrane binding and cause membrane dissociation. The binding of two calcium ions to EF-hand motifs in the recoverin protein facilitates the exposure of a myristoyl group from a hydrophobic cavity to solvent (Fig. 2b ) [24] . Another example is the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein. The phosphorylation of serine residues contributes to its membrane dissociation, since the phosphate moiety reduces the positive charge ( Fig. 2c ) [25] . Ece C. Gaffarogullari et al. [26] proposed a novel myristoyl/phosphorylation switch in a PKA-C model of membrane attachment. PKA-C maintains conformational equilibrium between a myr-in state and a myr-out state, which refer to the myristoyl group tucked into the hydrophobic pocket of the PKA-C or extruded from the hydrophobic pocket, respectively. In the myr-out sate, the exposed myristoyl group inserts into the lipid bilayer and facilitates PKA-C binding to the membrane. Therefore, it was proposed that a large population of PKA-C maintains the myr-in state distal to the membrane and that PKA-C shifts to the myr-out state in the proximity of the plasma membrane or when phosphorylated at Ser10 independent of the regulatory subunit.",

For example, it was reported that both N-myristoylation and palmitoylation appear to have opposing roles and different membrane lipid microdomain preferences for the G protein-membrane interactions I (G\u03b1i1) monomer, which are likely due to the conformational differences in the presence of different fatty acids [31] . The G\u03b1i1 protein that is N-myristoylated but not palmitoylated preferentially anchors to lamellar-prone membrane domains with a net negative charge. In contrast, the G\u03b1i1 protein that is both N-myristoylated and palmitoylated preferentially localizes to raft-like lamellar membranes without negative charges. N-myristoylated Akt1 (MyrAkt1) exhibits a distinct substrate preference that is not exhibited by the cytosolic or the membrane fractions that do not include lipid rafts, indicating that Akt1 for which oncogenicity is conferred by Nmyristoylation is enriched in lipid rafts [7] . In addition, the evidence that simvastatin or cholesterol depletion preferentially ablates the phosphorylation of MyrAkt1 in lipid rafts suggests that MyrAkt1 is modified in a cholesterol-sensitive manner (Fig. 2e ).",

In addition, some proteins must undergo N-myristoylation for subcellular trafficking and localization. Some mitochondria-related proteins, such as TOMM40, SAMM50 [32] and, CLPABP [33] , were demonstrated to require the function of myristoylated proteins to bind to the mitochondrial outer membrane. In one mechanism, the hydrophobic myristoyl group motif increases dependence of the protein to reduce cytoplasmic shuttling. For example, in mice, binding domain-containing protein 1 (Stbd1) was observed to be a transmembrane resident protein, and nonmyristoylated Stbd1 was shuttled with ease between the ER and mitochondria [34] . Ring finger protein 11 (RNF11) colocalizes with both early and recycling endosomes. While RNF11 requires N-myristoylation and Spalmitoylation for membrane binding, N-myristoylation plays a greater role [35] . The removal of myristoylate results in protein diffusion. In another mechanism, the hydrophobicity of the myristoyl moiety increases protein flexibility, facilitating its shuttling through hydrophobic areas. In a yeast model [36] , the proteasome subunit Rpt2 is cotranslationally N-myristoylated. Loss of Rpt2 N-myristoylation causes abnormal dynamic nucleuscytoplasm translocation of proteasomes and the aberrant accumulation of ubiquitinated protein levels (Fig. 2f) .",

Nef has many virulence factors that attenuate the immune system recognition of infected cells and enhance infectivity and viral replication [12] , and Gag is a precursor protein for structural components of the viral capsid. Because this virus lacks NMT proteins, both Nef and Gag are myristoylated by the host NMT cell, and the Gag-Gag interaction triggers an entropic switch toward a myristoyl-exposed conformation, providing the impetus for protein assembly (Fig. 3b) . In contrast, in beta-retroviruses, such as mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), the oligomerization of the matrix (MA) domain, which contains the N-terminal residue in Gag, adopts a myristoylsequestering conformation [41, 42] . Moreover, the results from screens of the interaction of the host factors with the HIV-1 MA domain showed that heme oxygenase 2 (HO-2) specifically binds the myristoyl moiety of Gag via a hydrophobic channel adjacent to its heme-binding pocket, which inhibits virus production. In addition, HO-2 binds N-myristoylated TRAM, an adaptor protein for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [43] , which inhibits the TRAMdependent lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-TLR4 pathway.

The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces the degradation of PP2CA, which is predominantly localized in the nucleus, through RGLG1/5 E3 ligases. This degradation mechanism was found by ABA downregulation of NMT1, which hindered the Nmyristoylation of RGLG1 and promoted its translocation to the nucleus, where it interacted with PP2CA, increasing PP2CA degradation. In addition, in Aspergillus nidulans [48] , the swoF gene was found to encode an NMT.

A 'myristoyl/phosphotyrosine' switch has been identified in the regulation of the kinase activity of c-Abl [49] . Nmyristoylation locks the protein into an autoinhibitory conformation when the SH2 domain docks to the kinase domain. In contrast, myristoylation leads to an unpredicted function: c-Src is induced into a conformation optimal for kinase activity. A series of studies have unequivocally demonstrated that N-myristoylation of the \u03b2-subunit is a prerequisite for the initiation of AMPK signaling in response to AMP [26, 50, 51] . Therefore, in the case of NMT deficiency or upon cell treatment with an NMT inhibitor, suppressed N-myristoylation diminished the extent of \u03b1-Thr172 phosphorylation of AMP and abolished its activation, thereby causing multiple morbid physiological outcomes. Moreover, the myristoyl switch regulated by AMP may affect the selectivity of the substrates and serve as a gatekeeper for transducing signals of metabolic stress [52] .",

Apoptosis is orchestrated by a signaling cascade of proteases called caspases (cysteine-containing aspases), which leads to the exposure of novel N-termini susceptible to various posttranslational modifications. Since the initial discovery of myristoylated Bid, it has been revealed that multiple proteins are modified posttranslationally by N-myristoylation upon caspase cleavage. Using a myristoylated protein-labeling method in Jurkat T cells and MCF-7 cells, at least 15 and 7 posttranslationally Nmyristoylated proteins were discovered, respectively, during apoptosis [57] . Further characterization of these proteins revealed that caspase truncated (ct)-gelsolin and ct-PKC have antiapoptotic roles while ct-Bid and ct-PAK2 have proapoptotic roles upon posttranslational N-myristoylation, suggesting that posttranslational N-myristoylation plays an important role in maintaining a balance between cell death and survival.

In the last step of ceramide biosynthesis, a trans \u25b34-double bond in the carbon chain of dihydroceramide is specifically catalyzed by dihydroceramide \u25b34desaturase 1 (DES1), which is N-myristoylated by NMT1 [58] . Myristic acid upregulates novel DES1 activity, which differs from that of saturated fatty acids, possibly because of the accumulation of N-myristoylated DES1. N-myristoylation causes a proportion of DES1 to be translocated from the ER to the mitochondrial outer membrane, leading to an increase in ceramide levels. Since the production of ceramide can induce apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction [59] , the myristic acid-associated increase in DES1 activity can enhance apoptosis induction in cells, which shows the importance of N-myristoylation in the process of apoptosis. N-myristoylated LANCL2, which belongs to the eukaryotic LanC-like protein family, is known as the testisspecific adriamycin sensitivity protein (TASP). One biochemical study identified a phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)-binding site in the N-terminus of LANCL2. In addition, both Nmyristoylation and PIP binding are crucial for LANC2 binding to the membrane. It is possible that the overexpression of LANCL2 increases cell sensitivity to adriamycin, which is dependent on both N-myristoylation and membrane association [60] .",

In fact, broadly classified inhibitors for each process in NMT-induced disease are designated as antifungal and antiviral agents. Typically, these inhibitors can be divided into three categories [56] : (1) Myristoyl-CoA and myristate derivatives. Although the myristoyl-CoA binding sites in human NMT and fungal NMT are highly conserved, their peptide-binding sites are divergent, which provides an explanation for the selectivity of inhibitors that do not induce adverse toxicity in humans. (2) Histidine analogs. In most conserved regions in the catalytic domain EEVEH (289-293), histidine is critical for the myristoyl-CoA transfer [61] . (3) Myristoyl peptide derivatives.

Non-N-myristoylated Lck is in the cytoplasm and unable to facilitate TCR signaling.

The premise for their use is based on a thorough understanding of the abnormal regulation of N-myristoylation in carcinogenesis. For instance, given that N-myristoylation can facilitate Src-mediated prostate tumorigenesis, the myristoyl-CoA analog B13 and its derivative LCL204 [68, 70] have been identified as inhibitors of NMT1 enzymatic activity and blockers of Src N-myristoylation; their actions are based on competing for myristoyl-CoA binding site, which provides a promising approach to inhibit Src family kinase-mediated oncogenic activity, and offers preclinical support for the use of protein N-myristoylation inhibitors in treating cancer [71] . An organopalladium compound, Tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (Tris DBA) was identified as a novel human NMT1 inhibitor that not only blocks the kinase activity of NMT1 but also reduces its expression.

Moreover, patients with diseases such as liver cancer, cervical cancer, and lung cancer and high expression levels of NMT1 or NMT2 are more likely to have a poor prognosis, as indicated consistently in some reports. In addition, it is noteworthy that a cohort with renal cell carcinoma with either high expression of NMT1 or low expression of NMT2 was found to have worse overall survival, suggesting the unique roles of these proteins in kidney cancer.

This finding suggests that two analogs may be involved in myristoyl-CoA transfer by interacting with His-293 of NMT. NAF45 was identified as an NMT activator factor in bovine brain [77] . The reconstitution of NAF45 and NMT likely resulted in an open conformation where the active site is expanded. A novel stratagem of NMT activation is enhanced NMT specificity for specific myristoyl-CoA substrates. On the basis that NMT can transfer abundant palmitoyl-CoA but can use only the rare myristoyl-CoA for acylation of a substrate protein, Eric Soupene et al. [78] determined that the acyl-CoA-binding protein domain 6 (ACBD6) stimulates the activity of NMT2. ACBD6 can block the access of palmitoyl-CoA to the NMT2-binding site and enhance its catalytic activity, which requires interaction between NMT2 and ACBD6. A mutant ACBD6 unable to interact with NMT2 or with deficient ligand binding at its own N-terminus does not stimulate NMT2 activity.",

The important role of Nmyristoylation underlies the early stages of protein maturation. After the protein is folded in the Golgi apparatus or the ER, cotranslationally N-myristoylation is likely to influence the transport and localization of the protein, which can affect the biofunction of protein. The insufficient NMT kinase activity in pathogens and the variations in different species emphasize the selective lethality of NMT inhibitors for infectious diseases for which either no valid drug is qualified or for which available drugs induce drug resistance. The breakthroughs of NMT inhibitors will likely be as tumor treatments. ABL001 is being pioneered continuously for CML and Ph+ALL patients in phase I trials, which suggests a strategy focused on the N-myristoylation of oncoproteins. Furthermore, posttranslational N-myristoylation in the apoptotic process suggests the participation of NMTs, specifically NMT2, in cell death. The function of the N-myristoylated protein in the apoptotic process, whether pathogenically or physiologically normal, can further indicate the orientation of the treatment strategy for targeting NMT. The knowledge of other protein modifications, such as ubiquitination or palmitoylation, which involves a multimember kinase family, can inform many specific enzyme-substrate studies and the design of selective inhibitors. In contrast, scientists need more precise approaches for analyses of NMTs and Nmyristoylation. Nevertheless, traditional methods based on radioactively labeled probes to detect N-myristoylation are insensitive and time consuming, and the technical difficulties in obtaining three-dimensional structures of myristate-attached proteins need to be overcome. Further, bioinformatics on N-myristoylation and NMTs is still in its infancy; however, since databases are integrated, these data provide many clues linked to other biological fields.",
