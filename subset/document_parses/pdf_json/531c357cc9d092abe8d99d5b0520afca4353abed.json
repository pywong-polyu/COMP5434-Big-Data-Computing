While the CCHS did ask questions regarding bicycling and walking to work or school between the 2007/2008 and 2013/2014 cycles, a complete definition of utilitarian bicycling and walking requires inclusion of destinations other than work (e.g. shopping, appointments), and both on-and off-street routes used for such trips. Cycles in 2000/01, 2003 and 2005 included queries about the time spent in a typical week bicycling and walking to work, school or while doing errands. Beginning with the 2007/08 iteration, the query was modified to specifically assess bicycling and walking to work or school. We did not find the estimates generated by these two questions comparable, so we limited our analyses to 2008 onward. The CCHS again overhauled queries of walking and bicycling in their 2015/16 iteration, rendering them incomparable to previous cycles. This underscores that incomplete coverage and changes to queries are pitfalls of data sources focused on employment, health or physical activity rather than transportation (see Table 2 and Appendix B).",

The census is quite restrictive in that it only includes people bicycling and walking if they use that mode as their main mode of commuting. Furthermore, for certain cycles the CCHS directly queries differences in the frequency of bicycling and walking by asking for the number of times a trip is made in the past three months. This trip data is limited by several factors. Travel to work and school is queried as \"both to and from school\" so each time could be considered two trips. Number of times queried in leisure activity may, by contrast, indicate a single trip, but there is a potential for reporting error depending on how respondents interpret \"number of times\". Reporting error in the number of bicycling and walking trips is also likely an issue due to the long length of time participants are asked to recall (Branion-Calles et al., 2019) . The census could potentially be used to estimate the number of trips by examining the number of days per week worked and assuming two trips per working day. This, however, requires the assumption that the transport mode is used a certain amount of days of the week. Our analyses of the CCHS trip data showed that bicycling respondents indicated commuting to work or school an average of 25.4 times in the previous 3 months (~2 times a week). The census also queries commuting distance (in km), but these data are not released in public user microdata files (PUMFs) except in broad categories (travel distances less than 5 km from a single category).",

The fatality rate based on census data suggests much higher risk per 100,000 road users than rates based on the CCHS data, due to the more expansive definition of bicycling and walking in the CCHS. On average, the census-based bicycling fatality rate was ~24 times higher than the CCHS leisure-based fatality rate for men, and ~39 times higher for women. Similar differences were found for walking, with the census-based pedestrian fatality rate being ~20 times higher than the CCHS leisured-based fatality rate for men and ~19 times higher for women. Even with ideal denominator data such as that provided by national travel surveys, estimates of absolute injury risk for people walking and bicycling based on police data would be underestimates due to under-reporting (Elvik and Mysen, 1999; Langley et al., 2003; Stutts and Hunter, 1998) . Crashes that result in a fatality have a much higher likelihood of being captured in police databases compared to crashes that result in injuries of lower severity (Elvik and Mysen, 1999; Stutts and Hunter, 1998) .",

For example, census-based bicycling fatality risk fell over time for both men and women, while CCHS leisure data showed risk falling slightly for men but staying stable for women. Within datasets, we found consistent patterns such as men having a higher fatality risk for both walking and bicycling. That men are at higher risk of fatality is a finding is consistent with previous analyses of transportation fatalities in other countries including the United States (Beck et al., 2007) , and the United Kingdom (Mindell et al., 2012; Scholes et al., 2018) . Regardless of denominator, the fatality rates did not increase significantly over time in the current analysis of Canadian data, a trend consistent with those in western European nations and in contrast to the United States .",

The matching denominator for the fatality data from the NCDB would be limited to bicycling/ walking on public roads. Note that this means that the NCDB does not capture fatal incidents off public roads and will underestimate the total number of fatalities. Our sub-analysis of bicycling trips made in Canada, combining the leisure and utilitarian trips from the CCHS is the best estimate of the appropriate denominator for the NCDB data, but still falls short relative to what a travel survey would provide, namely reliable estimates of number of trips, distance and/or time travelled. Unfortunately, the latest two iterations of the CCHS has eliminated even this optiontrip data is no longer recorded separately by mode.",

However, these surrogate data sources present considerable limitations in how these activities are queried. To support the development of a national household travel survey, a next step would be a methodological comparison of regional household travel surveys conducted in Canada. To fill the national household travel data gap, several municipal or metropolitan regions in Canada have developed and conducted regular or ad-hoc household travel surveys (e.g. Buliung et al., 2009; Teschke et al., 2013) . Regions have undertaken significant expense and expertise to conduct these surveys, which should be considered and consulted in a national survey development process to preclude any duplication of effort. Academically, an analysis of best practices used in regional household travel surveys to elicit complete travel data will be a crucial next step.",
