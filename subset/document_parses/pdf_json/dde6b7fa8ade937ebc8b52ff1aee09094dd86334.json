For example, news aggregators actively use clustering algorithms to generate news feeds from different sources and to select a single headline. The recent progress in designing multilingual models [13] , trained for dozens or even hundreds of languages at once, makes it possible to use them for monolingual tasks, particularly for Russian language tasks [8] . At the same time, Russian BERT-based models are actively evolving, and their comparison with more universal multilingual ones may be of interest.",

We compare the results for all models, except mT5, which doesn't have the [CLS] token in its dictionary. However, as shown in Table 3 , averaging show slightly better results for most of the models. We assume this is because embeddings of the [CLS] token contain high-level semantic meaning [13] , while for headline selection task it is more important not to lose the token-level information to meet the previously formulated criteria of a good headline. Moreover, we analyze whether sentence embeddings in the middle layers can be more suitable than in the last ones. Experiments show that layers 17 to 19 (of 25) for SBERT, XLM-R and mT5 and layers 8 to 9 (of 13) for RuBERT perform better than the top layers.
