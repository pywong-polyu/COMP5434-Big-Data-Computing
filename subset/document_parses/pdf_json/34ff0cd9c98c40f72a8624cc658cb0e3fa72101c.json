The aim of our work was to better understand the impact of misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 on epidemic curves. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 28 May 2020). There is presently no information of sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of laboratory tests used in Canada for the causal agent for COVID-19. Therefore, we examined best attainable performance in other jurisdictions and similar viruses. This suggested perfect Sp and Sn 60-95%. We used these values to recalculate epidemic curves to visualize the potential bias due to imperfect testing. If the sensitivity improved, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. These issues are minor early in the epidemic, but hundreds of undiagnosed cases are likely later on. It is therefore hazardous to judge progress of the epidemic based on observed epidemic curves unless quality of testing is better understood.",

            "text": "It is well known that outcome misclassification can bias epidemiologic results, yet is infrequently quantified and adjusted. In the context of infectious disease outbreaks, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019-2020, false positive diagnoses may lead to a waste of limited resources, such as testing kits, hospital beds, and loss of healthcare workforce. On the other hand, false negative diagnoses contribute to uncontrolled spread of contagion. In an ongoing epidemic, where test sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of case ascertainment are fixed, prevalence of the outcome (infection) determines whether false positives or negatives dominate. Poor sensitivity is more tolerable when prevalence is low early in the epidemic but less so as the number of infected grows . At present, the accuracy of testing for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, is unknown in Canada. All available research suggest that near-perfect Sp is justified but Sn can range from 60 to 95% (Binsaeed et al. 2011; COVID-19 Science Report: Diagnostics 2020; Fang et al. 2020; Ai et al. 2020; Konrad et al. 2020; US FDA 2020; He et al. 2020) . Full details of our efforts to learn more about Sn and Sp are detailed in Burstyn et al. (2020) . We conducted a Monte Carlo (probabilistic) sensitivity analysis of the impact of the plausible extent of this misclassification on bias in epidemic curves in Alberta, Canada.",

            "text": "For each observed count of incident cases, we estimated true counts as (observed count)/Sn under the assumption that specificity is indistinguishable from perfect. Because values of Sn are not estimated or known, we simulated various values of Sn as arising from Beta distribution, ranging in means from 0.60 to 0.95 and fixed standard deviation of 0.05. The results of 10 simulation realizations for each scenario are plotted in Fig. 1 . We assumed that Sn either improved (realistic best case: green) or degraded (pessimistic worst case: brown). Our analysis only reflects systematic errors for illustrative purposes and under the common assumptions (and experience) that they dwarf random errors. Calculations were performed in R (R Core Team 2019) and code is available via Burstyn et al. (2020) . Figure 1 indicates how, as expected, if sensitivity improves over time with the natural refinement of laboratory procedures (green lines), then the true epidemic curve is expected to be flatter than the observed. It also appears that observed and true curves may well fall within the range of 95% confidence intervals around the observed counts (blue lines). If sensitivity decreases over time (grey lines) (e.g., due to increased pressures of work, scaling up of the analyses with less experienced staff), then the true epidemic curve is expected to be steeper than the observed. In either scenario, there can be an under-counting of cases by nearly a factor of two, most apparent as the incidence grows, such that on day April 23, 2020, there may have been almost 500 cases vs. 336 observed. Even at the tail end of the epidemic, on May 27, 2020, our simulation predicts that there may have been as many as 45 to 50 cases vs. 27 observed. This is alarming, because misdiagnosed patients who have not self-isolated can spread infection unimpeded and it is impossible to know who they are among symptomatic persons tested negative around that time per day.",

Consequently, the sensitivity of surveillance has likely improved over time, with numbers of test-positive persons more closely resembling occurrence of the disease in the population.
