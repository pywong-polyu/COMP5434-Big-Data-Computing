The labor market company Emsi\u00ae provided the most current employment estimates by 6-digit North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes along with a geographic listing of businesses by NAICS codes that contained employment, earnings, and sales data. Esri\u00ae further categorized the 6-digit codes into 8-digits, thus providing a more detailed view of this sub-sector's businesses. However, since business listings do not comprehensively tabulate all businesses of each classification within a region, we developed a weighting method to estimate output, jobs, and earnings for the following industries using Emsi\u00ae data-Foresters Consulting, Government -Forestry Services, and Forest Restoration. A statewide input-output model, along with sub-regional models, were estimated using the IMPLAN\u00ae software to identify economic contributions to the state and regional economies. Total annual sales across Mississippi were $84.5 million; sales were greatest in the Central subregion, with the South, North close behind. Consulting Foresters was the largest industry by sales, jobs, and earnings. Total economic contributions were 1,140 jobs and $59.79 million in value added on total sales of $121.99 million. South Mississippi received the greatest regional contributions from Foresters Consulting, while Central Mississippi received the greatest benefits from Government -Forestry Services and Forest Restoration.",

Typically, the reports reference standard North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) coded industries that exist within the economic contribution software IMPLAN, which is utilized by practitioners from state agencies, universities, and economic development offices (IMPLAN, LLC, Huntersville, NC) . However, the IMPLAN software has the capability to produce non-standard reports for industries which either do not yet exist in the software package or are industries that are in their infancy and do not have an established industry with the NAICS coding system. 2 In these cases, practitioners are tasked with providing information collected outside of the standard model framework and augmenting the pre-existing geographical area of interest Henderson et al. 2017b; Scouse et al. 2017; Poudyal et al. 2017; Scouse et al. 2020) .",

Some examples include the effect of insect related mortality in ash species in Louisiana (McConnell et al. 2019a) , the impact international trade provides the forest products sector (McConnell et al. 2019b) , and the impact of paycheck protection program loans on the forest products industry (Russell 2021) . One area that has not been explored is how to disentangle the NAICS coded industries in the contribution software into smaller sub-industries. This is due primarily to data availability and/or suppression at sub-national levels for databases that serve as foundations for constructing regional economic models, e.g., the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Aggregation effects caused by this issue can obfuscate the economic contribution of those smaller industries that are grouped into the forest industries typically described in economic contribution publications and reports. One such sector is Support Activities for Forestry (NAICS code 115, 310) . This sector is an umbrella for private industries, such as consulting foresters, forest planters, and timber cruisers, as well as government forestry service providers.",

Assistance from consultants is particularly important in the US South, where only Florida has less than 80-plus percent of all forest ownership in private hands (Grove et al. 2020) . Overall, the National Woodland Owner Survey (NWOS) reported 1.37 million of the 1.66 million family ownerships in the US South are less than 100 acres in size (Caputo and Butler 2022) , which speaks to the decentralized decision-making practiced on these forestlands. This assistance can take many forms, but typically services include timber sales, reforestation, site preparation, and development of forest management plans (Munn and Watkins 2001; Arano et al. 2002) . Generally, studies indicate increased profitability from the use of consulting services, although the premiums vary widely depending on the attributes of the property and products merchandised (Munn and Rucker 1994; Munn and Franklin 1995) .",

This equated to about a 2 to 1 increase in economic activity due to earnings, contracting with vendors, equipment costs. Straka and Phillips (2016) found each additional state forester employed in South Carolina contributed an additional 12 jobs throughout the state economy. Cost sharing of forestry practices through the North Carolina Forest Service's Forest Development Program generated total impacts of 197 jobs and $12.6 million in total sales in 2012.

For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics provided no employment data for foresters (SOC Code 19-1032) in Mississippi in May 2020 4 (USDL Bureau of Labor Statistics 2021).

Examples relevant to forestry would be solid wood, paper, and furniture products; occupations that include managers, engineers, and loggers; and industries such as wood preservation and plywood manufacturing. Interested readers are referred to https:// www. census. gov/ naics/? 008967 on the concepts and history of the NAICS economic classification systems in the United States. 4 The Bureau of Labor Statistics did not release employment estimates for Mississippi but did provide wage statistics.

Emsi\u00ae provides estimates for economic variables of interest (other than the business listings) from 2001 to present and projects an additional ten years. While historical estimates do not replicate federal data, this data source has been validated by several studies (Munasib and Rickman 2015; Kumar et al. 2017; Pede 2013) .

Designed by the US Forest Service, it was created to estimate the regional economic contributions of management plans for national forests (Alward et al. 1985) . Input-output models make use of the Leontief model developed by Wassily Leontief in the 1930's. Using this input-output model allows us to see the flow of interdependent industries and how they contribute to the overall Mississippi economic output (Henderson and Evans 2017) . IMPLAN\u00ae provides \"current data and analytic support necessary to run the model\" (MIG 1999; Tilley and Munn 2007 ). Because the model accounts for industries across many sectors, the IMPLAN\u00ae system is well suited to estimate the economic contributions of the Support Activities for Forestry sector. We chose to calculate the economic contribution (an ex-post analysis based on actual industry data) of the individual Esri\u00ae-NAICS sectors rather than the economic impact of the sectors (an ex-ante analysis based upon forecasts) because (1) we are dealing with existing industry sectors rather than introducing new sectors into each economy and (2) we are eliminating the intra-sector linkages that would be present in an economic impact model and would demonstrate the demand that a specific sector has for its businesses (Watson et al. 2007 ). As such, economic contribution analysis focuses on economic sectors external to those being examined to present a more accurate assessment of the influence that the sector(s) under examination has on the local area or region. To develop the economic contribution estimates, we developed IMPLAN\u00ae models for each of the five FIA regions and for the state as shown in Fig. 1 .",

This mathematical operation ensures that the intra-sector linkages are eliminated for sales due to the SAM multiplier accounting for social security, tax leakages, institutional savings, and interinstitutional transfers (Tilly and Munn 2007) . Eliminating these sales is critical to achieving results that are both accurate and respected (Oosterhaven and Stelder 2002; Watson et al. 2015) . We then inputted the reduced sales estimations and the jobs and total earnings estimates described earlier into IMPLAN\u00ae events that consisted of IMPLAN\u00ae sector 19 Support activities for agriculture and forestry and were associated with Esri\u00ae-NAICS specific activities. The other modification that was made to each IMPLAN\u00ae model involved setting Proprietor Income (production-based earnings of sole proprietors, partnerships, and tax-exempt cooperatives) equal to \"0\" (zero) for each event to eliminate overestimating Labor Income (the sum of employee compensation and proprietor income).",

Here, the North FIA region had the largest number of jobs in this sector, followed by the South and the Southwest regions. The patterns found in Table 3 virtually mirrored those of total earnings per sector and by FIA region in Table 4 . This was primarily due to the method of determining total earnings per employee described above and the application of per employee earnings to the job totals described in Table 3 .

These businesses added $25.4 million in value added (contribution to the state's Gross Domestic Product) and had total sales of $53.3 million. 5 The economic \"spillovers\" (the sum of the indirect and induced effects) increased these benefits an additional 170 jobs earned $6.48 million. This resulted in an additional contribution to the state's Gross Domestic product of $12.3 million and additional sales by businesses of $23.4 million. 6 Table 6 presents the same information for the collective economic contributions of aggregated Government-Forestry Services and Forest Restoration. The Delta FIA region contains no reported activity in these sectors, which was due to businesses being either established outside this region or categorized into a NAICS code beyond the scope of this study, while the Central FIA region contains the largest levels of economic activity and spillover benefits due to state and federal governmental forestry services units being primarily housed in and around the state capital of Jackson. The total effects for these industries in Central Mississippi were 281 jobs, $13.2 million in labor income, $13.6 million in total value added, and $27.5 million In input-output accounting vernacular, \"industries pay labor, labor pays households, and households purchase goods and services from industry.\" Achieving the required balance that is fundamental to building input-output models, therefore, required the labor account to purchase a portion of the $30 million of earnings paid by industry to labor from out of state households, i.e., to be imported. Workers who work within a study region but live elsewhere are accounted for using journey-to-work data compiled by the US Census Bureau. in output. This was more than the next region by a factor of about 4. It should also be pointed out that counties are grouped into similar physiographic units by the USDA Forest Service. Following that aggregation scheme here essentially split the economic effects of Jackson's metropolitan area into the Delta, Central, and Southwest regions. No one region realized excessive economic benefits due to Jackson's larger, more urban economy. Table 7 presents a summary of the state and local fiscal (tax) effects for both the Foresters Consulting sector and the aggregated sector by FIA region. While economic activity within the Foresters Consulting sector generated an annual total of $6.25 million in fiscal revenue for state and local governments, most of these tax dollars ($5.39 million or 86.2 percent) accrue to the state. For all practical purposes, only the property taxes associated with the Tax on Production and Imports and Households revenue sources ($862,000) accrued to local governments. This situation existed in the state and local fiscal revenues for the aggregated sector as well. Economic activity in this sector generated $3.77 million in total fiscal revenue for state and local governments with $492,000 (13.0 percent) of property tax accruing to local governments. Interestingly, the structure of these industries in Mississippi led to both the Foresters Consulting sector and the aggregated sector paying negative taxes (these corporate taxes are comprised of taxes on Dividends and Corporate Profits Tax) in multiple FIA regions. Table 8 presents summaries of the tax revenue that accrued to the federal government because of the economic activity in the sectors examined. We estimated the statewide Foresters Consulting sector generated $6.75 million in federal taxes while the statewide aggregated sector produced federal fiscal revenues of $44.0 million. The largest federal revenue source for each FIA region was taxes on Employee The two industries were aggregated for reporting. Output was the sum of labor income and value added within each region. Employment, labor income, total value added, and output total effects were the sum of the direct, indirect, and induced effects. Regions are sorted by their output total effect Compensation, which is defined by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (USDC BEA 2021) as \"the total payroll cost of the employee including wages and salaries, all benefits (e.g., health, retirement), and payroll taxes.\" As with the state and local tax revenue reported in Table 7 , multiple FIA regions reported negative federal taxes from the Corporations revenue source. In the case of federal revenues, these corporate taxes are solely composed of Corporate Profits Tax. The correlation coefficients between regional forest inventory statistics and the total output contributions for Foresters Consulting, Government-Forestry Services and Forest Restoration, and Support Activities for Forestry overall by region are provided in Fig. 2 . The absolute values of the coefficients ranged from 0.21 to 0.96. For the industries within Support Activities for Forestry the correlations were generally weak. Only the relationship between regional timberland acreage and Foresters Consulting economic contributions exhibited a moderate level of association (r = 0.71), while regional timber harvest volume and Government-Forestry Services and Forest Restoration economic contributions were highly correlated (r = 0.87).

When these sectors were compared to the total Support Activities for Forestry sector, the pattern for output followed closely resembled that of Foresters Consulting, thus demonstrating the importance of that sector to this portion of the state's economy. The exception to this trend was the Central FIA region. These estimates can also be examined in terms of multipliers, which are ratios of additional economic activity resulting from a direct effect or shock in the economy (Miller 2010; Riggs et al. 2011) . Dividing the total effect by the direct effect for each economic measure presented in Table 5 under \"Mississippi Totals\" provides an employment multiplier of 1.31; a labor income multiplier of 1.21; a total value-added multiplier of 1.49; and an output (sales) multiplier of 1.44. This suggests that every 10 jobs in the Foresters Consulting sector created an additional 3.1 jobs in the state's economy and each additional thousand dollars of employee earnings in this sector results in an additional $210 of earnings for the state's economy.

These can be informative tools for framing economic development opportunities and potential policy impacts. While regional contribution levels were larger in the North and South portions of the state, the multipliers' interpretations as marginal contributions per dollar (or job) revealed all regions but the South exhibited greater specific metrics as compared to those at the state level-regardless of size. For example, the Delta and Central regions possessed total value added multipliers greater than Mississippi's state average. Thus, economic expansion that triggers value added generation by consulting foresters would have greater marginal impacts on other industries in those two regions. Conversely, the economic Fig. 2 Correlation coefficients between the total sales output effects of Support Services for Forestry (Support Services), Government-Forestry Services and Forest Restoration (Government and Restoration), and Foresters Consulting (Forester Consulting) and regional forest statistics.

The presence of any linear associations between the regions' forest inventory data and our economic findings were, however, largely absent.

The Central region had the second lowest level of activity. This was somewhat unexpected because the region contained the second greatest merchantable timber inventory, and the 5-year moving average of harvest levels exceeded all regions from 2015 to 2019 (USDA Forest Service 2021). Yet the Central FIA region also contained only three towns with populations above 10,000 residents, Meridian and the Jackson suburbs of Brandon and Pearl. The mobility of consulting foresters was unknown, but the results suggested consulting foresters did not incorporate in this region. Perhaps businesses were instead headquartered in other regions and only conducted business in the Central region. Additional work will be required to further clarify this finding.",

These revenues support many types of public-good programs and services. They are particularly important when dealing with forestry and agriculture sectors in a rural state like Mississippi. Although Mississippi has a relatively complement group of value-added manufacturing industries for raw timber products, the largest forest products manufacturing facilities, such as paper, plywood, and sawmills, often receive tax inducements to locate in areas.",

Recent mill announcements will see Mississippi adding over one billion board feet of lumber and potentially one million tons of pellets to its forest industry capacity over the next few years. Estimated roundwood demands could exceed five million tons (McConnell 2021), which will require hundreds of private family ownerships of the size discussed in this article (typically less than 100 acres). The implications can be extended to log trucking output (shorter distances allow for more loads to be delivered daily), wood utilization efficiency (diverse markets encourage more complete utilization), standing timber prices (lower processing costs accrue to stumpage), severance tax collections (twenty percent of which is returned to county governments), and consequently forestland value (present value of future income opportunities that can be furthered though cost sharing and tax credits). Each of these factors will improve forestry's economic importance in the state. Coupling this with long-term changes to Mississippi's forest and industrial structures warrant periodically reassessing these contributions.",

Regional contributions provided by private consulting foresters, public service foresters, and forester restoration contractors varied across Mississippi. Forests Consulting was dominant in the South and North Mississippi regions, while Central Mississippi benefitted from government and forest restoration activities. Forestry from a utilization perspective provided smaller levels of economic contributions in the Southwest and Delta regions. While it was beyond the scope of our work, some of Mississippi's highest valued timberland is ironically located in the Delta region because of the habitat it provides for recreational fishing and hunting (American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers 2021). This could open a new line of inquiry to further illustrate the diversity forestry brings to communities and their economies. This can be particularly true in places where forestry's impacts on environment, society, and economy may not be fully understood, such as the wildland urban interface in the US South that is becoming increasingly fragmented and parceled (Hermansen-B\u00e1ez et al. 2006) .",

Foresters Consulting as an industry contributed over $76 million in output to Mississippi. Another $45.3 million of output was generated in other forestry supporting services industries. Regional contributions were larger in the North and South Mississippi FIA regions, where the regional economies were larger and contained more urban areas. Regardless of size, each region provided non-trivial contributions on per dollar or job bases. By our estimations total sales by enterprises in the Support Activities for Forestry sector in Mississippi were $84.5 million. This output directly supported 874 jobs that earned $47.5 million in compensation. Accounting for the dependence other industries have on these firms for their business produced total contributions of 1,140 jobs, with earnings of $57.8 million. In sum, $59.8 million in value added was contributed to Mississippi's Gross Domestic product on sales approaching $122 million. Total tax proceeds across federal, state, and local collections were $20.8 million. This information is critical when smaller industries must compete with other industries and commodity groups in lobbying elected officials during their formulating of policy positions.",
