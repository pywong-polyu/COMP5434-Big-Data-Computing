            "text": "Manipulation of gene activity through creation of hypomorphic mutants has been a long-standing tool in examining gene function. Our previous studies have indicated that hypomorphic mutants could be created by inserting cis-regulatory sequences composed of consecutive adenosine nucleotides called poly(A) tracks. Here we use poly(A) tracks to create hypomorphic mutants and functional characterization of membrane, secretory, and endogenous proteins. Insertion of poly(A) tracks into the sequences of interleukin-2 and membrane protein CD20 results in a programmable reduction of mRNA stability and attenuation of protein expression regardless of the presence of a signaling sequence. Likewise, CRISPR-Cas9 targeted insertion of poly(A) tracks into the coding sequence of the endogenous human genes AUF1 and TP53 results in a programmable reduction of targeted protein and mRNA levels. Functional analyses of AUF1-engineered hypomorphs indicate a direct correlation between AUF1 gene levels and the stability of AUF1-regulated mRNAs. Hypomorphs of TP53 affect expression of the target genes differentially depending on the severity of the hypomorphic mutation. Finally, decreases in TP53 protein affect the same cellular pathways in poly(A) track-engineered cells as in cancer cells, indicating these variants' biological relevance. These results highlight this technology's power to create predictable, stable hypomorphs in recombinant or endogenous genes in combination with CRISPR-Cas9 engineering tools.",

Historically, chemical and UV irradiation mutagenesis screens followed by selection for phenotypic strength have been used to identify hypomorphic alleles. 1, [4] [5] [6] Hypomorphic mutations have also been created through non-directed insertional mutagenesis using transposable el-ements in or near regulatory regions. 7, 8 RNAi has also been an essential tool in creating hypomorphic phenotypes because of varying degrees of residual gene expression produced from knockdown. [9] [10] [11] However, each method of creation of hypomorphic mutations is accompanied by disadvantages. Although advances in next-generation sequencing have reduced the time and tediousness associated with finding phenotypic variants in traditional forward genetics screens, the process still requires creating a mapping population, with mapping resolution being variable. [12] [13] [14] Even when an allele is mapped to a gene of interest, mutagenesis screens still produce many other types of alleles, such as neomorphs (altered or unique function), nulls (LOF), and hypermorphs (gain of function). On the other hand, RNAi results in variable gene knockdown and can have off-target effects. 15 Therefore, there is a need for a method that can be used for all recombinant coding genes and, in combination with novel CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, to engineer endogenous genes.",

[16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The decrease in the amount of gene expression directly correlates with the length of the poly(A) track: the longer the poly(A) track, the lower the mRNA's stability and expression of the protein products. 16, 17, 19, 20 Our previous work indicated that poly(A) tracks could be used to create hypomorphic levels of recombinant cytoplasmic proteins in various reporters and across multiple organisms, such as E.coli, S. cerevisiae, T. thermophile, and N. benthamiana and in Drosophila and human cells. 19 Additional studies have indicated that the same technology can be used in C. albicans and A. thaliana cells, where constructs with poly(A) tracks were inserted into previously engineered knockout cells. 20 Previous studies of poly(A) track hypomorphs have been limited to reporters or recombinant cytoplasmic proteins and were not tested in secretory or membrane proteins. 19 Because the sequence and structure of the N terminus of secretory and transmembrane proteins are essential for co-translational translocation and, thus, proper processing and transport, it remains unclear whether insertion of poly(A) tracks would create hypomorphic mutants of such genes.

Inserting a poly(A) track of at least 9 and up to 18 adenosines reduces mRNA stability and protein synthesis in a programmable way without affecting protein membrane insertion or secretion out of the cells. This effect is also independent of the presence of the signaling peptide sequence in IL-2, where insertion of a poly(A) track immediately before and after the signal sequence results in a similar protein and mRNA reduction. We show that the same effects can be observed when poly(A) track sequences are introduced into endogenous genes in human tissue cultures using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. AUF1(AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1) and TP53 (tumor protein p53) mRNA stability and protein expression are reduced in a programmable way, depending on the length of poly(A) tracks. Analyses of downstream effects of AUF1 hypomorphs indicate changes in the abundance of MAT1A (methionine adenosyltransferase 1A), APP (b-amyloid precursor protein), TOP2A (DNA topoisomerase II alpha), and USP1 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 1) mRNAs, shown previously to respond to AUF1 protein. 24, 25 Inserting poly(A) tracks in the TP53 locus of HAP1 cells leads to partial or near-complete loss of TP53 protein and TP53 dosage-dependent effects on multiple TP53-regulated genes. Our data also indicate that partial or more complete loss of TP53 gene expression leads to downregulation of MGMT (O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) gene products, a trend observed in engineered cells and cancer cell lines with compromised levels of TP53 protein.",

[27] [28] [29] To test whether insertion of poly(A) tracks can lead to programmable expression of CD20, we cloned the full sequence of CD20 into the pDEST40 vector and inserted poly(A) tracks of 12 adenosines (12As, sequence equivalent to 4 consecutive lysine AAA codons) and 18As (sequence equivalent to 6 lysine AAA codons), respectively, after the second amino acid ( Figure 1A ). We transfected wild-type (WT) and mutated CD20 reporters together with a Green Fluorescence Protein -Yellow Fluorescence Protein (GFP-YFP) reporter as a normalization control into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Using qRT-PCR and western blot analysis, we examined the effects of poly(A) insertion on CD20 mRNA stability and protein expression ( Figures 1B and 1C) . The recombinant CD20 protein was visualized using a polyclonal CD20 antibody and compared with expression of GFP-YFP constructs. Expression of the CD20 protein was decreased over approximately 50% and 80% for reporters with insertion of 12As and 18As, respectively ( Figure 1B) , with previously observed degradation bands at 25 kDa. 29 We observed similar, approximately 50% and 70% reductions in mRNA stability for constructs with insertion of 12As and 18As, respectively ( Figure 1C ).",

            "text": "To investigate whether insertion of poly(A) tracks and expression of CD20 protein with short poly-lysine repeats interferes with cellular localization of this membrane-integral protein, we used live-cell imaging ( Figure 2A ) and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 2B ). Using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled CD20-2H7-specific antibody, we performed live-cell imaging of CHO cells expressing WT CD20 and poly(A) track variants. The monoclonal CD20 antibody 2H7 binds an epitope found in the larger extracellular loop of CD20 and has been used for depletion of B cells. 30, 31 Antibody immunofluorescence indicated that all three variants of CD20 are expressed in the membrane of CHO cells. 32 Furthermore, the position of the FITC-labeled CD20-2H7-specific antibody indicated a distribution of CD20 similar to the CellMask Orange plasma membrane stain ( Figure 2A ; Figure S1 ). The difference in the levels of cellular immunofluorescence was similar to the difference in protein levels seen in western blot analyses ( Figure 1B ). Cells expressing the WT CD20 construct had the highest immunofluorescence signal, whereas poly(A) track-engineered constructs had a programmable reduction in the abundance of the CD20 protein. CD20 protein with insertion of a poly(A) track of 12As had higher immunofluorescence than CD20 with 18As. Flow cytometry of transfected CHO cells with a FITC-labeled CD20-antibody also indicated detectable levels of expression of WT CD20 and CD20 with a poly(A) track of 12As ( Figure 2B ). 33 Insertion of a poly(A) tracks creates hypomorphic mutants of secretory IL-2 protein regardless of signaling peptide To test the ability to create hypomorphic mutants using poly(A) tracks in secretory proteins, we created reporter genes with the fulllength sequence of IL-2. IL-2 is a cytokine necessary for homeostasis of T lymphocytes and clonal expansion of regulatory T cells. 34, 35 As a secretory protein, IL-2 contains an N-terminal signal peptide for recognition by the signal recognition particle and efficient co-translational translocation. It has been shown previously that modification of the signal peptide of IL-2 could affect IL-2 expression and secretion. 36 To test the locational flexibility of poly(A) insertion, we placed poly(A) tracks of 9As, 12As, and 18As, respectively, before and after the signal peptide sequence ( Figure 3A ). Poly(A) tracks before the signal peptide were inserted after the codon for the second amino acid, whereas insertion after the signal peptide sequence occurred following the codon for amino acid 27. We transfected WT IL-2 and IL-2 reporters with poly(A) track insertions into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. These cells have been shown previously to produce secreted IL-2 protein when transfected with recombinant IL-2. 37, 38 We assayed mRNA amounts by qRT-PCR analysis for all reporters. RNA levels were reduced by approximately 20%, 40%, and 50% for 9As, 12As, and 18As, respectively, for poly(A) A B C Figure 1 . Design and effect of poly(A) track insertion on CD20 stability and expression (A) Scheme representative of poly(A) insertions and location of insertions for CD20 reporter constructs used in this study. Poly(A) insertions in the CD20 coding sequence were placed proximal to the ATG start codon. A schematic of the CD20 gene with the start codon (ATG), termination codon (STOP), and exons and insertion sites is also shown. (B) Western blot analysis of CD20 constructs expressed transiently in CHO cells. An equal amount of total protein was used for analysis. GFP-YFP and b-actin were used as transfection and loading controls, respectively, with expression of both proteins detected using specific antibodies. CD20 was detected with a CD20-specfic antibody. Arrows indicate the position of full-length CD20, GFP-YFP, and b-actin proteins. (C) mRNA levels of CD20 constructs were measured by qRT-PCR. CD20 expression was normalized to b-actin. Relative mRNA levels for both constructs (12As and 18As) are presented as percentages of WT CD20.

This gene locus encodes the loop region in the TP53 protein. We selected this position to assure targeting of the two major N-terminal isoforms of TP53 transcripts: canonical TP53, which contains the full N-terminal sequence, and D40TP53, which excludes the first 40 amino acids of the canonical TP53 isoform because of the presence of an internal start (AUG) codon ( Figure 4A ; Figure S2). 40 gRNAs were chosen for high NHEJ (non-homologous end joining) efficiency, low off-target effects, and proximity to the cut site. ssODN (single-strand oligo donor) DNA containing homology arms flanking the 3 0 and 5 0 regions of the poly(A) track insertion sequence (12As or 36As) was used as a template for CRISPR-mediated HDR (homology-directed repair) in the human near-haploid cell line HAP1. 41 After CRISPR-Cas9 engineering of the TP53 locus, we selected and confirmed by NGS (nextgeneration sequencing) and Sanger sequencing multiple cell clones containing an insertion of 12As or 36As ( Figure S2 ). Engineered cell lines with successful insertion of poly(A) tracks in the single copy of the TP53 gene in HAP1 cells were analyzed for mRNA stability and protein expression of the TP53 gene using qPCR and western blot analysis. GAPDH protein and mRNA levels were used as normalization controls between parental and engineered cell lines. Similar to the CD20 and IL-2 reporters, endogenous TP53 hypomorphs containing 12As or 36As had decreased mRNA levels and protein abundance, depending on the length of the inserted poly(A) track ( Figures  4B and 4C ). The 12A insertion reduced mRNA and protein amounts by 50% compared with WT TP53 expression in the original HAP1 parental line. Insertion of 36As resulted in almost complete loss of the TP53 protein and a 90% reduction in mRNA levels compared with TP53 levels in the original non-engineered HAP1 cells.",

MAT1A mRNA was previously stabilized by knockdown of AUF1, whereas transient knockdown of www.moleculartherapy.org Molecular Therapy: Nucleic Acids Vol. 26 December 2021 AUF1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection induces destabilization of APP, TOP2A, and USP1 mRNAs. 34 Our results confirm the observations of previous studies. 24, 25 MAT1A mRNA levels increase in the programmed hypomorphs of AUF1, whereas the levels of APP, TOP2A, and USP1 decline with a reduction in AUF1 expression. Even more compelling, the change in target gene mRNA levels was dependent on the length of the poly(A) track insertion and the extent of AUF1 reduction.

Based on previous studies and availability of antibodies, we selected BRCA1, DDIT4, DUSP6, MGMT, and P21 as TP53-associated genes. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] We analyzed cell lysates by qPCR and western blot analysis ( Figures 6A and 6B) . We used parental HAP1 cells and engi-neered HAP1 cells with 12A and 36A insertions in the TP53 coding sequence ( Figure 3 ). Tp53 protein and mRNA levels in these cells reflected WT TP53 levels, a 50% reduction in TP53 (TP53 12As), and nearly complete loss of TP53 protein (TP53 36As) ( Figures 4B and  4C , 6A, and 6B). Western blot analyses indicated that BRCA1 levels did not change regardless of TP53 protein levels ( Figure 6A ). The protein levels of DUSP6 and DDIT4 showed differential behavior in the presence of the varying TP53 levels ( Figure 6A) . A 50% reduction of TP53 protein levels caused by insertion of a poly(A) track with 12As led to a significant reduction of DDIT4 and almost complete loss of DUSP6 protein in those cells (HAP1 TP53 12As). DDIT4 and DUSP6 were not affected or slightly increased in cells with almost complete loss of TP53 (HAP1 TP53 36As) compared with WT HAP1 cells. Finally, MGMT and P21 protein levels were severely depleted in cells expressing TP53 hypomorphs compared with WT HAP1 cells. Analyses of steady-state mRNA levels for all genes indicated the same trend as protein levels ( Figure 6B ). BRCA1 mRNA levels were unaffected in cell lines with different TP53 levels. DDIT4 and DUSP6 mRNAs showed a significant drop in levels, with a 50% TP53 protein reduction and WT or higher levels of mRNAs in cells with almost complete loss of TP53. Finally, MGMT and P21 mRNA levels were severely depleted in both TP53 engineered cell lines. We further tested whether TP53 and P21 levels can be changed when we apply hydroxyurea to HAP1 cells as a cytotoxic and genotoxic drug ( Figure 6C ). 50 Figure 6C ).",

Based on our hypomorphic models, we predicted that cell lines that contain less TP53 would contain less MGMT. In cell lines with WT TP53 status (HEK293 and MIA PaCa-2), MGMT protein expression was easily detectible. The SW620 cell line has a double mutation in the TP53 gene (R273H/P309S) and deletion of the MGMT gene. As expected, TP53 protein levels were greatly reduced in the SW620 cell line, and MGMT protein expression was not observed. In the two cell lines that have negligible amounts of TP53 protein, PA14C (del -deletion of TP53) and K562 (Q136fs), MGMT protein levels were completely depleted ( Figure 6D ). These data indicate that our hypomorphic TP53 model can predict levels of the downstream gene MGMT.",

Using these powerful gene-regulatory sequences, we show a method of creating hypomorphic mutations that is titratable and predictable (Figures 1,  2, 3, and 4) . We expanded use of poly(A) track insertions to create hypomorphic mutants in integral membrane proteins (Figure 1 ). Integral membrane proteins make up 20%-30% of the proteome with highly diverse functions. Integral membrane proteins constitute the lipid bilayer of the membrane surrounding cellular organelles and the outside of the cell. They modulate movements of molecules and information across membranes and serve essential functions as signal receptors and transporters of solutes. 51, 52 Their importance for cell function is apparent when these systems go awry; a substantial amount of disease-linked mutations occur in integral membrane proteins. Therefore, these proteins make up over 50% of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug targets. As a result of their significance in health and disease, we chose to demonstrate the ability to create hypomorphic mutations in the transmembrane B cell antigen CD20 (Figure 1 ). By inserting 12A or 18A nucleotides directly following the second amino acid, we observed that CD20 mRNA expression was reduced by 50% and 60%, respectively. Protein expression was similarly reduced for both poly(A) track-containing reporters. In addition to successfully reducing CD20 expression using this method, western blot analysis using a CD20 protein-specific antibody indicated expression of the full-length CD20 at the expected size of 33 kDa and the previously observed degradation product at 25 kDa. 29 Furthermore, our live-cell imaging and flow cytometry (Figure 2 ; Figure S1 ) indicated correct membrane localization and programmable reduction of membrane-inserted CD20 protein, supporting our hypothesis that introducing additional adenosine nucleotides at the N terminus of CD20 would not further affect localization and quality of the protein. 54 This result shows that N-terminal addition of the poly(A) track in other membrane genes may successfully create hypomorphic mutants.",

Furthermore, the recent development of CAR-T cell therapies (Chimeric antigen receptor) indicates a need for attenuation of specific cytokines. 57 By creating hypomorphic mutations in alleles, these genes' functions can be examined or modulated, adding to the knowledge and significance of these genes in health and disease. With insertion of poly(A) tracks in these secretory genes, we wanted to ensure that these additions or mutations would not affect protein secretion by affecting the signal peptide's proteolytic cleavage.

            "text": "To test the effect of poly(A) track placement on IL-2 RNA stability and secretion, we created gene reporters containing the complete coding sequence of IL-2 with poly(A) tracks of 9A, 12A, or 18A nucleotides inserted before or after the signal peptide ( Figure 3A) . Placement of the poly(A) track in IL-2 did not affect IL-2 secretion, as shown by the measurable amount and functionality of IL-2 protein in the supernatant of transfected HEK293 cells (Figures 3B and 3D) . The mRNA stability of IL2 and its protein expression were decreased for all constructs irrespective of the location of the poly(A) track insertion. Furthermore, as shown in our previous studies, in which we created hypomorphic reporter genes in eukaryotic cells, the decrease in IL-2 gene expression is titratable, meaning gene knockdown depends on the length of the poly(A) track. 19 Although the magnitude of IL-2 knockdown is greater in constructs with poly(A) tracks inserted after the signal peptide, this difference was not significant (p < 0.05) and was not clearly observed in a functional IL-2 assay (Figures 3B-3D) . However, one can imagine that this discrepancy in IL-2 expression may result from the stalling and frameshifting mechanism of the poly(A) track. 16 Although the translational regulatory nature of the poly(A) track allows a decrease in gene expression for all constructs, the location may have a differential effect based on factors pertaining to mRNA quality control mechanisms. 58 By combining our method with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9-based methods, we can create hypomorphic mutants endogenously. We tested this method by creating endogenous AUF1 and TP53 hypomorphs in diploid HEK293 cells and near-haploid human HAP1 cells, respectively (Figures 3 and 4) . Introduction of 12As in the coding sequence of TP53 led to a decrease of $40% in mRNA stability and protein expression. Endogenous insertion of 36As in the gene locus of the TP53 led to an approximate 90% reduction in mRNA stability, and TP53 protein expression was nearly undetectable by western blot (Figure 3 ). After inserting poly(A) tracks of 12As and 18As in the coding region of AUF1, we saw reductions in the level of gene expression of approximately 40% and 60%, respectively. Protein expression of the four major isoforms (p37 AUF1 , p40 AUF1 , p42 AUF1 , and p45 AUF1 ) showed similar levels of decrease in protein in expression ( Figure 4 ). These results are consistent with previously observed eukaryotic reporter gene poly(A) track insertions of 12As and 36As. 19 The $40% knockdown in TP53 and AUF1 in haploid and diploid cells, respectively, with insertion of 12As in each gene supports the predictability and effectiveness of this tool for various genes and cell types. By creating TP53 hypomorphs in the HAP1 line, we examined the effects of poly(A) track insertion on TP53 expression by mutating a single allele. The ability to create monoallelic hypomorphs using CRISPR-Cas9 and poly(A) tracks provides a feasible and straightforward method for studying phenotypes when expression of one allele is decreased. 59 Moreover, TP53 hypomorphs can be used to create a haploid state in haploid cells, such as HAP1, in which diploidization can occur. 59, 60 Our titratable method for hypomorph creation may be able to maintain the haploid state through a P53 reduction without promoting the G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis that sometimes occur with deletion of P53. 61 When creating titratable CRISPR-Cas9-engineered endogenous hypomorphs, we examined application of this tool for understanding the role of hypomorphic gene expression of AUF1 and TP53 in expression of their downstream targets. After observing the differential effects of addition of 12As or 18As on downregulation of AUF1, we assayed the effect of AUF1 protein reduction on previously defined targets, including MAT1A, APP, TOP2A, and USP1. 25, 62 Because AUF1 has been demonstrated to stabilize or destabilize various targets, we expected that the reduction in AUF1 protein would have differential effects on expression of target mRNAs, depending on their previously established relationships. 63 For example, siRNA-mediated silencing of AUF1 has been shown to stabilize expression of MAT1A. 24 Our results support this relationship between AUF1 and MAT1A. Reduced expression of AUF1 in 12A and 18A hypomorphs lead to a moderate increase in MAT1A transcript expression slightly above WT levels ( Figure 4D) . Similarly, photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis identified post-transcriptional gene regulation of APP, TOP2A, and USP1 by AUF1. 25 AUF1 was found to interact with each mRNA through binding sites in the 3 0 UTR and, together with the HuR protein, regulates translational efficiency and stability of target mRNAs. Our results show that the reduction in mRNA stability of each of these genes is related to the level of AUF1 downregulation, with a stepwise decrease in expression of these targets in 12A and 18A hypomorphs, respectively.",

            "text": "We determined the differential expression of TP53 against several cancer-related genes, including BRCA1, DUSP6, DDIT4, MGMT, and P21 ( Figure 6 ). Most notably, we observed that patterns of decreased TP53 expression do not necessarily correlate with the expression levels for downstream targets regulated by TP53. The differential effects of TP53 hypomorphs on DDIT4 and DUSP6 proteins is more than intriguing, given that these proteins are connected with TP53 status, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, cell metabolism, and proliferation. 45 There were also relatively stable levels of BRCA1 expression in both cells containing 12A or 36A insertions, whereas MGMT and P21 were decreased by more than 85% in both cell lines. Larger downregulation of MGMT and P21 than the level of TP53 expression has been supported by previous studies. 49, 59, 64 Our study allows a more quantitative and tunable approach to investigating the role of TP53 expression levels in modulation of downstream targets, accomplished previously with popular methods such as RNAi. 59 P21 levels under hydroxyurea treatment in TP53 poly(A) track-engineered cells showed a delay in induction compared with WT TP53 cells ( Figure 6C ). 50 In the case of MGMT, our tool's precision and predictability may have utility for uncovering a more cohesive role of TP53 downregulation on MGMT expression and how this regulation affects chemoresistance in certain cancers ( Figure 6D ). 49 The utility of hypomorphic mutants created through poly(A) insertion can be seen in studies elucidating the function of proteins expressed in fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans. A recent study in C. albicans showed a decrease in protein abundance with insertion of poly(A) tracks of different lengths in the lanosterol demethylase (Erg11p) and penta-functional AROM polypeptide (Aro1p), common targets of antifungal agents. 20 The reduction of both genes' protein expression using this method was predictable, with insertion of six or more AAA codons causing a reduction in gene expression. Use of hypomorphic mutants created through poly(A) tracks in the prevalent pathogen, C. albicans, supports this tool's use in pathogenic microbes. With this tool, microbiologists can investigate the phenotypic effects of genetic manipulation in host organisms without use of xenobiotic agents and external environment changes. The results of this study and previous studies showing the effects of poly(A) track gene insertion undoubtedly support this tool's utility. The tool has been shown to be effective in eukaryotic and prokaryotic unicellular and multicellular organisms utilizing reporter constructs and CRISPR-Cas9. We predict that use of CRISPR-Cas9 for introduction of poly(A) tracks and generation of titratable and straightforward hypomorphic mutants will prove invaluable for synthetic biology and genetic studies.",

CD20 positive cells were labelled using anti-CD20-2H7 FITC-labelled antibody. The cell membrane is labeled with CellMask\u2122 Orange stain and the DNA was labeled with Hoechst 33342 stain. White scale bar represents 10 um. The control non-transfected CHO cells are indicated. Selected gRNAs along with number of genomic mismatches to longer and shorter regions of the selected target sequence (long_0,long_1, long_3,short_0) are highlighted in red. SNP (Single nucleotide polymorphism), SNP count, and distance from cut site in base-pairs (BP) are also shown. C. Sequencing results for 12A and 36A single clones, respectively. Results are shown for 2 clones for each insert (12 or 36A), both in the forward direction. In addition to target sequence and gDNAs being represented, the location of the ssODN (fuschia) in shown with both 5' and 3' homology arms (red and blue, respectively). The sequenced results for the region surrounding the polyA track insertion (red underline) is shown.",
