The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was identified in the late 2019 as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , an acute respiratory viral illness. Patients with chronic underlying conditions may have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Kidney transplant recipients may be at a uniquely increased risk of serious complications from COVID-19 as compared to the general population because of a chronically immunosuppressed state and a high prevalence of comorbidities like diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease. Early data suggest that the mortality of patients on dialysis may be comparable to those with kidney transplants, although more research is needed. This concise review aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients, manifestations, appropriate management, and clinical outcomes based on the available literature. Current evidence on many of the specific antiviral measures against COVID-19 has not shown a clear-cut benefit in smaller studies and the results of several ongoing larger clinical trials are awaited. In addition, we also highlight the impact of COVID-19 on kidney transplant center practice and volumes; potential living or deceased donors, recipients; and induction immunosuppression and surgical strategies. comprised 1% of all hospitalized patients with Although these data are not entirely comparable, they suggest that the incidence of COVID-19 in transplant patients is likely to be lower or at least similar to those on dialysis.",

Contact tracing has identified confirmed exposure to a patient with COVID-19 in only 17% of KTRs in a study from New York. 14 However, in a study from the general population from Wuhan, China, 64% of disease clusters were described among family members. 8, 16 Results in these 2 studies may be different because of different degrees of community spread in China and the United States. In addition, patient behavior (with regards to minimizing exposure to infected family members) may also impact these data. In the general population, viral replication typically begins 24-48 h before symptoms and peaks at 3-5 d after symptom onset. 16, 17 It has been suggested that compared to the general population, viral shedding may be prolonged to up to 28 d in patients with kidney transplants. 18 Although it is not known whether this virus may be infectious or not, this has implications for patients with regards to return to work, for exposure to clinical environments, and to healthcare providers. 19 ",

Mobile platforms like Abbot ID NOW molecular point-of-care device typically run 1 sample at a time and are useful for bedside testing and to perform tests in remote areas. Facilitybased platforms like Cepheid GeneXpert Xpress have higher throughput and yield results in less than an hour.

[5] [6] [7] 18, 33 The onset of symptoms has ranged widely from 1 d to 3 wk before the diagnosis. In 1 study on KTRs, fevers were noted to be less common (58%) compared with studies from the general population. 6 Although the initial study by Zhu et al 18 from Wuhan in SOT recipients described disease severity according to the Chinese CDC classification, other disease severity classifications have been used by other authors (Table 1 ). In the study from New York by Pereira et al, 5 44% of 46 KTRs had critical and 34 (54%) had mild to moderate disease. 14 On the other hand, in the Wuhan study, 8 of 10 KTRs (80%) had moderate-severe disease. In 2 separate studies from New York, 78% KTRs required hospitalization and 34% required ICU stay. 6, 14 The median length of hospital stay has ranged from 4.5 d to a much longer duration in another study with 43% KTRs still hospitalized at a 3-wk period. In a newly published study from New York on the outpatient management of COVID-19, of 41 patients, 13 patients (32%) required hospitalization a median of 8 d (range, 1-16) after symptom onset, and 23 (56%) had outpatient symptom resolution a median of 12 d (4-23) after onset. 34 Despite the heterogeneity of case descriptions, it does appear that the incidence of severe complications of COVID-19 may be higher in KTRs than the general population in various studies. [5] [6] [7] 18, 33 These complications may include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation (27%-39% patients) and severe acute kidney injury that necessitated the initiation of dialysis (20%-40%). The median time to intubation was reported as 5 d posthospitalization in 1 study. 14 Other reported complications include rhabdomyolysis, myocarditis, bacterial superinfection, and atrial fibrillation.",

            "text": "Early data from the general population suggest that COVID-19 may cause viral infection of different renal cells resulting in nephritis. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry; both endothelial cells and podocytes express ACE2. Glomerular changes and nephritis-like histology have been described in postmortem samples from patients with COVID-19. 35 A case series from the general population reported that >40% of cases had proteinuria on hospital admission. 36 Acute kidney injury (AKI) has also been reported to be common among critically ill patients with COVID-19, affecting approximately 20%-40% of patients admitted to intensive care. 4 In another study from China, 75% of hospitalized patients had abnormal urinalysis or AKI. 37 Although a majority of these patients had resolution of proteinuria (69%) and/or AKI (46%), renal involvement was associated with an increased mortality (11% versus 1% in those without renal involvement). Recent case reports have described collapsing glomerulopathy as well as thrombotic microangiopathy. 38, 39 The limited literature from kidney transplants suggests a similar or a higher incidence of AKI as well as proteinuria. 7 These data are limited by the absence of previous baseline parameters to clarify whether proteinuria was a new onset. Similarly, it is unclear whether the AKI is secondary to hemodynamic alterations or a direct infection by SARS-CoV-2. An interesting case report from a kidney transplant patient showed evidence of endothelialitis in the transplanted kidney. 40 It is unknown whether COVID-19 may be immunomodulatory and trigger acute rejection. It is, however, plausible that the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) associated with COVID-19 combined with a reduction in IS medications may predispose KTR to AR. 41 ",

The first one is an international COVID-19 Solid Organ Transplant Registry (www.C19TxR.org). 44 As of May 20, 2020, a total of 592 SOT patients have been reported. A majority of these were reported from the United States and the United Kingdom. Of these 592, 530 (90%) were in kidney transplant patients. Among the 405 KTRs that had received treatment, 46 (15%) have recovered and 58 (14%) died. Another registry study being organized by the University of Washington is actively collecting data.

Tocilizumab (and other IL-6 blockers) has been tried with variable success in KTRs with moderate-severe disease or in patients with high IL-6 levels. 50 Whether additional immunosuppression with IL-6 blockade would provide increased benefit in immunosuppressed KTRs is controversial and a subject of ongoing research.

Transplant clinicians have generally extrapolated the evidence in managing other life-threatening infections in KTRs to COVID-19, which involves a reduction of overall IS. 60 The primary aim of IS management in SOT recipients is a balance between the risk of rejection and complications of overimmunosuppression, such as worsening of COVID-19 complications and superinfections. KTRs with COVID-19 should have their IS management reduced based on factors such as age, time since transplant, sensitization level, previous rejection episodes, and the severity of COVID-19. It has been hypothesized that CNIs can lead to immune modulation against the virus and thus may be beneficial in reducing the cytokine release storm that is frequently seen with COVID-19. 61 Thus, cautious reduction rather than complete elimination of immunosuppression may avoid precipitation of severe complications like ARDS. This, however, remains to be proven in clinical studies.",

In addition, reduction of other agents such as antimetabolites (mycophenolate or azathioprine) by 50% should be considered. Those with moderate-severe disease may benefit from further reduction in IS with target CNI trough goals to ~25%-50% and temporary cessation of their antimetabolites. Steroid dosage ideally should be left unchanged in patients with mild-moderate disease. In those with critical disease (ARDS or requiring mechanical ventilation), consideration may be given to intravenous methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone in an attempt to suppress CRS, although there is inadequate evidence to support this practice. 6, 50 Patients who have a rapid clinical deterioration to ARDS or septic shock may need withdrawal of all immunosuppression, especially if they are coinfected with other organisms and/or stress dose steroids are being concomitantly administered. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Patients on maintenance belatacept may need to have their monthly dose held especially if they have moderate or severe disease. Therapy could generally be resumed on their previous monthly schedule once they are symptom free. For patients that have recovered, it remains unknown whether and when the CNI and antimetabolite dose should be reincreased back to baseline. Extrapolation from the management of other infections suggests that it should be reasonable to cautiously reinstitute the preinfection IS regimen once the patients starts improving clinically.",

Thus, we recommend standard prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular heparin (adjusted for renal function) or unfractionated heparin for hospitalized KTR with no active thromboses. Some authors describe the use of direct thrombin inhibitors among patients with severe disease and D-dimer >3 \u00b5g/mL. 5 Complement is an integral component of the innate immune response to viruses and an instigator of proinflammatory responses. 73 A recent study of SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, found that activation of complement component C3 exacerbates disease in SARS-CoV-associated ARDS. 74 Although there are numerous pathways for renal injury due to coronavirus, complement activation may play a significant role. Case reports describing renal endothelialitis and thrombotic microangiopathy support this association. 38, 40 Currently, there are no published data on the effect of complement inhibitors, but there are several ongoing clinical trials that may shed some light on the topic. 75 Augmentation of Immune System, Specific immunotherapy, and Adoptive Immune therapy Although a functional immune system is essential for combating infection, the role of augmenting the immune response is still unclear. Several vitamins, nutrients, and cofactors are thought to improve immune function. For example, zinc-deficient patients may be at an increased risk of viral infections. 76 It seems reasonable to test for deficiencies and provide supplementation to those patients, but there are no data on safety and efficacy of these approaches.",

Limited data have shown that viral RNA could be detected in plasma or serum from COVID-19 patients. In the first 41 patients in the city of Wuhan, viremia was found only in 6 of 41 (15%) patients. 89 The following points may be relevant to considerations regarding organ transplantation: (1) viral RNA in plasma or serum could be detected in COVID-19 patients on the first 2 or 3 d after the onset of symptoms; (2) most patients, especially younger adults who can donate organs, had milder symptoms than the older adults; and (3) the rate of infectivity of patients who are in the incubation period remains uncertain, and there are no data on the viral load in plasma, serum, or lymphocytes among individuals in the incubation period. Despite this, there are no reported cases of transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to date. Nevertheless, COVID-19 testing for all asymptomatic live kidney and most deceased donors before transplantation is currently being recommended, especially when the turnaround time is reasonable. 90 However, its impact on organ utilization rates and actual transmission is unknown owing to the presence of false negatives. The use of chest computerized tomography scans on deceased donors who test PCR negative should be based on individual donor's history and the level of community spread.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges that include unclear efficacy of current investigational therapies in transplant populations, lack of data driven optimal immunosuppression management, historic delay in vaccine deployment for immunocompromised hosts related to safety or efficacy, and ethical dilemmas in organ allocation and healthcare resource constraints.",
