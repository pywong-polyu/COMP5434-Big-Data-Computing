Here we show Anoctamin 9, a cation channel activated by cAMP/PKA pathway, is expressed in the OE and amplifies olfactory signals. Ano9deficient mice had reduced olfactory behavioral sensitivity, electro-olfactogram signals, and neural activity in the olfactory bulb. In line with the difference in olfaction between birds and other vertebrates, chick ANO9 failed to respond to 10 odorants, whereas chick CNGA2, a major transduction channel, showed greater responses to cAMP. Importantly, single-cell transcriptome data from Covid-19 patients revealed that Ano9 transcripts were markedly suppressed among genes in the olfactory signal pathway. The signal amplification by ANO9 is essential for mammalian olfactory transduction, whose downregulation may be a risk factor 15 for the olfactory dysfunction in Covid-19 patients.",

The presence of Ano9 mRNA along with transcripts of main 20 olfactory signaling genes and Anoctamins in the mouse and human OE was quantified by a quantitative PCR (Extended Data Fig. 1) . Ano9 transcripts were observed in both human and mouse OE. Its expression levels were relatively constant between the two species.

We sought to determine if chick olfactory signal transduction is different from mammals. Based on the dendrogram analysis of ANO9 across different species, we found that vertebrate ANO9 orthologs share a gross similarity in amino-acid sequence (51 ~ 88% sequence identities to mouse ANO9) (Fig. 5a) . Interestingly, unlike other vertebrates, the residue corresponding to Ser245 of mouse ANO9 essential for 20 the cAMP/PKA activation is substituted with alanine in chick ANO9 (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that chick ANO9 may not be functional in olfaction. Chick ANO9 has 747 amino acids and shows a 51% sequence identity with mouse ANO9. Upon whole-cell formation in HEK 293T cells transfected with chick Ano9 and mouse Olfr556, 1-heptanol failed to induce currents (Fig. 5d, e) . We then constructed a chimera that has a chick Ano9 5 backbone with an insertion of the 16 amino acids of mouse Ano9 flanking the Ser245 residue (Fig. 5c) . The chimeric Ano9 was activated nicely by the odorant when expressed in HEK293T cells with mouse Olfr556 (Fig. 5d, e) . We also checked the functionality of chick CNG channels. Chick and mouse CNGA2 orthologs have an 83% sequence identity. The presence of chick CNGA2 was confirmed with RT-PCR analysis 10 in the chick OE (Fig. 5f) . In contrast to chick ANO9, chick CNGA2 was activated by intracellular cAMP (Fig. 5g) . Importantly, the current response of chick CNGA2 to 100 \uf06dM cAMP was much greater than that of mouse CNGA2 (Fig. 5g, h) . The activation kinetics of chick CNGA2 was different from that of mouse CNGA2 as chick CNGA2 was activated rapidly by cAMP (Fig. 5g) . Also, chick ANO9 failed to amplify the cAMP-15 induced currents of chick CNGA2 in (Fig. 5g, h) . Moreover, the chick-mouse chimeric Ano9 showed a higher Ser-phosphorylation level than that of chick ANO9 (Extended Data Fig. 5b) . These results suggest that the native chick CNGA2 is functional in olfaction, whereas chick ANO9 is non-functional. Thus, birds appear to have a different mechanism for odorant signal transduction. 20",

We then checked single-cell gene profiling data obtained from 5 healthy control and Covid-19 participants (Chan Zuckerburg initiative single-cell Covid-19 consortia, http://covid19cellatlas.org) 42 . Among tissues sampled by the consortium, we analyzed a dataset collected with nasopharyngeal swabs from 37 patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and 21 controls obtained at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was conducted on 32,588 10 cells collected from the nasopharyngeal swabs, which annotated 18 cell types (Fig. 6b ) 42 . Among the annotated cell types, \"Ciliated Cells\" were selected for the gene analysis because OSNs have a ciliary region at the apical end. This cell-type cluster contains 4,703 cells from the control and 5,356 cells from the Covid-19 patients (Fig. 6b) .",

Thus, we filtered out cells that showed high contents (>15%) of mitochondrially derived genes, assuming these cells were in a poor condition for scRNA-seq analysis 44, 45 . This left a data set of 3,306 cells \u00d7 32,871 genes for COVID-19 patients and 3,000 cells \u00d7 32,871 genes for controls. To identify differentially 20 expressed genes relevant to the olfactory signaling, transcript levels of OR genes, ion channels, and other signaling proteins were compared for their differential expression between controls and Covid-19 patients. Among these genes, Ano9 showed a marked reduction in expression (28.0% reduction, p < 0.001, the MAST hurdle model test) in the Covid-19 patient group compared to that of controls (Fig. 6c) . However, the annotated 'Ciliated cells' also included ciliary cells of the respiratory epithelia. Thus, we narrowed down the putative OSNs. We counted cells positive for the Gnal or Stoml3 gene, representative marker genes for mature OSNs 46 . These cell clusters contained 5 1,661 and 2,196 cells for control and Covid-19 patient groups, respectively. In this cell cluster, Ano9 was significantly reduced in the Covid-19 patient group (23.0%, p < 0.001, the MAST hurdle model test) (Fig. 6d) . Other genes such as Cnga4, Cngb1, and Prkaca were significantly increased, whereas Gnal was significantly decreased in the patient's group ( Table I) . The number of cells with Ano2, Cnga2, Prkacg, and individual OR genes 10 were too small to count for statistical comparison. In this data set, we also compared the levels of Ano9 in other cell types such as \"Sustentacular cells\" and \"Basal Cells\". Sustentacular cells are known to support and protect OSNs in the OE, whereas basal cells are precursor cells for sustentacular or OSNs 47 . Sustentacular cells were defined if cells excluded from basal cells, blood-borne cells, and OSNs were positive with Sox2 15 and CYP2A13 genes, marker genes for sustentacular cells 46 . Sustentacular cell clusters contained 282 and 2083 cells for control and Covid-19 patient groups, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6e , the Ano9 mRNA level in the sustentacular-cell cluster from the Covid-19 patient group was significantly lower than that of the control group, whereas the Ano9 mRNA level in the basal-cell cluster was comparable in both groups 20 ( Fig. 6e, f) .",

ANO4 is also a calcium-dependent cation channel (Reichhart et al., 2019).

Odorants were delivered to the turbinate through a computer-controlled air injection system (HSPC-2-SB, ALA Scientific Instruments) with an approximate flow rate of 0.2 ml/sec. The reference Ag/AgCl electrode was placed in the bath. A glass pipette electrode for recording was 5 pulled with a micropipette puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments) followed by polishing the tip of the pipette with a microforge (MF-830, Narishige, Japan). The glass pipette was filled with the 0.9%-agar containing Ringer's saline. Evoked extracellular voltage was recorded from the surface of turbinates IIb or III and amplified with a differential amplifier (DP-304, Warner Instruments). The output signals of the amplifier were filtered at 10 10 kHz. The electrical signals were digitized at 500 Hz and analyzed using pClamp 10.",

Depending on the ethnicity and condition of the 15 studies, the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in Covid-19 patients varies from 47.9 to 85.6% 14,17,75 . Thus, about two-thirds of Covid-19 patients suffer from anosmia. Even though about a third of Covid-19 patients may not be anosmic, we still see a reduction in Ano9 mRNA level in OSNs of the Covid-19 patients. The change in the Ano9 expression may be greater than observed in this study If the Ano9 mRNA level is 20 checked only in the anosmic patients. This downregulation of Ano9 may contribute to the Covid-19-associated anosmia. However, the route and underlying mechanisms for the downregulation are not known. A subset of supporting cells in the human OE, but not OSNs, express ACE2, the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein receptor 47 , arguing against direct infection of the coronavirus in OSNs. However, low-level expression of ACE2 can induce SARS-CoV2 entry 76 . Or, paracrine effects from virus-infected supporting cells would account for the downregulation of Ano9 45,47 . 5 In summary, ANO9 expressed in the OE augments the odorant-induced olfactory signals via the cAMP/PKA pathway. The amplifying action of ANO9 contributes to olfactory function because ANO9-deficient mice showed impairment of olfaction. In addition, ANO9 may be a risk factor of Covid-19-associated anosmia because Ano9 10 mRNA level is substantially reduced in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells of Covid-19patients. These results now suggest that ANO9 actively participates in the olfactory signaling in the OE.",

All cadavers stored at Catholic Institute for Applied Anatomy qualified as materials for education and research according to domestic law. The Institutional Steering Committee approved cadaver use for this research on March 10, 2021 (Approval number: R21-A005). Animals Animal use was approved by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources of the 5 Korea Institute of Science and Technology. Adult male and female C57BL/6 background, transgenic, and Ano9 KO mice were used for electrophysiological recordings, in-vivo Ca 2+ imaging, or behavioral tests. In standard housing conditions, mice were housed in groups (two to five mice per cage) in an open-top cage system. Water and food were available ad libitum. All animals were kept at light and dark in a 12-hour cycle. 10 For the generation of Ano9 fl/fl mice, two loxP sites were introduced within the ANO9 locus by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The first and second loxPs were inserted to introns 7-8 and 9-10, respectively. Cas9 nuclease, validated sgRNAs, and donor template containing loxP sites were co-injected into single-cell C57BL/6 zygotes. The loxP regions of the mouse were confirmed after genotyping DNAs extracted from the 15 mouse tail. To delete Ano9 in the whole body, the mice genotyped for the presence of the loxP sites (Ano9 fl/fl ) were crossed with B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J (CMV-cre) to produce CMV-cre;Ano9 fl/mice.

The cAMP, in turn, opens CNG channels. Olfactory CNG channels in OSNs consist of three subunits: CNGA2, CNGA4, and CNGB1 32,52,53 with a stoichiometry of two CNGA2, a CNGA4, and a CNGB1b 30 . Genetic disruption of Cnga2 induces almost complete loss of EOG responses to odorants 6 , implying that CNG channels are 20",
