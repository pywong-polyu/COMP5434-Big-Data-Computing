Among patients with vaccine hesitancy, 59% worry about adverse effects and 53% believe that the vaccine is too new. 2 We hope that family medicine physicians will provide reassurance to the public to increase their acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines. Full approval of all of the COVID-19 vaccines by the US Food and Drug Administration is expected and this action surely will address vaccine hesitancy for a proportion of those remaining unvaccinated.",

Previous examples include the increase in racial inequality in mortality following the introduction of lifesaving innovations for the human immunodeficiency virus, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and hepatitis C. 4 Many patients with vaccine hesitancy believe in their individual right to remain unvaccinated. Family physicians may wish to discuss the issue of balancing individual rights with personal responsibilities when vaccine hesitancy is driven by this concern. For example, cigarette smokers have the right to die from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease, but they also have a responsibility not to increase these risks to others.",

First, the case-fatality rate for influenza is >30 times lower than that for COVID-19. ( for influenza but approaches 95% for COVID-19. Fourth, the COVID-19 vaccine offers almost complete protection against hospitalization and death. For every 100 deaths from COVID-19, up to 99 occur among unvaccinated people. Fifth, he overall safety profile patterned a lower risk of serious adverse events following immunizations with mRNA vaccines compared with influenza vaccines. 6 Fortunately, the unprecedented collaborative and coordinated efforts of academia, industry, government, and the regulatory authorities have fostered the extraordinarily rapid development of multiple highly effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines and their widespread manufacture and distribution to the US population in <1 year. Unfortunately, however, even these enormous successes in 2021 will not be sufficient to mitigate and control COVID-19 in 2022. Successful mitigation and control of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2022 will require the achievement of much higher vaccination rates throughout the United States, along with the production and distribution of sufficient quantities of vaccine throughout the world.",

Family physicians must play crucial and major roles to mitigate further increases in COVID-19 in the southern states and throughout the country by counseling all of their patients about the urgent need to increase vaccination rates now. Future hospitalizations and deaths will continue to be determined by the numbers of patients that become fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as additional variants emerge, both in the United States and worldwide. Specifically, the clinical and public health challenges to mitigate and contain COVID-19 in the United States require achieving higher rates of vaccination before the catastrophic emergence and spread of newer variant strains resistant to the current vaccines.",
