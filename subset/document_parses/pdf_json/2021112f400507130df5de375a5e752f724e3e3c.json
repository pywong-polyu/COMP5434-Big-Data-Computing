This would make it the worst crisis since the 1930s, and for Europe possibly the worst crisis ever. 1 And this is just the mild scenario, predicated on the IMF's assumption that the pandemic will gradually recede in the second half of this year (despite the fact that a good many leading virologists expect a second and even a third wave of the coronavirus). 2 The ECB now expects the eurozone economies to contract by between 5 per cent and 15 per cent. 3 Feverish consultations are under way at all levels of our globalized world order to decide on measures to tackle this unprecedented crisis. As always, a great deal of consultation and advice is being provided at the international level, for example, by the World Health Organization (WHO) and at the meetings of the G20 and G7. The IMF and its sister organization the World Bank are providing concrete financial support as well. The IMF's current lending capacity is USD 1000 billion. No fewer than 189 countries are members of the IMF. Over 100 countries have already applied for emergency financial aid. 4 The World Bank focuses largely on providing aid to Africa and developing countries elsewhere, and has currently made a maximum of USD 160 billion available. 5 No matter how mind-boggling these amounts may be, the concrete actions are being taken mainly at the national level. Examples are the various forms of financial support for businesses and people currently sitting at home jobless, as well as tax payment deferrals. 6 According to IMF estimates, national governments have already spent about USD 8000 billion on containing the crisis, and this amount is certain to rise as the various national rounds of emergency support are now following one another in quick succession. 7 Governments are not shunning unconventional measures to finance all their additional expenditure. For example, the Bank of England has already switched to monetary 1 The New York Times, 'EU Is Facing Worst Crisis Ever.

Normally, the UK would have to borrow money for this by selling government bonds to the investing public through the capital markets. Monetary financing is highly controversial, since it increases the total amount of money in circulation. In extreme cases, this can lead to hyperinflation of the kind that affected Zimbabwe (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) and Venezuela (since 2018). Monetary financing can also undermine the independence of the central bank. 9 And what action has the EU taken to deal with the coronavirus crisis? Public health and national security may be areas of national policy, but a lot of hard work is also going on at the European level. But, as ever, this is being done in typical Brussels fashion. That is to say, much is done by a process of trial and error, and the really important decisions are put off until the pressure becomes so great that they have to be taken to avert the disintegration of the Union. The obvious comparison is to the eurozone debt crisis (2009-2012), although then the process of taking important European decisions proved excruciatingly slow. Clearly, however, this was another 'sink or swim' moment for the EU, or in any event for the eurozone. Unlike its British counterpart, the ECB does not have the power to directly finance national governments or the EU by purchasing government bonds as soon as they are issued, 10 but it was and still is able to do something very similar. The ECB managed to save the euro in 2012 by declaring that it was willing to buy government bonds of the eurozone countries on a massive scale through the secondary markets (this was the famous 'whatever it takes' pronouncement of the then ECB president Mario Draghi 11 ). The ECB actually started implementing this policy in 2015. 12 In this way, interest rates on these government bonds were kept under control, and the government deficits run-up as a result of the massive financial support for ailing national banking sectors could continue to be financed by the eurozone countries on reasonable terms through the issuance of government bonds. Since then, the ECB has never actually stopped its indirect purchases of eurozone government bonds. On 24 March, the ECB decided to take matters a stage further by waiving certain restrictions imposed by previous asset purchase programmes, on this occasion to ensure that the Member States were able to continue financing their 8 See <https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hm-treasury-and-bank-of-england-announce-temporary-extension-of-the-ways-a nd-means-facility> accessed 21 May 2020, (9 April 2020). The Bank of England is also taking all kinds of other measures to deal with the coronavirus crisis; see <https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/coronavirus> accessed 21 May 2020. It should be noted that monetary financing is now spreading rapidly throughout the world. See massive support programmes during the pandemic (the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), which is dealt with below in Section 12). 13 The procedure adopted by the ECB for this type of asset purchase programme is roughly as follows. In cooperation with the national central banks of the eurozone, it purchases government bonds on the secondary market from the commercial banks, which in turn buy them from their government upon issuance. Not only does this keep interest rates on government bonds low, but it also creates room on commercial bank balance sheets to issue new loans to businesses and households. In this way, the ECB hopes to stimulate economic activity and raise the rate of inflation up to its target figure of just under 2 per cent. This constitutes price stability, which is the main objective of the monetary policy with which the ECB is charged. 14 That, at any rate, is the theory, but it by no means goes unchallenged, because there remains considerable doubt about the effectiveness of this type of asset purchase programme. 15 Be that as it may, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) confirmed, in response to requests from the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) for a preliminary ruling on previous asset purchase programmes, that they are, in principle, permitted, basically because their primary purpose is maintaining price stability. The mere fact that such purchase programmes also provide economic support for the eurozone countries does not necessarily mean that they violate the monetary financing prohibition. In its final judgment in the Gauweiler case, the German Constitutional Court had accepted-albeit reluctantly-this judgment of the CJEU, and many hoped that it would do the same in the Weiss case. 16 However, things turned out differently because on 5 May 2020 the Constitutional Court ruled that the ECB had exceeded its mandate by initiating an asset purchase programme known as the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP), or alternatively as the Quantitative Easing (QE) Programme, in 2015. The German Constitutional Court arrived at this judgment, in brief, because the underlying ECB decision was not assessed sufficiently rigorously by reference to the European principle of proportionality. The Constitutional Court has given the ECB three months in which to adopt a new decision based on better reasoning. If the ECB fails to do so, the Bundesbank will no longer be allowed to participate in the PSPP. 17 This is a historic ruling because it is the first time the German Constitutional Court has declared a judgment of the CJEU to be invalid. This means that the long-dormant power struggle between the German Constitutional Court, on the one hand, and the CJEU and the ECB, on the other, has now flared up in all its intensity. If the ECB complies with the Constitutional Court's request, this will undermine not only the independence of the ECB but also the supremacy of the CJEU. Generally speaking, the CJEU never comments on judgments of national courts, but following the judgment delivered by the German Constitutional Court it issued a press release on 8 May in which it recalled that (i) preliminary rulings of the CJEU are binding on national courts, and (ii) the CJEU alone has jurisdiction to rule that an act of an EU institution is contrary to EU law, as the unity of the EU legal order and legal certainty would otherwise be placed in jeopardy. 18 Shortly afterwards the European Commission announced that it considers infringement proceedings against Germany. 19 The ruling of the Constitutional Court in any event also calls into question the legitimacy of the recently started PEPP (see Section 12 below).",

            "text": "Another point that should be noted here is the rapid creation of the European Banking Union (EBU) in response to the eurozone crisis. This meant that the significant banks in the eurozone were placed under the direct prudential supervision of the ECB (first pillar of the Banking Union). In the event of their failure, a European authority (the Single Resolution Board) is responsible for their orderly resolution (second pillar). 20 Had it not been for the eurozone crisis, this historic transfer of competences from the national to the European level would never have occurred. So a crisis can also result in greater centralization. It is not for nothing that the idea of Eurobonds now features prominently once again on the European political agenda. But there are also important differences between the present crisis and the eurozone crisis. The eurozone crisis had its origins in the 2008 crisis in the financial sector, which subsequently impacted national governments and the rest of the economy. In contrast, the current crisis is a healthcare crisis, which is engulfing the economy as a whole, including the financial sector. Moreover, according to the IMF, the losses are now much greater than in 2008. 21 What follows is a discussion of the most noteworthy measures taken or yet to be taken by the EU to combat the coronavirus crisis. Basically, the measures fall into the following categories: (i) flexible application of EU rules that could hinder Member States in their strenuous efforts to save their national economies (Sections 2-4); (ii) a financial support package put in place by the EU itself (Sections 5-11); (iii) monetary action by the ECB (Section 12); and (iv) action by European financial regulators, including the ECB (albeit in its capacity of banking regulator rather than monetary authority) (Section 13). 22 This is followed by some comments on the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the intended completion of the EBU (Section 14), the plans for a European Capital Markets Union (CMU; Section 15), Brexit (Section 16) and the EU climate plans (Section 17). Lastly, I make some concluding remarks (Section 18).",

Eurozone Member States agreed on stricter rules to ensure the stability of the euro. After all, Eurozone countries in which public sector deficits rise will have to pay higher interest rates on their government bonds, thereby possibly weakening the euro due to excessive inflation. Specifically, it was agreed that a budget deficit should not exceed 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and the total public debt should not exceed 60 per cent of GDP. It is no secret that these rules are regularly breached. Sanctions can then be imposed, for example, in the form of a fine, but in practice, this never happens. 23 Usually, the European Commission (and the other eurozone countries) make do with issuing a warning, making recommendations and, above all, engaging in a lot of grumbling. So on that score, anyway, there seems little cause for disquiet. Moreover, no matter how strict the budget rules may be in theory, they can be temporarily suspended in periods of severe economic difficulty for the euro area or the Union as a whole. Given the gravity of the coronavirus crisis, this is undoubtedly now the case. On 20 March, the European Commission, therefore, announced that in its view the conditions for activating this general escape clause had been met. 24 And on 9 April, the Eurogroup signalled its agreement. 25 Member States thus have the requisite flexibility, even under the SGP, to support the national economy.",

Moreover, the fact that the northern Member States have deeper pockets than their southern neighbours means that the inequality is bound to increase. 30 It should be noted, by the way, that the Commission is currently handling applications under state aid rules with unprecedented speed and applying the rules in a generous spirit. 31",

This allows EUR 37 billion of cohesion policy funding to be used to tackle the consequences of the coronavirus crisis. In addition, the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund has been broadened to such an extent that it can also be used in public health crises. Since 1 April, the worst-affected countries have thus been given access to additional financial assistance of up to EUR 800 million for 2020. 33 On 2 April, the Commission made proposals to allow EU funds to be used even more flexibly (CRII\u00fe), for instance, by (i) enabling transfers between cohesion policy funds, categories of region and policy objectives, (ii) waiving the obligation for national cofinancing, and (iii) supporting the most vulnerable in society, for example, by providing food packages. 34 CRII\u00fe entered into force on 24 April. 35 6.

The Commission is encouraging the individual Member States to help maximize the effectiveness of these instruments. Individuals and foundations can also contribute to this, possibly through crowdfunding. The Commission will use the funds for a variety of purposes, including (i) central procurement and distribution of medical supplies such as face masks and respiratory equipment, (ii) transport of medical equipment and patients in cross-border regions and (iii) construction of mobile field hospitals. In the medium and long term, the Commission intends to use the funds to increase coronavirus testing capacity and fund coronavirus research. 37",

This leaves an amount of EUR 300 billion. While that may sound a lot, in reality it is little more than a drop in the ocean. The financial situation is becoming increasingly acute, especially for southern eurozone countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece. So much so, in fact, that they may possibly be unable to overcome the coronavirus crisis on their own. Their national debt was already high and is now rising further at breathtaking speed (although this is also true, of course, of the northern countries). Despite the ECB's PEPP (see Section 12 below), the interest rates that these Member States have to pay on their government bonds are still rising, 46 while their tax revenues will continue to fall as the economy slumps. Moreover, these countries depend for a considerable part of their GDP on tourism, and tourists are staying away for the time being. Not only because they are currently not welcome on account of the lockdowns, but also out of fear of the virus. Another factor is the impact of the crisis on the incomes of the hordes of holidaymakers from the northern Member States, many of whom will stay away for that reason as well. 47 The Eurogroup too is aware of this, which is why the final statement included a passage that a European reconstruction fund (Recovery Fund) should be created. The Eurogroup remains vague about the exact legal structure, the relationship with the new European multiannual budget (2021-2027) and, especially, the manner of financing. And, as already noted, the final statement contains a reference to the use of 'innovative financial instruments'. 48 The knives were already out in the run-up to the summit of European government leaders on 23 April. European Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis announced in the German business newspaper Handelsblatt that the European Commission was contemplating the idea of a reconstruction fund of EUR 1500 billion. This short-term fund would have to raise money on the capital markets through bonds guaranteed by the eurozone countries. The fund could then lend the money on favourable terms to those Member States that need it to restore their corona-ravaged economies. 49 France is one of the 45 See <https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/23/conclusions-by-president-charles-michel-follow ing-the-video-conference-with-members-of-the-european-council-on-23-april-2020/> accessed 21 May 2020, (23 April 2020 countries that endorses this plan. 50 In a non-paper issued prior to the summit, Spain put forward the idea that the Recovery Fund should provide grants rather than loans to Member States in need so as to avoid raising their national public debt to excessive levels.",

On 18 May, France and Germany tabled a joint proposal that the Commission should borrow EUR 500 billion through the capital markets and channel the proceeds to the affected Member States as grants. The money would be borrowed by raising the EU's Own Resources ceiling (i.e. the maximum amount that can be called upon from the member states) and using it as a guarantee. This arrangement would be given a fixed expiration date and the loans would be paid back after the next long-term budget, which ends in 2027. On 23 May Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden published a counterproposal opposing grants and endorsing a 'loans for loans' approach. On 27 May the Commission formally proposed a EUR 750 billion recovery fund, which would provide EUR 500 billion in grants to countries hit hardest by the crisis, and make another EUR 250 billion available as loans. The grants portion largely tracks the Franco-German proposal outlined above.

As the ECB is purchasing the government bonds on the secondary market from the commercial banks, this is also creating lending capacity on the balance sheets of commercial banks for the provision of new loans to businesses and households. 54 As already noted, significant doubts remain as to the effectiveness of this type of asset purchase programme. Although this is indeed a way of creating lending capacity on the balance sheets of commercial banks, it is to be hoped that they will lend only to parties that are essentially creditworthy, for one thing because they may otherwise be in danger of breaching their duty of care on account of imprudent lending (overextension of credit). 55 Naturally, however, the situation may be very different if the loans are fully covered by government guarantees. In any event, the creditworthiness of many businesses and households in the eurozone is in a parlous state as a consequence of the crisis, despite all the financial support offered by the Member States and the EU. According to the IMF, it is quite possible that lending may be impaired by a global credit crunch if the pandemic does not fade away in the second half of this year, as assumed in the IMF's baseline scenario. 56 Be that as it may, the PEPP's current maximum size is EUR 750 billion and the programme is available, for the time being, until the end of 2020. It is important to note that certain restrictions that applied to previous purchase programmes have been waived in the case of the PEPP. The absence of these restrictions is precisely why the ECB's PEPP decision is even more vulnerable to new legal proceedings brought before the German Constitutional Court. This is because the Constitutional Court, in its judgment of 5 May, held that one of the reasons why the PSPP, which was the subject of the litigation, did not circumvent the European prohibition on monetary financing was because these restrictions were observed in that programme. 57 It remains to be seen whether the Constitutional Court decides otherwise in any proceedings regarding the PEPP, given that this programme's express purpose is to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis.",

            "text": "Whatever the case, according to the ECB decision on the PEPP, the purchase of government bonds no longer has to take place in a neutral manner, in other words more or less in proportion to the size of the eurozone economies. 58 This suggests that the ECB could purchase mainly Italian, Greek and Spanish government bonds because those are the countries in greatest need. Moreover, the ECB is now also willing to buy Greek sovereign bonds, despite their junk-rating. 59 Another noteworthy relaxation is that the ECB no longer considers itself bound by the self-imposed limit that it may not purchase more than a third of a country's total sovereign debt and no more than a third of the outstanding amount per bond. 60 Whether this relaxation will find favour with the German Constitutional Court remains to be seen. The ECB had previously imposed these limits on itself in order to avoid becoming a blocking minority in the event of a bondholder vote on a possible debt restructuring. The position is as follows. In economic terms, a restructuring amounts to a partial cancellation of sovereign debt. If the ECB cancels sovereign debt, it violates the prohibition on direct monetary financing. 61 After the problems with Greece in 2013, it was decided that government bonds issued by the eurozone countries should contain a restructuring clause. Clauses of this kind (collective action clauses 62 ) provide that a given percentage (often 33 per cent) of the outstanding amount of the bond constitutes a blocking minority. So if the ECB holds 33 per cent or more of this type of debt, it may not agree to a proposed restructuring since this would constitute a breach of the prohibition on monetary financing. This would, therefore, block the restructuring. However, market parties do expect the ECB to adhere to the 33 per cent limit as much as possible in order to avoid problems. 63 In brief, these are fairly far-reaching relaxations compared with previous asset purchase programmes and it is very debatable whether they will meet with the approval of the German Constitutional Court. But quite apart from this, the PEPP is not a miracle cure, not only because banks will hopefully lend money only to basically creditworthy parties (see above), but also because the interest that Member States such as Italy have to pay on their government bonds will still continue to rise. 64 balance sheets must continue to give a true and fair view of the financial position. By letter of 1 April, the ECB asked the significant eurozone banks, when applying the international accounting rules, to take into account a potential rebound of the economy in 2020. 69 Financial reporting specialists warn that guidance of this kind from regulators is extremely dangerous because IFRS 9 requires banks to predict their own financial health, and that of the money they lend, by reference to independent macroeconomic measures such as GDP or unemployment rates. 70 Be that as it may, the various measures taken by the European financial regulators were confirmed on 28 April and elaborated in an Interpretative Communication issued by the European Commission. 71 On the same day, the Commission published a proposal for a Regulation to relax the EU banking rules in connection with the coronavirus crisis. 72",

For example, there is a long laundry list of reporting obligations with which financial institutions must comply, not only in relation to national and European regulators but also in relation to the financial markets. The coronavirus crisis has increased the pressure on staff. Things are not fundamentally different in the financial sector. Staff who are still healthy have to do not only their own work but also that of their sick colleagues, while their own productivity decreases due to all the lockdown measures, such as working from home while looking after children. And the crisis is also generating a lot of extra work. European financial regulators have, therefore, postponed numerous supervision deadlines to relieve pressure in the financial sector wherever possible, thereby allowing the sector to focus on its core activities. 75 Curbs on short-selling In times of crisis, the volatility of the financial markets sometimes encourages investors to speculate on falling share prices by selling short. Now this is happening once again. And if investors go short on a large scale, share prices may fall extra sharply. European financial market supervisor ESMA can prohibit short-selling throughout Europe in the event of exceptional market circumstances. 76 And national regulators can prohibit short-selling in their own Member State for the same reason. 77 So far, the competent regulatory authorities in Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, Greece and Austria have done so. 78 As yet, ESMA sees no reason to introduce an EU-wide ban on short-selling. However, it has lowered the threshold for reporting net short positions to supervisors to ensure that developments can be monitored even more closely than usual. 79",

            "text": "The coronavirus outbreak probably spells trouble for some important ongoing European projects. For example, the EBU is not yet complete as the third pillar-an EU-funded Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS)-is not yet in place. Under the existing European Deposit Guarantee Directive, it is already the case that if a bank in the EU is unable to meet its payment commitments, an aggrieved depositor (saver) can recover up to a maximum of EUR 100,000 from the deposit guarantee fund. Each Member State has (or should have) set up such a fund, which is jointly financed by the banks in that Member State. The idea now is for the financing of the DGS within the eurozone to be raised to the European level. 80 But the response from the Netherlands and Germany in particular has been lukewarm. If an Italian, Spanish, Portuguese or Greek bank goes bankrupt, the Dutch and German banks would have to contribute. The Netherlands and Germany have always indicated that they will only agree to an EU-funded DGS if the NPLs on the balance sheets, particularly of the south European banks, are reduced to an acceptable level. As Spain, Italy and Portugal were well on the way to reducing the size of the NPLs on their banks' balance sheets, there was some prospect of introducing the third pillar of the EBU. However, the coronavirus outbreak has caused the volume of NPLs on bank balance sheets across Europe to rise sharply again. Unfortunately, Greece has made insufficient progress in cleaning up bank balance sheets, and the current crisis has now added to the problems. An EU-funded DGS, therefore, seems further away than ever. However, a crisis can also result in greater centralization. Greek central bank president Stournaras has already called for the establishment of a European bad bank to which all non-performing exposures should be transferred. 81 Whether this form of European solidarity is feasible remains to be seen.",

This applies not only to the private sector but certainly also to the national governments and the EU. Implementation of the climate plans is likely to be delayed by the coronavirus crisis. This is particularly tragic since a link may exist between climate change and the outbreak of pandemics. 87 A delay in the realization of the climate plans would, therefore, be unacceptable. However, two rather more positive notes may perhaps be made. First, the coronavirus crisis may help us to realize that a video link, despite all its limitations, works quite well, and that flying around the world for face-toface meetings is not really necessary. And, secondly, the massive state aid provided by governments to their corporate sector (eg KLM-Air France) gives them the opportunity to impose green conditions. 88",

These divisions are particularly apparent in relation to the issue of financing the European recovery fund and the power struggle that has now flared up between the German Constitutional Court on the one hand and the CJEU and the ECB on the other. Hard times lie ahead for the EU, and the situation is exacerbated by the attritional Brexit negotiations and the need to face up to the challenges posed by other nationalist forces within Europe and by various external threats such as President Trump's 'America First' policy (although the President may be tripped up by his handling of the coronavirus crisis) and China's economic emergence (although that may be somewhat slowed by the pandemic). 89 Whatever happens, the EU seems likely to be scapegoated by certain political forces in both northern and southern Europe for all the misery caused by the huge economic slump triggered by the crisis.

I would note here that, in practice, the EBA, ESMA and EIOPA carry out little, if any, actual supervision of financial institutions, and instead mainly assist in the creation of European financial supervision law, while also providing authoritative but often formally non-binding interpretations of that law.
