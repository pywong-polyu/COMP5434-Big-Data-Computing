            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 has caused a global outbreak and became a major public health issue globally. Pain, agitation, delirium, and sleep disturbance are common in COVID-19 patients and are closely associated with the severity and poor prognosis of patients. It has been a challenge to manage the pain, agitation, and delirium in patients with COVID-19. Based on a literature review and front-line experience in Wuhan, a panel of experts in critical care medicine have developed an evidence-and opinion-based consensus on the management of analgesia and sedation in severe COVID-19 patients. The consensus includes 6 sections and 30 statements, including pain assessment and analgesia management, agitation assessment and sedation management, management of delirium, management of sleep disturbance, palliative care, and a protocol for the management of analgesia and sedation in severe COVID-19 patients. Our aims are mainly to standardize the management of pain, agitation, delirium, and sleep disturbance; formulate appropriate medication plan, and achieve optimal clinical status. Owing to the limited experience in the management of analgesia and sedation in severe COVID-19 patients, this expert consensus statement with specific suggestions should be helpful for clinicians worldwide.",

Those critically ill patients are often in a state of stress, pain, and anxiety due to the pathophysiology of the acute stage of the disease, the underlying illness, psychological factors, and environmental factors [11, 12] . COVID-19 increases organ function load, resulting in increased tissue oxygen consumption and respiratory dysfunction, which further damage organs and can even be life-threatening. In addition, various medical procedures including mechanical ventilation, arterial puncture, central venous catheterization, and hemodialysis could aggravate discomfort, anxiety, and pain. Appropriate analgesia and sedation treatment have been shown to block the sympathetic storm, increase patient comfort, and reduce the stress response as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the ICU [13] [14] [15] . reach a strong agreement.

            "text": "COVID-19 patients are all treated in isolation wards, multiple factors can modulate patients' pain. (1) viral infection: symptoms such as wheezing, dyspnea, insidious pain caused by tracheal intubation, and various clinical operations; (2) anxiety: fear of disease and worries about prognosis and family; (3) environment: prolonged bed rest, lights, noise from various machines, sleep fluctuations, and resuscitation or death of other patients. In a single-centered observational study, 71% of critically ill COVID-19 patients were treated with mechanical ventilation, 42% of them received tracheal intubation [8] . In addition, 63.5% of critically ill patients complained of dyspnea, 11.5% had muscle pain, 2% had chest pain, 2% had arthralgia, and 6% suffered from headache [8] . Statement 1: Analgesia should probably be considered as a high priority in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients and the implementation of analgesia-based sedation should probably be preferred. (Grade 2+, weak recommendation) Rationale: It is reported that pain could decrease the immune response and increase the risk of delirium and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [19] [20] [21] . Analgesia could improve comfort in mechanically ventilated patients and reduce stress [22] . However, analgesic agents could also inhibit important physiological functions of certain organs (e.g., respiration, circulation) or increase the metabolic burden of certain organs (e.g., liver, kidney) resulting in organ dysfunction or imbalance [22] . The effect of analgesic drugs on the function of the patient's organs is an issue that must be addressed. The patient's basic vital signs (mood, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, urine volume, and temperature) should be closely monitored before analgesia is administered so that the appropriate medication and its dosage can be selected. High-quality clinical trials of analgesia-based sedation are rare. It is reported that an analgesia-based sedation protocol could reduce the use of sedative agents and decrease periods of deep sedation, without increasing agitation [23, 24] .",

            "text": "Rationale: In isolation wards, simple and easy-to-use assessment tools are recommended due to limited conditions. A prospective study showed that the NRS score was valid and sensitive to capturing changes in pain response in critically ill communicative patients [25] . NRS was also found to be a valid assessment for dyspnea [26] . In patients who are unable to express themselves, and whose behavior can be observed, CPOT could be a valid and reliable pain assessment tool for patients from different areas [27] [Supplementary Table 3 ]. Statement 3: Non-pharmacological interventions should probably be considered as adjuvant pain management therapy in severe COVID-19 patients. (Grade 2+, weak recommendation) Rationale: Music was able to reduce mechanical pain sensitivity in healthy volunteers [28] . One meta-analysis showed that music interventions could significantly reduce pain intensity, emotional distress, and the use of anesthetic, opioid, and non-opioid agents [29] . The use of slow deep breathing (SDB) techniques is increasing in the clinic. Breathing techniques have shown beneficial effects on the intensity of pain in several clinical studies [30] . The breathing patterns used in these studies were diverse. In practice, we should carefully characterize the targeted timing (breathing frequency, inspiration/expiration ratio), and volume (breathing depth) components of a breathing cycle [30] . Statement 4: It is recommended that opioid analgesia should be used as the first choice for critically ill patients with COVID-19. (Grade 1+, strong recommendation) Rationale: Opioids are powerful central analgesics with strong analgesic effect, fast onset of action and high adjustability that are widely used in the ICU, such as morphine, fentanyl, remifentanil, sufentanil, etc. [Supplementary Table 4 ] [22] .",

            "text": "The adverse effects of opioids, which mainly cause respiratory depression, decreased blood pressure, and decreased gastrointestinal motility, are particularly pronounced in the elderly [31, 32] . Critically ill COVID-19 patients are mostly elderly, with long mechanical ventilation time and high incidence of acute gastrointestinal injury, requiring prolonged analgesic treatment; the smallest effective dose of opioids should be used as soon as possible. There is a lack of clinical trials assessing patients' benefits from prolonged application of opioids. When a patient is on opioids for more than 2 weeks, the patient's status should be carefully monitored and the type and dose of analgesic medication should be evaluated. Morphine derivatives, such as the opioid receptor agonist-antagonist dezocine, may have advantages in reducing respiratory depression and gastrointestinal adverse effects, but further clinical trial validation is needed. dexmedetomidine application does increase the incidence of bradycardia and hypotensive events compared to other drugs [46] . Statement 6: Experts suggest formulating appropriate analgesic and sedative strategies during medical procedures based on an individualized evaluation of patients with severe COVID-19. (Expert opinion) Rationale: Among the commonly used drugs, midazolam has less effect on cardiovascular function and produces anterograde amnesia. For patients with extreme anxiety, midazolam can be used intravenously. At the same time, etomidate or ketamine combined with low-dose midazolam is recommended in these patients. Since propofol infusion in patients with COVID-19 has an obvious effect on hemodynamics, it is only recommended in patients with relatively stable hemodynamics. Intravenous lidocaine can effectively inhibit cough during medical procedures. Among neuromuscular blockers, rocuronium lasts longer and confers a lower risk of cough than succinylcholine. Patients can be given rocuronium sequentially after deep sedation. Early use of opioids may cause cough in patients, so opioid administrations can be given after neuromuscular blockers have suppressed laryngeal reflex, commonly used opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, or remifentanil [47] .",

Early use of intravenous infusion and/or vasoactive drugs to prevent the occurrence of adverse events such as hypotension, asphyxia, and hypoxia is recommended [48] . It should be noted that acute critical illness can greatly reduce the need for analgesic and sedative drug doses, and analgesic and sedation therapy may increase the risk of hemodynamics and respiratory decompensation in critically ill patients. It is more common in elderly patients, obese patients, and patients with underlying heart disease and/or hepatorenal insufficiency. Therefore, the selection of the best type and dose of analgesic and sedative drugs should be determined based on an individual evaluation of patients. Besides, deep sedation [Richmond agitation-sedation scale (RASS) -4 to -5] should be maintained before the neuromuscular blocker effect disappears. In the continuous use of neuromuscular blockers, adequate analgesia and sedation therapy should also be used continuously.",

            "text": "Sedation is a key technology to reduce oxygen consumption and maintain oxygen balance. Because of the pathophysiological changes brought about by the disease and the psychological factors of the patients, COVID-19 can easily cause oxygen imbalance and lead to tissue hypoxia, which makes sedation an effective measure of treatment. Statement 7: Sedation is an important strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 in ICU. (Expert opinion) Rationale: Due to the different degrees of consolidation, extensive monocyte and megakaryocyte exudate from the alveolus, focal hemorrhage and necrosis, hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis [49] , severe COVID-19 patients suffer from severe dyspnea and hypoxemia, which rapidly leads to ARDS, septic shock and multiple organ failure [7] . Severe COVID-19 and ARDS will intensify the respiratory drive of patients, increase trans-pulmonary pressure, and cause 'secondary injury' to the lungs [5] . At the same time, due to multiple factors such as disease injury response, psychological load, social and treatment environment [48] , severe COVID-19 patients have strong anxiety, fear, and even delirium, which can enhance body stress, tissue oxygen consumption, and catabolism. This is not conducive to the curing of the disease and may produce long-term mental conditions such as PTSD and depression [50] . Therefore, as an important part of ICU treatment, sedation is of great significance in reducing respiratory drive and relieving anxiety and stress [31] . Statement 8: RASS should probably be used for sedation assessment in COVID-19 patients. (Grade 2+, weak recommendation) Rationale: Sedation should first rely on assessing the needs of patients. 'No assessment, no sedation'. The assessment tools were divided into the subjective scoring scale and objective assessment tool. The subjective scoring scale should be simple, accurate, relatively objective, and easy to repeat. RASS [Supplementary Table  5 ] had high reliability and validity in medical and surgical, ventilated and nonventilated, and sedated and non-sedated adult ICU patients [51] . We recommend RASS as the first choice of the sedation assessment tool in patients with COVID-19 because of the rapid change in condition and the need for continuity with delirium assessment [31] . Procedure for RASS assessment lists in [Supplementary Table 6 ]. The objective evaluation tool refers to the digital EEG after EEG signal transformation, commonly used as Bispectral index (BIS), Narcotrend index (Ni), state entropy (SE), etc. However, it still requires strong evidence to prove its effectiveness and is now mainly used as an auxiliary tool for subjective assessment. Statement 9: Goal-directed sedation strategy should probably be used during respiratory support in severe COVID-19 patients. (Grade 2+, weak recommendation) Rationale: Patients with severe COVID-19 will be exposed to different methods of respiratory support according to the severity of the disease, including high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC), non-invasive ventilation (NIV), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), muscle relaxation, prone position, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In different respiratory support methods, the depth of sedation varies. Injury from excessive deep sedation and organ damage caused by insufficient sedation should both be avoided. For severe COVID-19 patients, a goal-directed sedation strategy is most recommended [52] . the goal of individual sedation should be based upon the degree of pulmonary consolidation and fibrosis combined with the patient's inflammatory reaction, mental state, and respiratory support method. According to the dynamic evaluation of the goal, treatment should be adjusted and sedation titrated. Statement 10: It is suggested to maintain RASS at -1 to 0 during HFNC application in severe COVID-19 patients. (Expert opinion) Rationale: Patients who need HFNC are conscious but their symptoms, such as chest tightness and shortness of breath, are severe [53] . They should have adequate analgesia and should not be deeply sedated. A small dose of short-acting sedative drugs could be used to ensure comfort and relieve anxiety. A RASS score of -1 to 0 should be maintained. In addition, the respiratory rate of patients should be observed closely. The respiratory rate should be less than 30 breaths per minute with analgesia and sedation, but respiratory inhibition caused by excessive sedation should be avoided. Statement 11: RASS should probably be maintained at -1 to 0 during NIV in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and deep sedation (RASS < -2) should probably be avoided. (Grade 2\u00b1, weak recommendation) Rationale: NIV is an important respiratory support method for severe COVID-19 patients. However, for NIV to play a therapeutic role, it must be based on patient tolerance and good coordination between humans and machines. Therefore, a light sedation strategy needs to be implemented on the premise of sufficient analgesia, and the RASS score maintained between -1 to 0 [54] [55] [56] . At the same time, respiratory indices, especially tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate (RR), should be monitored. In the first two hours of NIV support, in addition to maintaining oxygen saturation (SpO2) >93%, VT < 9 mL/kg, and RR < 30 breaths per minute, respiratory drive and oxygen consumption should also be reduced [57] . During the implementation of an NIV light sedation strategy, we should also schedule appropriate times for eating, drinking, rehabilitation activities, and sleeping. Attention should be paid to communication and delirium avoided. Deep sedation (RASS < -2) should probably be avoided because there is no artificial airway protection in the course of NIV [56] . Deep sedation also increases the risk of aspiration and may increase the length of stay in ICU. Statement 12: In general, RASS should probably be maintained at -2 to 0 when using IMV in critically ill COVID-19 patients. (Grade 2+, weak recommendation) Statement 13: It is recommended to maintain RASS at -5 to -4 with deep sedation strategy if their obvious discomfort, agitation, patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, and strong respiratory drive during IMV. (Grade 1+, strong recommendation) Statement 14: It is recommended that deep sedation should probably be administered for a short duration. However, it could be adjusted according to the individual condition of patients. Daily interruption should probably be considered during long periods of deep sedation. (Grade 2+, weak recommendation) Rationale: Most of the severe COVID-19 patients, especially those with ARDS, need IMV treatment. The core measure of IMV implementation is lung-protective ventilation strategy (VT \u2264 6-8 mL/kg, Pplat < 30 cmH2O, reasonable PEEP, driving pressure < 15 cmH2O). Analgesic and sedation strategies are important factors in the implementation of lung-protective ventilation. However, because of the specificity of pathology and pathophysiology [58] , the depth and duration of sedation in COVID-19 patients are different from other ARDS patients in the past. In general, maintaining light sedation of RASS from -2 to 0 is a reasonable initial setting during IMV [59, 60] . However, if the patient is experiencing obvious discomfort, agitation, and patient-ventilator dyssynchrony is affecting gas exchange, then a deep sedation strategy should be considered to maintain the RASS at -5 to -4. Severe COVID-19 and ARDS patients usually have a strong respiratory drive, which increases trans-pulmonary pressure, aggravates air pressure injury, and induces patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) [61] . Therefore, deep sedation, and even combination with neuromuscular blocking drugs, is needed to interrupt spontaneous respiration [61, 62] .",

            "text": "It is preferable to keep the duration of deep sedation short [60] , otherwise, the probability of secondary infection will increase, and the duration of stay in ICU will be prolonged. However, COVID-19 patients often regain a strong respiratory drive once the depth of sedation is reduced, which means intensive care physicians need to make individual adjustments based on the specific conditions of the patients. If the respiratory drive is still strong (RR > 30 breaths/min, VT > 9 mL/kg, man-machine confrontation is obvious) after changing to light sedation, and adjustment of analgesia and communication is ineffective, then deep sedation should probably be considered. During the implementation of a deep sedation strategy, daily interruption to observe the condition of the patient is suggested [63] . Statement 15: It is recommended to maintain RASS at -5 when using neuromuscular blocking drugs during the early stage of IMV in severe COVID-19 patients. (Grade 1+, strong recommendation) Rationale: For early patients with severe ARDS, neuromuscular blockers may be considered based on adequate analgesia and sedation [64] . Conscious muscle relaxation is extremely dangerous, as seen during anesthesia, which can cause a severe sympathetic storm, stress, and significantly increase the metabolic burden of the circulatory system. Therefore, the use of muscle relaxants should adhere to the premise of sufficient analgesia and sedation, and maintain RASS at -5. At this time, objective assessment can help to monitor the depth of sedation and avoid being too light or too deep. Cisatracurium besylate is recommended for muscle relaxation. The indication is severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 150) at an early stage (within 48 h of onset). The dosage should be titrated to the minimum dose needed to prevent spontaneous respiration. The duration is recommended to be 48 h [65] . Statement 16: It is suggested that the degree of sedation during prone position varies with the respiratory support method and period of the disease. (Expert opinion) Rationale: Prone position is recommended for severe COVID-19 and ARDS patients without contraindication in the early stage (first 48 h) of IMV [66] , which can improve lung compliance and viscous secretion drainage. In the early prone position, a muscle relaxant is often used simultaneously, and the duration is at least 12 h, so a deep sedation strategy is needed. Prone position can be implemented many times in COVID-19 patients. After the early stage with muscle relaxation, light sedation strategy can be considered during prone position and some conscious patients have good tolerance [59] . The prone position also can be implemented during HFNC in COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "With sufficient communication, some patients can adopt a prone position in a conscious state. Mild analgesia can be used, but sedation should probably be avoided as much as possible. Statement 17: The degree of sedation during ECMO varies with the different periods of the ECMO implementation. 'Awake' ECMO is probably reasonable after strict evaluation. (Grade 2+, weak recommendation) Rationale: ECMO can be used as a salvage treatment for critically ill patients with ineffective mechanical ventilation [67] . In the early stage of ECMO administration, in order to achieve lung rest and avoid the aggravation of lung injury, the parameters of the ventilator will be lowered as much as possible. At this time, it is necessary to administer sufficient analgesia and deep sedation to reduce the secondary lung injury caused by an overly strong spontaneous respiratory drive [68] . If the pulmonary inflammatory response is reduced and the alveolar ventilation function is improved after a certain period of ECMO treatment, and there is no major damage in neurology and other organ functions can be compensated, the depth of sedation can be gradually reduced. After a full evaluation and testing, 'awake' ECMO with no intubation and self-breathing could probably be considered. This kind of support can avoid sedation, intubation, and mechanical ventilation related complications [69] . The ECMO circuit may affect medication absorption through larger volumes of distribution and drug retention by membrane oxygenators [70] . Therefore, ECMO support may alter drug dosing regimens. Midazolam, a sedative, is reduced by more than 50% with ECMO [70, 71] . Statement 18: Experts suggest a deep sedation strategy (RASS -4 to -5) combined with a neuromuscular blocking agent in severe COVID-19 patients when undergoing high-risk medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation, tracheotomy, and fiber optic bronchoscopy. (Expert opinion) Rationale: Due to the severe decrease of respiratory function and the high load of the 2019-nCOV virus in sputum and upper respiratory tract secretions of patients with severe COVID-19, medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation, tracheotomy, and fiber optic bronchoscopy are high-risk procedures for such patients [72] . On the one hand, the medical procedure itself and its complications may increase the patient's mortality, on the other hand, the airway secretions and the formation of spatter may also enhance the risk of cross-infection among medical workers [4] . Therefore, during these medical procedures, all necessary preventive measures should be taken, including personal protective equipment (PPE), sterilization of operating equipment, minimizing unnecessary contact with patients, and the management of medical waste. A deep sedation strategy combined with a neuromuscular blocking agent can not only help to reduce the occurrence of adverse events caused by the operational stimulation, but also effectively reduce the difficulty and course of operation for medical workers, and reduce the risk of cross-infection among medical workers [73] . Statement 19: Experts recommend sedatives should probably be used with attention to the effects on hemodynamics and organ functions, as well as the need for depth of sedation. (Grade 2+, weak recommendation) Rationale: Midazolam is the most commonly used benzodiazepine, it acts on the reticular structure of the brain stem and the limbic system of the brain, enhances inhibition of GABA receptors. It results in anti-anxiety, hypnosis, memory loss, and antispasmodic effects, and has little effect on blood pressure [74] . Lorazepam can be used as a long-term benzodiazepine. The main side effect of benzodiazepines is respiratory inhibition. The drugs have fast action and slow metabolism. Thus, they accumulate easily, increasing the depth of sedation and prolonging the time of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization. At the same time, in order to avoid delirium, we should try to reduce the duration of benzodiazepine use. Propofol enhances GABA signaling; it is quick to take effect and is metabolized quickly, it is a strong anxiolytic and induces memory loss. At the same time, it can effectively reduce cerebral blood flow and reduce intracranial pressure, and should be used preferentially in patients with neurological diseases with increased intracranial pressure [74] . The disadvantage of propofol is mainly its impact on the cardiovascular system, resulting in decreased cardiac output, stroke volume, and peripheral vascular resistance, as well as the function of reducing sympathetic nerve activity, causing decreased blood pressure during rapid intravenous injection. In addition, due to its liposolubility, long-term use can cause hyperlipidemia, which is not suitable for patients with triglyceride elevation, pancreatitis, etc. Dexmedetomidine acts on the locus coeruleus mainly by activating the \u03b12 adrenergic receptor subtype of the central nervous system, producing sedation and analgesia; the degree of sedation is mild, and the occurrence of delirium can be reduced [75] . Adverse reactions such as bradycardia, and hypotension tend to occur, so it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring of the circulatory system. Dexmedetomidine can be used as a basic sedative for light sedation of patients without artificial airway. Midazolam or propofol can be selected as basic sedation in patients with artificial airway and deep sedation, and then combined with other sedative drugs [Supplementary Table 7 ]. The sedative dose can be adjusted at any time based on evaluation [76] . III Delirium management Delirium, the most frequent clinical expression of acute brain dysfunction, is especially important in the context of COVID-19. The incidence rate of delirium for ICU patients is about 30% -50%, while it can be as high as 50% -75% for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation [31] . Evidence indicates that delirium is not only a robust prognostic indicator of prolonged mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, and a higher mortality rate, but also of higher risk of long-term cognitive impairment [77] . So far, the exact incidence of delirium in COVID-19 patients remains unknown. Mao reported the prevalence of neurological symptoms, which, including impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular disease, reached 45% in severe cases of COVID-19 [78] . Therefore, it is urgent that the standard prevention and management of delirium should be implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

Patients with COVID-19 always feel pain due to hypoxia, long-term immobility, inflammatory storm, organ dysfunction, and mental stress, all of which could lead to anxiety and depression. In addition to the main causes (disease severity and pathophysiology), the surrounding environmental factors such as excessive noise, light, enclosed management, and medical treatment could also cause sleep disruption and sleep quality degradation. A previous study reported that the restorative function of sleep may be a consequence of the enhanced removal of potentially neurotoxic waste products that accumulate in the awake central nervous system [87] . Unfortunately, a study reported there was a high rate of acute encephalopathy in patients with COVID-19 [88] . The Society of Critical Care Medicine has identified sleep deprivation as a significant contributor to the development of delirium in adult patients in ICU [89] . Lack of sleep or poor sleep quality will lead to a host of adverse outcomes\uff0csuch as pain, anxiety, dysphoria, delirium [90, 91] , tissue damage, abnormal immune regulation, and changing hormone levels and pulmonary mechanics that are associated with poor prognosis [16, [92] [93] [94] [95] . Therefore, a sleep management strategy should be adopted for patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "COVID-19 has caused a fast-moving, highly distressing global health crisis. Patients of all ages are under pressure from the disease, while healthcare systems are under the enormous pressure of the growing demand for services. On account of the shortage of medical resources during the outbreak, sometimes physicians have to set a priority for critically ill patients to decide who can receive intensive care. During the pandemic of COVID-19 in Wuhan China, older patients had equal opportunity to receive medical care, given the expected recovery. Nevertheless, many factors should be taken into account for this prudent decision in different regions with different cultural backgrounds and social systems, such as the expected possibility of recovery, individual willingness, and religious beliefs. For those who are not expected to survive or those who renounce aggressive therapy, high-quality palliative care, including end-of-life care, needs to be provided. Statement 28: Hospital palliative care is an essential part of COVID-19 therapy. (Expert opinion) Rationale: Palliative care is a specialized health care for patients and families facing serious illness. It is an important component of health care in pandemics, contributing to symptom control, psychological support, and supporting triage and complex decision making [116, 117] . COVID-19 has caused a fast-spreading global health crisis and a severe imbalance between demand and supply of intensive care. Strengthening hospice care to the greatest extent to ease the patient's pain is an ethical imperative, as well as the embodiment of social progress. Statement 29: The primary task of palliative care is to relieve the patient's symptoms. (Expert opinion) Rationale: Beyond providing life-sustaining treatments, clinical efforts should also address the relief of symptoms. The most prevalent symptoms were dyspnea, agitation, drowsiness, pain, and delirium. Relatively low doses of opioids and benzodiazepines were the most commonly used drugs for palliative sedation and analgesia, especially at the end of life [118, 119] . COVID-19 patients may also experience gastrointestinal symptoms or changes in smell and taste. Clinicians need to pay attention to these symptoms and address them to improve the patient's physical experience. Statement 30: Psychotherapy is another indispensable part of palliative care. (Expert opinion) Rationale: Fear of death and psychological loss are the most common psychological activities of critically ill patients. Psychotherapists are most important in the treatment of mental disorders during epidemics. Serious illness affects both COVID-19 patients and their families, therefore both the patients and their families need to be cared for. Communication and family meetings are also necessary. When death inevitably occurs, the greatest need and desire of the patients is the company of their relatives. In order to avoid spreading the disease through close contact, the use of many new technologies such as telemedicine, visual telephone, and web conferencing should be encouraged. By connecting the patients and their families through the internet, patients can feel the warmth from their relatives and families, which plays a good role in emotional comfort and pain alleviation. The families should cooperate with the medical staff with a good attitude and behavior to reduce the patient's negative emotions. The families also should give more comfort and create the best environment for the patients at the end of their lives. In conclusion, regardless of the prognosis, relief of symptom distress and improvement of emotional state are the key components of palliative care for all COVID-19 patients. A multidisciplinary team is needed for better palliative care. The collaborative efforts of the physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists will help treat distressing symptoms, which applies to the current COVID-19 crisis. While non-palliative specialist physicians can learn to provide primary palliative care, palliative care specialists remain essential members in providing support for COVID-19 patients. Particular attention should also be paid to the bereavement management of the families and PTSD of the health workers involved in the COVID-19 pandemic.",
