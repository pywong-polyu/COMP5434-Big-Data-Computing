The primary outcome was the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders, assessed by survey (SRQ-20). Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes related emotional distress, eating and sleeping disorders, all assessed by validated surveys at the moment of the study. Statistical analyses included unpaired t-test for continuous variables and \u03c7 2 test for categorical variables.",

In patients with diabetes, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms is about two to four times greater than in the general population [3, 4] . Although more research is needed to fully understand the link between diabetes and depression, it is clear that metabolic dysregulation influences brain function and disturbances in peripheral glucose regulation might be associated with depressed mood [5, 6] . Some cases of depression might result from low levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) into the brain, wich was shown to produce antidepressant behavioural responses in experimental studies [6] [7] [8] . Nutrient-activated gut to brain signaling pathways also appear to play a role in the genesis of depressive symptoms. A highly significant association between leptin levels, depressed mood and sleep disturbances has been shown in normal-weight individuals [6, 9] . Also, ghrelin can exert antidepressant effects in men and carbohydrates appear to lead to ghrelin suppression [6, 10, 11] . The association between diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment, and psychological distress could increase depressive symptoms and cause adverse diabetes outcomes [12, 13] . The emergence of a potentially fatal pandemic represents a new reason for uncertainty and anxiety in this group of patients. Since December 2019, when a series of cases of severe pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus was described in Wuhan-China, the COVID-19 infection, as it became known, quickly spread throughout the world [14] [15] [16] . On Jul 07th, more than 11 million and 600 thousand confirmed cases have been identified worldwide, totaling 538 thousand deaths [17] . The first case of someone suffering from COVID-19 in South America was confirmed on February 26th, 2020 in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Since then, Brazil has recorded the largest number of cases in Latin America and recently has emerged as a new epicenter of the pandemic in the world [18] .",

We found a high prevalence of significant psychological distress among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with approximately 93% of the studied patients showing signs of current mental suffering in some psychological specific area. Almost half of the patients had a positive screening for psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression, with a significant greater tendency in patients with type 2 diabetes. The presence of diabetes-related emotional distress was present in only 29.2% of the interviewees, which does not appear to directly justify the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders found in this study. Approximately three out of four patients had a positive screening for eating and sleeping disorders, which may reflect the systemic repercussion of a latent anxiety condition.",

An epidemiological study by Meurs et al. evaluating more than 90,000 patients found an 80% increased risk of depression and anxiety in patients with diabetes [36] . The data described in the literature shows a co-prevalence of diabetes and depression ranging from 17.6 to 21% [39, 40] . In Brazil, the prevalence of depression in patients with diabetes, in usual situations, appears to be similar to that found in other countries, reaching 22% in the most recently published study [41] . Considering the current scenario, a study by Huang et al. in China showed a prevalence of anxiety and depression in the general population of 35% and 20%, respectively [42] . This makes us reflect about the possible impact that 1 month of social distancing, associated with all the stressors related to the current pandemic, has on this group of patients. Health appointments not fully available, difficulties in obtaining diabetes medications and supplies, besides the lack of scientific information regarding the real relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes, may have contributed to the high prevalence of psychological distress found in Table 2 Multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of minor psychiatric disorders Multivariable logistic regression model to assess predictors of the presence of minor psychiatric disorders (\u03c7 2 = 17.94, p 0.05, R 2 Negelkerke 0.19).

A study performed by Bak et al. showed that patients with type 2 diabetes had almost twice the prevalence of depression symptoms when compared to those with type 1 diabetes [43] . In addition, intrinsic differences in types of diabetes can be affected in different ways during the period of social distancing. In type 1 diabetes, which requires precision in terms of the amount and timing of insulin administration, having more time at home could result in improved adherence and disease control. On the other hand, in type 2 diabetes, the maintenance of healthy habits, including physical exercise and balanced diet, can be greatly impaired during quarantine. These possible differences can have a positive or negative impact in terms of glycemic control, contributing differently to the appearance of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. It should be noted that these differences are still hypothetical, requiring specific studies for a better understanding.",

In the studied cohort, almost 7% of patients expressed positive responses to the question \"has the thought of ending your life been on your mind?\" in the SRQ 20. It is important to notice that the questionnaires were applied in a single phone call interview generated by researchers who had no bond or previous connection with participants. It is possible that, if applied under other conditions, this number would be even higher. Our findings are compatible with what was exposed by Gunnel et al., which stated that the pandemic would cause distress and leave many people vulnerable to mental health problems and suicidal behavior. Mental health consequences are likely to be present for longer and peak later than the actual pandemic [44] . This reinforces the importance of the active and ongoing participation of mental health professionals in policy task forces during this critical period [45] .",

Only one study was carried out to assess sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic, which showed 18% prevalence of sleeping disorders [43] . We believe that the presence of a positive screening for moderate and severe sleep disorder in our cohort is possibly multifactorial: the presence of obstructive sleep apnea in the groups with highest BMI, eventual nocturnal hypoglycemia episodes, staying longer time at home, practicing less physical activity, and having irregular sleep times may play an important role in this variable. In addition, it is possible that the presence of insomnia in this period reflects an anxiety sign related to a heightened concern about the risk of having COVID-19 while having diabetes.

It must be taken into account that a relatively small sample was included in this study, although in accordance to the sample size calculation.

The scales used were originally validated for self-application and, in our study, they were applied by researchers through phone calls due to the limitations imposed by the current scenario. The self-report-questionnaire (SRQ-20), which was used to assess the primary outcome, has validation for minor psychiatric disorders screening in primary health care in Brazil [48] . Despite not presenting validation for screening in patients in tertiary care, patients with diabetes mellitus are included in primary care samples. For the assessment of eating disorders, the eating attitudes test (EAT-26) was used. Although there are no validation studies in the population with diabetes, their results are widely generalizable and used for screening, indicating food preoccupation and restriction [30, 31] . The EAT-26 is often indicated as one of the methods of choice for the initial assessment of eating disorders in patients with diabetes, according to Young-Hyman et al. [49] . The mini sleep questionaire (MSQ) used to assess sleep disorders has validation only for the general population and there are no specific studies on its use in patients with diabetes [32, 33] .",
