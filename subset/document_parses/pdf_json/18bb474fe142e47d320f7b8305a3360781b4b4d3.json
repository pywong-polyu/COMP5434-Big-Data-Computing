The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate chest CT performances to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia with regard to RT-PCR as reference standard in a low incidence area. Methods A survey was sent to radiology department in 4 hospitals in an administrative French region of weak disease prevalence (3.4%). Study design was approved by the local institutional review board and recorded on the clinicaltrial.gov website (NCT04339686). Written informed consent was waived due to retrospective anonymized data collection. Patients who underwent a RT-PCR and a chest CT scan within 48 h for COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion were consecutively included. Diagnostic accuracy including the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of chest CT regarding RT-PCR as reference standard were calculated. Results One hundred twenty-nine patients had abnormal chest CT findings compatible with a COVID-19 pneumonia (26%, 129/ 487). Among the 358 negative chest CT findings, 3% (10/358) were RT-PCR positive. Chest CT sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value were respectively 87% (IC95: 85, 89; 69/79), 85% (IC95: 83, 87; 348/408), 53% (IC95: 50, 56; 69/ 129), and 97% (IC95: 95, 99; 348/358). Conclusions In a low prevalence area, chest CT scan is a good diagnostic tool to rule out COVID-19 infection among symptomatic suspected patients.",

Without specific treatment or vaccine, detecting the disease at its early stage and isolating the patient is paramount in order to limit the spreading of this viral infection. According to different recommendations [2, 3] , the reference method to perform diagnosis of COVID-19 is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RT-PCR has some limitations such as quality of sample collection and transportation or kit performances. False negative rate is evaluated between 10 and more than 30%, representing a real practical issue [4] . It is consequently recommended to perform at least three negative tests before being confident about excluding disease [5] , but in a context of epidemic, delay between tests and results provides difficulties to manage each COVID-19 suspicion. In some previous reports [2, 6] , chest CT scans were suggested as a help in patient management. Data came from regions with relatively high incidence rate and could not be extend to area of low incidence disease [6] . Recent publication [7] outlined the question of chest performances in symptomatic patients suspected for COVID-19 pneumonia in low estimated prevalence suggesting it is too low to be a useful screening tool.",
