However, most participants (87%) had to be given smartphones for them to have Bluetooth capabilities and access to the study app. Tolerability to the device was impacted by the difficult living circumstances of caregivers that induced fear of loss or theft. Significance: The study showed how the use of remote patient monitoring in the form of mHealth can benefit epilepsy patients, despite highly variable engagement with the technology. The combination of mPROs and wearable devices generated informative datasets that will allow clinicians but also the children and their caregivers to better understand and manage the disease.",

Remote patient monitoring in the form of mHealth, described by the World Health Organization as \"use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives,\" 14 can provide requisite data sources required to understand the patients' experience. mHealth applications can achieve this through the synthesis of real-world data repositories and on a continuous basis which will allow clinicians to monitor disease progression, response to treatment, and the impact on quality of life. Through these and similar approaches, an in-depth patient-specific profile can be generated to guide treatment regimen and help clinicians and researchers better understand the disease.",

Participants were provided with a smartphone with limited connectivity if their own phone did not meet the technical requirements to allow data transfer and Bluetooth connectivity. The app was paired with a wrist wearable device (Hesvit S3, Hesvit) using Bluetooth ( Figure 1 ). Participants were asked to wear the wrist-worn device all the time apart from when washing, swimming, and charging the device. The device captured steps, heart rate, and light and deep sleep minutes and calculated sleep duration and type from the 3-axis acceleration sensor data. Caregivers of the participants were given instructions on how to use the app for reporting their child's seizures (including video capture), behavioral difficulties, poor sleep, illness, or any other events in real-time. The CHU9D, EQ-5D-Y, ketogenic diet, and sleep questionnaire were pushed for completion every 30 days. A yes-no question was sent through the app every morning allowing the caregivers to report whether their child slept well. The medication adherence report was completed every 90 days. In addition, to support medication adherence reminders were sent via the app at the time the ASM was due. The caregivers were also able to indicate whether the medication was taken and explain the reason why otherwise. Any change in medication prescription was immediately updated on the clinical dashboard to ensure accurate reminders were received by caregivers. A notification was displayed by the app when action was needed. A \"Visits\" section captured all healthcare appointments. Data were stored on the smartphone and uploaded at predetermined intervals, so uninterrupted Internet access was not required.

            "text": "The mHealth technology used over the course of this study was able to capture important information that gives an overall impression of patients' experiences with complex pediatric epilepsy and also their caregivers. Despite physical activity being beneficial for psychosocial wellbeing, and studies showing its role in seizure mitigation, the majority of epilepsy patients are less active in contrast with the wider population. 23, 24 In addition, seizures have been observed to negatively impact sleep: altering proportions of varying stages and the overall quality. 25 Consequently, recording the lifestyle parameters of activity levels and sleep longitudinally may be useful in gauging the severity of epilepsy, the efficacy of a prescribed ASM or determining whether holistic prescriptions need to be made to improve disease management and quality of life. Caregiver's reports complemented with the activity and sleep patterns of the child generated by the wearable device provide the clinician with detailed information which should highlight barriers to providing adequate care. Caregivers' perception of their child's health might be influenced by their difficult living conditions. A discrepancy was observed between the reported sleep duration (8 h) by the caregiver and that measured by the device (5 h 58 min). This could be explained by the improper wearing of the device but also by caregivers not being aware of sleep disturbance. The living circumstances of participants influenced adherence to the wearable, in that many were too nervous or anxious to use the wearable outside of the home. That possibly impacted on the compliance rate and data quality. The use of CHU9D and EQ-5D-Y detailed the psychosocial impact of the disease on patients, with median values of 0 for two dimensions of CHU9D and values of less than 0.025 for six dimensions out of nine, and with caregivers for the affected children indicating that they had \"no problem\" in four out of a total five dimensions. This indicates an optimistic outlook and could influence reporting of events to health providers at clinic visits. Medication adherence was logged using the technology and showed that most caregivers adhere to giving their children's treatment regimen and use the app to report their reasons for not doing so more than when they are in the clinic with doctors. The most common behavioral event recorded was \"hyperactivity\" which is line with what is known for this group. Seizures were the primary clinical event as anticipated, with 79% of caregivers reporting its occurrence. Most the children recruited are defined as having refractory epilepsy which would indicate that most of the remaining 21% of the children were likely to have experienced seizures that were not reported. Nocturnal seizures which manifest as bad dreams or absence seizures that present as staring episodes are difficult to detect and thus might have been missed. However, reporting via the app was significantly higher than that achieved on the paper-based diary (79% vs 5%), demonstrating that the app has a clear benefit in documenting the seizure history of a patient which would have a tangible effect on patient management. While the majority of the children met the definition of refractory epilepsy, in the African setting children can be labeled refractory but in fact may not have had an adequate trial of ASMs due to a lack of sustainable supply and access to ASMs. Some children had apparently controlled seizures with ASMs but significant impact on quality of life from associated comorbidities such as cognitive delay or behavioral issues. As a result, a broader inclusion to the group was undertaken which included established epilepsy but also the presence of comorbidities. Thus, considering the expanded concept of \"complex epilepsy\" might be needed, especially in the African setting.",

Tolerability of the wearable was impacted by factors such as behavioral and cognitive events, including intellectual disability and hyperactivity along with the difficult living circumstances of caregivers that induced fear of loss or theft and potential compromise to personal safety in using these devices.

Limited access to networks, particularly when visiting rural areas as well as inconsistent supply of mobile data, may have also hampered data collection. Lastly, costs incurred must be considered: with an estimated 49% of the adult population in South Africa living below the upperbound poverty line (US$ 70.90 monthly income), 26 full engagement with mHealth technology may not be a viable option with current pricing structures. For instance, the total cost for the smartphones used in the study was US$ 2,494 (US$ 113 per phone) and the data packages provided on a monthly basis were worth between US$ 2 and US$ 8. As a reference, with a figure of 2338MB for average mobile data expenditure per month in South Africa being forecasted for this year from a 2016 report, 27 it is probable that patients would still require data bundles that exceed 1GB to support additional smartphone utilities, despite a minimum of 300MB being sufficient for use of the mHealth app. The average costs for 1 GB and 2 GB data bundles have been recorded as US$ 9.04 and US$ 14.43, respectively, according to a 2017 report from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). 28 Therefore, the cost impact on low-income patients may not be feasible at all or may be increased beyond affordability if they require a high frequency of engagement with the mHealth app, and/or a particular smartphone.",

With applications within health rapidly becoming digitized, there is a risk that disadvantaged communities may be left behind, which would negatively impact on treatment outcomes and widen the already existing global health inequality gap. Furthermore, as elements of artificial intelligence and machine learning become more commonplace within digital health applications, it is important that data are aggregated from varied patient groups to ensure that no demographic group is ostracized and that all are included in the development of digitized healthcare systems. 29 Digitized healthcare approaches have been used in sub-Saharan Africa as early as 2003, 30 and, within South Africa specifically, prior studies have displayed the acceptability and utility of mHealth for patients showing that there is a digital foundation which can be built upon. 31, 32 That engagement in, and enthusiasm for, digital solutions is greater in young individuals is not surprising but qualitative data from our study show that older people understand the value of mHealth and can be supported to engage. 21 This is in alignment with recent findings from South Africa which showed a positive correlation between individuals aged between 46 and 60 years who resided within 1 kilometer of their clinic, and an eagerness to engage with a mobile application for the purpose of ordering medication. 33 Health applications, combined with the present technological momentum, are seeing more people across sub-Saharan Africa access mobile technology and provide a great opportunity to potentially improve the treatment outcomes of billions of patients. 34 Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of digital healthcare solutions within clinical practice as they are highly adaptable, are efficient, and ensure for the continuation of health care when physically attending an appointment is not advised. [35] [36] [37] [38] The current international momentum driving the adoption of digitized healthcare solutions is one that may see an increase in use of such technology within sub-Saharan Africa.",
