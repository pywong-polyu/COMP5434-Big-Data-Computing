Since an education system often supports individuals with a higher socioeconomic status (SES), it may not resolve the issue of socioeconomic background impacting on career outcomes. Given the nature of the research questions, an individualistic approach is used for selecting tools. Using qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, we argue that graduates studying an 8-year engineering program fail to succeed compared to counterparts who studied a 4-year engineering program. Findings suggest that engineering graduates' socioeconomic backgrounds help them with their career advancement. A policy intervention may help to address the influence of SES on engineering education and professional employment.",

For example, while education often increases individuals' incomes, it also improves their social and economic status. Conversely, students from a privileged background can more easily access a quality education. Since the publication of the Coleman Report, 1 many studies have documented SES''s effect on academic achievements; however, it varies across different socioeconomic contexts (Liu et al., 2020) . For example, Conger et al. (2002) argued that family hardship could be detrimental to parental emotions or perceptions, practices, and behaviours, thereby affecting their children's education. Parental education may also impact on their children's academic achievements.",

In contrast, Alam (2021) argued that education improves individuals' capital levels and that may also ideally support removing the socioeconomic disadvantages in many cases. Since education increases income and social status, individuals with more years of schooling are more likely to offset poor SES''s impact on their subsequent professional education (Conger & Donnellan, 2007) . In this study, we firstly examine whether socioeconomic status affects the academic attainments and which subsequently influence the students' success in further education. Hence, we consider the grade points average (GPA) as a measure of academic success. Secondly, we examine whether the SES's effect on academic attainments influences the success attained in a professional career. Thirdly and finally, we attempt to explore a way forward that can help to offset the impact of SES in achieving academic and professional objectives particularly for engineers. To examine these issues, this paper considers Bangladesh as a case study.",

Students of DUET already have a 4year diploma engineering (DE) degree before enrolling in the engineering program at the bachelor level. On the other hand, students of BUET do not have prior engineering qualifications but have a 2-year Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) before enrolling at the same level. The HSC graduates mostly came from a privileged SES (Alam, 2021; Alam et al., 2014) .

Firstly, unlike previous studies, we argue students associated with lower SES but with a prior engineering education achieve less academic success than their higher SES counterparts. Most studies have argued how socioeconomic status affects academic achievement, considering that both groups have the same education background and their study program lasted for the same amount of time. To the best of our knowledge, none has examined whether a stipulated period for an academic program in the same discipline is more important than SES in achieving successful study outcomes and professional careers. Secondly, using a causal analysis, this study finds that students with a lower socioeconomic status and prior engineering backgrounds in the same discipline do not succeed in subsequent programs and professional careers, compared to their higher SES counterparts who have no previous engineering background. Findings strongly suggest that students from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds require special attention to achieve as much as they can in education.",

It also allows individuals to flourish in their lives, regardless of their birthplace, social background, race, ethnicity, or gender (Alam & Forhad, 2021b) . Engineering education produces technically skilled human resources, which is the fundamental key to economic progress. Trace (2015) highlighted a direct link between the enrolment rate in engineering education and economic growth. Most economic systems and public infrastructure to this day greatly rely on what engineers can design and build. While engineering education plays a significant role in national economic advancement, it also significantly improves individuals' living standards (Lucena & Schneider, 2008; Trace, 2015) . Therefore, a substantial engineering education should preferably offset the effect of SES to play its desired role. ",

In the late 1990s, Bos et al. (1999) and McDermott and Spencer (1997) argued that students from lower-income families are more likely to encounter academic challenges in schools. Although it is not unanimously clear, many studies explain that such effects range from the inequitable distribution of resources and opportunities to serious problems in families' day-to-day interactions with others in society (Conger et al., 2002; Mistry et al., 2002) . Perry (2012) and Alam and Forhad (2021a) argued that schools with more students from a higher SES often secure higher scores compared to the national average. Students with lower SES studying at such schools also perform well, which may suggest a group of high-SES students typically create a differentiated school environment where good scores can be attained. As well as school support, parents' education status, and income positively correlate to academic expectations for their children, especially if these variables are already advantageous (Child Trends, 2015; Davis-Kean, 2005; Neuenschwander et al., 2007; Triventi, 2013; Tynkkynen et al., 2012) . Perry (2012) argued that the opposite is true for students with lower SES. When these students are grouped in a school, this simply exacerbates the poorer education they receive. For example, Davis-Kean (2005) and Neuenschwander et al. (2007) argued that lower SES parents usually have lower expectations than their high-SES counterparts and are less likely to invest in their children's education. Although the relationship between SES and student outcomes is well established in the literature, few analyses have examined the effect of SES in university engineering. Since a prior engineering program likely offers an absolute advantage to undergraduate students, they are more likely to overcome the effects of SES in their subsequent program in the same discipline.",

They believed that education is a highly instrumental and necessary component to enhance an individual's productivity. However, Spence (1973) argued that even if education does not always contribute substantially to an employee''s productivity, it still offers the 'value to both the employer and employee'. He also claimed that if an apt 'cost/benefit structure' prevails, 'good employees' would seek 'more education' in order to signal that their worth and skills have improved. Hence, Spence (1973) further noted that education credentials 'signal' employers about the competitive parameters that the potential employees will have to address in the labour market.",

            "text": "Neoclassical economists also believe that individuals choose education and training to maximise their earnings. Therefore, education and training can be considered an investment (Tan, 2014) . Blaug (1992) further claimed that individuals consider their present enjoyment and pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits while choosing education as an investment decision. Given the growing popularity of the concept higher education as a private good, students having a higher SES might be able to take advantage of such investment. Although the widespread desire for social betterment can be achieved through a universal education system, higher education opportunities are not universal, regardless of what high-, middle-, and low-income countries aspire to. Using data on 55 countries with 50% or above higher educated individuals, Marginson (2016) shows that education's expansion is not making progress because elite institutions do not provide equal social access. Pickety (2014) and Piketty and Seaz (2013) argued that elitism in higher education has dramatically aggravated income inequality amongst highly educated graduates. Family income and social capital strongly influence access to both elite higher education and professional opportunities (Rivera, 2015; Soares, 2007) . Marginson (2019) argued that the relationship between education and work is heterogeneous, and it is impossible to formulate a theory to explain such complex dynamics. In such an environment, SES's effect is not only limited to education but also extended to professional achievement. This paper, the first of its kind, argues that despite a longer education in similar academic programs, socioeconomic factors remain a critical component for engineers' academic and professional achievements.",

To examine the effect of SES on further academic and career advancement, we first employ a qualitative analysis of secondary data to describe the differences in SES between BUET and DUET graduates. We then adopt an empirical model to explain whether SES has a causal impact on academic achievement in HSC and DE levels. This model uses primary source data. While the interpretations of findings of first and second research issues are mainly used to chalk out the third research question, semi-structured interviews were also conducted with the employers 3 and academics 4 to generate some deeper insights.

Students enrolled in BUET always have a better CGPA in SSC compared to their counterparts in DUET. However, the CGPA is increasing over time in both groups. One potential reason for this is the overall improvement in academic attainment throughout the country. Figure 6 illustrates the academic achievement trends in HSC and diploma engineering programs. They also have the same trends in the whole sample period which means the performance of HSC graduates is better than DE. After graduating from the DE program, getting a job in the public sector is highly competitive, whereas the private sector mostly absorbs them in sub-managerial positions. Upon realising that a 'bachelor qualification' is a 'must' in order to be promoted in an executive position, diploma engineers attempt to continue further education in DUET. 6 The income categories are defined by following the government's segmentation as prescribed by BBS (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics). 7 After completing the JSC exam, some students can enrol in a 2-year SSC-Vocational (SSC-VOC) program, which is equivalent to the SSC. 8 SSC graduates can go either into a HSC or DE program while SSC-VOC can enrol only in the DE program.

These statistics confirm that BUET graduates have a relatively higher academic achievement in most cases. Consequently, one may argue whether the SES affects academic achievement. Additionally, DUET graduates have a 4-year diploma engineering education prior to getting their first degree in engineering while BUET counterparts do not. Therefore, engineering education at the undergraduate level may offer DUET students an advantage in their subsequent engineering programs, although most of them come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Someone may argue whether an additional 4-year engineering education, in such case DE, affects academic and professional achievements in subsequent education and professional careers. On this basis, whether this DE program helps to overcome SES''s effects in the first degree or the professional career opportunities is open to question.

As DUET students already have a 4-year engineering education, it would be interesting to examine how a prior engineering program in a polytechnic affects subsequent engineering education when taking socioeconomic factors into account. Using Eq. 3, column 1 in Table 3 shows the estimated effect of the DE on academic achievement at the bachelor level.

Despite having a 4-year additional engineering education, a polytechnic program does not significantly influence their subsequent program.

This is how DUET graduates probably fall behind BUET even DUET has an 8-year engineering education program. Both BUET and DUET graduates completed almost the same number of credit hours These situations in turn generate questions concerning both 'human capital' and 'signaling' theories. Establishing the difference 11 between 'human capital' and 'signaling' theories is a subject of striking controversy in the discourse of education economics (Connelly et al., 2010) . While 'human capital' theory suggests that education increases wages/salaries by aggregating 'productivity', 'signaling theory' claims that education increases people's wages simply because it is a signal of the 'employees' ability' 12 (Connelly et al., 2010) . Education credentials represent a proxy of all attributes that a potential candidate may have in the labour market; this is a key tenet of 'signaling theory' (Weiss, 1995) . For this reason, it is highly likely that graduates from both institutions (BUET and DUET) will have the opportunity to do well in the recruitment process.",

            "text": "An employer can choose the best potential candidate through the recruitment process. In contrast, some recruitment processes within the country have discouraged DUET graduates from qualifying for them. For example, the engineering division of the Bangladesh Army and some commercial banks (Dutch Bangla Bank Limited-DBBL) have imposed an embargo on DUET graduates when positions are advertised. While DUET authorities contacted these employers asking to explain the embargo, further explanation was not forthcoming. Although BUET and DUET graduates have a 4-year undergraduate degree, allowing only those from one institution to apply for jobs is discrimination. Moreover, the discriminated against DUET graduates have an additional 4-year diploma engineering qualification. It appears that while academic results are appreciated, studying for a longer period of time tends to be ignored in the labour market. In other words, signaling theory's emphasis on overall attributes achieved through education credentials may only partially work. Therefore, findings may suggest that polytechnic education does not help the graduates obtain subsequent academic status and professional careers. 11 We believe that both theories are in some contexts very similar and it is not necessarily a case of 'either-or'. 12 It could refer to various kinds of abilities such as innate attributes. Note: ***, **, and * represent significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively Education offered at lower education levels (such as primary and secondary school) enhances productivity/human capital (Perry, 2012; Triventi, 2013; Tynkkynen et al., 2012) . Students accrue literacy, numeracy, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and other basis ones while at school. School-life also plays an important role on the development of character and personality (Triventi, 2013) . Having said that, an additional investment in students from privileged socioeconomic backgrounds supplements and complements what schooling sets out to achieve. Such investments may also ensure students from a privileged SES will obtain greater success than others (Tynkkynen et al., 2012) . This trend continues into higher education and the job market which may force both the human capital and signaling theories to seek other explanations (Alam, 2021) . Neither of these theories is faultless although it seems that signaling theory should work well in the context of tertiary education (Connelly et al., 2010) .",

Riley (2017) emphasised a rigorous and evidence-based engineering research and education. Compared with other academic disciplines-business, humanities, and social sciencesengineering education is a more practice-driven education. The availability of logistical support for a practice-driven program is crucial in shaping career progress. Because of the unavailability of such data, we mainly rely on official statistics on students' enrolments and on semi-structured interviews on the subject of overcoming the socioeconomic effects. According to BANBEIS (Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics , 2020), the total enrolment in polytechnic institutions has more than doubled in the last 5 years. Unfortunately, teaching and laboratory-related logistics have not expanded. Using the same infrastructure and logistics, delivering diploma engineering education to these increased intakes is not ideal. In such cases, theory-driven lectures are overly emphasised to the detriment of practical instruction. The student and teacher ratio has also significantly increased. As a result, polytechnic institutions might not train their graduates as promised in their academic curricula.",
