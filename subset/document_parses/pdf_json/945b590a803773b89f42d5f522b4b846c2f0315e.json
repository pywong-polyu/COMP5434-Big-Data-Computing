However, longitudinal evidence, particularly for early adolescents, is lacking. This study investigated family pre-pandemic influences on parental stress and adolescent psychosocial wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from 233 adolescents and their parents before and during the initial phase of the pandemic. Parents reported their own stress level and perception of adolescent adjustment problems, whereas adolescents reported their own psychological distress level. In addition, adolescents also reported their satisfaction with family life in the pre-pandemic survey. Cross-lagged path models indicated reciprocal associations between parental stress and perception of adolescent adjustment problems. Compared to adolescents low in pre-pandemic family life satisfaction, those adolescents with higher levels of family life satisfaction before the pandemic reported lower levels of anxiety and stress only when parental stress showed no increase during the pandemic. Findings provide support for the mutual influences between parental stress and perceived adolescent adjustment problems during the pandemic. Special attention should be paid to those adolescents who undergo significant family life changes during the pandemic.",

Many countries had implemented either a full or partial lockdown to control the spread of COVID-19. The closure of schools, educational institutes, and activity areas has negatively affected over 91% of the world's student population (Lee, 2020) . With a large proportion of people being confined indoors for a long period of time, there has been increasing concerns and attention to the mental health impact of school closures and other physical distancing requirements (Holmes et al., 2020; Van Lancker & Parolin, 2020 ). Yet, the majority of research has focused on the prevalence and severity of mental health problems during lockdown. While a theoretical conception of family and child experiences during the current pandemic is emerging (Benner & Mistry, 2020; Prime et al., 2020) , there remains little empirical work to investigate the mechanisms underpinning these experiences.",

Findings of emotional changes in parents and children during the pandemic have been mixed. On one hand, the disruptions caused by the pandemic to employment, education, and socialization can intensify emotional disturbance in parents and children. It has been reported that increased caregiving burden during the pandemic is linked with parental reports of mental ill-health and perception of children's stress (Romero et al., 2020) . On the other hand, for some families, the COVID-19 crisis can provide a unique opportunity to reconnect, create memories, and evaluate priorities. In a qualitative study of families in Australia, Evans et al. (2020) found that while most families reported mental health difficulties and strained relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic, some families were unaffected because they could cope with pandemic-related stressors using constructive communication and conflict resolution strategies.",

An investigation of the characteristics of family environment before the pandemic would be useful for improving our understanding of why and how mental health states in parents and children can change over the pandemic course. While research targeting young children is emerging Xie et al., 2020) , very few work has been done to clarify the mental health impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children reaching early adolescence and their families. Early adolescence is of special interest because this is a time of transition from childhood to adolescence, during which individuals may have greater vulnerability to mental illnesses particularly at difficult times such as COVID-19 (Benner & Mistry, 2020) .",

Although disadvantaged families are more likely to have insufficient resources, increased financial pressure due to unexpected events such as unemployment, income decline, and unmanageable debts during the pandemic can affect all families across socioeconomic strata (Fegert et al., 2020) . It is thus important to recognize that the pandemic is causing unprecedented challenges to all families regardless of their socioeconomic background.",

            "text": "Different theoretical models have been suggested to explain how social disruption may impact child adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic (Prime et al., 2020; Wu & Xu, 2020) . The family stress model, for example, suggests that stressors could strain caregivers' wellbeing and adaptive parenting behaviours, in turn leading to increased psychosocial difficulties in children (Conger et al., 2002) . In particular, children's socio-emotional problems would likely arise when parents frequently express negative affect or unsupportive reactions to children's emotions (Breaux et al., 2016) . As indicated by the family system theory (Schermerhorn & Mark Cummings, 2008) , family is an emotional unit where members could interact and exert influences on each other's thinking and behavior. Evidence suggests that emotions in one family member can spill over to the other members (Nelson et al., 2009) . Although the parent-driven models are evident in the COVID-19 setting, very little attention has been paid to the impact of children's behaviour on parental mental health during the COVID-19 period. Notably, early adolescents just start to explore ways of becoming independent but still seek to maintain close relationships with family members (Lam et al., 2012) . This independence-dependence struggle may make early adolescents more difficult to adjust to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn could increase parental stress and affect how they perceive children's adjustment problems during this period.",

Prime et al. (2020) suggested that pre-existing vulnerabilities within families could predispose children and families to pandemic-related stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression, whereas intact or strong family bond can protect individuals against these negative emotional states. A previous study examining the impact of 9/11 attacks on children's post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms found that maternal acceptance pre-9/11 and helpful mother-child discussions about the event post-9/11 were linked with fewer PTS symptoms in children (Wilson et al., 2010) . Research also found an association between increased family support and a lower risk of probable depression during social movements (Ni et al., 2020) . In addition, youth who were social distancing because of parental rules reported greater belongingness during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (Oosterhoff et al., 2020) . However, it is unclear whether such association still holds true for those adolescents who have been living in a conflictual and unsupportive family environment before the pandemic.",

Prior to analysis, all variables were inspected for outliers and normality; all assumptions of multiple linear regression, including normality, homoscedasticity, and absence of multicollinearity were met. To investigate the stability and cross-lagged effects, we employed structural equational modelling (SEM) with full information maximum likelihood techniques using the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) R package (Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2010) . This two-wave autoregressive cross-lagged design allows for examination of influences over time of one construct on another and vice versa, while simultaneously controlling for stability as well as for associations between the two investigated constructs over time (Kline, 2015; Little et al., 2007) . Specifically, we built one single model to include all autoregressive, correlated, and cross-lagged relationships with adjustment for several confounding effects including age, gender, and family SES. The autoregressive relationships accounted for stability over time for both the PSI-SF-PD sum score and the SDQ sum score. Additionally, we included the correlations between the sum score of PSI-SF-PD and that of SDQ at T1 and T2 to account for the strong association between these constructs (Barroso et al., 2018; Neece et al., 2012) . Hence, the crosslagged effects can be interpreted as the predictive effects of (1) the sum score of PSI-SF-PD at T1 on that of SDQ at T2 and (2) the sum score of SDQ at T1 on that of PSI-SF-PD at T2. The goodness-of-fit of the estimated model was evaluated using four indicators: comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). Good model fit is indicated by CFI > 0.95, TLI > 0.95, RMSEA < 0.06, and SRMR < 0.08 (Hu & Bentler, 1999) .",

Age, gender, family SES, parental marital status, status of receiving financial assistance from the government, frequency of dinner with parents, and initial level of externalizing problems and distress variable of interest were entered as covariates into these analyses. Given missing values below 5% of the total number of values, we replaced the missing data of predictors and control variables using the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) R package (Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2010) to include all cases (n = 233).",

Standardized coefficients were reported, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant in this study. Table 1 displays the socio-demographic characteristics of the entire sample. There were no dropouts and reports of major adverse events or changes occurring in the parents or adolescents during the follow-up period, and none had been diagnosed with COVID-19 at the time of follow-up survey. Over 97% of the parent respondents were mothers. The mean age of the adolescents (92 males and 141 females) was 12.20 years (SD = 0.43) at T1. 94.4% of the parents were married and living together. Two families reported receiving government subsidies at T1. 138 (59.2%) parents reported an increase in parental stress at T2. 93 (40.2%) adolescents were perceived by parents to have an increase in adjustment problems at T2. 41 (17.6%) adolescents experienced an increase in all three aspects of psychological distress (stress, depression, and anxiety) at T2. Specifically, 96 (41.9%) reported an increase in depression levels, whereas 98 (43.4%) and 91 (39.1%) reported an increase in stress and anxiety levels, respectively. Intercorrelations among T2 emotional changes and T1 family life satisfaction are presented in Table 2 . Adolescent T1 family life satisfaction correlated positively and significantly with their change in adjustment problems at T2 (r = 0.137, p = 0.038), suggesting that adolescents high in family life satisfaction before COVID-19 were more sensitive to the psychosocial impact of the outbreak.",

The first step in the analysis examined whether T1 family life satisfaction would be associated with adolescent T2 emotional adjustment as well as whether parental stress would change with adolescent psychological distress over the study period. Results showed no significant associations between these variables after controlling for the effects of age, gender, family SES, parental marital status, status of receiving financial assistance from the government, frequency of dinner with parents, and initial level of externalizing problems and distress variable of interest. The second step in the analysis tested the hypothesis that adolescent T1 family life satisfaction would moderate a relationship between parental stress and adolescent psychological distress changes at T2. Significant interactions were found between adolescent T1 family life satisfaction and parental T2 elevated stress in predicting adolescent T2 changes in anxiety (\u03b2 = 0.21, p = 0.034) and stress levels (\u03b2 = 0.24, p = 0.014). To examine these interactions graphically, we plotted the regression of T2 changes in psychological distress (stress, depression, and anxiety) on T1 family life satisfaction at high and low levels for adolescents facing elevated parental stress and those who did not at T2 (see Fig. 2a-c) . Compared to those low in family life satisfaction at T1, adolescents with higher levels of family life satisfaction at T1 reported increased levels of anxiety and stress when parental stress was elevated at T2, but their levels of anxiety and stress were reduced when parental stress showed no increase at T2. On the other hand, T1 family life satisfaction did not play a moderating role in the relationship between changes in parental stress and changes in adolescent depression symptoms at T2. As shown in Fig. 2c , adolescents reported increased levels of depression when parental stress was elevated at T2 regardless of their initial level of family life satisfaction at T1.",

Our findings support a bidirectional model between parental stress and perception of early adolescents' adjustment problems in the pandemic context. Furthermore, we found that parental stress predicted a marked increase in levels of adolescent stress and anxiety over the course of the pandemic only for those adolescents high in pre-pandemic family life satisfaction. The findings together provide new insights into the family antecedents and correlates of psychosocial wellbeing among children in early adolescence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fig. 1 Cross-lagged effects of adolescent adjustment problems and parental stress. Coefficients were standardized and a full information maximum likelihood estimator was used. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 Results of this study also align with previous non-pandemic research showing reciprocal influences of parental practices and child behavioral outcomes (Rodas et al., 2017) . Although we did not investigate parenting practices, it is possible that parental perception of adolescent psychosocial difficulties before the pandemic could lead to inappropriate discipline practices and elevated stress levels during the pandemic. In line with the family systems perspectives (Nelson et al., 2009) , our results suggest that parents without mental health problems before the pandemic may have a higher capacity to help children to cope with pandemic-related stressors. They are also less likely to transfer negative emotions to other members, and thus these families could face lower risks of poor health and well-being during the pandemic.",

Specifically, we observed that within these families, when parents experienced no increase in stress levels, pre-pandemic satisfaction with family life appeared to reduce adolescent negative feelings during the pandemic. However, when parental stress was elevated, pre-pandemic satisfaction with family life may predispose adolescents within these families to mental health problems during the pandemic. It is possible that elevated stressful experiences during the pandemic may have disrupted the usual family routine and interactions that are considered important for promoting adolescent perception of family life satisfaction before the pandemic. For example, when parents are stressed by pandemic-related challenges, they may show less interest to perform the usual pre-pandemic family activities or use harsher parenting methods which could aggravate emotional difficulties in children during the pandemic (Benner & Mistry, 2020) .",

These findings support the notion of stressor exposure as a risk factor for more severe mental health problems such as anxiety and depression (Anyan & Hjemdal, 2016) . As McEwen (2005) indicates, the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic can evoke stress but not necessarily overwhelm individuals to have long-term health and functional problems such as chronic fatigue, worry, frustration or other coping difficulties. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited disruptions to family life and work, the surveyed parents and adolescents in this study may have undergone only the short-terms effects of the pandemic as indicated by greater increases in stress levels than the levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, chronic exposure to adverse conditions could result in toxic stress responses and increase the risk of depression (Hammen, 2005) . It is therefore important to conduct regular assessments, particularly on high-risk individuals, for early detection and intervention of unusual psychological and behavioural signs across different phases of the pandemic.",

Second, as indicated earlier, some of the mental health changes may take place at a slower rate and would not be adequately reflected in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, our results are based on questionnaire assessment. Future research should use data from direct assessment or multiple informants' reports to increase the reliability of study findings. Finally, this study was not able to rule out the possibility of an intermediate variable that is responsible for the link between parental stress and adolescent adjustment problems.
