Thus, a nationwide multicenter retrospective survey was conducted to evaluate the disease burden in non-COVID-19 population. This multi-center survey involved 94 hospitals from 24 provinces in the mainland of China, and collected data on non-COVID-19 patients admitted to the radiology departments due to VTE between January 24 and April 16, 2020. Baseline characteristics, VTE risk factors, clinical manifestations and the treatments were compared with those in the same period of 2019. 3,358 patients with VTE from 74 hospitals were included in this study (1,458 in 2020, 1,900 in 2019). Most aged \u2265 50 years (80.6% in the pandemic, 81.2% in 2019). The number of patients aged 30-39 years increased from 3.9% in 2019 period to 5.8% in the pandemic (p = 0.009). Among the VTE risk factors, the rate of decreased activity increased significantly in the pandemic, and was much higher than that in 2019 (30.7% vs 22.6%, p < 0.0001). Under the risk of decreased activity, patients with comorbidities chronic diseases, especially diabetes, showed significantly a higher incidence of VTE (30.4% vs 22.0%, p < 0.0001). In the pandemic period, fewer patients were treated with anticoagulation alone (33.5% vs 36.7%, p = 0.05), and more underwent inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) implantation, compared with those in 2019 (66.5% vs 63.2%, p = 0.046). The pandemic increased the VTE risk of decreased activity among the non-COVID-19 population.

Baseline characteristics (age, sex, and comorbidities disease), VTE risk factors, and clinical manifestations were collected by a questionnaire (Supplemental table) . Except for age, all other questions have been presented in the form of multiple-choice questions. Possible VTE risk factors include decreased activity (greater time spent sitting or lying down, and physical activity time less than half of the usual \u2265 3 days, with no other disease reasons), recent surgery performed in the prior 2 months (including abdominal, cardiac, neurological surgery, etc.), traumatic fractures without surgery in the prior one month, immobilization for at least one week for any nonsurgical reason in the prior one month and others (including hormonal therapy, fat and chronic lung disease) [7, 8] . The categories of VTE including DVT and PE were analyzed. The treatments were also evaluated, including anticoagulation alone, inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) implantation, and additional interventional radiology therapy (including catheter-directed thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, balloon dilatation, or stent implantation). Data were compared with those of the in-hospital VTE patients during the same period in 2019 (from January 24 to April 16). Finally, three senior doctors gathered and analyzed all the data.",

Many people spent more time sitting or lying down at home, and their physical activity time was less than half of the usual [13] . The present study showed that decreased activity was the first risk factor in the pandemic period, with significantly higher rate than that in the same period of 2019. Decreased activity reduces venous blood flow, particularly in the pockets of the venous valves, resulting in stasis and increased coagulation [14] . It also increases the possibility of prethrombotic state when the duration is more than 24 h, it will be a risk factor if the duration exceeds 3 days [15] . In previous studies, decreased activity has been identified as the main factor of hospital-acquired VTE [16] . Data from the RIETE registry trial reported that recent decreased activity provoke the recurrence of VTE and PE in COPD patients with VTE, the OR are 0.96 (0.61-1.53) and 1.01 (0.57-1.79) respectively [15] . Therefore, this study recommended appropriate activity to reduce the possibility of VTE during the self-isolation. On the other hand, decreased activity reduced the risk of trauma and surgery in turn. Thus, the pandemic also affected the constituent ratio of the VTE risk factors.",

Therefore, patients with chronic comorbidities disease should be aware of incident VTE during the pandemic.During the pandemic, home-based exercise can be beneficial for older adults [19, 20] . Behnood Bikdeli et al. recommended the Table 1 Baseline characteristics of patients with venous thromboembolism in the pandemic period and in the same period of 2019 IQR interquartile range, VTE venous thromboembolism a Decreased activity (greater time spent sitting or lying down, and physical activity time less than half of the usual \u2265 3 days) b Recent trauma without surgery c Recent surgery performed in the prior 2 months (including trauma, abdominal, genitourinary, orthopedic, cardiac, vascular, or neurological surgery) d Immobilization for at least 7 days for any non-surgical reason in the prior one month (associated or not with medical conditions, or non-operable fractures) e Other risk factors including hormonal therapy, fat and chronic lung disease patients without COVID-19 but with risk factors to increase mobility, and even administer pharmacologic prophylaxis after risk assessment. Telemedicine and e-visits were preferable to minimize the risks of in-person interactions between healthcare worker and patient [2] . Under the panic of COVID-19, it showed that patients were more likely to choose aggressive treatment. The rate of IVCF implantation and additional interventional therapy increased in the pandemic period. And only 33.5% patients were treated with anticoagulation alone in the pandemic period, which was lower than that in 2019.",

To our knowledge, it is the largest study to date that examined how the pandemic affects the prevalence of VTE in patients without COVID-19 in China. The study has some limitations. First, because of its retrospective nature and limitation of the data available (derived predominantly from the radiology departments), and those with VTE did not go to the hospitals were not included, a potential exists for misrepresentation of national hospitalizations may exist. Second, lack of information (duration, severity, follow-up, etc.) limited further evaluation. Third, the pandemic period (from January 24th to April 16th) was not divided into different stages reported by other studies [21, 22] . Even so, we tried to send an important message as Dr. Rosenbaum called for, \"Covid or no Covid, we are still here to care for you\" [23] . Promoting healthy living for future pandemic protection should be considered [24] .",
