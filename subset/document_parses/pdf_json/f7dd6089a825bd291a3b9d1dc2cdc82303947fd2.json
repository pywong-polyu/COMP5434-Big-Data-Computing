Discussion: These data confirm a certain degree of vaccine mistrust in Italy, especially among less qualified workers. Influenza vaccine has been made available free of charge by the Italian National Health Service to all population above age 65, and to selected workers, including most health workers. Due to the COV-ID-19 pandemic, the age limit has now been extended to all population 60 and over. Only a limited proportion of the population, however, accepted to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza.",

            "text": "We conducted a nationally representative survey of attitudes towards influenza vaccination, and a potential COVID-19 vaccine in the Italian population. We included five questions on influenza and a potential COVID-19 vaccine (including regular yearly use of influenza vaccine, use in the previous winter, vaccine advice by the GP, attitudes towards influenza and a potential COVID-19 vaccine this year) in weekly national surveys routinely conducted by Doxa (3). The present survey was conducted on September 16-28, 2020, and based on a sample of 1055 individuals (546 women, 509 men), representative of the general Italian population aged 15-85 in terms of sex, age, geographic area and socio-economic status. Data were collected using computer assisted web interviews (CAWI). We carried out a stratified analysis by sex, age group (15-34, 35-54, \u226555) and occupation category (1 -Professionals, managers and teachers; 2 -Office workers and merchants; 3 -Manual workers and farmers). Table 1 gives the results on the total population, by sex and age group. In Italy, 21.2% of subjects reported to regularly undergo influenza vaccination, 6.4% only some years, and 72.4% never. The proportion of ever influenza vaccine users was higher in women (23.1%) and particularly in the population 55 and over (41.9%). This was confirmed by the percentage of subjects reporting influenza vaccine last year, 24.4% overall and 46.6% at age 55 and over. Subjects interviewed reported that their GP recommended influenza vaccination to about a third of the sample, and to about 60% at age 55 and over. About 40% of the Italian population reported an intention to be vaccinated against influenza next winter (21.7% certainly, 19.1% probably), and the proportion rose to about 60% (41.3% certainly, 17.5% probably) at age 55 and over. A potential COVID-19 vaccine would be accepted by about 54% of the population (20.4% certainly, 33.3% probably), and the proportion rose to 58.2% (29.8% for certainly) acceptance above age 55. Table 2 shows the results by occupation categories. The proportion of ever influenza vaccine users was higher among professionals, managers and teachers than among manual workers and farmers (19.6% vs. 11.0%) as well as the proportion of users who received influenza vaccination last year (14.4% vs. 8.7%). More than one-fourths of the professionals, managers and teachers were advised to be vaccinated by their GP, while the proportion was much lower among manual workers and farmers (13.4%). The percentages of workers who reported the intention to be vaccinated against influenza next winter (yes and probably) were: 36.1% among professionals, managers and teachers and 27.6% among manual workers and farmers. The percentages of workers who reported the intention to receive a potential COVID-19 vaccination were: 51.6% among professionals, managers and teachers and 44.8% among manual workers.",

At present, only about 50% of the Italian population has a favourable attitude towards a potential COVID-19 vaccine.

Obiettivi: Descrivere l'attitudine verso la vaccinazione antinfluenzale e un potenziale vaccino per il COVID-19 in Italia. Metodi: Un'indagine nazionale rappresentativa, basata su 1055 Italiani di et\u00e0 compresa tra 15 e 85 anni \u00e8 stata condotta tra il 16 e il 28 Settembre 2020. Risultati: Il 40,8% della popolazione ha riportato l'intenzione di vaccinarsi contro l'influenza il prossimo inverno e il 53,7% accetterebbe di ricevere un potenziale vaccino per il COVID-19. Le percentuali sono pi\u00f9 altre tra gli individui di et\u00e0 \u2265 8% per un potenziale vaccino per il COVID-19). Discussione: Questi dati confermano un certo grado di sfiducia nei vaccini in Italia, specialmente tra i lavoratori meno qualificati.",
