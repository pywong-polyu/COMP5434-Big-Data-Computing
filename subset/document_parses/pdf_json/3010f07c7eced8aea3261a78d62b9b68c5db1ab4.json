            "text": "The Covid pandemic has become a serious public health challenge for people across India and other nations. Nowadays, people rely on the online reviews being shared on different review sites to gather information about hospitals like the availability of beds, availability of ventilators, etc. However, since these reviews are large in number and are unstructured, patients struggle to get accurate and reliable information about the hospitals, due to which they end up taking admission into a hospital which might not be appropriate for the specific treatment they require. This paper employs the use of sentiment analysis to understand various online reviews of hospitals and provide valuable information to the patients. Approximately 30,000 + reviews were collected from more than 500 hospitals. The broad objective of the study is to give the patients a comprehensive and descriptive rating of the hospitals based on the online reviews given by different patients. In addition to providing a comprehensive summary, the study has conducted aspect-based analysis where it compares the hospitals based on four different aspects of the hospital viz. \"Doctors' services\", \"Staff's services\", \"Hospital facilities\", and \"Affordability\". The database containing aspect-based ratings of the hospitals will be of great value to the patients by allowing them to compare and select the best hospital based on the optimum fit of the aspects of their preference.",

Lack of reliable sources of information regarding available healthcare infrastructure and services may result in adverse consequences for serious patients (both Covid and non-Covid) for whom getting right treatment in time is critical. Due to lack of information about the available facilities and services, it may be possible that the patients end up getting their treatment in the hospital which do not have adequate resources to cure their disease in particular. This becomes one of the major risks for the patients. For example, patients suffering from Covid should get their treatment from the hospital having adequate amount of oxygen availability. However, if the patients do not have information regarding oxygen availability for the hospitals at the time of admission, they may take admission in a hospital which is not appropriate for the disease.",

In today's technology-savvy world, an increasing number of people are relying on reviews to make their decisions.

Global Internet traffic is predicted to be 7.7 Exa-bytes per day in the year 2021, up from 2.4 Exa-bytes per day in 2016. This is more than a twofold increase. Global Internet traffic in 2021 will be equivalent to 707 billion DVDs per year, 59 billion DVDs per month, or 81 million DVDs per hour [2] . Recent technological advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning have now made it possible to synthesize this large amount of data and derive commercially valuable information from it [3] .",

            "text": "There are multiple types of platforms that allow users to share their reviews, opinions or suggestions. There are many product-based e-commerce sites or digital marketplaces such as amazon.com or flipkart.com, then there are some service-oriented sites like trivago.com and makemytrip.com. Apart from all these sites social media sites like facebook.com and Instagram.com where many people share their opinions and suggestions related to various products or services. However, there are multiple challenges with basing decisions on online reviews. Primary problem is that they are mostly unstructured and colloquially written, which makes them difficult for extracting information from them. The large volume of reviews from multiple sources also makes the task of reading the reviews and making choices a very complex and tedious task. Usage of sarcasm and language slangs further makes the reviews difficult to be deciphered. Sentiment analysis provides us a tool for proper understanding of reviews and deriving meaningful information from them. Considering the healthcare sector, a proper mechanism to assimilate and decipher the online reviews of hospitals can help us develop a database that contains comprehensive information set about hospitals including the quality of their services and condition of their facilities. Sentiment analysis is a domain that classifies reviews, comments, or opinions into two intrinsic sentimental indicators, i.e., positive and negative [4] . Sentiment analysis means the understanding of the emotional essence of any text and the evaluation of the nature of emotion of the text [5] . Nature can be either on the spectrum of good and bad or simply neutral [6] . Sentiment analysis is generally applied to various materials such as reviews and survey responses from online sources. It extracts subjective information and facilitates businesses with a tool to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product, or service with the help of online reviews.",

            "text": "In this paper, the overall aim is to summarize the reviews of hospitals using sentiment analysis and also to develop a methodology that can be generalized for any product or service. We aim to develop a demonstration model based on the healthcare sector. The task of sentiment analysis of hospital reviews mainly includes the following steps in sequence: pre-processing [7] , attribute extraction which is followed by the selection of the relevant attribute [8] , emotional analysis [9] , and at last quantifying the extracted attributes. A typical approach is to compute an average quantitative rating based on individual user ratings. However, this method does not describe the true nature of the hospital and the overall rating is not comprehensive as a single quantified parameter fails to convey any meaningful information about the hospital in detail. Thus, such average ratings are generally not a true indicator of the nature of the hospital. To solve the above-mentioned problem, the methodology discussed in this paper aims at providing an aspect-based summary of hospitals based on the online reviews. The aspects considered in this study are \"Doctors' services\", \"Staff's services\", \"Hospital facilities\" and \"Affordability\". These aspects are made of the set of attributes which are of similar meaning. For example, the attributes such as [\"cost\", \"costly\", \"loot\", \"payment\", \"pricey\", \"cash\", \"affordable\", \"bill\", \"fees\"] are related to the aspect of \"Affordability\". Similarly, each aspect is formed from a defined set of attributes. The aspect-based ratings will be more suitable for the patients as these ratings will enable them to compare hospitals based on more specific parameters. There might be a case where a hospital is expensive but the staff is very poor or a hospital is having good doctors but lacks other facilities for a specific disease. These types of details can only be measured using aspect-based rating and would probably be missed in a single-value average quantitative rating.",

The work [30] tries to extract features by taking advantage of the observation that a lot of product features are phrases, which introduces a concept of phrase dependency parsing and further extends traditional dependency parsing to phrase level. The authors of [31] try to formulate an approach to deal with single sentence with multiple emotions and features related to any product or service. The paper [32] is a literary survey that compares and contrasts various deep learning algorithms used for aspect-level sentiment classification. However, works in Table 1 did not propose any methodology regarding how to integrate attribute-specific emotions to obtain the overall Yes sentimental polarity of reviews. Moreover, all the works mentioned in Table 1 are primarily based on analysis of product review like mobiles, laptops, television etc. and not based on services like hospitality sector or healthcare sector. This work tries to present an approach to integrate attribute-specific emotions and obtain the overall sentimental polarity of reviews and is based on the healthcare industry.",

This new approach might be a better alternative than the traditional methods such as surveys and feedback forms. The establishment of a strong relationship between the patient's reviews and the services which are lacking or the services which need improvement in the healthcare system emphasized the need for more work in this domain [34, 35] . But, to the best of the authors' knowledge, in healthcare sector, no work has been done at aspect-level sentiment analysis.

For example, multiple forms of a base word 'organize' can be 'organizes', 'organized', 'organizing', etc. However, such multiple forms of a single word do not contribute in sentiment analysis. Thus, it is advisable to consider the base word only. In this study, we have found the base word by lemmatization which reduces any form of a word to its base word. We used 'WordNetLemmatizer' from 'nltk.stem' module to perform this task. lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer() For example, 'are', 'is', 'being' \u2192 'be' 'car', 'cars', 'car's' \u2192 'car'",

Consider the aspect of 'Affordability' whose rating is 50 for hospital no. 2. This implies that half the number of people who have mentioned this aspect in their reviews have said positive or good things about this particular aspect. Similar inference can be drawn from the other ratings. In this way, the aspect-based results would be more helpful for the patients than simple average ratings given to hospitals based on the sentiment analysis of whole reviews. The last four columns of Table 3 represent results related to normal sentiment analysis of hospital reviews, where we simply count the number of positive (good), negative (bad), and neutral (neither good nor bad) reviews and rate the hospital based on these data. The 'Net rating' (last column) is calculated according to Eq. 3, where Total Reviews are the sum of all the positive, negative, and neutral reviews. representation of data and the Y-axis indicates the number of hospitals that are in a particular aspect-rating interval. Figure 3 shows that a highest number of hospitals (i.e., 148) share the rating from the interval of 65(excluded) to 78(included) for the aspect of 'Doctors' services'. This indicates that average rating for this aspect lies in the interval of 65(excluded) to 78(included). Thus, the average aspect rating can be used as benchmark to compare other hospitals in aspects of doctors' quality, expertise etc. and hospitals above this average are among top rated ones. Figure 7 represents the Net rating of the hospital calculated according to Eq. 3 and indicates the result for the normal sentiment analysis of hospital reviews. The data from Table 3 in the last column with the title 'Net Rating' is corresponding to the scatterplot of Fig. 7 . As we can observe from Fig. 7 that majority of hospitals have the average net rating in the interval of 60-80. Thus, the average net rating can be used to filter the above average rated hospitals from the rest. Figure 7 only represent single data point for each hospital based on sentiment analysis ",
