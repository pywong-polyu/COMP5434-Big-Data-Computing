Furthermore, those Mexicans who have lost their jobs and are facing trials and tribulations are also turning to this saint to cope with the mental strains.

We begin by describing Santa Muerte's attributes, after which we consider her origins. We argue that they derive not only from pre-Hispanic thanatology but also hail from the dark days of the Black Death in fourteenth-century Europe. Without such an understanding of not only her European but also her Indigenous origins, the duality of her powers of life and death cannot be comprehended. We then outline praxis and belief in devotion to death. In turn, ethnographic evidence is proffered detailing Santa Muerte's role in the coronavirus pandemic. This underscores not only her role as holy healer, countering claims she is merely a narco-saint but also attests to the saint's plasticity in adapting to l'air du temps. We also consider how veneration of Santa Muerte allows her devotees to be willing to take her bony hand when the time comes for them to leave this world. As we outline, the new religious movement is based, much as Indigenous faith once was, upon acceptance of the interdependence of life and death. For devotees, this thanatological epistemology furnishes the framework for understanding their reality and the certainty of death.",

The anthropologist during fieldwork made strong local connections which they maintain and although unable to go to the field due to current travel bans owing to the virus, they are in contact daily with respondents in Mexico and abreast of what is happening on the ground. Furthermore, both of us have conducted digital ethnography using participant observation to interact with Santa Muertistas (devotees of Santa Muerte) on social media sites such as Facebook which has innumerable groups consisting of 80,000 followers in some groups alone. On these sites, we publicly and privately corresponded with those posting prayers against COVID-19 and those thanking Santa Muerte for miracles of virus healing.

Catholic saints, the great majority of whom lived centuries ago in Europe, are far removed from the average Latin American and are difficult to relate to, although Saint Jude, patron of lost causes, has become hugely popular in Mexico. Folk saints, literally saints of the folk, are typically deceased people who lived out their lives on local soil and who after their death are believed to have been gifted supernatural powers (Graziano 2006) . Due to cultural affinities and familiar life stories, they are perceived as being more likely to listen to, understand and resolve the problems of their followers (Kingsbury and Chesnut 2020a; Kingsbury 2020) .",

In a similar vein, Pedro Bastista, during the same period, presided over a quasi-Catholic commune in the backlands of Brazil based on the promise of the supernatural healing of earthly afflictions (Chesnut 2017; Pessar 2004) . It therefore would not be far-fetched to argue that the most popular saints in the region are generally those that have a reputation for being powerful healers. Santa Muerte is also said to have strong curative powers, and as we will detail, is currently being propitiated to heal and protect devotees from COVID-19. As this is a new religious movement that has emerged in the last two decades in response to present day needs (Chesnut 2017; Chesnut 2020a, 2020b) , it is in perpetuum mobile and has manifested once more its malleability by morphing to Mexicans' current necessities in these times of coronavirus.",

Mexicans devotees, however, are more likely to regard the skeleton saint as an adapted version of an Indigenous goddess of death, whether Aztec, Mayan or Pur\u00e9pecha.

Like Santa Muerte, the deathly couple was typically represented as skeletons or human bodies with skulls for heads. Aztecs not only believed that those who died of natural causes ended up in Mictlan but also invoked the gods' supernatural powers for earthly causes, such as healing. With its persecution of Indigenous religion, the Spanish Conquest drove devotion underground and into syncretism with Catholicism. Thus, according to this version, her Spanish style tunics and dresses, and her European accoutrements, the scythe and scales of justice, are but a fa\u00e7ade thinly veiling her true Aztec identity (Chesnut 2017, p. 22) .",

Much like today, when cruise ships were believed to be one of the first and worst hit places due to the nature of enclosed crowded spaces which allowed COVID-19 to spread to passengers who then infected others upon their return home, back in the fourteenth century ships were believed to be the key vector of infection (Sonne 2016). In the early 1340s, the disease struck China, India, Syria, Persia and Egypt. In 1347, contagious travellers arrived in Europe from Caffa, Crimea. Twelve ships entered the Sicilian port of Messina. Those waiting on the docks were shocked to find that many aboard the ships were dead. Others were severely ill and covered in black boils which exuded pus and blood. Local authorities demanded the fleet of so-called death ships leave the harbour, but it was too late, the pestilence had already begun to spread. From Italy, the disease gradually propagated across the rest of Europe (Cohn and Cohn 2003) .",

Clotho held the distaff of the thread of life, intertwining dark and light strands. Lachesis, the second sister, twisted out the cord, and beneath her fingers, it vacillated strong and weak with life's vicissitudes.

It was said that death culled the living thus cutting their existence short, much as farmers in their fields lopped the heads off their wheat and barley crops. The practice began of decorating churches and graveyards with the ominous skeletal figure. In one of the most vivid depictions of death, usually set in cemeteries, Catholic clerics had actors perform a 'danse macabre', a dance of death. One of the thespians would dress as Death and as the other performers swayed their bodies one last time the Grim Reaper approached them, scythe in hand, and snatched up their soul (Knoll and Oosterwijk 2011). The Grim Reaper along with skulls featured in a wide range of religious material culture. The aim was to ensure that Christian eschatology be more easily assimilated by lay people. In the 1500s, such iconography would evolve into memento mori and vanitas items and objects (Schmidt 2011, p. 261).",

In pre-conquest iconography there are myriad skeletal deities from Ah Puch, the cadaverous Mayan death god, to the Tarascan goddess of birth and demise, Cuerauaperi, who has a skull for a head and empty death-like eyes (Hosier 1995; Pollard 1993) . Many of these death deities, from Mictecahihuatl to Xonaxi Quecuya, not only acted as psychopomps but also had the power to gift and 'foment life' (McCafferty and Carrasco 2001, p. 319) . And indeed many death goddesses were depicted in late pregnancy signifying the fecundity of death as a 'source of life' (Bloch and Parry 1982, p. 6-7). Death, rather than spelling finality as in Christian theology, was linked across Indigenous mythologies with the regeneration of life, as in the Mayan ball game, which is an analogy in action of 'death and rebirth' (Schele and Freidel 1990, p. 76) .",

No doubt many iterations of death remained clandestinely worshipped by devotees, but neither Mexicans nor foreign observers recorded the presence of Saint Death again until the 1940s when two American anthropologists note the saint of death being worshipped by women who prayed to her asking her to use her scythe to return errant husbands to the homestead (Lewis 1961 , Toor 1947 . Nevertheless, in one of the prayers for the novena (nine-day prayer) recorded in a chapbook at the time, the saint is supplicated for sanation. Saint Death is asked not only to rid curses but also illnesses. And of course, curses in Mexican folk epistemology are often perceived to lead to illness (see Zavaleta and Salinas Jr 2009).",

She is now a legendary figure among Santa Muerte devotees as she is the person who took what was previously a covert religious folk faith from the shadows into public light when she established a street altar to Santa Muerte in front of her home in Tepito, Mexico City, in 2001. The life-size effigy of Santa Muerte that graced the sidewalk outside her home quickly became a devotional icon for thousands of 'chilangos' (argot for residents of Mexico City).",

Among the multiple advocations of the Christ Child in Mexico, el Ni\u00f1o Doctor stands out for his healing powers (Scheper Hughes 2012). Traditionally, he is bedecked in an oldfashioned white physician's smock, but on Yuri's altar, the Child Doctor features in a modern medic's turquoise outfit replete with scrub cap and a surgical mask covering his mouth (Fig. 3) . He is especially sought out for the healing of ailing Mexican children. In churches across the country, but especially in the Mexican capital, his statues are often graced with offerings of toys, ex-votos for miracles of restored health that he is believed to have granted to the faithful. His novel presence at the Santa Muerte temple in Cancun bespeaks the intense fear over the virulent pandemic currently peaking in Mexico, which as of August 2020 ranks third in Coronavirus deaths after the USA and Brazil.

As such death was not about brusque finality, as it is in much of European and American culture, but about continuity, community and the cycles of the cosmos. Santa Muerte, as we saw earlier in this article, is a syncretic saint who in part takes from pre-Hispanic thanatological epistemologies and as such she is not only petitioned by devotees for protection but as we saw in the case of Vivian, also provides a cultural framework within which to accept death's bony embrace when she inevitably appears with her scythe to reap one's last hour.",

It is thus vital, as we have demonstrated, to trace her pre-Hispanic origins to understand death as a source of life. The duality of the saint's powers hails from an Indigenous ontology that presupposes the interdependence of life and death, and also assumes that death deities may intervene in earthly causes, including prolonging life. Only by decolonizing our knowledge of Santa Muerte's origins and accepting her significant pre-Columbian derivation can we understand the role of the death saint who at once heals the ailing but also snips the thread of life and snatches up souls, while providing a thanatological epistemology for understanding mortality. Santa Muerte is imagined by devotees not only as a reaper of souls but as simultaneously warding off disease and mending broken bodies and in so doing she adds a few more grains of sand to the hourglass of life.
