            "text": "Older adults, a quickly growing segment of the population, are vulnerable to trauma 1 and face unique challenges during and after their care. Older adults are more likely than younger individuals to be hospitalized due to a higher risk of disability and death after injury, and their higher likelihood of comorbid diseases and pre-existing disabilities that prolong the healing and recovery process. Moreover, the normal physiologic changes associated with aging negatively impact how organ systems function during the stress of an acute injury. 1 The vulnerability older adults experience related to acute changes in health status, the stressors of hospitalization, and the challenges faced during the recovery period may lead to a decline in health status after hospitalization. 2 Due to the unique challenges older adults present after experiencing a traumatic injury, their growing population, and the resulting financial and resource burden on the healthcare system, it is imperative we begin to understand the complex postdischarge needs of older adults. 1 Older adults living in rural areas face even more challenges after discharge for traumatic injuries. Some of these factors may include socioeconomic needs magnified by illness and disability, and challenges with accessing rural healthcare and posttrauma or burn follow-up care. Compared with urban areas, rural areas tend to have a higher prevalence of older adults and poorer health, demonstrated by a higher prevalence of obesity, chronic diseases, depression, and decreased social functioning. 3 Rural areas have fewer rehabilitation resources, including physiatrists, rehabilitation therapists, and mental health providers, when compared with urban areas. 4 Although rural adults are at an elevated risk of traumatic injury when compared with adults in urban communities, 5 there is limited research on the barriers that adults from rural areas face after hospitalization for traumatic or burn-related injuries. Most of the existing literature on rural trauma patients is quantitative and focuses on mortality and rehospitalization. We have chosen a qualitative research strategy to better understand",

The KTA framework is a dynamic process that includes knowledge creation and knowledge application with the overarching goal of improving health and healthcare. 7 Furthermore, it allows the user to focus on the needs of the project and tailor interventions to meet agencyspecific needs. 7 We developed the patient interview guide using information synthesized in a literature review as well as questions taken from instruments and survey tools previously validated in the literature on postdischarge transitions. 2 Survey questions were either multiple choice or open-ended and focused primarily on patientreported needs related to housing, discharge, transition to home from the hospital, social support, and basic needs of daily living. Two authors (LN, TP) used an iterative process to develop and vet the questions. We ensured that the questions had an appropriate balance to query about transitional care challenges and living situation after injury. The interview guide was approved by both the UW faculty and agency contacts and the UW Institutional Review Board.",

We then categorized the remaining patients by ruralurban commuting area (RUCA) index and restricted our sample to rural codes (RUCA 7, 8, and 10). From the final cohort of potential participants, we stratified age, sex, and injury mechanism and chose participants at random from each category to ensure a representative group (figure 1). Due to recruitment difficulty (many declined participation and others did not respond), we eventually contacted all eligible patients to obtain a sufficient sample size. We had aimed to enroll 20 patients as a final participant group of older adults who live in rural areas and are recovering from their traumatic injuries. To assess the representativeness of our sample, we obtained injury, patient, and clinical outcome characteristics for both participants and non-participants after merging our health system's data with the state-wide death, trauma, and emergency use registries.",

Four major themes were identified from qualitative analysis: discharge and care transition, loss of control, rural insights, and self-efficacy. Table 2 provides illustrative quotes for each of the four categories and subthemes. Discharge and care transition included the tools and education provided for patients at discharge, the equipment needed for recovery at home, the accessibility of telemedicine, and access to primary care providers, physical therapy (PT), and occupational therapy (OT). Assistance at home included a lift and housekeeping help. Home assistive devices included walkers, canes, shower chairs, or grab bars. Three patients needed restrictive devices on discharge (neck brace, arm sling), and one needed wound care supplies. Only two participants did not need any equipment or supplies after discharge. One key challenge for participants was accessing PT and OT after Open access transitioning home. The majority of participants were recommended to continue PT or OT after discharge either at a skilled nursing facility, inpatient rehabilitation, or as an outpatient. In particular, PT is frequently used for recovery from falls, making it a common and important resource for older adults. However, two patients were unable to attend their recommended PT/OT, one because the patient was unable to pay for the therapy out of pocket or for the gas it would take to get there, and another because the patient was unable to travel the distance required. In terms of access to trauma center resources postdischarge, participants reported that telemedicine services were highly desirable. However, 13 participants reported never being offered a telemedicine appointment, and over half of the participants (10; 56%) reported feeling as though they would be able to successfully use telemedicine if it was offered. The majority of participants felt prepared to care for themselves on discharge. Two participants felt only somewhat prepared, whereas two did not feel that they were prepared at all. Many participants were supported by their families after discharge and the majority felt that they had quite a lot of emotional help and support from their family. Eleven participants lived with a spouse or significant other, and only four lived alone.",

We chose to implement indepth interviews as a research strategy in an effort to better understand the lived experiences of adult trauma patients during and after hospitalization. 6 Although each patient's experience was unique, almost all patients queried had the support and resources they needed for inhome care. Participants consistently highlighted the importance of assistive devices and therapy services in their recovery, as well as the positive impact of community resources such as loaner assistive equipment. The majority of participants reported a strong sense of community living in a rural area, a stable support system, and in general were able to meet their basic needs. However, a common experience for participants was the need for increased support with accessing PT and OT. Barriers to care varied but included expense, distance, and access to local and trauma center resources.",

Telehealth can provide broader resources to communities that would otherwise not have those options and allows providers to more effectively care for their patients. 12 The majority of study participants were not offered telehealth appointments on discharge, but felt that they would be able to navigate telehealth if given the opportunity.",

The participants who agreed to be interviewed may not be representative of the larger eligible cohort. Our methodology likely favored the subset of patients in better social, economic, and physical recovery. With respect to socioeconomic challenges, this cohort of participants faced fewer challenges than expected as they all had a current source of income and form of transportation, no one had to move their home location after discharge, and no participant had to choose between paying for medication or other needs. As an example, more participants had secondary insurance when compared with non-participants. This indicates that participants were more financially secure on average, as they were able to prepare for the potential of injury with insurance. More non-participants had an emergency department visit within 1 year of discharge, which may be related to access to PT, follow-up care, or stable housing. Our participants came from a single level 1 trauma center, so their challenges may not accurately represent or fully encapsulate the challenges faced by others in rural communities.",

Discharge experience varied, but nearly all participants reported some difficulty when transitioning back into their rural communities. There is room for improvement in the discharge and care planning process for older adult patients from rural communities, who face a unique set of challenges. Trauma centers should increase their awareness of community resources in specific rural areas they serve. Actionable recommendations on discharge include the following: set up the option to be seen via telemedicine and ensure patients have the knowledge to use this option, arrange specific follow-up appointments with each patient's primary care provider, and set up referrals to local PT/OT programs. By incorporating these recommendations, trauma centers may be able to facilitate patients' access to the proper resources to successfully transition home and increase the likelihood of returning to baseline functional status.",
