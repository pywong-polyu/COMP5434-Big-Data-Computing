In 621 patients with diagnosed prediabetes, glucose, lipid, and anthropometric parameters were measured. Furthermore, the interaction of 25-OH-vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) with metabolic and glucose metabolism parameters was analysed in the total prediabetic population, as well as after stratification by sex (female vs. male prediabetic subgroup), by logistic regression. Results. 25-OH-vitamin D was negatively related to cholesterol, BMI, fatty liver index, insulin, and HOMA-IR. Especially in the male prediabetic cohort, 25-OH-vitamin D levels negatively correlated with total cholesterol levels (r \ufffd \u22120.17, p \ufffd 0.001), with triglycerides (r \ufffd \u22120.17, p \ufffd 0.001), and with HbA1c levels (r \ufffd \u22120.14, p \ufffd 0.010). Only in the female cohort with prediabetes, we found a negative correlation of 25-OH-vitamin D levels with systolic (r \ufffd \u22120.18, p \ufffd 0.005) and diastolic blood pressures (r \ufffd \u22120.23, p < 0.001). Conclusion. In this study, in females with prediabetes, 25-OH-vitamin D was notably related to a more favourable metabolic profile, including lower total cholesterol and higher HDL cholesterol levels. On the contrary, in men with prediabetes, there was a stronger association between 25-OH-vitamin D and cholesterol-HDL quotient, as well as fatty liver index was observed in the male prediabetic subgroup. erefore, sex differences should be considered in future studies on vitamin D and glucose tolerance status.",

In the female compared to the male cohort, a higher mean concentration of 25-OH-vitamin D ( In addition, the male and female cohorts were analysed in respect of 25-OH-vitamin D levels. 25-OH-vitamin D had a negative effect on cholesterol (r \ufffd \u22120,18, p < 0.001), especially in women. 25-OH-vitamin D had a negative effect on cholesterol-HDL quotient (r \ufffd \u22120.3, p < 0.001) and fatty liver index (r \ufffd \u22120.27, p < 0.001), particularly in men. Table 3 reports the correlation of 25-OH-vitamin D with the metabolic parameters by logistic regression models. In the general cohort, a negative correlation was evidenced between the 25-OH-vitamin D level and triglycerides (r \ufffd \u22120.14, p < 0.001), HDL cholesterol (r \ufffd 0.23, p < 0.001), LDL cholesterol (r \ufffd \u22120.17, p < 0.001), cholesterol-HDL quotient (r \ufffd \u22120.26, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (r \ufffd \u22120.11, p \ufffd 0.009), BMI (r \ufffd \u22120.18, p < 0.001), abdominal circumference (r \ufffd \u22120.18, p < 0.001), fatty liver index (r \ufffd \u22120.19, p < 0.001), insulin levels (r \ufffd \u22120.19, p < 0.001), and HOMA-IR (r \ufffd \u22120.19, p \ufffd 0.001).",

Furthermore, we observed sex differences regarding the relationship of 25-OH-vitamin D with total cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c levels, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Bearing in mind that our study population consists of subjects with prediabetes, the effect of 25-OH-vitamin D on glucose metabolism is of importance, expanding the knowledge on possible vitamin D effects to a group at a high risk of progression to diabetes. More specifically, we could show that higher levels of 25-OH-vitamin D were related to a lower HOMA-IR and lower levels of insulin and HbA1c in the whole study population. Further analysing sex-specific differences, we could observe higher HbA1c values in the female population and a negative relationship of 25-OHvitamin D with HbA1c values in the female prediabetes cohort. Previous studies support our findings [17] [18] [19] . ese studies investigated the general population or patients with overt diabetes mellitus. e aforementioned studies claimed that vitamin D may decrease insulin resistance, fasting glucose, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR [17] [18] [19] . However, in the general population, no effect of vitamin D on HbA1c levels could be found [19] . Vitamin D's effect on insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR can be explained by the ability of 25-OH-vitamin D to bind on pancreatic \u03b2-cells and therefore alter their function in a positive way [2] . A prior study showed that daily vitamin D supplementation in participants with prediabetes could reduce their risk of developing overt diabetes [14] . A new finding of our study is that we studied sex differences in the association of 25-OH-vitamin D status and metabolic parameters in a cohort with prediabetes.",

Vitamin D in combination with probiotics increased HDL cholesterol levels in patients with diabetes mellitus [17] . Other studies reported that vitamin D alone may increase HDL cholesterol levels in hypertensive patients [20] . In our study, we found similar results in a population with prediabetes, especially in women. Concerning total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, previous studies had divergent results. An earlier study reported higher levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol related to higher vitamin D levels in a population diagnosed with arterial hypertension [20] . On the contrary, lower levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were described following vitamin D supplementation in an older Lebanese population [19] . In our study, 25-OH-vitamin D was negatively related to total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels in a population with prediabetes. Particularly in the female population, we could see a decrease in total cholesterol with higher 25-OH-vitamin D. Vitamin D might be able to alter the gene expression of apolipoproteins [21] and thus affect cholesterol levels. Previous studies investigated that higher cholesterol levels are associated with higher fat mass. Notably in women, we confirmed such an association potentially because women generally have a higher percentage of subcutaneous fat [22] . Further previous studies investigated a positive correlation of fat mass on LDL and HDL cholesterol levels [23, 24] . Moreover, former studies provided knowledge that vitamin D can inversely affect obesity and BMI [18] . In our study, lower BMI values were also related to higher 25-OH-vitamin D levels. e reason why vitamin D is lower in individuals with higher BMI levels could be that it is stored in the excess fat mass of obese subjects [25] . Another hypothesis is that individuals with higher BMI values might have a higher distribution volume and therefore require greater dietary intake of vitamin D as compared to lean individuals [26] . Previously, it could be observed that vitamin D intake lowers the risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [27] . In addition, men have a higher risk of fatty liver disease as oestrogen might exert protective effects [28] . erefore, it is not surprising that we observed a negative association of 25-OH-vitamin D on the fatty liver index, particularly in men.",

Strength of the present study is the rather large number of subjects with documented prediabetes and that, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first study investigating the association of vitamin D with a variety of metabolic parameters and glucose metabolism in this specific population, including analysis of potential sex differences. Various studies investigated vitamin D levels and their impact on patients with diabetes mellitus. A previous study could show that vitamin D supplementation in a population with prediabetes does not lead to a lower risk of diabetes mellitus [14] . Still, the findings of our study could lead to greater awareness of sex differences in the association of 25-OH-vitamin D levels with metabolic parameters in a cohort of patients with prediabetes. e results may emphasize the importance of vitamin D measurements and possibly supplementation in case of deficiency in prediabetic patients. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, patients with impaired glucose metabolism are even a more important International Journal of Endocrinology target group of research as patients with diabetes mellitus not only have a higher incidence of COVID-19 but also a higher mortality rate, especially males [29] . Furthermore, studies suggested that vitamin D supplementation might be able to reduce risk for COVID-19 and progression to severe disease and mortality [30] . erefore, the present study may contribute to further understand the impact of vitamin D on metabolism in this vulnerable population.
