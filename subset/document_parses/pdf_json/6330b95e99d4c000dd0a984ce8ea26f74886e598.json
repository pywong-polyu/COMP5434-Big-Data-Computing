Methods: This study was a randomized and single-blinded clinical trial in which 60 subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention group (n=30) received vitamins, and the control group did not receive any vitamin or placebo. The intervention was included 25,000 IU daily of vitamins A, 600,000 IU once during the study of D, 300 IU twice daily of E, 500 mg four times daily of C, and one amp daily of B complex for 7 days. At baseline and after the 7-day intervention, the serum levels of inflammatory markers, vitamins, and the SOFA score were assessed. In addition, the mortality rate and duration of hospitalization were evaluated after the intervention (IRCT registration number: IRCT20200319046819N1/registration date: 2020-04-04, https://www.irct.ir/trial/46838).",

The effect of vitamins on the mortality rate was not statistically significant (p=0.112). The prolonged hospitalization rate to more than 7 days was significantly lower in the intervention group than the control group (p=0.001). Regarding the effect size, there was a significant and inverse association between receiving the intervention and prolonged hospitalization (OR = 0.135, 95% CI 0.038-0.481; p=0.002); however, after adjusting for confounders, it was not significant (OR=0.402, 95% CI 0.086-1.883; p=0.247).",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a newly discovered and highly contagious infectious disease with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure requiring ICU admission [1] . According to available data, about one-fifth of severe cases need to be hospitalized in ICU due to the high possibility of progression to severe complications and death [2, 3] . Therefore, several recent studies have focused on identifying mechanisms and probable therapeutic targets for reducing complications and mortality rates of ICU-admitted patients with COVID- 19 . It has been shown that, besides the viral load, impaired immune response and subsequent exacerbate inflammatory response to infection are also responsible for increased risk of severe symptoms and mortality in patients with COVID-19 [3] [4] [5] [6] . Dietary intake of micronutrients or supplementation with them has well-established beneficial effects on the regulation and integrity of the immune system via the epigenetic modulation of physiological pathways controlling the immune system and the inflammatory process [7, 8] . Current evidence has elucidated that not only, deficiency of vitamins could intensify the COVID-19 disease, but also simultaneous administration of vitamins could synergistically improve the function of the innate and adaptive immune [9, 10] . However, numerous studies have shown the crucial role of vitamin supplementation in modulating the immune system function and improvement of survival in different infectious diseases, some studies have found contradictory results [7, 11, 12] .",
