Based on health behavior theories, this study considered risk perception and risk response as mediators of the relationship between OB and individuals' preventive health behaviors and intentions. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional survey design. Online survey platforms were used to recruit U.S. adults. A total of 293 valid responses were included in the analyses. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship of OB to the respondents' health information seeking intention and related behavioral outcomes. Results: Results from the first regression model showed that OB was negatively related to risk perception. In other words, optimistically biased respondents perceived their risk of COVID-19 to be low. The second model demonstrated that perceived risk was related positively to affective responses to risk (e.g., worry and fear). That is, the lower their perceived risk of COVID-19, the less likely respondents were to feel anxiety and fear about this disease. Models 3 and 4 revealed positive relationships between risk response and respondents' intentions and behaviors. Finally, the results supported a fully mediated pathway: OB \u2192 risk perception \u2192 risk response \u2192 information seeking intention and behavioral outcomes. Conclusions: The study findings suggest that by decreasing their perceived risk and subsequent responses, optimistic bias can undermine individuals' motivation to take precautions. To reduce this bias, the actual risk of COVID-19 should be reinforced.",

            "text": "Since emerging as a novel strain in December 2019, the coronavirus (COVID-19) has posed significant challenges to global public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared the COVID-19 pandemic as the disease spread very rapidly, affecting vast numbers of people worldwide. As of June 1, 2020, the WHO reported 6,140,934 confirmed cases and 373,548 confirmed deaths related to COVID-19. 1 In the U.S., 1,787,680 cases and 104,396 deaths were confirmed. 2 Given the unprecedented incidence and mortality resulting from its high transmissibility, it is imperative for citizens to take proper preventive measures to delay and limit the spread of this disease. In the U.S. and other countries, societal measures (e.g., stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and the closure of non-essential businesses and schools) have been implemented. 3 At the individual level, it's crucial to take preventive actions as protective measures. According to several health behavior theories, such as the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), perceived risk is a key element in an individuals' engagement in preventive behavior. Perceived risk often comprises perceived susceptibility (a person's perception of the risk of contracting a disease) and perceived severity (one's perception of the severity of the disease). 4, 5 Both HBM and TPB suggest that individuals are likely to behave in ways that mitigate the threat of a disease when they perceive they are personally susceptible to a disease and that consequences of contracting it would be severe. In the context of COVID-19, individuals are more likely to engage in preventive behaviors if they perceive they are at risk (susceptibility and severity) from the coronavirus. Other behavior models, such as the Planned Risk Information Seeking Model (PRISM) and the Theory of Motivated Information Management (TMIM), provide additional insight. The PRISM and the TMIM propose that an individual's perceived risk is mediated by the individual's affective risk responses (e.g., anxiety and fear). In other words, when people consider risk of a disease to be serious and susceptible to its impact, they experience worry and fear associated with the risk. Such emotional responses may trigger people to seek information to cope with the risk. In the context of COVID-19, when individuals feel anxiety and fear associated with the virus after perceiving the risk of this virus, they may seek information to limit their risk of contracting the disease.",

            "text": "Of note, an individual's assessment of risk is often distorted. That is, people estimate their own risk for disease to be lower than similar others' risk, a phenomenon known as optimistic bias (OB). Studies have shown that OB is pervasive in populations across diverse conditions. For example, optimistically biased individuals felt that, compared with others, they were at lower risk of developing conditions including cancer, 6,7 coronary heart disease, 8, 9 depression, 10 Alzheimer's disease, 11 and HIV. 12 If OB affects a person's perception of risk, OB can potentially influence the person's engagement in risk behavior given that perceived risk is a key determinant of such engagement, as posited by the HBM and the TPB. In other words, because OB leads people to underestimate their risk, they perceive their susceptibility to risk to be low; thus, they are less likely to engage in preventive health behavior. Research has demonstrated that OB indeed has resulted in discounting recommended preventive behaviors. 13, 14 Although OB has been well documented for a variety of conditions, it remains unknown in the context of a pandemic crisis, such as COVID-19. As such, this study aimed to explore the role of OB in predicting engagement in communicative behavioral outcomes associated with COVID-19 risk and prevention, as well as information seeking intentions (Fig. 1) . Guided by health behavior theories, this study considered risk perception and risk response as mediators of the relationship between OB and engagement in COVID-19 preventive behavior/intentions. Accordingly, the specific objectives of the study were to examine whether (1) OB was significantly related to risk perception; (2) risk perception significantly predicted affective risk response; (3) affective risk response was significantly related to intention to seek information about COVID-19 and engaged in important communicative behavioral outcomes; and (4) risk perception and affective risk response sequentially mediated the relationship between OB and information seeking intention and related behavioral outcomes.",

Respondents perceived themselves (mean \u00bc 5.06 \ufffd 2.61), compared with others their age and sex (mean \u00bc 5.57 \ufffd 2.32), to be less likely to become infected with COVID-19. The mean difference between the \"self\" dimension and the \"others\" dimension was statistically significant (t(292) \u00bc \u00c0 4.43, p < 0.001), which indicated the presence of optimistic bias. Overall, respondents (somewhat) agreed that they were susceptible Scales were internally consistent with Cronbach's alpha scores ranging from 0.7 (\"behavioral outcomes\") to 0.9 (\"fear\"). Table 3 reveals the results from multivariate linear regression analyses after controlling for numerous covariates. Results from Model 1 showed that OB was negatively related to risk perception after adjusting for covariates (\u03b2 \u00bc -0.0858, SE \u00bc 0.0274, 95% CI [-0.1397, \u00c0 0.0318]). That is, optimistically biased respondents perceived that they were less likely to get infected with COVID-19. They also believed the coronavirus to be less serious. In Model 2, perceived risk positively predicted perceived emotional response after controlling for covariates (\u03b2 \u00bc 0.5778, SE \u00bc 0.0488, 95% CI [0.4819, 0.6738]). The higher their perceived risk of COVID-19, the more likely respondents were to feel anxiety and fear. In Model 3, the dependent variable was the respondents' past communicative behavior. This model demonstrated a positive relationship between risk response and their communicative behavior after adjusting for covariates (\u03b2 \u00bc 0.3785, SE \u00bc 0.0619, 95% CI [0.2565, 0.5004]). If the respondents felt more anxiety and fear about COVID-19, they were more likely to discuss the risk and prevention of this disease with others. Additionally, this model supported a fully mediated pathway (i.e., OB \u2192 risk perception \u2192 affective risk response \u2192 communicative behavioral outcomes) (\u03b2 \u00bc \u00c0 0.0188, SE \u00bc 0.0071, 95% CI [-0.0345, \u00c0 0.0063]). Optimistically biased respondents underestimated the risk of COVID-19; thus, they felt less anxiety and fear about this disease. Consequently, they talked less about the risk and prevention of the disease with others. Model 4 with information seeking intentions as the dependent variable showed similar findings. The more the respondents felt anxiety and fear about COVID-19, the more likely they were to seek information about the risk and prevention of this disease (\u03b2 \u00bc 0.3683, SE \u00bc 0.0687, 95% CI [0.2331, 0.5035]). A fully mediated pathway (i.e., OB \u2192 risk perception \u2192 affective risk response \u2192 information seeking intentions) was also supported (\u03b2 \u00bc \u00c0 0.0183, SE \u00bc 0.0072, 95% CI [-0.0340, \u00c0 0.0062]). Because optimistically biased respondents perceived themselves less likely to get infected with COVID-19, they were less anxious and fearful about this disease. As a result, they were less likely to seek information about COVID-19 risk and prevention.",

To minimize such effects, the world has strived to slow the spread of the disease. Many of the endeavors require extensive cooperation; thus, it's important for individuals to recognize the COVID-19 risk accurately given that risk perception is an essential determinant of their engagement in preventive behavior. Notably, optimistic bias has been known to affect individuals' perceived risk. As such, this study examined whether OB was related to individuals' risk perception of COVID-19, thereby affecting their risk response and the resultant engagement in communicative behaviors associated with COVID-19 risk and prevention, as well as intention to seek information about COVID-19 risk and prevention. Study results showed a negative relationship between OB and respondents' risk perception of COVID-19. That is, optimistically biased individuals underestimated both their perceived susceptibility and severity of the coronavirus. The presence of OB in risk perceptions has been reported for a wide range of conditions such as cancer, 6,7 coronary heart disease, 8, 9 depression, 10 Alzheimer's disease, 11 and HIV. 12 This study verified that COVID-19 is one of the health risks subject to unrealistic optimism. Moreover, the study results revealed that OB ultimately resulted in less engagement in the respondents' communicative behavior and information seeking intentions regarding COVID-19 prevention. In other words, individuals might not be engaged in COVID-19 preventive behavior or information seeking because they were unrealistically optimistic about the risk of this disease. When individuals' perceived others to be of higher risk for COVID-19 than themselves, they are not motivated to talk with others about risk and prevention. These results are commensurate with findings in other contexts. 14, 26, 27 For example, Kim and Niederdeppe found that, compared to non-optimists, unrealistic optimists perceived themselves less likely to become infected with H1N1 influenza, and thus to be less likely to perform flu preventive behaviors. 14 Another study examined college students' perceived risk of becoming pregnant or contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD). 26 This study found that optimistically biased students, compared to those who viewed their risk accurately, were less interested in risk information and less likely to alter their risk perceptions. In Dillard et al.'s study, optimistically biased smokers were less likely to identify smoking cessation as a way to reduce cancer compared to unbiased smokers. 27 As such, those biased smokers were less interested in quitting smoking, causing them to maintain their smoking behavior. All of these findings indicate that underestimation of risk can lead to discourage engagement in preventive behavior.",

            "text": "In addition, the current study suggested that perceived risk significantly provokes affective risk response (e.g., anxiety and fear), which then encourages preventive health behaviors. In this study, individuals who appraised their risk for COVID-19 as lower felt less anxiety and fear about this disease; thus, they were less likely to be engaged in discussing and seeking information about COVID-19 prevention. This finding was somewhat expected given the health behavior theory on which this study was based. The HBM considers perceived risk as a precursor to preventive behavior. 4, 28 This model postulates that individuals are likely to take precaution when they perceive that they are susceptible to a disease or when they regard it to be a serious problem. Numerous studies have supported these theories by demonstrating the connection between individuals' perceived risk and their preventive behaviors such as vaccination, diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and contraception. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Results of the present study also demonstrated that perceived risk as a key determinant of engagement in communicative behavior for the prevention of COVID-19. Moreover, the health and risk information seeking models such as the PRISM and the TMIM focus on risk perception and risk response as antecedents to information seeking intentions. According to these models, if individuals perceive risk, affective responses to risk (e.g., worry and fear) arise. Then, such emotional responses motivate individuals to seek information that helps mitigate risk. That is, information seeking intent is a function of these key components (i.e., risk perception and risk response). Researchers have reported these components as strong drivers of information seeking intentions in handling the risks of cancer and H1N1 influenza virus. 24, 35, 36 The present study also observed these components as motivators of information seeking intentions in the context of COVID-19.",

To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first research examining optimistic bias in its sequential relations to the perceived risk of COVID-19, the subsequent risk response, and subsequent engagement in communication and information seeking. The study findings highlight that evaluating optimistic bias is critical in understanding why people at risk for contracting a disease do not engage in preventive behaviors to reduce risk. In this study, the importance of reducing unrealistic optimism was emphasized for promoting COVID-19 preventive behaviors. In addition, this study uniquely considered risk perception and affective risk response as mediators of the relationship between OB and information seeking and related behavioral outcomes. Identifying these variables and mapping relationships between them were based on several behavior theories. These theories have been successfully applied to explain an extensive range of preventive behaviors. Therefore, this theory-driven research could provide logical rigor and robustness in understanding the relationship between OB and personal engagement in COVID-19 preventive behavior/intentions.",

Thus, the degree of optimistic bias observed in this study might not be representative of the general population. This could limit the generalizability of the study results. In addition, because this study used self-reported survey data, it may have inherent limitations such as social desirability bias. For example, social desirability bias could exist if the respondents overreported their communicative behavior and information seeking intentions. Finally, there may exist other extrinsic barriers (e.g., shortage of hand sanitizer, cleaning wipes, or facemasks) that hinder taking preventive actions. Because of these barriers, those who intended to take preventive actions may not have done so, or only in a limited manner. Since this study focused on a person's individual factors, extrinsic barriers will be explored in future research.",

            "text": "Study findings have implications for public health. In light of the inverse relationship between OB and engagement in COVID-19 seeking intention and communicative behaviors, it is important to modify people's misconceptions about the risk of this disease. Although systematic evidence of risky behaviors during COVID- 19 is not yet available, reports of \"coronavirus parties\" and large crowds gathering during holiday weekends suggest that citizens are behaving in ways that will increase spread of the disease. 37, 38 To alter such risky behaviors, accurate, evidence-based information on the actual risk should be made readily available in a timely manner. For example, trustworthy organizations (e. g., WHO and CDC) can reinforce the real risk for these people with the most up-to-date evidence. At the community level, clinicians can play a direct role in informing of the actual risk of COVID-19. They can also suggest COVID-19 mitigating or prevention behaviors. Public health officials also can recruit advocates seen as credibly by people who discount messages from state and local leaders, such as the revelers in media reports. The smaller the gap between the perceived risk and the real risk of COVID-19, the less likely people are to be optimistically biased, thereby increasing their engagement in preventive behavior/intentions. Such engagement, along with structural aids to reduce barriers (e.g., making sanitary products readily available and affordable), can move people toward behaviors that will limit the spread of COVID-19.",
