            "text": "Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is a major issue for pig producers worldwide, because of economic impacts in swine herds and public health concerns due to the excretion of zoonotic pathogens and antibiotics treatments. PRDC is a multifactorial disease due to simultaneous or sequential viral and/or bacterial infections which could induce severe respiratory troubles leading to poor animal growth in the case of additive or synergic outcomes [1] . The PRDC manifestation could depend on environmental factors, breeding practices, farm management and host-dependent factors such as age, genetics or immune status. However, PRDC severity could also closely depend on the interactions between pathogens themselves. Previous studies showed that respiratory viral infections can promote an ideal environment for bacterial super-infections through the destruction of the epithelial barrier, the over-expression of receptors involved in bacterial adhesion to the cells and the alteration of host immune system [1, 2] . Conversely, a pre-existing chronic pulmonary bacterial infection, such as Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp) infection, could potentiate the outcome of a subsequent viral infection by inducing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of immune cells [2, 3] . Unfortunately, only few studies have explored the virus/virus interactions that may occur in pig respiratory tract. Among the viruses involved in PRDC, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza A virus (swIAV) are among the most important primary agents [1] . These viruses are both highly prevalent and enzootic in pig populations from several European countries [4, 5] . PRRSV is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome that belongs to the genus Betaarterivirus of the Arteriviridae family. There are two PRRSV species, Betaarterivirus suid 1 (PRRSV-1) and Betaarterivirus suid 2 (PRRSV-2), mostly widespread in Europe and North America/Asia, respectively [6, 7] . This virus primarily infects alveolar macrophages [8] , is responsible for long-lasting infections [9, 10] , and is considered a causative agent of reproductive troubles, respiratory disorders and growth retardation [11] . Most PRRSV strains interfere with innate antiviral immune responses by blocking interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) signaling and promoting the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) [12] . swIAV is an enveloped virus with a negative-sense, single-stranded and segmented RNA genome that belongs to the genus Influenzavirus A of the Orthomyxoviridae family [13] . There are three swIAV subtypes, i.e., H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2, which circulate simultaneously in areas of high pig density, with multiple region-specific genetic lineages within each subtype [14, 15] . swIAV target cells are epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tracts [13] . swIAV infection is responsible for acute respiratory disease, characterized by fever, cough, sneezing, apathy and dyspnea, associated with growth retardation [16] . Unlike PRRSV, swIAV is known to be a high inducer of type-I IFN and inflammatory responses [17] . In production areas where PRRSV and swIAV are widespread, there is a high risk that pig farms are infected by both viruses at the same time [18, 19] . However, very few studies have analyzed the impact of a PRRSV/swIAV super-infection in pigs. They have mainly focused on clinical and virological parameters, but with inconsistent results; some studies have reported exacerbations of lung lesions [20] [21] [22] , whereas others showed no difference in clinical signs as compared to single-infected animals [21, 23, 24] . Furthermore, the host immune responses have been studied only to a very limited extent at the systemic or pulmonary levels. Considering the lacks and apparent contradictions of these previous studies, new investigations were necessary to better characterize the effect one virus infection may have on the other, as well as the impact of dual PRRSV/swIAV infection on the host immune responses.",

In this context, we aimed, in an experimental study, (i) to investigate the clinical and immuno-virological impact of a PRRSV-1 infection on a subsequent H1 hu N2 swIAV infection, and (ii) to explore the effect of H1 hu N2 swIAV infection on the course of ongoing PRRSV-1 infection. Knowing that the impact of PRRSV-1 single-infection in lungs of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs is a maximum of one week post-inoculation, with both the highest PRRSV-1 genomic load and the lowest alveolar macrophage count [10] , we delayed swIAV inoculation by eight days after that of PRRSV-1. Thus, pigs were inoculated either with PRRSV at study day (SD) 0, or with swIAV at SD8, or with PRRSV and swIAV at SD0 and SD8, respectively, or mock-inoculated. Monitoring of clinical outcomes and viral multiplications, as well as studies of innate and adaptive immune responses specific to each virus at both the systemic and pulmonary levels, were implemented for four weeks post-inoculation with PRRSV.",

The day after swIAV inoculation (SD9), all (6/6) animals in the swIAV group exhibited hyperthermia, but only 4/6 did in the PRRSV/swIAV group, resulting in a significant difference in mean rectal temperatures between both groups (40.9 \u00b1 0.2 \u2022 C and 39.8 \u00b1 1.0 \u2022 C, respectively, p = 0.0025). At SD13, the PRRSV/swIAV group further displayed a slight increase in mean rectal temperature, significantly higher than in the Control group (p = 0.0008), but under the hyperthermia threshold. No or only minor respiratory troubles were observed in the PRRSV group in the time course of the experiment (Figure 1b) . Cough and sneezing were recorded in the swIAV group during the first week after swIAV inoculation, at SD9-11 and SD13-14. Moreover, 6/6 pigs exhibited rapid breathing at SD9 and 2/6 pigs at SD14. In comparison, cough and sneezing were not detected in the PRRSV/swIAV group, and only 1/6 and 2/6 pigs exhibited rapid breathing at SD9 and SD14, respectively. There was no difference observed between the groups in terms of growth performance, based on weighing and food consumption measurements once a week. At necropsy, three weeks after swIAV inoculation, no macroscopic lung lesions were observed in any group. Altogether, these results indicated that PRRSV pre-infection did not exacerbate, and even led to an attenuation of the influenza syndrome as usually observed after intratracheal swIAV inoculation in SPF pigs.",

            "text": "The first objective was to investigate the clinical and immuno-virological outcomes of a PRRSV-1 infection on a subsequent swIAV (H1N2) infection. In a previous study, where we inoculated H1N2 swIAV intratracheally to 9-week-old SPF pigs, reductions in food consumption and weight gain were evidenced during the first four days post-inoculation, before recovering [28] . In the present study, individual weighing was not performed daily; thus, we did not observe such an early impact of the swIAV infection. Nevertheless, what can be noticed is that any difference in growth performance was observed between the infected groups in the second and third weeks post-inoculation with swIAV. This suggests that even if swIAV infection had impacted food consumption and weight gain in the first days, PRRSV pre-infection had not exacerbated this swIAV infection outcome, and/or the PRRSV/swIAV group recovered at least as quickly as the swIAV group. In any case, hyperthermia and respiratory signs were observed in the swIAV group, as expected. In contrast, fewer clinical signs were observed in the super-infected group, suggesting an attenuation of H1N2 swIAV infection outcomes in the PRRSV-1 pre-infected pigs. Knowing that pig lungs are largely destabilized by PRRSV infection eight days post-inoculation [10] , one might have expected an exacerbation of swIAV clinical signs in the PRRSV/swIAV group, rather than an attenuation. In addition, our results were consistent with most of the few experimental studies that previously investigated PRRSV-1/swIAV co-infection, because most of them did not evidence an exacerbation of the influenza disease [21, 23, 24] . Indeed, whereas a first study of Van Reeth et al. suggested an enhancement of clinical disease in some conventional pigs inoculated with PRRSV-1 and H1N1 swIAV three days apart [20] , large variations in the clinical responses were observed between individual pigs, which was confirmed in further experiments where inoculations were performed either three or seven days apart [21] . However, in colostrum-deprived caesarian-derived (CDCD) piglets inoculated in seven-day intervals, the differences with the single virus infections were negligible [21] . The same observation, i.e., no significant impact of PRRSV infection on subsequent swIAV infection, was reported when SPF piglets were inoculated with PRRSV-1 and H3N2 swIAV one week apart [23] , or when conventional pigs were simultaneously inoculated with PRRSV-1 and H1N1 swIAV [24] . Interestingly, the dual infection was largely subclinical in conventional pigs inoculated with PRRSV-1 and H1N1 swIAV with a 14-day interval [21] , in line with the attenuation of swIAV clinical signs we observed here in SPF pigs inoculated with PRRSV-1 and H1N2 swIAV eight days apart. Altogether, whereas the diversity of the experimental protocols could make it difficult to compare them, it seems that both the sanitary status of pigs (conventional, SPF or CDCD) as well as the time interval between inoculations (0, 3, 7, 8 or 14 days) can affect the clinical outcome of PRRSV-1/swIAV super-infection, whereas impact of the age of the animals (3 to 12 week old), the inoculation routes (nebulization, nasal, tracheal) or the swIAV subtype (H1N1, H3N2, H1N2) cannot be excluded at this stage. Although the inoculation route does not influence the outcomes of a single PRRSV infection [35] , it is known that the severity of influenza disease is dependent upon swIAV delivery, as observed in our lab (unpublished results) and reported by others [36] . Tracheal inoculation is a technique which enables the reproduction of clinical outcomes observed in the field, the induction of marked clinical signs, as well as pulmonary inflammation, the observation of their attenuation in pigs pre-infected with PRRSV-1 is all the more relevant. Further comparative experimental assays using nebulization or shedder pigs as a more natural inoculation route for swIAV could be considered to confirm the results we obtained here.",

Indeed, we observed a peak of haptoglobin in the swIAV group at 4 days post-swIAV infection as previously shown [28, 38] , but not in the PRRSV/swIAV group. Consistently, an influx of granulocytes was observed in the lungs of pigs from swIAV group as expected [28] , whereas it was more limited in super-infected group. Interestingly, PCAs also indicated that the attenuation of clinical outcomes was not related to swIAV multiplication, because similar swIAV genomic loads were measured in the lungs of swIAV and PRRSV/swIAV groups. The absence of effect of PRRSV pre-infection on swIAV multiplication in lungs may result from differences in cellular targeting between the two viruses. In support of this hypothesis, it can be noted that in a co-infection study using two viruses replicating both in the lower respiratory epithelium, namely, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and swIAV, PRCV infection strongly decreased swIAV replication [39] . In contrast, another study on PRRSV/PRCV co-infection showed no effect of PRRSV on PRCV replication and shedding [20] .",

Type-I IFN promotes both innate anti-viral defenses and adaptive immunity, while also bearing a deleterious role by inducing inflammatory responses which can lead to clinical manifestations [42] . Thus, the links that were evidenced here between inflammatory and IFN responses are in accordance with results previously reported by others in the context of swIAV single infections [28, 43, 44] . Nevertheless, the IFN-\u03b1 level was significantly reduced in super-infected pigs, as compared to swIAV-infected pigs, suggesting that PRRSV preinfection interfered with IFN-\u03b1 induction. This result is consistent with an in vitro study showing that macrophages infected with PRRSV and then with a swine alphacoronavirus, which is a good IFN-\u03b1 inducer as swIAV, failed to produce the antiviral cytokine [45] . Interestingly, another in vitro investigation indicated that PRRSV could interfere with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in newborn porcine tracheal (NPTr) epithelial cells, even without entering these cells, leading to a sub-expression of IFN-stimulated genes after infection with swIAV [46] . Similar levels of antibodies directed against H1N2 swIAV were measured in sera from swIAV and PRRSV/swIAV groups, as reported by others when comparing humoral responses at the systemic level in H1N1-infected and PRRSV/H1N1 co-infected pigs [24] . Conversely, we detected higher levels of anti-swIAV antibodies in BALF from the PRRSV/swIAV group, as compared to the swIAV group, at SD21. PRRSV infection induces polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia [47] ; therefore, this phenomenon may have played a role in the high production of anti-swIAV antibodies in BALF from the super-infected group. However, no correlation between the levels of anti-swIAV antibodies in BALF and swIAV multiplication was observed, suggesting that this huge humoral response had no impact on swIAV clearance. In parallel, a slight induction of IL-10 was measured in the lungs of more pigs from the PRRSV/swIAV group, than from the single-infected group, as already observed by others after PRRSV/swIAV co-infection [48] . However, due to the low sensitivity of IL-10 detection in BALF by ELISA, additional comparative analyses of IL-10 using other methods such as gene expression quantification in BALCs of infected groups [10] should be considered to confirm its higher induction in the lungs of super-infected pigs.",

            "text": "The second objective of this study was to investigate the effect of swIAV infection on the course of an ongoing PRRSV infection. Interestingly, a transient but strong decrease in PRRSV genomic load was observed in the lungs of PRRSV/swIAV superinfected pigs, as compared to PRRSV single-infected pigs, in the few days after swIAV inoculation, consistent with other studies regarding PRRSV/swIAV coinfection in pigs [49] . Host target cells for PRRSV are alveolar macrophages [8] , whereas swIAV mainly infects epithelial cells of upper and lower respiratory tracts [13] ; therefore, this viral interference should depend on indirect mechanisms. Knowing that PRRSV is very sensitive to IFN-\u03b1 [45] , and as supported by correlation analyses, the impact that swIAV infection had on PRRSV multiplication was probably linked to the induction of IFN-\u03b1 in the lungs of PRRSV/swIAV co-infected pigs. As mentioned above, IFN-\u03b1 levels were strongly reduced as compared to those measured in swIAV-infected pigs, but still higher than usually measured after PRRSV infection. These results are completely in line with a previous study showing that the induction of IFN-\u03b1 through a non-replicating adenovirus (Ad5-IFN-\u03b1) inhibited the replication of a PRRSV-2 strain in pigs inoculated one-day later [50] . In the same way, we showed, in a recent study, that a concomitant swIAV infection can temporarily inhibit the replication of a PRRSV-1-modified live vaccine, probably through IFN-\u03b1 induction [51] . In contrast, the fact that the IFN-\u03b1 concentration was low in blood could explain why the PRRSV genomic load was not affected at the systemic level. Nevertheless, in addition to IFN-\u03b1, the role of other cytokines in decreasing PRRSV multiplication in lungs, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), cannot be excluded. Even though we were not able to detect any TNF-\u03b1 in the lungs after H1N2 inoculation in a previous study [28] , others have reported that swIAV infection could lead to an increase in TNF-\u03b1 concentration in the lungs [48] . If this happened, TNF-\u03b1 could have played a role because it was shown to have an antiviral effect on PRRSV [52, 53] .",

However, we observed that the number of PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3-SCs increased faster in the blood of pigs from the PRRSV/swIAV group as compared to the PRRSV group. A correlation was found between the IFN-\u03b1 level and the PRRSV-specific CMI response; therefore, it could be hypothesized that IFN-\u03b1 induction linked to swIAV infection might have stimulated the cellular response against PRRSV. This is supported by another study that also showed a significant increase in the number of PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3-SCs in pigs injected with an Ad5-pIFN-\u03b1 at the time of PRRSV inoculation, as compared to single-infected pigs [54] . Beyond innate anti-viral defenses, IFN-\u03b1 can also activate the CMI response by stimulating the dendritic cells that trigger antigen-specific T cell proliferation [55] .",

On the one hand, reductions in IFN-\u03b1 levels in superinfected pigs, as compared to swIAV-infected pigs, would have contributed to the attenuation of influenza-like illness through the impairment of inflammatory response. On the other hand, increases in IFN-\u03b1 in super-infected pigs, as compared to PRRSV single-infected pigs, would have counteracted PRRSV multiplication and stimulated the induction of CMI specific to PRRSV. However, other cytokines could have played a role in viral interference, which deserves further investigation. Additionally, as underlined previously, the results we obtained here might have been different when using other viral subtypes or another delay between inoculations or pigs with a different health status. Further studies evaluating the role of each of these parameters in the outcomes of super-infection are thus still needed.",

It suggests that an antagonistic, but not a synergistic or additive, effect may result from a co-infection, probably depending on event chronology, as also recently evidenced in vitro in a study dedicated to dual infection with swIAV (H3N2) and porcine respiratory coronavirus [56] . Although further investigations are needed to more deeply decipher the complex interplays between PRRSV and swIAV infections, these findings provide new insight into PRDC regulation in pigs [2] . They should be relevant as well for the comprehensive understanding of respiratory virus co-infections in other species, such as within bovine respiratory disease in cattle [57] , or in humans where co-infections may occur with influenza A virus and other viruses [58] , among which some exhibit an ability to interfere with the IFN pathway.",
