Guided by Monte Carlo modelling and in vitro 1-log 10 decimal-reduction value (D-value) predictions, the X-ray photon energies required for the effective inactivation of zoonotic viruses belonging to the medically important families of Flaviviridae, Nairoviridae, Phenuiviridae and Togaviridae are demonstrated. Specifically, it is shown that an optimized irradiation approach is attractive for use in a multitude of downstream detection and functional assays, as it preserves key biochemical and immunological properties. This study provides evidence that X-ray irradiation can support emergency preparedness, outbreak response and front-line diagnostics in a safe, reproducible and scalable manner pertinent to operations that are otherwise restricted to higher containment BSL3 or BSL4 laboratories.",

A significant proportion of these emerging zoonosis are RNA viruses which present characteristically high transmission rates, are subject to unpredictable evolutionary change and cause high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs) in humans. Some notable examples include avian influenza (AI), Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), West Nile virus and Zika virus (ZIKV) which have all caused unprecedented epidemics across several countries, and in many instances death 3 or congenital disease 4 , while exerting acute pressures on public health infrastructures and local economies 5 . Incidences for such HCIDs are predicted to increase as population density, urbanization and climate equilibria continue to fluctuate 6-10 . These relatively recent events, including the current emergence of COVID-19 11,12 highlight the need for effective and reproducible workflows that permit safe, scalable and rapid pathogen inactivation, suitable for a range of downstream pathogen detection and intervention strategies.",

X-ray irradiation is an alternative to chemical and thermal approaches which both have known detrimental effects on the biological integrity of samples 22-24 . It does not require the addition of exogenous toxic or volatile chemicals and does not induce notable thermal expansion within the sample. In contrast to UV, plasma and electron bombardment, high energy X-rays (\u2265 1 keV) are composed of highly penetrative photons that traverse multiple layers of packaging in a similar manner to gamma radiation. Compared to gamma radiation, however, X-ray sources do not suffer from radio-isotopic half-life decay or the same security implications that are associated with the use of 'live' radiological sources. Energy-spectra and dose rates are also more tunable with X-rays than with gamma sources.",

In all cases, relaxation processes within the ionized atom (e.g. Auger and Coster-Kronig electron emission, fluorescence photons etc.) further contribute to the transmission of energy within the sample. The precise energy ranges above which one process dominates over another depend on the effective atomic number (Z) of the material 26 .

However, and as an inevitable consequence, photon penetration decreases with decreasing energy, leading to potential dose gradients within samples. This implies that determination of the optimum X-ray energy for biological inactivation of macroscopic samples is non-trivial. Soft X-rays (1 to 10 keV) have been shown to have some value in the inactivation of both enveloped 29 and non-enveloped viruses 30 without causing excessive damage to antigenic properties as previously demonstrated using pathogenic bacterial models 31,32 .",

The viruses selected here span a range of genomic arrangements and physical structural variants which are surrogates for higher risk group viruses that cause HCIDs e.g. Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Chikungunya fever diseases.

            "text": "Low-energy X-rays produced by bremsstrahlung are responsible for virus inactivation efficacy. To characterize the energy distributions of the photon fields for virus irradiation, Monte Carlo (MC) models of the X-ray source and irradiation chamber environment fitted to a MultiRad 225 Irradiator were developed using the general-purpose radiation transport code MC N-Particle (MCNP) version 6.1 33 , designed to track many particle types over broad ranges of energies. Setting the tube potential to 220 keV and current to 18.2 mA within the model, X-ray photon energies and dose rates for the irradiation of liquid virus samples through multi-layered packaging were modelled using an unfiltered beam, and 0.2, 0.5 or 2.0 mm aluminum (Al) or 0.3 mm copper (Cu) filters. The dose rates were calculated by the use of 'kerma tallies' (average kinetic energy released per unit mass), with equivalence between absorbed dose and kerma assumed; this assumption was justified from a consideration of the physical geometry of the irradiation chamber and sample set-up, and the maximum expected ranges 34 of any secondary electrons that might be produced. Conversion to absolute dose rates from the relative 'per-source-electron' normalization applied by default by MCNP6.1 was achieved by multiplying the Monte Carlo results by the quotient of the beam current of the X-ray tube (typically 18.2 mA, or equivalently 18.2 mC s -1 ) divided by the elementary charge constant (~ 1.602 \u00d7 10 -19 C).",

D-values, defined as the radiation-dose required to reduce the viral infectivity titer by 90% (or 1-log 10 ) were determined by the method of Schmidt and Nank 36 using TCID 50 data. Filtration with 0.3 mm Cu led to the greatest reduction in low-energy bremsstrahlung photons (or soft X-rays) and exposed the samples to fields more dominated by the characteristic X-rays. This led to a reduced efficacy in ZIKV inactivation, as measured by RT-qPCR (Fig. 1d ) and TCID 50 data (Fig. 1e ). Unfiltered beam exposure produced a similar inactivation curve to that from a beam filtered with 0.2 mm Al but showed higher variability, causing inconsistencies across ZIKV inactivation. This data set in combination with predictions obtained from the MC modelling data rationalized the use of 0.2 mm Al for beam filtration to ensure a better balance between dose uniformity and dose rate attenuation in all subsequent inactivation experiments.",

All inactivation doses were examined for cytopathic effects (CPE) by three consecutive rounds of tissue culture passages in Vero cells. Total virus input for all irradiated samples were controlled using RT-qPCR readouts to ensure that a minimum of 10 8 genomic-equivalent copies/mL of X-ray treated virus (pre-irradiation infectious titer of 10 6 TCID 50 /mL) were added to each cell culture monolayer. This provided assurance that the development of any CPE in vitro during the assay was normalized across the X-ray treated samples throughout the course of the experiment. As expected, non-irradiated ZIKV and RVFV controls developed CPE in Vero cells at 4 and 3 days post-infection respectively. A correlation between the time of delay before CPE and the X-ray dose was observed throughout the three-week assay. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Consistent with the D-values predicted from the inactivation curves, a final dose of 12.8 kGy for ZIKV-X and 15.79 kGy for RVFV-X as judged by CPE assays produced inactivated virus (Fig. 2a) . To investigate sterility further, in vivo animal disease models for ZIKV and RVFV were employed to provide additional evidence of non-infectious virus using the predicted X-ray inactivation doses. For ZIKV, interferon type-II deficient A129 mice were intravenously administered with an equivalence of 1 \u00d7 10 6 pfu of irradiated virus (at serial X-ray dose increments) and doses \u2265 9 kGy showed a 100% survival rate at 14 weeks post-infection (Fig. 2b) . No significant clinical symptoms or shifts in animal weights were observed during this period of experimentation, whereas mice treated with non-irradiated ZIKV (1 \u00d7 10 5 pfu) and doses \u2264 7.2 kGy consistently presented with clinical symptoms and were euthanized (according to pre-set disease end-points and ethical standards) within six days post-infection. Similar experiments were performed for RVFV using BALB/c mice with similar results: all mice survived after 2 \u00d7 intramuscular administration of 5 \u00d7 10 5 pfu of inactivated virus (i.e. virus pre-irradiated with doses \u2265 14.4 kGy; Fig. 2c ). The organs of surviving mice, including blood, spleen, brain and liver were checked for the presence of viral genomic material using RT-qPCR and were found to be negative, indicating that the RVFV-X treated with doses \u2265 14.4 kGy were no longer replicating and were not infectious in BALB/c mice. D-values for HAZV and BEBV were found to be 0.96 and 4.83 kGy respectively.",

An assessment of whether any of the X-ray inactivated viruses could be used as a source of viral RNA/cDNA or protein reagents in downstream biochemical and/or immunological assays was next investigated. To this end, ZIKV-X 11.6kGy and www.nature.com/scientificreports/ RVFV-X 18.4kGy were utilized in a series of experiments involving Next Generation Sequencing, ELISA and Western blot analysis. Using virus stocks cultivated at \u2265 6 log 10 infectious units, the utility of X-ray irradiation under ambient conditions for sequencing and full-length assembly of non-replicating ZIKV-X 11.6kGy and RVFV-X 18.4kGy genomes using an Illumina paired-end sequencing library was performed. ZIKV has a positive-sense singlestranded RNA genome whereas RVFV consists of a tripartite negative-stranded RNA genome consisting of Small (S), Medium (M) and Large (L) segments. Using SPAdes 37 , it was possible to re-assemble the complete genomes of both ZIKV-X and RVFV-X. Genome assembly showed no significant statistical association between the N50 variance and increasing X-ray irradiation dose, for either virus (Fig. 3a) . Complete ZIKV-X and RVFV-X S, M and L genomes could be successfully reconstructed from two independent non-replicating, X-ray inactivated virus stocks without the need for genome scaffolding. To assess for potential mutations incurred from X-rays during inactivation, complete genome assemblies from the nonirradiated stocks of both viruses were used in the subsequent mapping of irradiated sequencing reads. Mapping experiments to the respective viral genomes showed a minimum of \u00d7500 depth of coverage ( Fig. 3bi-iv) for both viral species across all X-ray irradiation doses. Mutations were assessed by calling variants at a coverage depth of \u2265 \u00d7100 and Phred quality score 30, against the final assembly of non-irradiated ZIKV and RVFV genomes. Figure 3C shows genomic segments of both inactivated ZIKV-X and RVFV-X containing random counts of substitution mutations, interestingly however no correlations were observed between dose exposure and the number of variants per genome segment(s) of either virus. As all viral stocks used in these sets of experiments originated from a single batch, it is unlikely that the observed variants are from variations in viral propagation or cultivation conditions. It is however probable that these variants are a result of either the mutation rate associated with MLV reverse-transcriptase used during cDNA synthesis 38 or the proof-reading actions associated with Taq polymerase enzyme during NGS library amplification steps rather than X-ray irradiation.",

            "text": "Zoonotic infections have been the predominant source of dangerous emerging disease over the last century 9,39 and include EVD, CCHF, Lassa fever, RVF, MERS and SARS. Work with such zoonotic pathogens requires the use of specialized high-containment facilities necessary for the safe handling of infectious materials. A consequence of the stringent bio-safety features of these facilities, especially BSL4, is a constraint to high-throughput processing which in turn slows the progress of diagnostic reference virology, including R&D work. While many microbiological activities can be accommodated within BSL4, there are significant practical and cost benefits of being able to work outside of containment by effectively inactivating pathogens. However, standard and established methods of virus inactivation such as heat treatment or chemical cross-linking with formaldehyde destroy and/ or modify complex protein structures and can lead to decreased sensitivity or artefactual results. This is especially problematic if inactivated pathogens are being used for clinical diagnosis and reference virology. A potential solution is to inactivate with X-rays which does not destroy native antigenic structure and provides a useful route to delivering non-infectious reagents for diagnostics and R&D work in lower containment laboratories and provides comparable results to non-inactivated native material. The production of non-infectious material containing whole-virus characteristics is a distinct advantage as it supports more complex experimental strategies than can be achieved with chemically modified or heat-denatured inactivated viral material. A number of studies examining the parameters that influence direct or indirect mechanisms of viral inactivation such as, sample types and suspension matrices [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , physiological temperature states 45 , particle size and infectious titer 46 have all indicated that X-ray irradiation could rapidly advance and strengthen conventional public health laboratory activities, and should therefore be considered as a serious contender to the current gold standard radiological sources such as Cobalt-60 for agents requiring BSL3/BSL4 facilities. However, to our knowledge, a detailed study with accurate D-values showing evidence of inactivation of viruses that retain biological and immunological characteristics using X-rays has not been thus far demonstrated. Guided by MC modeling, the data reported here shows the amount and type of X-ray radiation required for effective inactivation of viruses belonging families that cause medically-important zoonotic infections in humans. It was possible to recover nucleic acid for sequencing post inactivation and the protein moieties were detected in routine laboratory analysis. X-rays offer unique advantages over conventional gamma ray inactivation as they permit higher levels of control over the delivery of beam uniformity to a pathogenic specimen. Although gamma sources such as Cesium-137 or Cobalt-60 can offer very high dose rates compared to the output of typical X-ray tubes, they have significant drawbacks, such as highly divergent fields and inherent difficulties in controlling dose rates and inactivation. Furthermore, gamma source security, shielding, decommissioning and management introduce a range of addition non-scientific problems which are not simple to address. In contrast, X-ray sources are more controllable and directional, permitting improved accuracy in the dose uniformity ratio and in the inactivation process, consequently they reduce the risk of unnecessary damage to the material. This resolution in uniformity can be controlled using choice filtration composites with appropriate attenuation properties for lower energy photons. This is an important factor in the context of developing and scaling X-ray inactivated viruses for rapid diagnostics, high resolution structural biology or potentially for emergency vaccines which can be rapidly inactivated [47] [48] [49] to support front-line healthcare workers in HCID outbreaks.",

            "text": "Filtration permits the removal of soft X-rays (\u2264 ~ 20 keV) by a reduction of bremsstrahlung continuum photons in the X-ray beam. In our experiments looking at the effect of filtration on the irradiation of ZIKV, 0.3 mm Cu filtration produced inefficient inactivation of virus under both ambient (-3.8 log reduction) and frozen (-2.8 log reduction) sample conditions; this compared to -6.6 log reductions for the unfiltered or 0.2 mm Al filtered X-ray doses. These data taken together, suggest that X-ray energies lying on the hard X-ray electromagnetic spectrum are less responsible for inactivation and that soft X-rays are more accountable for the inactivation of viruses through a specific photoelectric ionization mechanism. Filtration of X-rays using 0.3 mm Cu resulted in a significant loss in dose rate which would have to be compensated for by a longer cycle of irradiation to achieve the required dose. On the other hand, unfiltered X-ray beams showed enhanced variability both in the context of depth-to-dose penetration of X-rays within the liquid phase of the samples as well as across the sample plane. Irradiation under these conditions would result in over-exposure of the samples to achieve assurance that the required dose had been used for sample inactivation. Filtration using 0.2 mm Al permitted the penetration of soft X-rays across the packaging system of our samples and induced sample inactivation with decimal reduction values comparable to the literature (Fig. 2a) . Furthermore, 0.2 mm Al filtration permitted uniform exposure of the samples to predicted X-ray doses required for inactivation. These parameters showed the successful inactivation of ZIKV, BEBV, HAZV and RVFV under ambient conditions.",

            "text": "An accurate understanding of doses required for sample inactivation using D-values is useful for normalizing exposure times relative to infectious titer and, in turn, will prevent unnecessary damage to precious samples following prolonged irradiation procedures. These D-values can be achieved with current plug and play instrumentation such as the MultiRad 225 keV, which provides highly penetrative irradiation doses permitting viral inactivation through stringent sample packaging systems. Through selection of composite materials with low X-ray attenuation coefficients or high Z-values for sample packaging, it may be possible to focus the desired photon energies responsible for inactivation of the pathogen and reduce irradiation times further. Higher dose rates can be achieved by considering dual or triple X-rays sources which could reduce the exposure time significantly Scientific Reports | (2020) 10:21431 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77972-5 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and achieve uniform sample inactivation. The sources are relatively straight forward to operate locally and are much safer than radioisotopes because they do not generate nuclear waste or require such stringent security and protective measures. In principle, it has been demonstrated here that X-ray inactivation can be successfully achieved for a selection of medically-important zoonotic viruses. X-ray irradiation is an effective mode of pathogen inactivation, which permits the production of non-infectious whole virus material that retains desired biochemical and immunological properties under ambient inactivation conditions. Preparedness in conjunction with active bio-surveillance programs are crucial public health endeavors and X-ray irradiation offers a unique tool for rapidly developing reagents for a range of downstream applications in a safe and reproducible manner.",

            "text": "Monte Carlo modelling of X-ray photons. MC simulations were performed using the general-purpose radiation transport code MCNP6.1 54 . The model accounts for X-ray source tube potential and current, distance to samples, geometric field of exposure including packaging materials and densities used during irradiation. The source was modelled as a 2.75 mm radius beam of plane-parallel monoenergetic electrons impinging on an angled target of pure tungsten of density 19.6 g/cm 3 . The beam was orientated along the negative x-axis and was hence perpendicular to the vertical (z) axis of the irradiation chamber. In general, the physics parameters and models used in the Monte Carlo simulations were the defaults applied by MCNP6.1, which are the code's maximally accurate options in almost all cases; the MCPLIB84 and e103 cross-section libraries were used for photons and electrons respectively. In order to improve computational efficiency, however, production of bremsstrahlung photons in the tungsten was artificially enhanced by setting the BNUM parameter in MCNP to 10,000, with the code then re-weighting the results automatically to maintain fairness; whilst the exact choices of variance reduction applied in the modelling were chosen 'by hand' , and may not necessarily be optimal, it is important to emphasize that all tally results were successfully tested for statistical robustness using the packages applied by MCNP6.1 by default. Photon intensities and doses were determined using MCNP f4 fluence-and f6 kermatallies, respectively, with the latter justified under the reasonable assumption of secondary charged particle equilibrium at the locations of interest. X-ray irradiation and inactivation. Commercial X-ray generators typically operate by impinging a beam of electrons onto a high-Z target (often tungsten) inside an evacuated tube. As the electrons decelerate within the target, bremsstrahlung photons are emitted with a directional distribution that is dependent on the target material and its shape, as well as on the energy of the incident electrons. A thin window in the X-ray tube allows the photons to escape, with collimation typically added around the window to better focus the direction of the beam and prevent the escape of stray radiation. The energy distributions of the X-ray beams are composed of continuous bremsstrahlung radiation that is dependent on the voltage of the electron beam and characteristic peaks that occur at energies dependent on the material. The overall intensity of the X-ray field is governed by the electron beam current. Beam filtration using metals with increasing attenuation coefficients and/or densities can be used to systematically remove the lower energy components of the photon fields, resulting in beam hardening.",
