From May 4, 2020 the so-called Phase II was approved, and consisted in a gradual deceleration to Phase I as a result of a decline to the epimedic's curve [4] (Fig. 1) . On June 7, 2020 Italy recorded a total of 234,998 COVID-19 cases wherein: 168,640 had recovered, 32,459 were in home self-isolation and 33,899 deceased [5] . Until the middle of April, the number of patients hospitalized in intensive and nonintensive care units progressively increased as a result of the consequent need for a complete reorganization of hospital infrastructures. The territorial heterogeneity of the COVID-19 trend brought about a decisive and dramatic prevalence in areas of northern Italy and a more contained incidence in areas of central and southern Italy ( Fig. 2 ) [5] .",

Therefore, although with smaller numbers, the Abruzzo region also underwent an important distress and COVID-19 centered reorganization of hospital activities with the interruption on March 13, 2020 of all planned medical and surgical activities with the exception of oncology and hematology services which clinicians judged non-deferrable. In fact, when regarding cytostatic, radiation oncology or immunological treatments, the Ministry of Health emphasized to local Health Authorities the need to guarantee these \"lifesaving\" treatments to all patients and to plan dedicated routes and spaces for those patients being treated as well as the availability of all necessary individual protective In the background (scale on the left), the cumulative day-per-day deaths (red) and recoveries (blue), patients currently positive and requiring admission to intensive units (orange), non-intensive unit admissions (yellow) and home self-isolation (green) (modified by https ://ilseg nalat ore.info/) devices and equipment [7, 8] . Furthermore, the Italian Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) implemented a document to make radiotherapy operating procedures homogeneous throughout the ongoing COVID-19 emergency [9] and conducted a targeted national survey [10] . To this regard, several experiences have been published on the management of radiation therapy during the pandemic [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . We aim to report here our particular experience in the organizational planning of radiotherapy during the two phases of the COVID-19 emergency, lockdown phase I and postlockdown phase II. It was in doing so that we were able to guarantee treatment continuity whilst maintaining the safety of cancer patients and healthcare personnel within the framework of a complete COVID-19 reorganization at the University Hospital of Chieti.",

Many internal and surgical departments were reconverted and dedicated to the management of COVID-19 within only a few weeks, with the radiological and laboratory diagnostic activities seriously involved in these plans. Although witnessing more contained case numbers than the regions and provinces of northern Italy, the main hospitals of the Abruzzo region and, specifically in our experience, the University Hospital of Chieti, were reorganized to conform to COVID-19 measures in only a short period of time. This particular situation carried a double risk due to the potential of delays or interruptions in to oncological therapies, which, despite being a \"lifesaving\" treatment, could have been hazardous to patients who are often already frail and also at high risk of infection themselves as well as to carers and health personnel alike. Several scientific documents and papers published on the subject represented an important reference point especially in the first phase of the emergency [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and with particular regard to the use of protection systems, triage procedures and the use of hypofractionation schemes. In particular, a national survey conducted by the Italian Society of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology and, prior even to this, a survey of the radiotherapy centers of the Lombardy region, the region most affected by COVID-19 [10, 14] , both reported and supported the measures, implemented for the new rearrangement of centers, the workloads necessary and the COVID-19 cases found. Most of the measures adopted and reported in the surveys are in line with the planned approach undertaken in our particular experience with the exception of the \"working from home scheme\" which cannot Triage area with nursing staff: (a) entry for 4 patients at a time with a distance of at least 1 m; (b) body temperature detection with Thermo can; (c) finding of respiratory symptoms, ocular disorders (conjunctivitis), dysgeusia and anosmia; (d) contacts with suspected COVID-19 by filling of the dedicated Hospital questionnaire; (e) obligation of surgical mask for patients and carers [18] [19] [20] [21] As per Phase I 10 Management of suspected case in triage for patients, staff, carers and third parties: if temperature \u2265 37.5\u00b0 repetition after 10 min and if confirmed, access to the center is not allowed. Evaluation for deferral of planned clinical or technical performance: in the case of deferral, the patient is rescheduled; in the case of non-deferral, the patient accesses the service by adopting all the safety criteria indicated in points 12 and 13 [19] As per Phase I",

In our particular experience, the clinical activity during the lockdown phase was comparable to that of the same period of 2019 and, except for a rescheduling of the oncological follow-up visits, there were no interruptions in treating patients nor reduction in radiotherapy preparation or treatment of newly diagnosed cancer patients. The national survey also reports 29.6% of the positive or suspect cases treated in Italian centers. No positive or suspicious cases were found in our experience during phase I and phase II. However, the differences shown in the reduction of workloads and the number of positive or suspect patients reported in the national survey highlight the predominance of the COVID-19 cases in the regions of northern Italy and, in particular, Lombardy where a reduction of 10-50% in radiotherapy was registered, but also in greater organizational awareness due to the increase of national and international guidelines emerging on the subject during this period and in the detailed recommendations on individual tumor pathologies treated using hypofractionated regimens [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . In our experience, dose hypofractionation has been used in breast, prostate and palliation cancers.",
