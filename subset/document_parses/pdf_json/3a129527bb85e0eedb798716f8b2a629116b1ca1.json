Specifically, competition cyclists during confinement had lot of difficulties to train due to the need to train outside their homes. However, the increase of online training sessions, or virtual training tools could help to overcome training difficulties due to confinement although there are not studies that analyse the effects of using these types of tools in cyclists. This study aims to test how the use of online training tools in competition cyclists during confinement is related to training frequency and duration, and emotions. 329 cyclists filled an online questionnaire about feelings during confinement and the use of online training tools, before and during confinement. Results showed that the use of online training tools was associated with higher frequency and duration of trainings. Moreover, those who used these tools felt more positively about their future and preparation to compete, feeling more energy than those who did not used online tools. In addition, cyclists that started using these online tools (including virtual roller training) during confinement increased the frequency of training. In conclusion the use of online training tools for cycling could be appropriate to maintain training levels and energy and positive feelings about their future.",

It is estimated that world tour professional male cyclists ride, between training and competitions, within 25,000 and 35,000 km per year, while world tour female cyclists ride between 13,000 and 18,000 km per year (Sanders et al., 2019) . For this reason, cyclists could have been affected highly negatively by the confinement. However, despite the need to train outdoors, as far as we know there are no studies that have tested the effect of confinement on professional cyclists. Thus, from a practical point of view, cyclists, physical trainers, and teams have had to develop useful alternatives to maintain the level of fitness and motivation.",

Thus, thanks to the accessibility of training technology, countless mobile and online applications have emerged to allow training at home. Online apps can guide physical exercise and offer reinforcements and contingencies that improve physical fitness (although, these type of publications are scarce and there is excessive fragmentation of them, according to a recent bibliometric study) (Liu and Avello, 2020) . In addition, several studies have suggested the efficacy of exergaming applications to increase adherence to exercise and reduce stress, anxiety and mood disorders during confinement (Bentlage et al., 2020; Chtourou et al., 2020) . Thus, the use of digital technology has been recommended to improve adherence to exercise due to its social relevance and impact on health in other types of populations, such as the elderly (Ammar et al., 2021b) . Apart from applications for training there are numerous applications in the field of psychological or motivational training (Boudreaux et al., 2018; Oh et al., 2020) , sleep monitoring for the recovery and improvement of the athlete's performance (Gershkovich et al., 2020) , reducing the risk of injuries (Halson, 2019) or even for the control of intake in obesity (Keogh et al., 2016) . There are some studies that show that the use of these apps can be promising to promote physical activity, quality of life, even self-efficacy in sedentary individuals (G\u00fcr et al., 2020; Price et al., 2020) although in a recent systematic review (Truelove et al., 2020) it has been indicated that there are some of those studies with methodological deficiencies that compromise the conclusions, suggesting the need for more rigorous and systematic research.",

In the case of cycling, we have not found any studies investigating whether these apps are used, although a study with people who regularly use the bicycle shows that the use of GPS smartphone apps is associated with a higher frequency of cycling and a greater perception of strength (Angosto et al., 2020) . Additionally, in recent years the use by competition cyclists of virtual training simulators that improve performance of conventional rollers has increased. These interactive training tools allow cyclists to virtually compete against each other, monitor their workouts, and even schedule team workouts. They also have functionalities that allow quantifying training loads and physiological adaptations, relevant parameters for any training method, incorporating meters and bluetooth or ANT+ connections for different sensors that allow instant information and data on the main physiological parameters (Mujika, 2017) . In this way, cyclists training and performance could be monitored and optimized during indoor training in a similar way to training on the road or in competition (Passfield et al., 2017) , with greater efficiency than other instruments such as fitness monitors activity, much cheaper but also much less reliable (Boudreaux et al., 2018) . These tools could serve for monitoring the detraining period and quantifying the rate of loss of physical fitness caused by confinement, and planning the lap to normal activity, as it is done in other sports (Eirale et al., 2020) . All this could provide an important advantage over non-virtual training (with roller and without interaction), considering the value of social interaction and motivation that they can provide.",

However, there is no objective data showing whether this use is effective in improving training frequency or whether it has any effect on the way confinement is experienced. Therefore, the objective of this work is to analyse the use of online training tools and virtual rollers by competition cyclists to confirm the impact of these tools on their perception of confinement, training routines, and mood.

Results confirmed these significant relationships but with a little effect size and low correlation indexes. Specifically, professional cyclists who use online training tools informed being less pessimistic about their future in comparison with cyclists that do not use these tools. Even using online tools for training before confinement was related to better mood. Therefore, during confinement the use of online training tools would be a recommendable strategy for cyclists to improve mood and their vision of the future. In addition, the increased use of these tools leads to a higher frequency of training, specifically indoor roller and is associated with positive thinking about future preparation. Complementarily, online training tools use was associated with a greater perception of energy. Additionally, an interesting and very useful aspect to highlight is that the use of these online tools was negatively related to the effort that cyclists take to train; so, these methods could be a good instrument to motivate and carry out more effective training routines. In this sense, considering that reduced levels of physical activity have been an issue of concern during COVID-19 confinement (Bentlage et al., 2020) and the effects on mental health as negative affect, well-being and mood, leading to even lower life satisfaction (Ammar et al., 2020a (Ammar et al., ,b,c, 2021a , recommending the use of online training tools could solve, partially, some of the confinement issues. In this line, it has been reported a greater acceptance among the population of the use of technologies during this period, so the use of these online resources should be considered as appropriate strategies to maintain physical activity (Ammar et al., 2020c (Ammar et al., , 2021a .",

            "text": "All these results show how specific online cycling trainings can be a very interesting tool in cases of confinement, allowing cyclists to maintain a training routine evaluated by its frequency and weekly duration. Complementarily, the fact that the use of online training tools reduces the difficulty of training and makes it more attractive allow to maintain training routines helping cyclists to maintain their fitness level and competitiveness. In this sense, in other athletes, such as football players, the adaptation of training sessions to the conditions of confinement has already been noted and recommended, stressing that medical and physiological standards should be ensured by adapting training sessions to the new conditions and recommending more research dedicated to the adaptation of safe training sessions during confinement (Eirale et al., 2020) . In addition, these instruments are related to a higher energy and mainly to a more positive vision about their sport future and their preparation, directly influencing the motivation to keep on training. This is very important because following physical activity routines influence positive mood, as has been demonstrated during the pandemic (Clemente-Su\u00e1rez et al., 2020). We consider this result is also very relevant and reiterates the need to expand the use of the different online training tools in sportsman. Therefore, these tools allow athletes to stay active, which could translate into continued healthy habits such as better sleep quality or a higher level of physical activity (Trabelsi et al., 2021) . Research indicates that behavioral changes have occurred in the population during the pandemic lockdown, both in physical activity habits (Leon-Zarce\u00f1o et al., 2021) and altered eating behaviors (Ammar et al., 2020b) , highlighting the importance of safe physical activity in times of pandemic .",

Considering that our results showed a significant increase in the frequency and duration of training bouts and less harmful confinement effects (preparedness and less difficulties to train), we consider that virtual roller could be a ground-breaking in the field of cycling. Thus, the wide training possibilities that provide to cyclists and teams but overall, the possibilities to train without depending on the weather or confinement, could make these virtual training tools a competitive advantage. Among other advantages offered by this type of rollers is the real-time interaction between geographically distanced cyclists, the possibility of team training with the presence of all the riders, make up for the impossibility of training on the road through indoor training, knowing the real fitness status with relative precision and planning tests remotely, and especially to offer an attractive stimulus to roller training, which facilitates compliance with the routines established by physical trainers or sports directors.",

Moreover, considering that our sample also includes professional sportsmen, the results can be applied also in the professional world, which could be extrapolated to other fields of professional sport.

The main important limitation of this study is that all the measures are subjective (selfreported) and obtained from an online questionnaire directly asking cyclists about their perception of frequency and duration of training and perceived mood and feelings. Moreover, the low effect size and low correlations, even significant, obtained in all statistical analyses prevent us to made sounding conclusions. Complementarily, this research would have benefited if we had made explicit the specific applications that the cyclists used, mainly in the case of virtual rollers to identify which tools are the most employed and useful. However, the strengths of this study are that it is a specific population that has not been studied during confinement, even though they are eligible for paying attention since they depend on being able to leave home to train. In addition, another strength is that the data were taken at the time of the confinement, two weeks after the start of the confinement when the future was uncertain.",
