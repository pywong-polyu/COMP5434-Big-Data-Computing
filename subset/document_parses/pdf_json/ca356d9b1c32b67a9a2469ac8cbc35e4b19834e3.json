Given the laboratory tests and the clinical state, a diagnosis of PIMS-TS was made, and we started treatment with DF at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day divided into 4 doses together with low-dose heparin. After 3 doses of DF, the clot firmness was reduced (MCF: 50 mm, Figure 1G ) and TPAmediated lysis was significantly improved (LT: 360 sec, Figure 1G ). Although this is still speculative, our data indicate that the DF treatment might have supported the TPA-mediated clot lysis, probably via increasing plasmin concentration or downregulating the plasminogen activator inhibitor. After 8 days of DF treatment, the patient was afebrile and could be discharged 17 days after admission with normal laboratory results and without signs of ascites or pleural effusions.",

The inflammatory status and laboratory tests were suggestive for the diagnosis of the recently described PIMS-TS. So far, no specific treatment for this syndrome has been reported. In a recent publication, 48 children with Covid-19 admitted to ICUs were described. Most children were treated with hydroxychloroquine. Other agents, mostly used in combinations were azithromycin, remdesivir and tocilizumab [8] . Feldstein et al describe pediatric patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome who mainly received steroids, or IVIG in case of Kawasaki\u00b4s disease like features. None of these approaches are primarily directed towards the treatment of an assumed endothelial damage [9] . The reasons for the endotheliitis are currently not clear. It might be a direct toxic effect of the virus, since expression of ACE2 on endothelial cells can provide an entry mechanism for the virus. Another possible mechanism might be a complement-mediated injury either by direct complement activation or antibody-mediated [10] . Indeed, significant deposits of C5b-9 have been described in the lungs in autopsy cases [11] . Therefore, we measured the C5b-9 complex in patient 2 and found a two-fold elevated level A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 at time of admission which normalized during DF treatment ( Figure 1E ). Furthermore, one could speculate that higher titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG might induce enhanced complement-mediated endothelial damage since high specific IgG antibodies correlated with more severe illness and poorer outcome compared to patients with lower titers [12] .",
