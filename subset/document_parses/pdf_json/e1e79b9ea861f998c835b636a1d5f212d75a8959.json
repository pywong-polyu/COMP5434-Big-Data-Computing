We systematically investigated the impact of PAF units in a mock classroom, as a supplement to background ventilation, on localized and wholeroom surface deposition and particle concentration. Fluorescently tagged particles with a volumetric mean diameter near 2 \u03bcm were continuously introduced into the classroom environment via a breathing simulator with a prescribed inhalation\u2212exhalation waveform. Deposition velocities were inferred on >50 horizontal and vertical surfaces throughout the classroom, while aerosol concentrations were spatially monitored via optical particle spectrometry. Results revealed a particle decay rate consistent with expectations based upon the reported clean air delivery rates of the PAF units. Additionally, the PAF units reduced peak concentrations by a factor of around 2.5 compared to the highest concentrations observed and led to a statistically significant reduction in deposition velocities for horizontal surfaces >2.5 m from the aerosol source. Our results not only confirm that PAF units can reduce particle concentrations but also demonstrate that they may lead to reduced particle deposition throughout an indoor environment when properly positioned with respect to the location of the particle source(s) within the room (e.g., where the largest group of students sit) and the predominant air distribution profile of the room.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID- 19) , the infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), 1,2 has led to >254 million confirmed cases and 5.1 million deaths globally 3,4 as of November 2021. Like other respiratory infections, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted via the expulsion of respiratory particles during breathing, speaking, and other human respiratory activities. The fate of such particles ultimately determines the mode of exposure for individuals. Human respiratory activities produce an extremely broad and often multimodal size distribution of particles, 5\u221211 but the smallest mode of the size distribution is peaked well below 10 \u03bcm for breathing and speaking, the most common human respiratory activities. Recent studies have repeatedly detected viral RNA in such sub-10 \u03bcm particles, 12\u221216 strongly suggesting that they are largely responsible for infectious virus dispersion into the environment and, ultimately, that they are the primary drivers of infection spread. Particles in this size range evaporate upon dispersion into indoor environments, 17, 18 yielding micrometer-scale aerosol particles with lifetimes in the air which are tens of minutes to hours. 19 Such particles are easily dispersed throughout the entire indoor space where they originate and can contribute to infection spread via two means. 20 First, a direct aerosol transmission route occurs when infectious particles are inhaled and deposit within the airways. Second, exhaled micrometer-scale particles can deposit on surfaces 19 ,21\u221223 and readily do so on surfaces throughout indoor spaces. While the direct aerosol route has been most prominently discussed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and may be the primary route of transmission in many instances, 24\u221226 the indirect route may still contribute to infection spread. Indeed, viable SARS-CoV-2 is detectable on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for >72 h; 27 thus, deposition to high-touch surfaces may increase the viral load that individuals come into contact with when interacting with these surfaces. Additionally, when examined via a physiological perspective, even with perfect deposition efficiency in human airways, exposure levels through direct inhalation are bounded by the minute volume (5\u22128 L min \u22121 ). Deposition velocities for 2 \u03bcm particles in indoor spaces are often of order 10 \u22125 to 10 \u22124 m s \u22121 , 28 and for a surface area of 1.0 m 2 (e.g., an office desk or teacher's desk), we arrive at a deposition exposure equivalent of \u223c0.6\u22126.0 L min \u22121 , similar in magnitude to direct inhalation (though with a less clear route to transmission).",

            "text": "Reducing the potential for infection spread via both direct inhalation and through deposition and contact hence requires limiting expelled aerosol particle concentrations and their lifetimes in the environment. Alongside the universal use of masks as both source control and protective equipment, 29 this is best accomplished through increasing ventilation rates, limiting occupancy in rooms, and limiting time of co-occupancy. Limiting occupancy and co-occupancy time is a particular challenge in many settings, notably for school environments. In the United States, 50 million students and five million adult staff comprise the kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) public school system. 30, 31 To limit the spread of COVID-19 among staff and students, many U.S. schools enacted distance learning throughout most of 2020 and into 2021. 32 However, many school systems have opened to in-person instruction in Fall 2021. Infection spread in school systems is hence a persistent concern, 33\u221235 and employing interventions that limit respiratory virus transmission is paramount. 36 Recommendations for classrooms state that proper ventilation should be higher than 3\u22126 air changes per hour (ACH), 37,38 with the recent literature highlighting that lower COVID-19 infection rates can be achieved in schools when ventilation and/or filtration is improved as part of a multi-level COVID-19 mitigation strategy. 39, 40 However, not all school systems will be able to achieve such ACH values; many schools have older infrastructure and limited heating, cooling, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems that are unable to adequately ventilate the rooms with fresh air or filter the air being delivered to the space. Recirculating portable air filtration (PAF) units, which typically incorporate fibrous filters to remove particles from air, but may also incorporate other technologies (i.e., to remove [volatile organic compounds] VOCs or to augment filter collection), 41 \u221243 is a demonstrated approach to supplement the ventilation systems. 44, 45 The capability of PAF units to reduce airborne particle exposure in various indoor environments has been investigated for decades and proved to be promising. 46\u221248 For this reason, many school systems are considering, or have committed to adding, PAFs to their classrooms. While prior studies have examined PAF performance in mock classroom settings, 44, 49 they have largely been limited to examining rates of particle concentration decay following a simulated aerosol event, akin to tests used in evaluating clean air delivery rates (CADR) for such units. 50 Here, we seek to expand on these studies by examining microparticle dispersion from a breathing simulator in a mock classroom (hereafter \"classroom\") environment having its own air handling unit (AHU). Not only do we evaluate the effect of PAFs on aerosol clearance rates but we also report on the effect they have on deposition velocity to surfaces throughout the classroom, similar to what has been done in other environments. 22,28,51\u221253 In doing so, we examine the influence PAFs have on the potential for both direct and indirect infection transmission. Specifically, as described in the subsequent sections, we injected fluorescein-tagged particles via a breathing simulator situated in the classroom space. We evaluated particle deposition fluxes and velocities, as well as concentration, at different locations around the classroom. Four experimental conditions were implemented, with one condition run with the HVAC system operation only and the three other conditions with HVAC system operation supplemented by three PAF units running simultaneously at predefined settings. Each measurement location was a varied distance from the simulator and the three PAF units situated throughout the space, allowing us to examine the localized and whole-room impact of PAF on particle deposition and concentration. The results demonstrate how PAF units can be used to not only reduce airborne particle concentrations but also reduce deposition velocities, hence directly mitigating both direct and indirect aerosol transmission routes.",

This mock classroom was on the third floor of an eight-story building that shares walls with other rooms. However, the AHU supplying the classroom served that space only. It was reconfigured to a classroom for 12 students and one teacher. Twelve school desks (0.61 m \u00d7 0.47 m) were brought into the classroom, each 0.71 m in height. We also placed a teacher's desk (1.17 m \u00d7 0.72 m) of 0.79 m in height at the northeast corner of the classroom, with a desktop computer and two monitors placed atop at 1.30 m in height. The placement of all the desks reflected the ideal setup of a classroom in relation to COVID-19 physical distancing recommendations (2-m spacing). A 1.38 m tall whiteboard was placed at the north end of the classroom near the teacher's desk. Six iPads were placed upon the back of three student desks. The classroom has a dedicated AHU providing mixed fresh and recirculated air through three variable air volume boxes. Four linear diffusers next to the windows and three square diffusers in the center of the classroom supplied air (Figure 1b) , with two return grilles at the northwest and southwest corners. A minimum efficiency report value (MERV) 10 filter, common to public spaces, including schools, was installed in the AHU. The MERV 10 filter has an average particle size efficiency of 50\u221264.9% for particles sized 1.0\u22123.0 \u03bcm and 85% or greater for particles 3.0\u221210.0 \u03bcm. 54 During each experimental condition, the classroom was maintained between 20 and 22\u00b0C and 20\u221250% RH.",

Prior to experimental measurements, we performed a CO 2 decay test using an ASTM international standard for determining air change in a single zone 56 in order to quantify the total air supplied to the room (ventilation + infiltration/exfiltration). Briefly, we placed two tanks of CO 2 in the classroom each injecting 68 m 3 /h (40 CFM) of CO 2 . We used two large fans to help mix the classroom air.

Each PAF unit consisted of an Intellipure Compact (Intellipure, Inc.; Pulaski, New York), which contains a six-stage prefilter for larger particles and VOCs, followed by an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and, subsequently, an electret main filter for micrometer and submicrometer particle collection. While we did not perform tests to directly evaluate particle collection efficiency within these units, 42 we remark that the multiplexing of different technologies in series in PAF units is commonly done in an effort to maximize collection efficiency while simultaneously minimizing pressure drop. 57, 58 In series, application of multiple control technologies reduces the influence of leaks, which have been detected in prior studies 59 of PAF units incorporating single technologies. A third-party lab test reported minimal ozone generation (<0.001 ppm) during PAF unit operation. Notably, although ESP systems may also increase the risk of oxidized VOC and particulate matter generation via secondary indoor air chemistry, 60 their major byproduct, ozone, is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and is the chief concern during ESP operation, particularly if proper ESP maintenance does not occur. 61 To further characterize the PAF unit, we calculated the anticipated diffusion and field charging levels for the ESP and included within the Supporting Information (Section 2). Third-party testing following the standards EN1822-1:2009 62 and EN1822-5:2009, 63 noted that the particle removal efficiency was 99.83% for the filter (classified as E12) within these units at a particle size of 0.3 \u03bcm and higher for other sizes. 62, 63 When the whole unit was tested as an integrated filter + ESP according to these testing standards, the particle removal efficiency was 99.997% at 0.3 \u03bcm. When run on the highest fan setting, each unit had a third-party tested CADR of approximately 246.9 m 3 h \u22121 (an augmentation of 1.08 ACH for the classroom). We conducted additional testing to surmise the airflow speeds from the unit when run with and without filters installed (Table S1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The three units hence led to a CADR augmentation of \u223c3.23 ACH within the classroom, yielding a total effective air cleaning rate of 6.23 ACH assuming additivity with the HVAC system contribution calculated using the following equation.

The inhalation and exhalation waveforms of the simulator were 0.38 sin(1.67t) and 0.32 sin(1.39t) standard liter per second (L/s), where t is the time in seconds. 64 The nebulizer generated aerosol using a solution of 20% glycerol, 1.5% uranine (fluorescein sodium salt), and 78.5% distilled water under a constant backing pressure of 2.07 bar that was provided by an air compressor. The mean volumetric particle size was approximately 2.0 \u03bcm after solvent evaporation and mostly ranged between 1 and 5 \u03bcm. A detailed plot of this volumetric size distribution, measured optically at the mouth of the breathing simulator, can be found in our prior study. 21 We used this size range for two reasons. First, particles within this range and, particularly, those less than or equal to 5 \u03bcm, are more likely to penetrate deep into the respiratory system, thus increasing their likelihood of causing infection versus larger particles. 65 Second, as compared to submicrometer particles, particles within this size range (1) may contain more viruses if viral loading follows the volumetric size distribution for exhaled breath 5, 8 and (2) deposit more efficiently within the respiratory system (as submicrometer particle deposition efficiencies are lower, though they do deposit more prevalently in the deeper airways). 66 During inhalation, particles produced by the nebulizer were passed to a filter and not expelled into the room, while during exhalation the rate of particle dispersion followed the exhalation waveform.",

Two optical particle spectrometers (OPS; TSI 3330; TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN) measured the particle concentration and size distributions at two different locations ( Figure 1 ) in the 0.3\u221210 \u03bcm size range. Both OPS locations were one row in front of the simulator, but one OPS was next to a PAF unit in the middle right of the classroom (AP2) on CD9 while the other OPS was distal to all PAF units, on CD7. Four impinger sampling systems were also utilized to measure the fluoresceintagged particle mass concentration at (1) different heights around the PAF unit most distal to the simulator (IM3-L and IM4-H) and (2) near the simulator (IM1 and IM2). Each sampling system consisted of a small glass impinger (AGI-30; Ace Glass, Vineland, NJ) and a HEPA capsule connected via Tygon tubing to a vacuum pump (McMaster Oil-Free Electric Vacuum Pump; Santa Fe Springs, CA) ( Figure 2b ). Impingers were operated at a 12.5 L per minute sampling rate and were filled with 25 mL NaOH solution (0.001 M, mixed with 4 g sucrose to prevent freezing). Three of the four impingers (IM1, IM2, and IM4-H) were placed 1.52 m above the floor to sample the air from the breathing zone expected when an average height person is standing, while IM3-L, colocated with IM4-H, was placed 0.76 m above the floor. This lower height allowed for an assessment of the impact of the PAF unit vertically. The vacuum pumps used for operation were placed underneath tall chairs covered with 55-gallon plastic bags to limit any impact of thermal plumes generated by the running of the pumps.",

This minimized potential crosscontamination. The collected solution was then pipetted into a new 12 \u00d7 75 mm disposable glass culture tube for each piece of the substrate, and its fluorescein concentration was determined using a Trilogy Laboratory Fluorometer previously calibrated using a set of standard fluorescein solutions of known concentration. Each impinger was reweighed after being removed from the classroom, with the pre-to post-test impinger weight difference yielding the loss of sampling liquid due to evaporation. The volume of the liquid left in each impinger was also recorded, and the fluorescein concentration in the remaining liquid was measured by pipetting 1 mL of the remaining solution from the bottom of each impinger into new disposable glass culture tubes and placing it into the fluorometer.",

Along with the combined particle concentration and deposition measurements, we conducted four additional experimental conditions to determine the aerosol concentration distribution within the classroom, again using the settings specified in Table 1 . For these measurements, we placed one OPS unit in the middle classroom desk, one row in front of the breathing simulator (CD8) as a reference, with the other OPS unit placed upon a cart 81 cm in height and moved every 2 min. to the 34 locations indicated by the blue squares in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information. The cart had a wire frame that minimally impeded the airflow. For each measurement, we first ran the breathing simulator for 60 min. to inject the classroom with enough aerosol to reach a steady state. After 60 min., two researchers entered the classroom. One researcher was situated at the side of the classroom with a study laptop and remained in this location throughout the duration of the experiment. The other researcher guided the OPS unit situated on the cart already positioned at location \"1-CD3-O\" to each of the 34 sampling locations denoted by precisely measured pieces of tape on the floor (see Figure S4 in Section 3 of Supporting Information). With the breathing simulator still running, we sampled at each location for a total of 2 min, with the OPS units sampling at 10 s intervals. Each location's \"start\" and \"stop\" times directly from the OPS unit being moved around on the cart were stated by the researcher pushing this cart for documentation into a spreadsheet by the researcher holding the study laptop at a fixed location in the classroom. The data were cleaned to remove the outliers outside the 95% confidence intervals. The concentration and size distribution of the aerosol particles at each location facilitated analyses of the spatial effect of the PAF units on particle concentrations throughout the classroom under each experimental condition. More detailed procedures can be found in Section 3 of the Supporting Information. While a different ACS ES&T Engineering pubs.acs.org/estengg Article reference concentration choice could certainly be made, this would not change the general conclusion of this work, and deposition velocities would remain at the same orders of magnitude as reported here. 2.5. Data Processing. The raw fluorescein mass concentration recovered from the substrates and impingers was recorded in mg/m 3 . Extraction efficiency was tested in triplicate for every size of plastic wrap and scotch tape by placing 0.1 mL of 100 mg/m 3 of fluorescein onto these substrates and allowing for drying for 24 h in a room using a different AHU. Following the 24 h of dry time, these pieces of plastic wrap and scotch tape were processed identically to the procedures outlined above. The raw mass concentration value for each substrate in all conditions was then divided by this extraction efficiency to correct for any fluorescein mass lost during extraction. The averaged relative standard deviation was around 10% and, depending on the size of the substrate, the extraction efficiency varied between 40 and 80%. We then used the extraction efficiency as a correction factor for each type of the substrate; the fluorescein mass concentration c d,i in the recovery solution after processing each piece of the substrate was determined by dividing the raw concentration by its extraction efficiency. The effective deposition fluxes J\u2033 for each substrate were then calculated as",

For most passive horizontal upward-facing surfaces, the BL and BL + FanO conditions had comparatively higher deposition velocities than the BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP conditions, with consistent notable spikes at CD5-SIM. CD5-SIM represents deposition to the classroom desk immediately in front of the breathing simulator, so deposition velocity was typically higher than at other locations, as expected. While spikes were observed at the AP1-3ft-R and AP3-6ft-N locations, this appeared only during the BL + Filters + ESP condition and may have been due to the changes in localized airflow, an effect we discuss subsequently. Figure 3b plots deposition velocity for all passive horizontal upward-facing surfaces by the distance from the breathing simulator. As expected, and consistent with our prior work examining deposition in an office environment, 21 the deposition velocities were highest within 2 m from the breathing simulator and stabilized between 10 \u22123 and 10 \u22122 cm/s beyond 2 m. This is possibly because the concentration around the breathing simulator was higher than the ambient level but not captured by the impinger and thus not as fully accounted for in the calculations. However, it suggests that the indirect transmission route via deposited aerosol particles, if significant, would be most likely to occur through contact with surfaces that an infected individual remained close to (within 2 m of) for an extended period of time.",

For microparticles (0.1\u221210 \u03bcm), the influence of gravity cannot be neglected for deposition onto upward-facing surfaces. For characteristic velocities of indoor air, their model indicates that the deposition velocities of particles 0.1\u221210 \u03bcm in size onto passive vertical surfaces span the 10 \u22126 to 10 \u22124 cm s \u22121 range, while the deposition velocities onto passive horizontal upward-facing surfaces varied between 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22121 cm s \u22121 . Although deposition velocities onto passive horizontal upward-facing surfaces in our study agreed well with their model, we observed higher deposition velocities onto the passive vertical surfaces than they referenced. As pointed out by our previous study, 21 the reason for this difference can likely be attributed to the effect of the ventilation system on the room's flow field, surface roughness, and the use of the reference concentration for a point source, as well as a potential limitation of the measurement device. We also remark that the Lai and Nazaroff framework 28 assumes that the particle concentration is uniform throughout the indoor space, making it unnecessary to select a reference concentration location for deposition velocity calculation. However, in utilizing a breathing simulator, we do not have a spatially uniform particle concentrator, as the breathing simulator is better approximated as a point source. Therefore, the precise deposition velocities calculated apply for our choice of reference concentration, that is, the aerosol mass concentration of fluorescein particles at the height of the simulator.",

Figure 5 displays deposition velocity to active horizontal downward-facing surfaces, which are diffusers and return grilles, by distance from the breathing simulator. Note that both the diffusers and return grilles have similar output and intake velocities, respectively. As expected, deposition was slightly higher for the return grilles relative to the diffuser given that these surfaces were pulling \"dirty\" air from the classroom versus supplying the classroom with \"clean\" air, respectively. These data generally suggested that for the BL and BL + FanO conditions: (1) more particles needed clearance by (2) more particles were being recirculated back into the classroom through the HVAC system because, again, more particles were entering the HVAC system in the first place. Additionally, and consistent with our prior measurements in a mock-office environment, 21 deposition onto these surfaces showed little relationship with the distance from the breathing simulator, with much higher deposition velocities observed even 8 m away than were observed on passive vertical surfaces less than 2 m from the simulator. 3.4. Deposition to Electronic Surfaces. Electrostatic forces have been found to significantly increase particle deposition in indoor environments, as a strong electric field can be present close to electronic screens, with particles also able to gain a charge via collision with air ions. 67 Furthermore, in the present experiments, we utilized nebulized particles without neutralization (prohibited by the high flow rates of the breathing simulator relative to the flow rates implantable with the Po-210 and Kr-85 ion sources we had at our disposal for charge neutralization). Particles, therefore, were likely charged to some extent from the aerosolization process itself. However, we remark that in spray-based charging, typically the charge distribution spans both polarities and is centered around neutral levels. Hence, charge neutralization with a bipolar charger primarily serves to modestly reduce the standard deviation of the charge distribution, rather than shift the charge distribution. 68 We compared particle deposition to iPads and computer screens powered on and powered off in colocated areas of the classroom to determine the extent to which electrostatics had an influence on experimental results. A summary comparison is shown in Figure 6 , revealing there were no significant differences in deposition velocity between electronic devices powered on or off. We attribute this finding to little changes in the iPad and computer monitor surface charge distributions and electric fields when powered on compared to powered off scenarios, particularly compared to the effects of fluid flow and gravity on particle motion in the classroom environment. This finding can perhaps be generalized to most electronics in a classroom setting; powered systems will not necessarily lead to different levels of particle deposition than non-powered systems. We believe more research will be needed to understand the influence electrostatics may play in indoor air deposition, including not only electronics but also static charge levels on different building materials, and the variation in these charge levels with temperature and relative humidity (i.e., with season and time of day), as powered devices are ubiquitous in modern indoor environments.",

While deposition velocity is important when discussing the potential for indirect transmission, the total aerosol particle concentration can serve as a proxy for the risk of direct inhalation of potentially infectious airborne particles. Total particle concentrations in the classroom for the different conditions are plotted in Figure 7a in the 0.3\u221210 \u03bcm size range. Average concentrations at different classroom locations ranged from \u223c100 to 1100 #/cm 3 . As reviewed in our methodology section, these experimental conditions were completed separately from the deposition conditions, but with the room, HVAC, and PAF unit setup being identical. As expected, higher concentrations were observed at the locations close to the breathing simulator, such as CD5-SIM, CD6, and AP2-6ft-N. However, this trend was not consistent between different conditions. For example, the BL case had a higher concentration at AP-2-6ft-S, which was to the back left of the simulator, while the BL + FanO condition had higher concentrations at CD5 and CD6, which was directly in front of and to the right of the simulator. This suggests that the concentration of aerosol particles throughout the classroom was influenced by the changes in airflow due to PAF unit operation for this experimental setup. We also remark that these concentrations are not background corrected and are hence a combination of breathing simulator generated particles and background aerosol (average background: 20 #/cm 3 ). The BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP conditions had aerosol particle concentrations that trended lower throughout most locations of the classroom relative to the BL and BL + FanO conditions, particularly at distances beyond 2 m from the simulator. The averaged aerosol particle concentration values demonstrated lower peaks and narrower ranges during the BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP conditions, even within the vicinity of the breathing simulator. Overall, the particle concentration with the PAF units operating with both filters and the ESP, the BL + Filters + ESP condition, reduced peak concentrations by a factor of around 2.5 compared to the highest peak concentration, observed during the BL + FanO condition.",

Also plotted is the expected decay curve neglecting deposition but considering the average measured air change rate for the AHU, and the augmentation brought about by the PAF units. Immediately evident is that for the data from both OPS systems, results are in reasonable agreement with theoretical expectations for the BL + Filters + ESP condition, that is, the PAF units led to the anticipated level of particle clearance based upon their CADR values. This is consistent with recent studies of PAF unit influences on aerosol concentration decay, both experimental 44 and numerical. 69 Compared with the BL + Filters + ESP condition, the BL condition did not align as well with the theoretical calculations. This is likely because the BL condition had less mixing due to the lack of airflow introduced by PAF units and is possibly because theoretical predictions do not consider deposition losses. The reduced mixing is particularly true at the beginning of the postdeposition decay following the completion of the 60 min deposition trial, as the source effect from the breathing simulator would still be quite strong even though the simulator was shut down. This fact is evident when examining the last few points of the post-deposition decay, as the alignment appears better, which coincides with when the source effect from the breathing simulator would have been lower.",

When considering that viable SARS-CoV-2 is detectable on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for >72 h 27 and that viral shedding of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 has been noted for greater than a week after initial infection in individuals with COVID-19, 70, 71 it follows that studying engineering control measures that can be taken to lessen indirect exposure risk and additional viral load is important. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, within their Hierarchy of Controls, 72 notes that engineering controls are one of the ways in which individuals can be isolated from a hazard in the environment. Therefore, data on how a scalable engineering control, such as PAF units, can limit deposition of particles to surfaces throughout a room is valuable as reduced deposition could assist in limiting accumulated viral load via an indirect aerosol transmission route. This is particularly important given that controlling the frequency with which individuals touch vulnerable tissues (e.g., mouth, nose, and eyes) after touching potentially virus-contaminated surfaces (i.e., fomites) is challenging. 73, 74 From measurements, passive horizontal upward-facing surfaces have much higher deposition velocities than vertical passive surfaces (by more than 2 orders of magnitude in some circumstances). Therefore, in terms of mitigating indirect transmission, it is these surfaces that are of concern. We do find that PAF operation with control technology implemented (i.e., the BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP conditions) led to reduced deposition velocities on passive horizontal upward-facing surfaces. Figure 8 shows the mean deposition velocities of passive horizontal upward-facing surfaces for each condition at distances beyond 2.5 m from the breathing simulator. We specifically looked at these distances because they are beyond any current physical distancing recommendation distance 75 and because in our prior research, we found only a weak variation in deposition velocities with a distance beyond 2.5 m. 21 Specifically, relative to the BL condition, deposition velocities for the BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP conditions were reduced by approximately one-third, a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.01 vs BL and BL + FanO conditions). Mechanistically, this is not surprising, as PAF units presumably lead to the collection of particles within them, which is a clearance mechanism not possible in their absence. Also notable in terms of developing aerosol clearance procedures, we ran the BL + FanO case as a positive control to examine how moving air around in the classroom impacted particle deposition. The deposition velocity of the BL + FanO condition was slightly increased compared with the BL condition, which confirmed the particle removal effect of the filters within PAF units and that simply increasing the air movement within the classroom would not result in the same changes in deposition velocity as observed during the BL + FiltersO or BL + Filters + ESP conditions. Figure 9 shows the deposition flux in the core region of the classroom for each condition. Notably, the scales of these heat maps are not the same, as the peak deposition fluxes of the four conditions differed. That said, BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP cases share the same scale and BL and BL + FanO share the ",

Values for \u03b7 higher than 1 indicate higher effectiveness at aerosol particle removal versus the BL condition. Box-and-whisker plots resulting from concentration measurements are also shown in Figure 11 . Compared to the BL condition, we observed lower particle concentrations throughout the whole classroom for the BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP conditions (Figure 11 ; see also Figure 7 ). However, the measured influence on steady particle concentration is more subtle than the measurements of deposition velocity. Greater effectiveness did coincide with the location of the PAF units in relation to the areas of greatest airborne particle accumulation. For example, during the BL + FiltersO condition, three zones of greater particle removal relative to the baseline were observed in the top left, bottom left, and middle right (i.e., the three locations where the filtered air exhausted from the top of the PAF unit and spread out from the unit as it made contact with the ceiling). For the BL + Filters + ESP condition, we only observed two zones of greater particle removal versus BL, middle right and bottom left. The differences in observations may have been due to the non-uniform distribution of the particles. The two PAF units in the middle right (AP2) and bottom left (AP1) of the classroom happened to be placed closer to the area around the breathing simulator, where more particles accumulated. This makes sense as there were more particles in need of removal in those locations and, thus, a greater opportunity for more of an effect to be observed for particle removal. The effect of background particles brought in by the HVAC system also presumably affected the results, as the breathing simulator is a single point of particles. For this reason, we did not see large differences in steady particle concentrations for each of the four measurement conditions. This supports the continued use of CADR or decay-type tests to examine the efficacy of PAF units, while principle steady-tests can yield the same information on CADR difference may be more difficult to discern in such tests. 4.3. Size of the Suspended Particles. To ensure that the results were due to the deposition of microparticles (and not Figure 10 .

All comparisons are relative to the BL condition and account for the spatial variations in the BL condition.

The mean particle size was uniform (\u223c0.8\u22121.2 \u03bcm) throughout the classroom. Even for locations close to the breathing simulator, we did not see significantly larger particle sizes compared to the locations. This was intentional; we mixed the glycerol with water (and then spiked with fluorescein) to control the residue particle size and, given glycerol's low vapor pressure, the particle size was able to remain relatively uniform even after evaporation. Notably, while slightly larger particle sizes were observed for the BL + Filters + ESP condition at most locations, this was likely due to higher RH (Table 1 ) during that condition of which presumably reduced evaporation.",

The larger distribution of deposition throughout the rest of the classroom was lower and more uniform when PAF units supplemented the HVAC system versus the HVAC system alone (i.e., the BL condition). Compared with deposition onto passive vertical surfaces, deposition onto passive horizontal upward-facing surfaces was 1\u22122 orders of magnitude higher because of the effect of gravity on particle behavior (even for microparticles). Deposition onto electronic screens and monitors did not show significant differences when paired groupings of electronic devices in the same location were powered on and off nor did deposition to these surfaces appear different than that to passive horizontal upward-facing surfaces and passive vertical surfaces. These observations are likely due to the weak electrostatic field generated by the screens of these electronic devices. Deposition onto active horizontal downward-facing surfaces (diffusers and return grilles) provided evidence suggestive of how the PAF units during the BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP were filtering and recirculating clean air back into the space compared to the BL and BL + FanO conditions, as the latter two conditions typically had higher deposition to diffusers and return grilles. \u2022 Compared with the BL condition, the BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP conditions were observed to have deposition velocities approximately one-third lower outside of 2 m from the infectious source.

Concentrations at different heights, especially standing breathing height, may provide more insight as to the dispersion of aerosol particles. (2) While particle deposition and concentration data were collected at many different locations throughout the classroom, particle lifetime is not directly measured via the methodology employed. This is notable as the lifetime of deposited or suspended particles will determine the viability of the attached virus. (3) Although the classroom's environmental conditions were maintained at the same setpoints throughout the whole study, the operational mode of the HVAC system changed with the weather conditions (heating vs cooling). It caused some inconsistency in the background ACS ES&T Engineering pubs.acs.org/estengg Article airflow field. However, this would be expected in a real-world classroom as the seasons change. (4) We did not investigate masking. This was an a priori choice given the high number of studies that have been completed on mask effectiveness. 76 (5) We did not investigate the presence of other occupants within the classroom. This decision was also made a priori to concentrate fully on the impact of PAF units on localized and whole-room deposition and concentration within the classroom. Occupants would augment the airflow and, thus, the mixing of air in the classroom due to movement and thermal plume generation (creating potential thermal stratification), with increased surface area also contributed by the occupant presence of which is particularly relevant to our deposition measurements. These occupant-induced effects would alter the performance of PAF units to some extent. (6) The observations described here were completed using predefined conditions tested in a single room configuration, which represented the ideal setup per COVID-19 physical distancing recommendations (2 m spacing). Thus, care must be taken when generalizing our observations. (7) The airflow field pattern in the studied classroom was not directly quantified or measured in this study. A detailed assessment would have assisted in helping us verify the explanations. Importantly, we sought to indirectly analyze the airflow field pattern by measuring the spatial aerosol distribution in the absence of more direct measurements. (8) The results and conclusions are drawn from experimental conditions that did not undergo replication due to time constraints and the long duration of each condition (\u223c30 h for each experimental condition). Although extreme caution was applied when conducting each experimental condition, with some conditions repeated when data collection did not go as planned due to environmental condition fluctuation (e.g., excessive humidity), the lack of replication warrants caution when interpreting our observations. 5.1.

The red dot represents the breathing simulator sitting in the third row, middle seat, with blue boxes representing the location of the PAF units. During all conditions, an area of increased deposition was observed (yellow area) in the \u223c1\u22122 m radius around the breathing simulator, offering some support for the CDC's physical distancing guidelines.75 Outside this zone of higher deposition, deposition flux decreased quickly and was largely uniform in value throughout the rest of the classroom. During the BL + FiltersO and BL + Filters + ESP conditions, higher deposition fluxes were observed on the desk immediately in front of the simulator, CD5-SIM, compared to the BL and BL + FanO conditions. This may have been due to the changes in the airflow within the classroom caused by PAF unit operation. Indeed, without the PAF units, we observed that most of the exhaled air from the breathing simulator was blown to the right side of the classroom by local airflow but with the PAF units, the clean recirculated air from the units might have created a stronger zone of stagnant air in front of the simulator. Although the BL + FanO condition altered airflow when running the PAF unit without filters (i.e., fan only), the airflow was stronger without the filters installed (see Section 1 of Supporting Information on the supply airflow rate of the PAF unit with and without filters) and may have pushed the zone of stagnant air farther from the desk immediately in front of the breathing simulator.4.2.
