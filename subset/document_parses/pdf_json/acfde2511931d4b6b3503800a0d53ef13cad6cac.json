In recent years, the prevalence of cigarette smoking has decreased among US youth and adults [3, 4] . However, this decline has been juxtaposed with an uptick in electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use, especially among youth [3] . E-cigarettes are devices that deliver nicotine, flavors, and other additives through inhaling vaporized aerosols [1] . The tobacco product landscape is ever evolving, and e-cigarettes today come in many forms, such as traditional disposable devices, tank devices, and pod systems/pod mods [1] . With e-cigarettes and other products, youth are often the target of marketing and advertising by the tobacco industry to cement tobacco use behaviors early and establish the potential for lifetime tobacco purchasing [5] . Thus, it is imperative to better understand the reasons influencing youth decisions to try and continue using these products.",

That same year, the prevalence of cigarette use among youth was 3.3%, slightly lower than the prevalence of cigar use (3.5%) and higher than the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use (2.3%) [6] .

Temptation to smoke among youth refers to the willingness or susceptibility to use tobacco products in particular situations [9] . This construct can be used to identify youth who are susceptible to initiating tobacco product use [9] . Factors, such as the social environment and negative affect, may tempt youth into trying or continuing to use tobacco products [10] [11] [12] . For example, family and friend smoking is associated with tobacco use among youth, and social context, such as the number of friends who smoke and views on tobacco's acceptability, is a substantial component to understanding tobacco use behaviors [13] [14] [15] . In addition, internalizing problems and psychological distress are linked to tobacco initiation and use, with recent empirical evidence establishing a relationship between these factors and e-cigarette use [11, 12, 16] . Although studies on temptation to use e-cigarettes are limited, the relationship between being tempted to use tobacco and tobacco use shown in other studies is likely similar [17] [18] [19] .",

For example, while past-30-day e-cigarette use prevalence in 2020 was similar between male and female youth, the prevalence was substantially higher among White youth (15.5%) than Black youth (6.2%) [6] . In addition, although Black youth have relatively low overall prevalence of tobacco product use, they have the highest prevalence of individual cigar use [6] . Thus, not only is it important to understand determinants of tobacco use, but also how tobacco product use patterns differ by group (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity). Further, tobacco use disparities exist by socioeconomic status and rurality in the United States [20, 21] . The 13-state Appalachian region, which ranks high in both poverty and tobacco use, contains disproportionately affected populations of youth who may be differentially exposed to tobacco products [22] . Increased exposure to tobacco products and use may be driven by rural lifestyle, community acceptance of tobacco, and familial involvement in the tobacco trade [22] . Thus, it is not surprising that the prevalence of tobacco product use in the Appalachian region exceeds the national average (20% vs. 16%, respectively) [23] . For example, one study found that smoking remains a significant issue among adults in Central Appalachia, despite substantial declines in smoking rates throughout other US regions during the past decade [24] . These findings also have implications for Appalachian youth as household tobacco use has been linked to tobacco and polytobacco use in this population [25] .",

One goal is to investigate temptation to try e-cigarettes among youth who have not tried e-cigarettes to shed light on groups potentially at risk for initiation. Another goal is to explore temptation patterns among e-cigarette users to better understand users who may be prone to continued use, including experimenting with additional electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).",

Within each state, we identified Appalachian counties with poverty levels that exceed the national average and their state's average. From the identified counties, public schools were randomly selected. If a school declined, another was invited to participate. Students in participating schools completed a questionnaire that took approximately 45 min. The questionnaire was distributed during the regular school day and included questions about tobacco use behaviors, tobacco-related perceptions and attitudes, and sociodemographic characteristics. Parental consent and student assent were obtained before data collection. Details on YATS can be found elsewhere [26] .

The first ten situations were derived from the validated Situational Temptations Inventory for Smoking, which is highly reliable [9, 27] . The situations in this inventory contain measures on positive social and negative affect situations, habit strength, and weight control [9] . Although the inventory is often used in smoking cessation programs to prevent smoking relapse [9, 19] , it can be used to identify patterns of initiation and continued use among younger populations. YATS included situations 11 and 12 to add social situations relevant to peer influence and tobacco use. For the twelve situations, response options ranged from 1) \"not tempted at all\" to 5) \"extremely tempted.\" An e-cigarette use temptation scale was created by summing the twelve situation scores (range: 12-60), with a score of 12 indicating youth who responded \"not tempted at all\" to each situation, and a score of 60 indicating youth who responded \"extremely tempted\" to each situation. Distributions and means of each e-cigarette temptation situation and the e-cigarette use temptation scale are presented in Supplementary Table S1 . A Cronbach's alpha was calculated to test the internal reliability of the twelve situations among the entire sample, with a value of 0.96 indicating excellent reliability (see Supplementary Table S2 ).",

Frequencies and means of the e-cigarette use temptation scale were calculated by each participant characteristic overall and by tobacco use status. Within-group differences were estimated using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for binary sociodemographic characteristics and Kruskal-Wallis tests for nominal sociodemographic characteristics overall and within each tobacco use group. To estimate the effect of tobacco use status on temptation to try e-cigarettes, a factorial ANOVA was used, adjusting for gender, race/ethnicity, school type, state, and household tobacco users. This model included five two-way interaction terms between tobacco use status and each covariate (Supplementary Table S3 ). Each interaction term was evaluated for its statistical significance using Wald tests and alpha levels of 0.05. Factors that approached or were statistically significant were retained in a parsimonious factorial ANOVA, excluding each two-way interaction between tobacco use status and school type, state, and household tobacco users, respectively. For each remaining interaction term, average marginal effects (adjusted group means) and associated 95% confidence intervals were plotted to display the relationship between tobacco use status and temptation to try e-cigarettes by gender and race/ethnicity, respectively, using the margins command in Stata. Data were analyzed using Stata 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Table 1 presents the distribution of sociodemographic characteristics by tobacco use status. Of the sample, approximately half were male (51.1%), the majority were White (88.6%), the mean age was 13.8 (SD: 1.9), over half were in middle school (59.9%), the majority lived in North Carolina (45.5%) or Kentucky (34.7%), and over half (57.1%) had at least one household tobacco user. Approximately two-thirds (65.4%) were never users, and 10.5% and 24.1% were non-e-cigarette and e-cigarette users, respectively. Tobacco use status differed by all sociodemographic characteristics except race/ethnicity. Notably, never users and e-cigarette users significantly differed in age (p < 0.001), school type (p < 0.001), state (p < 0.001), and household tobacco users (p < 0.001). Similar associations were found comparing never users and non-e-cigarette users, with an additional statistically significant finding by gender (p = 0.017).

Although the racial/ethnic minority category is heterogeneous, these findings indicate that Appalachian youth from racial/ethnic minorities who use cigarettes or smokeless tobacco may be at higher risk for trying e-cigarettes than their White counterparts, putting them at elevated risk for additional nicotine consumption and possible health consequences [31, 32] . The statistical interaction between tobacco use status and gender shows that female never users have lower temptation to try e-cigarettes than male never users, yet female e-cigarette users have higher temptation to try e-cigarettes than male e-cigarette users. Thus, among these youth, temptations vary by use status and gender; however, variation in tobacco product use by sociodemographic groups (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity) warrants further investigation to better understand potential influences on initiation or continued use [3, 6, 25] , and our results emphasize the complexity by which these relationships occur.",

Second, 18.2% of participants had missing data on the exposure, outcome, or covariates, which may have influenced the results. In addition, the sample size of minority youth non-e-cigarette users may have precluded detecting meaningful interactions due to a lack of statistical power. Third, the findings may not be generalizable across Appalachia given that our study focused on three states. Fourth, our findings may be more clear-cut for never and non-e-cigarette users than e-cigarettes users, as the latter group had tried e-cigarettes. That is, temptation to try e-cigarettes among never and non-e-cigarette users may identify subsets of users who are more at risk for trying these products. However, we assume that e-cigarette users who are tempted to use e-cigarettes are more susceptible to continued use or trying various ENDS, but additional research is needed to better understand the mechanisms behind temptation to continue or expand use. Moreover, during the data collection period, changes in perceptions or use behavior may have occurred and not be fully reflected in the findings. Additionally, study findings do not reflect changes since our data collection, such as shifts potentially influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, this study is among the first to examine the relationship between tobacco use status and temptation to try e-cigarettes in a sample of Appalachian youth.",

Importantly, our results suggest that non-e-cigarette users from racial/ethnic minority groups may find themselves in situations that tempt them to try e-cigarettes more than their White counterparts. Tailored tobacco prevention efforts for groups at-risk of initiating or continuing e-cigarette use, such as Appalachian youth, are especially important. Refinements to such efforts based on sociodemographics may contribute to overall effectiveness, thus decreasing the likelihood of negative long-term health consequences that come with e-cigarette use.
