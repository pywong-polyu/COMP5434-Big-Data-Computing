Throughout 2020, estimates of COVID-19 vaccination intent in the general adult population ranged from less than half to approximately three-quarters, and pointed to an urgent need to address vaccine confidence. 1 Members of groups affected by systemic racism suffered disproportionate morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] These groups, in particular black individuals, have long suffered gross abuses and injustices in healthcare. Partly as a result, members of marginalised groups have expressed lower intent to receive COVID-19 vaccines. 2 8 9 In December 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccines were authorised for emergency use in the USA and healthcare workers were among the first groups to be offered the vaccines. 10 Recent working papers have highlighted the need to effectively engage local communities in COVID-19 vaccination 11 and to equitably distribute the vaccines. 12 Globally, local healthcare workers are some of the most trusted and influential professionals in individual and family decisions around vaccination. 13 14 Beyond their work roles, healthcare workers are also influential members of the communities in which they live. Vaccine hesitancy is prevalent among healthcare workers globally. 15 The WHO emphasises that targeted discussions and engagement with healthcare providers will be essential to obtaining widespread vaccination confidence, as they will be the first ones expected to get the vaccine and they will be on the front lines facing questions from the public. 16 Here, we examine the demographic, work role and vaccine-related belief factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt among healthcare workers during the initial roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine in a diverse region of New York City heavily impacted by the pandemic.",

We did not ask respondents if they received more than one dose. To measure general vaccine confidence, we used the Vaccine Confidence Index (VCI), which was developed and validated by The Vaccine Confidence Project to measure 'individual perceptions on the safety, importance, effectiveness, and religious compatibility of vaccines'. [17] [18] [19] The following are the three statements: 'Overall, I think vaccines are safe', 'I think vaccines are important for children to have' and 'Overall, I think vaccines are effective'. For computing the VCI as a numerical score, we assigned numerical values to responses to each of the three questions (strongly agree=5, somewhat agree=4, neither agree nor disagree=3, somewhat disagree=2, strongly disagree=1). While there is, as yet, no standardised way of categorising responses, we used existing literature 20 and visual inspection of the data to assign VCI scores less than 9 as low vaccine confidence. We used Brewer et al's 21 model of vaccination behaviour to develop questions that measured perceived COVID-19 disease risk, COVID-19 vaccine benefits and COVID-19 vaccine harms. We included two optional open-ended questions at the end of the survey inviting participants to share their thoughts and suggestions and what resources would help them provide information about COVID-19 with more confidence.",

Lower perceived vaccine harms including safety and being experimented on also predicted vaccine receipt. Higher perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, higher perceived risk of COVID-19 disease and more positive attitudes towards vaccination have been associated with greater intent to vaccinate in the general US population and among healthcare workers worldwide. 1 31 33 39 A similar study among emergency department and emergency medical services (EMS) staff in the USA found higher perceived COVID-19 vulnerability was associated with early vaccine uptake. 26 A prior study investigating COVID-19 beliefs, vaccine intent and race found that beliefs mediate the association of race and vaccine intent. 40 Here, black healthcare workers had lower COVID-19 vaccination rates even after accounting for safety concerns and provaccine beliefs in the multivariable model. Vaccine intent does not always translate to vaccine receipt 21 and this effect may be greater among black healthcare workers. While all healthcare workers in this study had been offered the vaccine in their workplaces, there may have been racial differences in actual access (eg, ability to take time off duty to wait for the vaccine) which our study was not designed to detect.

In our population VCI scores did not correlate with COVID-19 vaccine receipt, but did vary by healthcare worker role. The VCI may not capture attitudes specific to COVID-19 vaccination. 17 A strong physician recommendation in favour of vaccination has been shown to positively influence vaccine decision-making for many immunisations, and COVID-19 appears no different. 43 44 In our study, healthcare workers reported their primary care doctor was the most trusted source for advice on COVID-19 vaccination and this held true across race and vaccine receipt. Similar to other studies in the USA, black participants reported lower levels of trust in government agencies, highlighting the need to build trust and use trusted messengers in communities of colour. 41 42 A study of healthcare workers in Canada also found that COVID-19 vaccine refusers were more likely to mention lack of trust in experts and pharmaceutical companies. 25 Our findings also point to the influence that all healthcare workers can have in discussing COVID-19 vaccination within their social networks. Over 70% of the participants were asked about COVID-19 vaccination multiple times by coworkers, family and community members, adding evidence to support implementation of strategies that leverage healthcare workers as trusted messengers. 45 ",

We did review the differences between these two groups and assessed differences over time (see online supplemental file 9). Additionally, while the COVID-19 vaccines were made available to employees at the time of the survey, many may have had access issues, which our survey was not designed to assess. The 11% of respondents in our survey who reported they planned to get the vaccine but had not scheduled or gone for their vaccine yet may have experienced access issues. We recognise that access plays an important role in vaccine uptake, but to minimise length we did not include these measures in our survey. Future studies should investigate inequities in access to vaccines and to accurate information. Intervention design targeting marginalised groups of healthcare workers and others will need to account for the dynamic interplay between vaccine access and ease of access, respectful service delivery and vaccine behaviours.",
