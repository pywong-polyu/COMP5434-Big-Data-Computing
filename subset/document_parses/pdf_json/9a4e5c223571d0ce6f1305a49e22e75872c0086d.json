Neither transthoracic echocardiography nor any radiological images detected a mass in her heart or pericardium. Elevated plasma troponin level and diffused patchy areas of gadolinium late enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance were compatible with myocarditis. Considering the persistently elevated cytokine level, systemic inflammation symptoms, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac dysfunction, a cytokine storm secondary to NK/T-cell lymphoma was considered. Due to the refractory malignant arrhythmia, the patient died soon after being admitted to our hospital.",

At that time, a laboratory test found increased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (Nt-proBNP: 1,562 pg/ml), high-sensitivity troponin (hsTnT: 149 pg/ml), and DNA load of EBV (1,890 copies/ml). The 12-lead electrocardiography demonstrated low voltage in all leads and ST-segment elevation of 2 mm in inferior wall leads and leads of V4, V5, and V6 (Figure 1) . A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a moderate pericardial effusion, posterior-lateral wall hypokinesis, and normal left ventricular contractility (LVEF = 55%). As acute coronary disease was considered, coronary angiography was performed and revealed normal coronary arteries with no atheromatous finding. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showed global gadolinium late enhancement and diffuse patchy areas of edema in the interventricular septum and lateral wall of the left ventricle (Figure 1 ). Myocarditis was presumptively diagnosed. The patient was prescribed with prednisone at 40 mg qd, but her condition did not improve and even deteriorated. When she was transferred to our hospital, she had severe heart failure (NYHA IV) and could not lay down more than a few minutes; otherwise, she would be out of breath. On admission, she was found to have a fever, several enlarged cervical lymph nodes measuring 0.5 cm, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. Lab tests revealed that NT-proBNP was more than 35,000 pg/ml and that hsTnT was 699 pg/ml. The patient had elevated IL-5 (18.16 pg/ml), IL-6 (18.16 pg/ml), IL-10 (31.10 pg/ml), and IFN\u03b3 (28.46 pg/ml). An echocardiogram showed ventricular wall hypokinesis and moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, LVEF = 43% (additional files). Biopsy of the enlarged cervical lymph nodes was performed, and the histopathology showed atypical T cells with prominent hyperplasia and necrosis and lymph nodes lacking lymphoid follicles with structure destruction. A immunohistochemical study showed that these malignant cells were positive for CD4, CD3\u03b5, CD163, and CD56 (Figure 2) . EBV in situ hybridization was also positive (Figure 2) . These features were compatible with the diagnosis of NKTL. Positron emission tomographycomputed tomography (PET-CT) was not performed as the patient could not lie down. The patient was refractory to pharmaceutical treatment for heart failure, and her condition deteriorated rapidly (7) . She was transferred to the intensive care unit for circulatory and respiratory support and expired 8 days later because of cardiopulmonary failure ( Table 1) .",
