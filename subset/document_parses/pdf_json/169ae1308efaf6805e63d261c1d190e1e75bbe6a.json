            "text": "The magnitude of the problem of poor knowledge of IPC is particularly noticed in an environment where basic infection control measures are usually lacking or non-existent in health facilities. [4] Hospital-acquired infections are among leading causes of death in the US [5] and contribute to the shortage of human resources for health. [4] Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), recognized as the first deadly emerging and transmissible disease by the World Health Organization in the 21 st century, was noted to have easily spread through close hospital contact with infected persons. [6] In fact, as SARS spread, it became obvious that many countries lacked the necessary infrastructure, facilities, equipment and trained personnel to provide appropriate infection control measures. [6] A hospital can provide a favourable transmission environment for the spread of infections; especially in facilities having staff with poor knowledge of IPC. [7] Gaps have been identified in the knowledge and compliance of IPC among healthcare workers by some authors. [8] With the rising rates of tuberculosis, hospital-acquired infections and other emerging and re-emerging diseases like SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19 internationally, it is necessary to take precautions to prevent infectious disease transmission in healthcare settings. The transmission of infections is possible in health facilities providing a wide range of health services (as found in the Primary Health Care (PHC) Centres). Hence, the need to ascertain the level of IPC knowledge among staff, because the determinants and availability of administrative control measures remains a significant step to break the chain of transmission of such infections.",

[9] Several scholars have worked on IPC within different levels of healthcare systems globally, [10e13] and more locally within Nigeria. [14e16] Very few investigated IPC knowledge at PHCs. Most authors agreed that healthcare workers in Nigeria were knowledgeable and compliant with standard precautions, [17] which is just an aspect of IPC. Others still held the view that the practice of IPChad remained very poor in healthcare settings. [18] However, the Ebola outbreak of 2014 could not be easily forgotten as it reawakened the inevitable need to observe IPC strategies, [18] not just amonghealthcare workers but everybody in the West Africa sub-region (including Nigeria). This then underscored the fact that the responsibility of IPC should be that of everybody. Important components of infection control programmes include basic measures for infection control, (i.e. standard and additional precautions); education and training of health care workers; protection of health care workers, (e.g. immunization against some diseases like hepatitis); identification of hazards and minimizing risks; routine practices essential to infection control such as aseptic techniques, use of single-use devices, appropriate reprocessing of instruments and equipment, antibiotic usage, management of blood/body fluid exposure, handling and use of blood and blood products and sound management of medical waste [9] However, infection control comprises four major aspects which include administrative measures, environmental measures, personal protective measures and waste disposal measures [19] .",

            "text": "Overall, 218(72.7%) of these healthcare workers had poor knowledge (i.e < 50% of the knowledge scores) of IPC. Exactly 271(90.3%) did not know that considering the potential for transmission of infectious agents in patients constitutes part of the concept of standard precautions and 285(95.0%) had poor knowledge of the use of puncture-resistant containers as a standard precaution practice, whereas 185(61.7%) had good knowledge that needlestick injuries/sharps could be potential sources of occupational exposure to infections. Considering the moments of handwashing, a majority (60.7%) did not know that hands should be washed before any direct contact with patients, in-between patient contacts (74.7%) and after touching body fluids (81.3%). However, the majority knew that hands should be washed immediately after removing gloves (69.7%). The majority (66.0%) did not also know that standard precautions should be applied for all patients irrespective of the clinical presentation. Two hundred and sixty-eight (89.3%) had poor knowledge of the fact that all blood-tinged body fluids required standard precautions. See Table II . The majority of the healthcare workers (55.0%) considered that hepatitis B infection was an important patient factor in deciding the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and 13.7% of respondents also had good knowledge of indications for when anti-retroviral drugs should be given as Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP). See Table II and III. There is a statistically significant association between years of practice (experience) and overall knowledge (c2 \u00bc8.469, P \u00bc 0.037) but no statistically significant association between having training on IPC and overall knowledge (c2 \u00bc2.533, P \u00bc0.149). The professional occupation and years of practice were found to be determinants of good knowledge. The odds of a nurse having good knowledge of IPC is 2.50 times higher than that of other professional PHC workers (orderlies, ward maids, and laboratory and pharmacy technicians) (AOR 2.5; 95% CI 1.256e4.969) whereas the CHEW/CHO are shown to have odds 2.0 times higher than the odds of other PHC professionals (orderlies, ward maids, and laboratory and pharmacy technicians) in having good knowledge of IPC (AOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.023e3.967). Similarly the odds of respondents that have worked for 10 years having good IPC knowledge were about 3 times higher than the odds of other respondents with >20 years' practice (AOR 2.88; 95% CI 0.73e17.25) and those who had worked for 11e20 years had odds of good IPC knowledge about 2 times higher than that of those with practice more than 20 years (AOR 1.89; 95% CI 0.66e10.63). See Table IV . Concerning the availability and compliance to administrative IPC measures among primary healthcare workers, the majority of them reported not having the following: Infection Prevention and Control Committee (IPCC) (73.3%), IPC focal person (84.0%), signages to aid movement (76.7%), IPC policy (72.3%) and an institutional IPC meeting (71.0%). Of those reporting having IPC meetings, 35.6% said the frequency of their meeting was weekly. A majority also reported nonavailability of the following in their facilities: visible standard operating procedures (75.7%), IPC plan duly signed (78.3%) and IPC plan/checklist in place (76.3%), see Table V .",

Previously published literature acknowledges that healthcare workers have above-average knowledge of standard IPC precautions. [16,24e26] A study in Nigeria documented that the healthcare workers' knowledge of standard IPC precautions was good, [8, 16] but similar to our findings, studies in Enugu, South-East Nigeria, [23] and in Nepal on infection control among PHC workers, showed that 22% and 18% respectively had the correct knowledge of IPC. [13] In contrast, similar studies in Plateau State, Northcentral Nigeria and Egypt revealed fairly high levels of knowledge of IPC amongst PHC workers. [3, 7, 8, 16] Health care workers should be equipped with requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes for good infection control practice. The reason for this dissimilarity could be attributed to the inclusion of doctors in those studies, as they were carried out in tertiary healthcare facilities where IPC structures were better established. Inclusion of doctors (trained academically in infection pathophysiology and pathogen transmission) and other healthcare worker groups could lead to this discrepancy in reported results. Doctors were not included in this study.",

A significant proportion ofrespondents had good knowledge of the fact that needlestick injuries/sharps could be potential sources of occupational exposure to infections.

This could imply a reduced risk of cross-contamination and auto-infection among the workers because hand hygiene had been regarded as the most effective way of infection control and prevention, even though knowledge does not always transmit to good practice. A majority of these healthcare workers did not know that standard precautions should be observed for all the patients. Most of them were ignorant of the fact that all blood-tinged body fluids required standard precautions. This could be very risky as these body fluids were the vehicles of infectious agents and hence not applying standard precautions to them could increase the chances of more occupationally acquired diseases and the spreading of such, might sustain Healthcare Acquired Infections (HAI). Regarding the concept of standard precaution as a component of IPC, a significant proportion had poor knowledge of this concept with exclusion of hand washing where most of them correctly identified hand washing as a component. These findings contrasted a similar study done in Enugu where the authors reported that many of their respondents had good knowledge of these components. [16] This discrepancy could be explained partly by the fact that the study dealt with standard precautions and most of their study respondents were trained in standard precaution which is one of the elements of IPC. More so, in contrast to this observation, was another study done in North-Central Nigeria where a higher proportion of the healthcare workers were noted to exhibit good knowledge of the concept and its components. [27] This could be explained by the fact that the sample size and scope of that study was higher than that of this study. They included both private and public hospitals which invariably had more doctors and nurses that carry out surgical operations and services that were more complex and complicated than that carried out in primary healthcare facilities. Moreover, these study areas being higher in healthcare level also served as referral centres where infection prevention and control knowledge and practice should be higher.",

[18] The implication is the that nurses and CHEWS/ CHOs had more knowledge of IPC. This was understandable because the CHEWs and CHO were largely the staff of PHCs and of course, were more in contact with patients and perhaps with relatively higher risk perception.
