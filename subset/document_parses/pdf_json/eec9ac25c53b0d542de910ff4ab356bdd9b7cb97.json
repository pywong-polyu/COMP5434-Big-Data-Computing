The complex pathophysiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection and their impact on cardiovascular system are rapidly evolving, shedding lights on the role of \"pro-thrombotic state\" in critically ill patients. Indeed, elevation of lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and fibrin degradation products, thrombocythemia and prolonged thrombin time are common findings, suggesting that cytokine storm leads to coagulation cascade activation and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in severe COVID-19 patients. Emerging evidences, coming from small post-mortem studies, seem to support a link between virus infection and thrombotic complications, with pathological evidence of high rate of pulmonary microthrombosis. Moreover, areas of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may be found, as final consequence of coagulation factors depletion and DIC.",

Recently, several observational studies investigated the prevalence of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU (Table 1) . Klok and colleagues analyzed 184 critically ill ICU patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, a selected population at high risk of thrombotic complications [1] . Despite all patients received antithrombotic treatment (at least thromboprophylaxis regimen), they found a remarkable cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications (31%) in this population. Of note, pulmonary embolism was the most common cause (81%), followed by other venous thromboembolic (VTE) and arterial thrombotic events. This high rate of thrombotic complications in severe COVID-19 is of utmost importance, although current recommendations suggest only prophylactic dose of heparin once daily. On the other hand, systemic and multiorgan involvement in advanced phases of COVID-19 pneumonia may lead to renal failure, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders, which increase bleeding hazard.",

To this regard, Padua Prediction Score (PPS), which was developed to predict VTE events in hospitalized medical patients, may be supportive in decision-making process of optimal heparin treatment (conventional prophylaxis doses versus therapeutic regimen) in severe COVID-19 patients. As shown in the Fig. 1 Dealing with lights and shadows of this pandemic and uncertainties regarding optimal anti-thrombotic strategies, a one-size-fits-all strategy cannot be applied in patients admitted to ICU and an individualized approach should guide the complex management of these patients in a fine balance between ischemic and bleeding complications. Thrombotic hazard should be counterbalanced with bleeding risk, especially in advanced stages of COVID-19 disease. Further studies are warranted to develop or validate novel prediction systems, aiming to guide the challenging and fast-evolving management of COVID-19 critically ill patients.",
