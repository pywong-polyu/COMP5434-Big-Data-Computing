            "text": "Arriving at the 1st anniversary of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States provides an opportunity to reflect on what we have learned in the care of geriatric hip fracture patients. [1, 2] To date, over 105 million people worldwide have been infected, and on February 22, 2021, the US surpassed 500,000 deaths due to the virus. [3] Although most cases of orthopaedic trauma declined and stay-at-home orders were instituted almost universally during the pandemic, reports of hip fracture volumes were observed to remain relatively consistent with prepandemic volumes. [4] [5] [6] These observed volume change differences have been attributed to the fact that hip fractures due to low-energy mechanisms occur most frequently in the patients' home. [7, 8] There has been much interest in the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on hip fracture outcomes and delivery of care. As expected, those with COVID-19 infection and hip fracture have been shown to demonstrate worse outcomes than their COVID-19-free peers, primarily seen as increases in 30-day mortality. [9] [10] [11] [12] In addition to impacting 30-day mortality rates, COVID-19 impacted key healthcare delivery metrics known to impact hip fracture outcomes, specifically time to surgery (TTS). Operating room capacity and staffing decreased significantly in many hospitals in response to COVID-19 patient care needs and staff infections. [13] [14] [15] In some reports, the hip fracture management changes during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted mortality and morbidity even in COVID-19-negative patients. [16] However, the evidence is conflicting, and research analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic impact on hip fracture patient care in the US is still lacking.",

[18] The World Health Organization officially recognized COVID-19 as an international emergency on March 11, 2020. [19] Subsequently, on March 13, 2020, Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz declared a peacetime emergency to prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota. [20] We defined 3 phases of the healthcare system response to the pandemic: prepeacetime emergency, acute phase of the state of emergency, and subacute phase of the state of emergency. Prepeacetime emergency (Period A, January 7 to March 12, 2020) was defined as the 8 weeks preceding March 13. The acute phase (Period B, March 13 to May 7, 2020) was defined as 8 weeks after the peacetime emergency declaration and was characterized by new protocol development and rapidly evolving practices during the early stages of the crisis. The subacute phase (Period C, May 8 to July 2, 2020) was defined as 8 weeks after the acute phase and represented a timeframe with less frequent changes in practice and protocols at the trauma center.",

Slullitel et al [35] reported an increase in mortality concomitant with patients who were frailer at baseline. [35] Other authors reported no difference in mortality rates suggesting that their hospitals adapted rapidly to new algorithms and continued delivering protocolized hip fracture care despite the pandemic. [6] TTS is an important marker of geriatric hip fracture care. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors have found a significant increase in morbidity and mortality when TTS was greater than 24 hours. [37] Our mean TTS was 20.0 hours (SD 14.3). Although fluctuation did occur, the TTS was within 24 hours even in Period B and Period C. Within the global literature, TTS during the pandemic varied with some authors reporting faster, [13] slower, [12, 33] and equivalent times [6, 9, 10, 34, 35] to surgical fixation (Table 4 ). In the presented report, our level 1 trauma center preserved capacity to provide timely access to OR for hip fracture patients notwithstanding protocol changes that included the reduction of operating rooms for orthopaedic trauma from 4 ORs to 1. However, the number of orthopaedic providers remained constant during the pandemic response.",

            "text": "In other US reports, Egol et al [9] reported no difference in TTS for all hip fracture patients (mean = 33.6 hours) but increased TTS in their COVID-19-positive hip fracture patients (64.8 hours) as compared with COVID-19 negative (26.4 hours). The authors have posited that medical optimization of COVID-19 patients and the lack of familiarity with the evolving COVID-19 protocols caused delays. [9, 32] Previous authors have noted decreases in community trauma, besides hip fractures, during the pandemic which was also true at our trauma center. This likely contributed to our center's ability to adapt to new protocols successfully while maintaining timely surgical fixation for geriatric hip fracture patients. [25] Length of stay (LOS) of hip fracture patients is another important indicator of hip fracture care. The length of stay varied widely around the world during the pandemic. Some studies report an increased LOS during the COVID-19 pandemic, [18, 35] while others found a decreased LOS, [10, 24] or no significant difference between periods. [9, 33] We attribute these wide-ranging results to differing hospital-by-hospital protocols and workload effects of the pandemic. Some authors attribute decreased LOS during the pandemic to an emphasis on rapid discharge, helping to prevent patients from acquiring COVID-19 infection, along with increased staff availability due to decreases in other forms of orthopaedic trauma. [10, 35] Additionally, some healthcare systems received additional funding from the government to aid in expediting discharges to free up acute care beds. [35] On the other hand, other hospitals may have had more staffing shortages (possibly due to staff COVID-19 infections or redistribution of staff) that prevented prioritizing timely discharge of hip fracture patients.",

[9] Our hospital in Minnesota was not as severely overwhelmed as hospitals in New York City during the same time period and indeed our state experienced peak COVID-19 case numbers and admissions in the fall of 2020. [38] Although the spring of 2020 does not correlate with peak case volumes in Minnesota, our system still underwent a large policy shift in response to the Governor's peacetime emergency declaration that significantly affected how we delivered care, including trauma patient care. Our study is focused on analyzing the effects of policy changes on hip fracture outcomes during the pandemic. A future direction for our study group may be to compare hip fracture metrics during our state's pandemic surge period (fall of 2020) to that of other authors during their state or country's own surge period without focusing on specific dates.",
