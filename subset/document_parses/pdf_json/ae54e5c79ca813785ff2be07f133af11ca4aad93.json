This infection was often found to cause a severe multi-system illness with increased severity particularly in older adults, and those with comorbidities including obesity.(1) As of 11th September 2020, COVID-19 was estimated to have infected over 28 million people and caused over 914,000 deaths.(2) Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been recognised as significant risk factors for adverse outcomes and associated mortality from COVID-19. (3, 4) On the other hand, glucose-lowering medications commonly prescribed in diabetes are also known to have modulatory effects on inflammation. (5) The potential impact of these therapeutic agents on susceptibility to COVID-19 is therefore of significant clinical and public health interest. (6, 7) A number of retrospective cohort and observational studies have suggested that concomitant use of metformin is associated with beneficial clinical outcome in respiratory diseases including tuberculosis (8) , COPD (9) , pneumonia (10) , and asthma (11) . Furthermore, metanalysis suggests pre-admission use of metformin improves septic shock outcomes in patients with diabetes.(12) Metformin has been associated with a reduction in CVD in a subgroup of patients with obesity and is the recommended first line therapy in type 2 diabetes.(13) There is therefore an urgent need to clarify whether metformin influences susceptibility to COVID-19. Two recent meta-analyses of observational studies have suggested reduced mortality from COVID-19 in patients taking metformin.(14, 15) These studies only included patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19, and do not address the important public health question of susceptibility in the general population. Just one in five patients with COVID-19 are admitted to hospital, therefore studies in these settings are not well placed to assess susceptibility in the community.(16) Furthermore, there was limited adjustment for confounders in some of these studies and the source populations in some studies included patients without diabetes.(14, 15) Only two papers included any propensity score matching to mitigate the effect of prescription by indication bias.(17, 18) None of the studies considered unobserved confounders.",

The results of previous relevant studies and our study on the association between metformin use and COVID-19 related mortality have been shown in Figure 3 .(4, 7, 17, 18, 37-40)",

Only an extremely small proportion of patients would receive their care through the private sector, therefore would not have a significant impact on the generalizability of our results. Recording of medication prescriptions is known to be very reliable in this primary care dataset with very few patients not accessing them via their NHS GP. However, it is possible that patients are not compliant with their medication. The event rate for some outcomes, such as confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths, was relatively low, limiting statistical power to detect small effects in these outcomes. Although the groups were well matched for multiple factors that could affect the outcome, there remained some imbalance with respect to eGFR/chronic kidney disease status, which is known to impact COVID-19 outcomes;(34) however, eGFR was adjusted for in the regression models.
