            "text": "Purpose: With the widespread prevalence of Corona Virus Disease 2019 , cancer patients are suggested to wear a surgical mask during radiation treatment. In this study, cone beam CT (CBCT) was used to investigate the effect of surgical mask on setup errors in head and neck radiotherapy. Methods: A total of 91 patients with head and neck tumors were selected. CBCT was performed to localize target volume after patient set up. The images obtained by CBCT before treatment were automatically registered with CT images and manually fine-tuned. The setup errors of patients in 6 directions of Vrt, Lng, Lat, Pitch, Roll and Rotation were recorded. The patients were divided into groups according to whether they wore the surgical mask, the type of immobilization mask used and the location of the isocenter. The setup errors of patients were calculated. A t-test was performed to detect whether it was statistically significant. Results: In the 4 groups, the standard deviation in the directions of Lng and Pitch of the with surgical mask group were all higher than that in the without surgical mask group. In the head-neck-shoulder mask group, the mean in the Lng direction of the with surgical mask group was larger than that of the without surgical mask group. In the lateral isocenter group, the mean in the Lng and Pitch directions of the with surgical mask group were larger than that of the without surgical mask group. The t-test results showed that there was significant difference in the setup error between the 2 groups (p \u00bc 0.043 and p \u00bc 0.013, respectively) only in the Lng and Pitch directions of the head-neck-shoulder mask group. In addition, the setup error of 6 patients with immobilization open masks exhibited no distinguished difference from that of the patients with regular immobilization masks. Conclusion: In the head and neck radiotherapy patients, the setup error was affected by wearing surgical mask. It is recommended that the immobilization open mask should be used when the patient cannot finish the whole treatment with a surgical mask.",

            "text": "Head and neck cancers account for 9 of the world's 36 most common cancers, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal, lip, oral cavity, brain metastases, and throat cancers predominating et al. About 70% of head and neck tumors are advanced tumors. 1, 2 Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for malignant tumors. 3 With the continuous development of radiotherapy technology, the accuracy of radiotherapy continues to improve. However, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 affected the process of radiotherapy for patients. The COVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets, and normal people are exposed to infectious droplets when they are in close contact with infected people. Exposure to surfaces in the environment surrounding an infected person may also cause the disease. 4 Van Doremalen et al. 5 described that viral aerosols can persist in the air for up to 3 to 4 hours under laboratory conditions. The virus strains had mutated over time and spread in different regions, with one strain becoming more infectious, as described by Tang et al. 6 The surgical mask is divided into 3 layers: water blocking layer, filtering layer and water absorbing layer, with particulate filterability, waterproof and anti-spray properties. The results of the Mata analysis by Chinazzi et al. 7 showed that both N95 respirators and surgical masks can be used to prevent infectious acute respiratory tract infection and prevent the spread of droplets. Wearing masks was also a key factor in the containment of the Wuhan epidemic, and it greatly reduced the spread of disease. 8, 9 Also asymptomatic infected people and those in the incubation period still have a certain risk of spreading the disease. Therefore, facial masking is an inevitable choice. 10 The COVID-19 is generally very contagious, while cancer patients and obese people are more susceptible to infection. 11 Data from Liang et al. 12 show that cancer patients infected with COVID-19 have a higher risk of developing severe disease and worsen more rapidly than non-cancer patients. Cancer patients are physically weak, especially those who are receiving treatment such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which may lead to reduced resistance to disease and higher risk of infection. In addition, radiotherapy treatment takes place in a confined space, which increases the risk of contracting the virus. 13 In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, the transmission mechanism of the virus has not yet been studied and there is no conclusion to date. Therefore, cancer patients during radiotherapy should wear a surgical mask to prevent infection between patients and alleviate their fear of the virus. In addition, it is a precaution to protect radiation therapists from droplet transmission.",

The Hubei Cancer Hospital, which was the first in Wuhan to start radiation treatment during the outbreak and the epicenter of the outbreak hospital in Wuhan, has the largest number of radiotherapy patients (the average daily radiotherapy patients exceeded 200 in April). In order to prevent infection, all staff and patients in our clinic wear masks. In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, in most clinics around the world, the radiotherapy staff were not equipped with full personal protective equipment (PPE) when treating patients. Even until now, not every clinic requires patients to wear surgical masks or has enough resource to fully protect its staff. This paper explores whether the surgical mask worn by patients in the course of radiotherapy has an effect on the setup error, so as to provide reference for other clinics, especially those who treat head and neck patients without daily CBCT. Our study also provides some experiences on general patient masking practice.",

Some patients had to breathe through mouth when wearing a surgical mask, which could affect the Pitch and the Lng positioning. However, for the patients with open masks, there is no distinguished different from the error of regular masks. Comparing to regular mask, the intrafraction random and systemic error were less than 1 mm and less than 1 for open masks in head and neck tumors, 17 suggesting that open masks can be used if the patient cannot breathe through nose to the end of treatment.",

Therefore, patients generally will only get CBCT scans in the first 3 treatments and once a week in the later treatments. Other possible contribution factors to setup error including respiratory issues and pre-existing comorbidities were not taken into account because patients who have severe respiratory issues or pre-existing comorbidities were not recommended for radiotherapy, therefore not included in this study.
