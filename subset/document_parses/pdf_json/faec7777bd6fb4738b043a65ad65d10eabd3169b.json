            "text": "Previous studies confirmed the effectiveness of slit lamp shield use in reducing aerosol transmission; however, the use of a slit lamp is a technical skill that requires fine adjustments, and therefore ease of access to the controls is essential. While larger shields are more likely to provide better protection, they could also cause difficulty for the examiner to access his or her patient and slit lamp parts during an examination, therefore it could impede effective examination. Alternatively, small shields may enable ease of control but may not offer enough protection. Aerosol spread is usually detected using droplet imaging systems or light scattering technology. Droplet imaging uses fluorescein and photographic imaging under ultraviolet light to trace aerosol droplets 12 ; although inexpensive, this methodology does not enable quantitative analysis of the data and therefore cannot be used to show a statistically significant difference between different types of slit lamp shields. Alternatively, the light scattering method enables statistical comparison; however, it usually entails the use of expensive and bulky aerosol detectors that may be difficult to use in slit lamp settings. 13 In our study, we used two custombuilt aerosol detectors to detect inhaled aerosols at examiners face position and precipitated aerosols on slit lamp table. We investigated the optimal size and design of a slit lamp shield that could provide the best protection against both inhaled and precipitated aerosol. 13, 14 Our results show that the use of slit lamp shields is effective at reducing the aerosol spread and that increasing the size of the shields increases their efficacy. Out of the 5 different sizes of slit lamp shields, shield 1 was the largest and the most effective. Such results are expected as a larger shield would provide larger screens against which aerosol particle would bounce back. But equally a larger shield would add more restrictions in reaching the patient and slit lamp joystick. Khadia et al. 15 attempted to partly overcome the restrictions in reaching patients imposed by the use of large barriers by creating holes in the bottom of the shield to allow room for the examiner's hands.",

            "text": "In our study, we aimed to increase the efficacy of slit lamp shields without adding further restriction to accessibility by bending the shields around plastic frames with a 20 cm arc and creating curved shields to reduce their overall width. The results showed that curving the shields not only improves accessibility but also provides better overall protection. Figure 2 illustrates that flat shield 1 requires the examiner to bend an arm around the width of the shield to access the joystick. However, by curving shield 1, the need for this is significantly reduced, and the examiner is not stretching to reach the controls. The values in Table 3 show that curving the shields does not only improve accessibility but also provide better protection. It is logical to think that a shield with greater height and width, and therefore a greater surface area, would provide better protection against both inhaled and precipitated aerosol. This effect can be seen when comparing data from sensor 1 for both curved and flat shields 1 and 2. However, data from sensor 2 shows that flat shield 2, despite of its shorter height compared to flat shield 1, provided greater protection against the precipitated aerosol spread (P < 0.05). This may be explained by a mechanism of droplets deflecting off the shield and further studies into the differences of this phenomenon between flat and curved shields are required. Similarly, curved shield 5, despite its shorter height compared to all other shields, provided the best protection against both inhaled and precipitated aerosol. This is possibly due to the fact that the slit lamp parts that fall between the patient and the examiner change the aerodynamics of aerosol travel, and minimize the advantages of shields with larger heights. Therefore we can propose that curved shields with large width but smaller heights similar to shield 5 in set 2 of our experiment has benefits for both ease of use for the examiner and protection from aerosol.",

Similarly, the design of the sensor 1 was chosen to simulate the mechanism on inhalation in the human body. However, we cannot accurately replicate all factors that influence the biomechanics of inhalation. Nonetheless, we believe that the gross result of manipulating shield size and design on aerosol reduction is a valuable outcome from this study.",
