We detail various components of the audio processing workflow (Figure 1 ), beginning with a description of the considerations and tools for collecting and processing clinical audio data. We then present an overview of statistical, traditional machine learning, 11 and deep learning 13 methods that have been leveraged for the analysis of clinical audio for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.

Given the rapid developments in clinical audio processing, we focused on research published after 2010 to emphasize the most recent trends in this field. Furthermore, studies that involved analyses of text generated from speech were included only if they were done in conjunction with an analysis of the native audio. For details of studies from before 2010 and/or focusing on clinical speech, we recommend other excellent reviews. 1, [3] [4] [5] 9 The PRISMA flow chart in Figure 2 details the search results and inclusion/exclusion selection criteria. From the initial 1812 records retrieved from the databases, 561 duplicates were automatically removed, and a further 880 were removed after manual screening of titles and abstracts based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, leaving 371 in-scope articles. Studies were included if they explicitly used audio or audio-derived features as clinical biomarkers or were reviews of relevant clinical uses of audio signals; studies that did not use audio signals or used them only for obtaining textual transcription, as well as those that considered ultrasound or echocardiogram only for imaging, were excluded. Among these in-scope articles, this review discusses the 69 most recent and least redundant representative papers on clinical audio processing.

The choice of recording device and its placement relative to the participant may significantly affect data quality. 15 However, few studies have reported on optimal microphone placement configurations. Some studies suggested using wearable microphones, such as lavaliers, since they are less susceptible to changes in proximity, orientation and posture of the person being recorded. 5 Other technical factors that can also affect the quality of the recording include the range of frequencies that a microphone can capture. For speech, the recommended upper limit of this range is at least 10 kilohertz (kHz). 15, 16 The choice of sample rate (number of times a data point is recorded per second) and bit depth (number of binary digits used to represent each point) can also affect audio quality. Modern systems generally record at a sample rate of 44.1 kHz and a bit depth of 16 or 24, although some applications require a lower sample rate to improve computational efficiency. 15 Pre-processing audio data Denoising is the most basic pre-processing of audio data. 17 While there are sophisticated solutions to this problem, 18 it is often sufficient to filter out frequencies below 60 Hz, which removes most of the noise induced by common electronic devices. 15 Normalization is the process of making audio signals from multiple sources, e.g., patients, compatible with each other. 16 A popular normalization method is min-max scaling, which linearly scales all data from a single source to a given range, typically 0 to 1. [19] [20] [21] Normalization can be performed on the raw audio signal, or more commonly, on features derived from it (next subsection).",

Other studies used statistical tests like Mann-Whitney U to evaluate the association of pitch features ( Table 2 ) with neuropsychiatric conditions.

One study used multiple SVM models to identify a motor speech disorder by determining the severity of unintelligible speech. 35 A sentence-level SVM trained on energy features and a phoneme-level SVM trained on pitch and time features yielded accuracies of 79.8% and 77.3% respectively. This accuracy increased to 84.8% when the SVMs were combined, an approach known as ensemble learning. 11 Other studies have found success in similar tasks using other traditional ML algorithms like RF and kNN. 37, 38 Several approaches also combined audio features with linguistic characteristics derived from textual transcripts of the audio. 32,36,38,39 One study performed 3-way classification of levels of cognitive impairment (control, mild, and early stage Alzhiemer's disease) using an SVM trained on acoustic features derived using Praat 26 and an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system ( Table 1) . 40 This classifier had an accuracy of 60%, which improved to 66.7% after combining the acoustic features with a variety of linguistic ones.",

Multiple investigations found that an ensemble of individual CNNs built from different data modalities (e.g., audio, text, and video) can predict depression severity even more accurately. 41, 42, 44 Other approaches have leveraged the sequential or temporal nature of audio. One AD detection effort employed a Time-Delayed CNN. 45 Instead of the entire recording, this approach applied the convolutional filter to utterances (segments of speech separated by silence) over all preceding time frames (hence the \"delay\"). This allowed them to extract local features from different temporal segments of the recording. 45 Another study used a Long-Short Term Memory architecture (LSTM, a sophisticated implementation of an RNN) 12 to screen for depression. 46 MFCCs ( Table 2) were extracted from different temporal segments of the audio and input to the LSTM. The outputs of the recurrent layers were then fed to the fully connected layers of the network to predict depression scores. 46 DL methods have also been used in situations of insufficient audio data. One study 46 employed transfer learning 12 to classify eight types of emotions from the relatively small RAVDESS dataset 47 (Table 3) . This approach repurposed an RNN trained on a data-rich task (depression score classification), and fine-tuned it with RAVDESS for a related task (emotion recognition). The approach achieved a validation accuracy of 76.3%, an increase of 8.7% from a baseline RNN trained solely on the RAVDESS. 46 Another useful DL architecture for data augmentation is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), 12 which consists of two competing neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, to generate new data samples. In an approach to diagnose childhood autism, 48 the generator of a GAN was trained using GeMAPS 25 and other feature sets extracted from the Child Pathological Speech Database 34 (Table 3) , and a discriminator was trained to help the model generate more realistic data points. Learned representations of the data were then extracted from the intermediate layers of the discriminator, and used to train an SVM model to classify four levels of pathology related to developmental disorders and autism.",

These studies utilized as large datasets of audio as possible, and a wide array of statistical, traditional ML and DL techniques. Most of this work focused on neuropsychological conditions, but interesting work in other clinical areas (e.g., cardiac, infectious and sleep disorders) is emerging. The review also discussed several important challenges facing the field, as well as potential ways to address them.",

However, most of the efforts to date have been in laboratory settings, focusing on refining analytic processes. While there has been some movement towards standardization and benchmarking , there has been limited deployment of these methods. Some software systems that can be shared among clinicians have been developed. NeuroSpeech is one such system that can help analyze dysarthric speech and diagnose Parkinson's disease. 90 Another group deployed a smartphone application to recognize phonemic boundaries and interpret a patient's speaking rate for real-time speech therapy. 91 Future work in this direction will have to address several challenges. First, an infrastructure for the recording, processing and storage of high-quality patient audio will have to be established and standardized. 8, 11 These data must be obtained with patients' consent, and be stored securely to maintain privacy and confidentiality. 13 Finally, institutions may also need highperformance computing facilities for this deployment, especially to develop predictive models for their patient populations. 92 As progress is made in these directions, we expect that audio-based tools will be deployed in the clinic much more extensively in the future.",

First, records published after 2010 were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using the listed keywords. Duplicates were automatically removed. Through manual screening, records are retained/removed according to the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria. The main goal was to only include articles that used or described the use of audio in a clinical setting for purposes other than medical imaging or obtaining transcriptions and performing textual analysis. Of the remaining records, a representative subset were included in this review to accurately portray the scope of clinical applications of audio signals. Figure 3 : An illustration of a deep learning-based neural network model that can be used to represent audio at various levels of abstraction. The raw audio is input to the network at the waveform level, and at each successive \"layer\" of the network, a more abstract representation is learned. At the final layer of the network, the model predicts the most likely class that the audio originated from.",
