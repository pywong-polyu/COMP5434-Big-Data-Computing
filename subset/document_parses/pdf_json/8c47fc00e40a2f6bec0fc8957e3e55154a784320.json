The ongoing ELECTRA-STROKE study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of dry electrode electroencephalography (EEG) for LVO-a stroke in the prehospital setting. To determine which EEG features are most useful for this purpose and assess EEG data quality, EEG recordings are also performed in the emergency room (ER). Here, we report data of the first 100 patients included in the ER. Methods Patients presented to the ER with a suspected stroke or known LVO-a stroke underwent a single EEG prior to EVT. Diagnostic accuracy for LVO-a stroke of frequency band power, brain symmetry and phase synchronization measures were evaluated by calculating receiver operating characteristic curves. Optimal cut-offs were determined as the highest sensitivity at a specificity of \u2265 80%. Results EEG data were of sufficient quality for analysis in 65/100 included patients. Of these, 35/65 (54%) had an acute ischemic stroke, of whom 9/65 (14%) had an LVO-a stroke. Median onset-to-EEG-time was 266 min (IQR 121-655) and median EEG-recording-time was 3 min (IQR 3-5). The EEG feature with the highest diagnostic accuracy for LVO-a stroke was theta-alpha ratio (AUC 0.83; sensitivity 75%; specificity 81%). Combined, weighted phase lag index and relative theta power best identified LVO-a stroke (sensitivity 100%; specificity 84%). Conclusion Dry electrode EEG is a promising tool for LVO-a stroke detection, but data quality needs to be improved and validation in the prehospital setting is necessary.

            "text": "Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is standard treatment for patients with an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by a large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation (LVOa) [1] . It is important that EVT is performed as soon as possible, in particular in the early time window, since time delay decreases the chance of patient recovery [2, 3] . In most countries, paramedics transport a patient with a suspected stroke to the nearest hospital for diagnostic work-up and, if indicated, initiation of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) [4] . In 45-83% of cases [5] [6] [7] [8] , this nearest hospital is a primary stroke center (PSC), where EVT cannot be performed. In these situations, a patient with an LVO-a stroke requires a second transfer to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) to undergo EVT. This 'drip-and-ship' model delays initiation of EVT by 40-106 min, [5, 6] which theoretically decreases the chance of a good functional outcome by up to 10% [9, 10] .",

Recently, two small studies performed in an emergency department setting have provided preliminary data that suggest that EEG could be a feasible instrument for detection of LVO-a stroke [16, 17] . Although traditional EEG measurement requires long preparation times, solutions for faster and easier application are available. For example, dry electrodes require no skin preparation or conductive paste and can reduce EEG preparation time to less than 5 min [17] . ELECTRA-STROKE is an ongoing study with the primary aim to determine the diagnostic accuracy of dry electrode EEG for LVO-a stroke detection in the prehospital setting. To gain insight into which EEG features are most useful for LVO-a stroke detection in the ambulance and to assess and improve EEG data quality in an emergency setting, the ELECTRA-STROKE study also performs dry electrode EEG recordings in patients with a suspected stroke or a known LVO-a stroke in the emergency room (ER). Here, we describe our first experiences with dry electrode EEG in an emergency setting and report the results of the first 100 patients in the study in whom an EEG was performed in the ER.",

The study consists of four different phases. In phases 1 and 2, dry electrode EEG recordings were performed in controlled in-hospital settings: healthy subjects in the outpatient clinic (phase 1, n = 8) and patients admitted to the stroke unit (phase 2, n = 7). These two phases were not intended for data acquisition, but only to assess technical and logistical feasibility of performing dry electrode EEG recordings. In phase 3, we aim to include 250 patients who are presented to the ER of our hospital with a suspected stroke or with a known LVO-a stroke (after being transferred from a PSC to our hospital to undergo EVT). Patients with a known LVO-a stroke were included to 'enrich' our study population, i.e. to increase the incidence of LVO-a stroke compared to the primary target population to improve the reliability of the EEG analysis. In the fourth and final phase, ambulance paramedics (Ambulance Amsterdam and Witte Kruis Alkmaar, both in the Netherlands) perform dry electrode EEG recordings in the prehospital setting in 222 patients with a suspected stroke. The full study protocol of ELECTRA-STROKE is available as an online supplement (Online Resource 2).",

These electrode positions were selected to achieve optimal coverage of the vascular territory of the middle cerebral artery, while trying to minimize the risk of EEG artifacts. All EEG recordings were acquired with an EEG amplifier (eego amplifier EE-411, Eemagine, Berlin, Germany) at a sample frequency of 500 Hz, using clinical EEG software (Clinical Science Systems, Leiden, The Netherlands). EEG recordings were stored in a 16-bit EDF format prior to 12 December 2019 and afterwards in a 32-bit EDF format to avoid incidental clipping of the stored signal. EEG recordings were performed by research personnel who were instructed to perform a recording with a duration of approximately 3 min as soon as logistically feasible after patient arrival and before initiation of EVT.

An EEG recording was considered to be of sufficient quality for analysis if, after artifact rejection, at least 10 s of EEG signal remained in either \u2265 3 unilateral bipolar derivations simultaneously and/or \u2265 2 symmetric bipolar derivations simultaneously (Fig. 1 ). EEG features were calculated per 10-s epoch with a 5-s overlap using three unilateral bipolar derivations for analysis of single hemispheres and two symmetric bipolar derivations for analysis of the brain symmetry ( Fig. 1) . For single hemispheres, we determined the relative delta power (1-4 Hz), relative theta power (4-8 Hz), relative alpha power (8-12 Hz), delta-alpha ratio and theta-alpha ratio for each bipolar derivation separately and averaged them thereafter. As a measure for phase synchronization within a single hemisphere, we determined the WPLI in the frequency range of 4-18 Hz. As a measure for brain symmetry, we determined the pdBSI in the frequency range of 4-18 Hz.

Single EEG features with the highest accuracy were the theta-alpha ratio (AUC 0.83) and relative alpha power (AUC 0.80). The combination of relative theta power and WPLI best identified LVO-a stroke, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 84%. An important limitation was that the EEG data were of insufficient quality for analysis in 35% of patients. Several previous cohort studies have shown that interhospital transfer of patients with an LVO-a stroke delays EVT by 40-106 min and is associated with worse clinical outcome [5, 6] . The RACECAT trial (NCT02795962), in which patients with a suspected LVO-a stroke were randomized between primary presentation to a PSC and direct presentation to a CSC, also found that inter-hospital transfer prior to EVT was associated with a treatment delay of approximately an hour, although no difference in clinical outcome was found [22] . A prehospital LVO-a stroke detection method with high diagnostic accuracy, however, would not only save time by enabling direct transportation of patients with an LVO-a stroke to the nearest CSC, but with high specificity, a positive result would also warrant the angiography suite to be prepared and the operating team to be alerted before patient arrival, which could further lower time to treatment. Several prehospital LVO-a stroke detection methods that have previously been proposed, do not seem suitable for this purpose at this time [23] . Multiple Fig. 3 ROC curve for LVO-a stroke detection by the theta-alpha ratio. The red circle is located at a cut-off value of 0.43, with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 81% for LVO-a stroke clinical scales have been studied in the prehospital setting and some can reach a relatively high diagnostic accuracy [14] , comparable to the diagnostic accuracy of several single EEG features in our study. However, while diagnostic accuracy of EEG may be drastically improved in the future by the further development of LVO-a detection algorithms and new EEG acquisition techniques, it seems unlikely that the diagnostic accuracy of clinical scales can be substantially improved. The relatively low exposure of ambulance paramedics to the population of suspected stroke patients combined with the complexity of the neurological examination makes reliable application of clinical scales in the prehospital setting difficult. Nonetheless, it is important thatonce the technique of dry electrode EEG in the ambulance has matured-future studies appropriately assess the added value of EEG measurement on top of clinical scales for triage of patients with a suspected stroke.",

            "text": "Recently, two small studies performed in the ER have provided data that suggest that EEG could be suitable for LVO-a stroke detection. A previous small study of 24 suspected stroke patients found that the alpha-delta ratio, the (delta*theta)/(alpha*beta) ratio, delta power and lower beta power discriminated between patients with and without an AIS with a large infarct volume, in a population of suspected stroke patients in the ER [16] . In another study, dry electrode EEG recordings were performed in 100 patients with suspected or definite stroke in the ER [17] . In this study, the relative theta power and relative alpha power combined identified LVO-a stroke with an AUC of 0.69. When combined with clinical data, the AUC improved to 0.86. This suggests that combining the EEG with a clinical scale may further improve its diagnostic accuracy, although in our study, relatively high diagnostic accuracy was achieved without use of clinical data. Contrary to the study by Erani et al., we acquired all EEG data prior to EVT, with a substantially lower median time from symptom onset to EEG acquisition (4.4 vs. 9.4 h). As cellular mechanisms change rapidly during the first hours after AIS onset [24, 25] , this difference in timing of EEG acquisition is important to consider when interpreting the findings of both studies and when assessing their generalizability.",

            "text": "An important limitation to our study is the high number of patients with EEG data that were of insufficient quality for analysis. Although lower channel reliability is a known disadvantage of dry electrode EEG, average channel reliability has previously been reported to be approximately 80% [26] . In our study, however, only 65% of patients had EEG data of sufficient quality. A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be that our EEG preparation times were relatively short and the fact that the EEG recordings were performed in an emergency setting. We chose to use dry electrode EEG because it requires a substantially decreased preparation time compared to wet electrode EEG [26, 27] . Since EEG recordings were performed prior to EVT, we wanted to take as little time as logistically feasible and, therefore, aimed for a total EEG acquisition time of approximately 5 min. When comparing our study to that of Erani et al., in which EEG data of 95% of measured patients were used for analysis, our EEG preparation times were substantially lower (2 min vs. 9 min) [17] . These low preparation times could also explain why patients with EEG data of insufficient quality more often had an LVO-a stroke (40% vs. 14%), since there was more of a time constraint in these patients, especially in those who were transferred from a PSC directly to the angiography suite. Additionally, in our study, compared to that of Erani et al., more EEG recordings were performed by inexperienced users (70% vs. 90%), which may also have contributed to the high number of low quality EEG recordings. Another possible explanation for our low data quality is that with the EEG recording software that was used, electrode impedance could not be visualized for dry electrodes. Therefore, the researcher performing the EEG recording was unable to ensure sufficient electrode-skin contact. Because having a lot of hair on the scalp makes sufficient electrode-skin contact more difficult to achieve [28] , this may also explain why patients with EEG data of insufficient quality were more often women and more often had long hair. Since poor electrode-skin contact increases the power of lower frequencies and dry electrode recordings are known to have increased power in the lower frequencies until 3 Hz compared to wet electrode EEG, related to increased electrode drift and a higher offset potential [28] , our results regarding the delta frequency band should be interpreted with caution. Finally, the limited number of electrodes in our dry electrode cap may have contributed to the high number of patients with EEG data of insufficient quality, since with less electrodes, the chances of obtaining good quality EEG data may be lower. Over the course of our study, the EEG data quality did improve, as we found that recordings were more often of sufficient quality for analysis if they were stored in a 32-bit file format and were performed by a more experienced user. Other possibilities to improve data quality include: providing feedback of the electrode-skin contact to the user prior to the EEG recording; enforcing better electrode-skin contact by increasing the tightness of the cap fit; increasing the electrode surface area to improve electrode stability and electrode-skin contact; and improving the training of the users of the EEG equipment. Although automated methods for detection and removal of EEG artifacts are available, these have not yet been studied in the prehospital setting [29] .",
