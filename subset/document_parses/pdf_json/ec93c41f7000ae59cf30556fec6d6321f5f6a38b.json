Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted by reviewing charts and slides of placentas between April 1 to July 24, 2020. Clinical history of \"COVID-19\" were searched in Pathology Database (CoPath). Controls were matched with SARS-CoV-2negative women with singleton deliveries in the 3 rd -trimester. Individual and group, pathological features were extracted from placental pathology reports. Results: Twenty-one 3 rd -trimester, placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women were identified and compared to 20 placentas from SARS-CoV-2-negative women. There were no significant differences in individual or group gross or microscopic pathological features between the groups. Within the SARS-CoV-2+ group, there are no differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Conclusion:",

The virus consists of four structural proteins (spike surface glycoprotein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein) and non-structural proteins. The spike protein consists of two functional subunits. The S1 subunit is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and the S2 subunit is utilized for the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. 1, 2 Studies showed that the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is also a functional receptor for SARS-CoV.",

In a case series, Baergen and Heller found that ten of 20 (10/20, 50%) cases of COVID positive patients showed some evidence of FVM or fetal vascular thrombosis (FTV). 12 Moreover, Hecht and colleagues examined placentas of nineteen COVID-19 exposed women and found that there was no characteristic histopathology present among the 19 cases, despite two placental infections. 13 Our study included a control group of placentas to compare with placentas from SARS-CoV-2 positive women, and we did not identify a specific pathology or pathological pattern attributed to the virus. Compared to placentas from SARS-CoV-2-negative women, there were no significant differences in gross and microscopic placental pathology, including placental weight, SGA placentas, abnormal cord insertion or cord coiling, MVM, FVM, and maternal or fetal inflammatory responses.
