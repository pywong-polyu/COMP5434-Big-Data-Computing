Nasal distribution and retention studies using a 3D nasal cavity model and manganese-enhanced MRI were conducted by administering nasal dye and manganese powder formulations with the applied technology. Systemic and mucosal immune responses for the nasal OVA powder formulation were evaluated by determining serum IgG and nasal wash IgA antibody titers. The nasal dye and manganese powder formulations showed wider distribution and longer retention time than did a nasal liquid formulation. The nasal OVA powder formulation also showed comparable and higher antigen-specific IgG antibody titer to an injection and nasal liquid formulation, respectively. Furthermore, antigen-specific IgA antibody response was detected only for the nasal OVA powder formulation. The present study suggests that the technology, originally designed for drug absorption, is promising for nasal vaccines, enabling both a mucosal immunity response as the first line of defense and systemic immunity response as a second line of defense against infection.",

            "text": "In recent years, respiratory infections such as new strains of influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes such as COVID-19 (a new coronavirus infection) have become major public health issues as the viruses have spread worldwide. As part of the preparations for the emergence of respiratory tract infections, a number of studies on techniques to powderize vaccine antigens, enabling cold-chain-free storage and distribution, have been reported. 1 Additionally, a number of studies on nasal vaccination as an alternative to conventional subcutaneous or intramuscular (IM) vaccination routes to defend against viral infection in the upper respiratory tract have been reported, and an attenuated influenza vaccine nasal spray (FluMist\u00ae and Nasovac\u00ae) is currently on the market. 2, 3 The mucosal immunity achieved by nasal vaccination, which is mainly due to production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) as an immune response of nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and lymphoid tissues such as Waldeyer's tonsillar ring, has a crucial role in defending against viral infection in the upper respiratory tract. 4e6 It has been reported that SIgA is also effective against mutated antigens, as it exhibits cross-protection. 7 Therefore, a nasal vaccine is keenly anticipated to be developed as a pre-pandemic prophylactic against new strains of influenza as well as a defense against easily mutated antigens such as influenza antigen. However, since most research and development on nasal vaccines is intended for delivering vaccine antigens in a liquid form to the nasal cavity, there is a great need for nasal platform technologies that deliver a powder form against emerging respiratory viral infections due to their potential for cold-chain-free storage and distribution.",

In the present studies with the 3D nasal cavity model and manganeseenhanced MRI (MEMRI), the nasal powder formulations showed wide distribution from the anterior region to the posterior region. In contrast, the nasal liquid formulations showed limited distribution in the nasal vestibule and lower nasal cavity area even though they showed a wider plume angle and spray area than those for the nasal powder formulations in the present spray characteristic studies. Thus, an obvious difference in distribution was observed between dosage forms. In both the in vitro and in vivo nasal distribution evaluations, the nasal liquid formulation showed wide distribution from the lower turbinate to the middle turbinate in the coronal plane. However, in the sagittal plane, the nasal liquid formulation showed limited distribution in the anterior region compared that of the nasal powder formulation. These results suggest that the liquid formulations are not effective to widely distribute from the anterior region to the posterior region of the nasal cavity due to obstruction by the middle turbinate, which is notably overhung in the nasal cavity. Additionally, these results suggest that the powder formulations are easy to widely distribute from the anterior region to the posterior region of the nasal cavity, possibly by scattering immediately after impacting with the overhanging middle turbinate. The inconsistency between the wide plume angle and the nasal distribution limited in the anterior region of the nasal cavity for the nasal liquid formulations may be due to less scattering after impacting with the middle turbinate, and/or less impelling force to reach the posterior region of the nasal cavity resulting from a high air resistance with the wide plume angle. The MEMRI images for the nasal cavity captured 20 min after dosing showed significant Mn 2\u00fe signals for the nasal powder formulations in contrast to the low Mn 2\u00fe signals for the Nasal Mn Liquid Formulation. Other in vivo PET imaging studies evaluating nasal distribution after dosing nasal liquid formulations were reported to have retained an amount of the nasal liquid formulation in the nasal cavity even 30 min after administration. 18, 19 Low Mn 2\u00fe signals for the Nasal Mn Liquid Formulation in the present MEMRI imaging study captured 20 min after dosing were probably due to a low detection sensitivity for the Mn 2\u00fe signal in the MEMRI imaging. However, the difference in the Mn 2\u00fe signal level 20 min after dosing between the Nasal Mn Liquid Formulation and the nasal Mn powder formulations was obvious. Also, the MEMRI images for the nasal cavity captured 3 h after dosing showed a higher Mn 2\u00fe signal for the Nasal Mn Cellulose Powder Formulation when compared with the Nasal Mn Trehalose Powder Formulation, possibly due to high muco-affinitive characteristics of the cellulose carrier. These results of MEMRI suggest that the Nasal Mn Cellulose Powder Formulation showed a longer retention time in the nasal cavity when compared with other formulations.",

Nasal OVA Cellulose Powder Formulation showed a comparable increase in the anti-OVA IgG antibody titer in the serum to that observed with IM OVA Injection and significantly increased the anti-OVA IgA antibody titer in the nasal wash. In contrast, no increases in anti-OVA IgA antibody titer were observed for IM OVA Injection or Nasal OVA Liquid Formulation. Antigen-specific IgG antibodies in the serum and antigen-specific IgA antibodies in the nasal mucosa are produced by B cells stimulated by follicular T cells of the germinal center in the lamina propria of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) such as NALT and the tonsils after antigen presentation. 20, 21 The polymer poly-Ig receptor (pIgR) binds to IgA antibodies and is taken up by the epithelial cell layer above the lamina propria, moves across the epithelial cells, and is secreted (SIgA). 22, 23 It is considered that the Nasal OVA Cellulose Powder Formulation, having characteristics of wide nasal distribution and longer nasal retention time, contributed to increased contact of OVA with MALT, and enhanced antigen presentation and differentiation of IgG and IgA-positive plasma cells, resulting in increasing both anti-OVA IgG antibody titer in the serum and anti-OVA IgA antibody titer in the nasal washes. Also, it was observed that for a dose group of the Nasal OVA Cellulose Powder Formulation that an increase in anti-OVA IgA antibody titer in the nasal wash was delayed for approximately 2 weeks in comparison with the increase in anti-OVA IgG antibody titer in serum. This was considered to be due to polymerization of the anti-OVA IgA antibodies and subsequent secretion into the lamina propria.",

Furthermore, since the nasal delivery platform technology used in the present study is designed for powdered forms, the system possibly contributes to storage of nasal vaccines at room temperature in combination with other technologies to stabilize powdered antigens (e.g., powderization with disaccharides). 26 Further research and development on nasal vaccine delivery technology enabling needle-free, enhanced immune response and cold-chain-free handling is highly anticipated, particularly for pandemic vaccine application, to efficiently and safely defend against emerging respiratory tract infections.

Nasal OVA Cellulose Powder Formulation showed a comparable increase in anti-OVA IgG antibody titer in serum as that with IM OVA Injection and an increase in the anti-OVA IgA antibody titer in the nasal wash, which was not observed with IM OVA Injection or Nasal OVA Liquid Formulation. These results suggest that the nasal delivery platform technology which was originally designed for nasal drug absorption is also promising for nasal vaccines enabling both the mucosal immunity response as a first line of defense and the systemic immunity response as a second line of defense against infection.",
