            "text": "\u2022 Most people affected by severe COVID-19 are old and are at high risk of developing acute complications. A recent institutional report showed that the median age of patients dying of COVID-19 is 80 [IQR 73-85], which is more than 15 years higher than the median age of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Italy [12] . Current data suggest that people of age 70 and older represented about 85% of deaths in Italy [13] . Data collected in hospitals show a clear correlation between age and mortality rates, which reaches 55% among very old patients (> 85 years). Moreover, 92% of hospital deaths occur among people aged 65 and over. [14] . \u2022 It is now widely accepted that one of the common presenting symptoms of older people affected by COVID-19 is delirium [15] . In frail patients, delirium is commonly hypoactive or mixed. Without an active screening hypoactive delirium can go undetected [16] . Delirium is a strong predictor of mortality and its incidence in elderly patients hospitalized because of COVID-19 is urgently needed. We suggest to adopt screening protocols, such as 4AT, for the early diagnosis of delirium and to monitor psychological, behavioural, and physical functions and to implement non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for delirium patients [17] . \u2022 No guidelines are available to improve the clinical approach to elderly people affected by COVID-19 along with disability and dementia. \u2022 The risk of ageism is tremendously high. Likewise, the risk of not offering comfort care to patients with poor prognosis is just as high. \u2022 One of the major pitfalls of the current healthcare system that has been revealed by the pandemic is the risk of ageism. In the current COVID-19 tragedy, ageism can be summarized as the exclusion of persons from interventions just because they were \"old\". Geriatric medicine has produced substantial evidence showing that chronological age needs to be placed side by side by concepts like frailty and disability which better define the health status and future prognosis of older persons [18] . Unfortunately, the emergency has brought everyone back to the disease-era forgetting the patient-era, forgetting the importance of the biology of ageing, leading to dramatic medical care decisions mostly based on chronological age [19] . \u2022 The impact of COVID-19 has been devastating on long term care (LTC) facilities, with both high prevalence and mortality among residents [20] . Data about nursing homes recently collected by the Italian N.I.H. through a survey in the Lombardy Region demonstrated a mortality rate fourfold higher than expected in LTC, even if in only half of the cases a relation with COVID-19 can be demonstrated [21] . These data can be explained by the initial scarcity of diagnostic tests performed in these facilities, mainly for economic and structural reasons. This led to a delay in the isolation procedures for infected residents. Other factors that could explain the spread of the disease in LTC settings are the initial scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the lack of early and clear emergency management procedures (the first operational indications were released one month after the outbreak began). \u2022 There are still insufficient data about the lethality of COVID-19 in community-dwelling older people. Often, older subjects who died at home have not been tested either before or after death. Indeed, some Regions in Italy did not adopt policies of early contact tracing, limiting the use of diagnostic testing. This is probably one of the reasons for the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Lombardy compared to other Italian Regions [22] . Furthermore, COVID-19 has shown to often spread in specific \"social\" and \"family\" clusters. This has determined the loss of entire groups of older people, with a psychological and social impact very difficult to quantify. Italy is a decentralized country, and the organization of home care and the role of General Practitioners (GPs) are quite different among different Regions. In some areas, GPs could not carry out or prescribe diagnostic swabs for the identification of SARS-CoV-2. Some GPs lacked an adequate training, a sufficient supply of PPE and a clear coordination with health departments and institutions [23] . \u2022 The lockdown established by the Italian Government as well as the spread of COVID-19 among healthcare workers led to a reduction, and in some cases to the suppression, of home care services usually provided to frail older people (day-care, home care assistance, Alzheimer services). Additionally, the isolation from their relatives may have had, though it was not fully examined, consequences on the psychological, cognitive, behavioural and physical status of older and frail people.",

Asymptomatic residents who had contacts with confirmed cases should be tested and, if positive, isolated and periodically checked for specific and nonspecific symptoms. Hospitalization should be limited to cases that cannot be managed in LTC facilities, and should be considered only after an assessment of the patient's general health, cognitive and functional status and after an evaluation of patient's priorities and wills. Family involvement in choices regarding the treatment is recommended. Monitoring of possible contagion among health care professionals should be systematically carried out, and the availability and correct use of PPE should be periodically assessed [31] .",

Here, we provide some practical indications to care for older patients affected by COVID-19 in different care settings. We are aware of the difficulty in applying these recommendations, mainly because of the fragmentation of the Italian social and healthcare system in terms of organization and resources. COVID-19 has resulted in a surge of ageism by the public. The fact that the majority of those who die from the virus are older adults has been regarded with a kind of relief by the general population; this pushes us to recall the fact that, as the elderly are at a higher risk from COVID-19, we must all act to support and protect the elderly people who live alone in the community, the more frail and those living in LTC [33] . Older patients are known to have an increased risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unclear whether age per se is the main cause of this concurrence. Furthermore, the role of living conditions, comorbidity, frailty and specific biological modifications related to aging have not been fully understood.",
