This rapid uptake creates major challenges for conducting COVID-19 clinical research studies, because quickly evolving standards make it difficult to adapt in real time. The rapid dissemination and implementation of COVID-19 interventions is the realization of goals long pursued by the implementation science community. However, the downside of the rapid implementation is that low-quality evidence with little to no scientific vetting may be quickly integrated into clinical care, resulting in lost opportunities to advance our scientific understanding about how to manage infected patients. In the future, novel adaptive designs embedded into electronic health records (Embedded Quantified, Integrated-into-Practice Trial [EQuIPT] designs) that allow for easier and better access to clinical trials may simultaneously improve care and advance healthcare innovations.",

In this background of slow change, pragmatic and adaptive clinical trial designs were developed to conduct treatment studies that would mimic real-world clinical practice and allow for study design changes [2, 3] . Adaptive trials come in all shapes and sizes; common adaptations include changing sample size, removing doses or medications that appear less effective, adaptive randomization schemes, targeting recruitment to specific groups, and changing stopping parameters [4] . Adaptive designs are attractive for clinical studies during the pandemic, because they allow for adjustments to be made as new knowledge is generated.",

The trial was initially designed as a 3-armed pragmatic trial, comparing interleukin (IL)-1 inhibition (anakinra) to IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab) to standard of care alone. However, this design-which continues to be relevant-was quickly deemed infeasible as neither drug was available for purchase, and our institution's stock of medication could treat a total of 1 patient with anakinra and 6 patients with tocilizumab. Rapid dissemination and adoption of case-report level data had prompted widespread purchase of the drugs for treatment outside of a clinical trial setting, resulting in national shortages and supply chain barriers. We were able to purchase sarilumab, another IL-6 inhibitor, and so the study was adapted before it even began.",

The first 20 patients are randomized 1:1, with updates to the randomization probability weighting after prespecified checkpoints (every 10 patients). We chose this design to meet the need to gather high-quality evidence to guide future care, while recognizing that there were few proven treatment options and discomfort among clinicians and patients about not offering some therapy. We designed our trial with pragmatic features in mind: broad inclusion criteria, few exclusions, and an off-the-shelf medication (sarilumab) that was rapidly ruled to be exempt from a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) application, because we were using it at its FDAapproved dose. We chose to administer the drug as a subcutaneous injection-in line with its labeling-for simplicity and with an eye toward early implementation and dissemination. Additional pragmatic features include use of open-label drug, embedding within the VA electronic health record (EHR), and expectation for standard of care to evolve. Based on prior experience and understanding about Diffusion of Innovations [5] , we anticipated that this strategy would be flexible enough to accommodate the changing landscape of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatments.",

A major challenge was that, in the desperation of the COVID-19 crisis, the processes of evidence review, followed by discussion and early adoption, then followed later by diffusion and dissemination, did not occur sequentially. Instead, unverified, unvetted, and unproven statements were disseminated on social media and in the popular press, prompting rapid action and adoption by frontline providers; based on these reports, key stakeholders integrated changes to institutional treatment guidelines rapidly, sometimes within hours. This was a major challenge for the conduct of our study; on April 27, Regeneron put out a press release stating that in its own study of sarilumab, the standard dose (200 mg) was no longer going to be studied, because an interim analysis indicated benefit primarily in intubated patients and only at a higher dose (400 mg) [6] . On the basis of this press release and another announcement about the efficacy of another IL-6R antibody, tocilizumab, at a high dose [7] , we opted to increase our dose to 400 mg, although we maintained the subcutaneous administration.",

Our study was then on hold for a critical 27 days pending FDA determination, until we received notification of an exemption on May 29, 2020.

Cumbersome recruitment, identification, and consenting processes are major barriers. Clinical trials, even in the setting of a pandemic disease without proven treatments, are enrolling primarily at large, academic medical centers with existing research infrastructure. This has 2 major consequences: first, access is limited to a small segment of the population; second, recent research demonstrates that even having a clinical trial open increases prescribing outside of the research setting [8] . Although unproven, we hypothesize that this phenomenon may be particularly strong for providers in institutions without evidence-based options for their patients and no access to a clinical trial.",

In contrast, low-quality evidence with little to no scientific vetting has been rapidly integrated into clinical care, resulting in lost opportunity to collect data to guide rational decisions, and it is also raising concerns about harm, costs, and unintended consequences. The rapid implementation of COVID-19 treatment is the exception that proves the rule: although diffusion of innovations typically happens slowly and often incompletely, underlying evidence and risk aversion protect patients, providers, and ultimately the integrity of knowledge acquisition to guide future decision making. The challenges of identifying effective therapies for COVID-19 underscore the upsides of this usually slow process, but it also demonstrates that rapid improvements to bedside clinical care are possible. It is possible that by using the lessons of the pandemic and leveraging technological advancements, the medical research community can identify a critical middle ground: EQuIPT designs.",
