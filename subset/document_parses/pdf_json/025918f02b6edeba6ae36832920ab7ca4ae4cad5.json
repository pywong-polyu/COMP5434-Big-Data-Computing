This study utilized the time series data for trend analysis and data forecasting using the ARIMA model to visualize the measles cases. Figures for the time-series and forecasted results are individually presented with the use of GRETL software. Results showed that there was an increasing pattern of the disease from 2016 to 2019. However, there was a decreasing pattern of its occurrence in the next five years based on the five-year forecast. Nevertheless, with the results of the study, there is still a need to improve the different intervention plans of the authority in alleviating the occurrence of the disease though it yielded a decreasing pattern in the future since it is evident that the figure of the forecasted data is still approximately 15,000 and above.",

The proponent of the study prepared a stationary time series by considering the differences. Further, determined plausible models on the basis of an autocorrelogram and a partial autocorrelogram. Lastly, the parameter estimation and model testing were used to compare the plausible models obtained, and we selected the most appropriate model.

In the study, the time-series tool successfully presented the trends of the disease in the country, and ARIMA (1,0,1) model helps in predicting the increasing and decreasing pattern of the measles cases. There was an increased pattern of the disease in the country from 2016 until 2019, based on historical data. However, in the next five years, there will be a decreasing number of its occurrence based on the results of the forecast. With the current situation and the future figure of measles disease in the country, there is still a need to strengthen the campaign by the Department of Health to the community in dealing with how to prevent oneself from the infection and at the same time to revisit previous intervention plans and programs and evaluate which part of the plans that need to be focused as a way to prevent that spread of the infections.",
