            "text": "Considering the role of preventive behaviors in reducing the prevalence of COVID-19, the main way to contain the spread of the virus is to support changes in individuals' behaviors and their compliance with health prescriptions (12) . This study was designed and conducted to investigate the preventive behaviors of COVID-19 and its relationship with some demographic variables. The range of achievable scores for preventive behaviors of COVID-19 were (19-95) and the mean score of preventive behaviors is 62.67 \u00b1 8.53. The results of the study showed that the mean score of preventive behaviors in women was higher than men and more than the overall mean score of preventive behaviors in both sexes and there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of preventive behaviors in both sexes. In a study conducted by Choi et al., The results showed that preventive behaviors were higher in women, which is consistent with the present study (5) . The results of other studies also showed that women performed better in preventive behaviors (13, 14) . The highest average score of preventive behaviors is related to people who have a university education level. The results of a study showed that the use of masks has a significant relationship with the level of education (15) . In one study, the level of the correct response to preventive behaviors in relation to MERS was 0.22 and Preventive behaviors have a significant relationship with education level (16) . In the present study, there is a significant relationship between people's jobs and preventive behaviors. Occupational conditions play an important role in preventive behaviors. The results of the study showed that there is a significant relationship between economic level and preventive behaviors. The average score of preventive behaviors was the lowest in people who assessed their economic situation as weak. Many behaviors, such as wearing masks, gloves, eating healthy foods, disinfecting surfaces, and washing hands regularly, require people to spend money. It is necessary for governments to intervene to improve the economic situation of people with low economic status. Advertising and public health promotion activities supported by government agencies provide cues to increase the use of face masks to prevent respiratory infection (15) . In one study, self-report of infection prevention behaviors was not desirable and people especially needed training in the use of personal protective equipment (17) . Preventive behavior affected the most significantly by attitude and risk perception (5) . Health behaviors are not necessarily interdependent, and individuals can only perform a number of health behaviors. Each behavior pursues a specific goal based on individual experience. It is important that persons recognize that preventive behavior can prevent infectious and could stop its spread (5) . In the present study, the frequency of preventive behaviors is different, so that the most behavior is related to not using hookah and smoking and the least behavior is related to regular physical activity at home. In one study, 65.5% of people were able to avoid being in the community (18) . In one study, among the flu-preventing behaviors, washing hands with soap and water, covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing were the most common. The use of masks has had the least frequency of behavior (19) . The results of another study showed that during the corona epidemic, 97.4% of people tried not to leave the house, 93.6% wore masks when leaving the house, and 91.5% did not go to crowded and closed places (20) . In another study, 83.4% of people avoided crowded places and washed their hands regularly, and only 51.2% of people wore masks (21) . In a study in Wuhan, China, on preventive behaviors at the time of the outbreak of Quaid 19, 8.5% of those surveyed used public transportation at the time of the outbreak, 2.4% were in crowded places, and 95.2% of They used masks, 100% of people washed their hands regularly with soap and water, and 73.8% disinfected living areas (22) . In the study, 40% of respondents most often wore masks in public places and washed their hands regularly (10 times a day), and about one-third of people refused to visit crowded places in China (15) . In another study, regular hand washing was moderate, with less than half of people wearing surgical masks (17) . In a study in China, 98% of people wore masks when leaving home (14) . Regarding their quarantine behavior, only 7% of people were interested in quarantine (23) . In one study, the average rate of preventive behaviors in medical students was 47.14 (24) . Due to some differences that were observed in the results of the present study with some other studies, it should be noted that the behavior of individuals depends on many factors, including circumstances and situations. Differences in the psychological, cultural, social, and demographic characteristics of the participants, as well as differences in tools, may be reasons for the discrepancies in the studies.",

Due to COVID-19 disease, this method of data collection was appropriate. One of the limitations of this study is completing the questionnaires only through cyber space. People included in the study who had access to the Internet and social networks. Therefore, in order to generalize to the whole community, it should be interpreted with more caution. Also, because of the people in cities have more access to social media than villagers, and women use social networks more than men and have more time to complete the questionnaire. Therefore, the majority of study participants were women and urban dwellers. Also data used in the analysis of this study were self-reported, which might suffer from reporting bias.",
