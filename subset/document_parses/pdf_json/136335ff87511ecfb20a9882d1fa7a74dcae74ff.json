Pneumonitis may present asymptomatically and be incidentally found on computerized tomography (CT) scanning, or present symptomatically with cough, dyspnea, fatigue, or chest pain or clinical findings of progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure [10] [11] [12] . Diagnosis is based on appropriate history and suggestive radiological findings on CT scanning. Definitive diagnosis requires a combination of bronchoalveolar lavage and/or a biopsy; however, these investigations are often impractical in an acutely unwell individual [10] [11] [12] . Suggestive radiological features include ground glass opacities, interstitial reticulation, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia-like changes [8] [9] [10] 12] . Pneumonitis caused by immunotherapy is graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) severity scale, which ranges from grade 1, asymptomatic, through to grade 5, where death occurs [2] (Table 1) . Initial treatment is often empiric. Treatment options include supportive therapy alone, oral or intravenous corticosteroids, cessation of immunotherapy, and, in refractory cases, the use of steroid-sparing agents as part of prolonged immunosuppression with mycophenolate, infliximab, or cyclophosphamide [11, 13] . The outcome of patients who develop pneumonitis can range from complete resolution to death [12, 13] .",

Two months after treatment, the FDG-PET scan showed an initial partial metabolic response, with incomplete resolution of the changes due to pneumonitis (Fig. 3) . Over time, the pneumonitis settled, but there was cancer progression on FDG-PET after 5 months off nivolumab. On discussion between the patient and her treating team, nivolumab was reinstituted and treatment continued for a period of 18 months with a best response of stable disease. No further episodes of pneumonitis were observed. The patient subsequently died from cancer-associated venous thromboembolism unrelated to her prior immunotherapy. ",

The severity of immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis does not appear to be correlated with the timeframe of onset. 4. Immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis can flare or recur during the period of steroid taper. 5. Following careful consideration, immunotherapy rechallenge can occur for some patients with prior immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis. A careful discussion of the potential risks and benefits is required Nishinu et al. identified that pneumonitis more commonly occurs in patients who have NSCLC 4.1% and renal cell carcinoma 4.1%, compared with patients with metastatic melanoma 1.6% [1] . Similarly, a meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials found that the lowest rates of pneumonitis were seen in patients treated for advanced melanoma (0.72%) and highest in patients treated for advanced NSCLC 4.7% [2] . Patients with NSCLC are more likely to have underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), potentially increasing their susceptibility to pneumonitis and/or to developing higher-grade pneumonitis [12] . A recent study by Suzuki et al. [15] indicates that lower lung static volumes such as with large thoracic tumors are associated with higher pneumonitis risk post-immunotherapy [16] . A past or current smoking history may also be a risk factor for the development of severe pneumonitis. Whether this is due to smoking itself or due to smoking-related lung diseases is unclear and perhaps difficult to discern, with two studies showing smoking on its own was not associated with an increased risk or incidence of pneumonitis [17, 18] .",

In a study by Nishino et al., the median time to onset of immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis was 2.6 months, ranging from 0.5 to 11.5 months [13] . Pneumonitis must be considered among the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with early clinical deterioration and respiratory symptoms early in their treatment course. However, late onset of irAEs including pneumonitis can occur more than 90 days after cessation of immunotherapy [20] . Delaunay et al.

In the same study, they found that the time to onset and severity of pneumonitis appeared to have no correlation [9] .

Treatment options include observation, oral or intravenous corticosteroids, cessation of immunotherapy, and, in refractory cases, the use of immunosuppression drugs including mycophenolate, infliximab, and cyclophosphamide [11, 13] . Patients may require admission to hospital and respiratory support in a high-dependency or intensive care unit. The outcome of patients who develop pneumonitis can range from complete resolution to relapse, palliation, or death and is dependent on a multitude of variables [12, 13] . The mainstay of therapy is corticosteroids; however, steroid-refractory cases challenge clinicians' decisions regarding the appropriate dose, timing, and route of administration [19] . Steroid-sparing agents are often employed in the case of steroid refractoriness; however, there appears to be limited data on the efficacy of these treatments [11] . The length of treatment and weaning regime implemented can also be a challenge with rebound toxicity on withdrawal of steroids [19] . As per the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines, prednisolone should be weaned over 6 weeks minimum in grade 2 pneumonitis or minimum 8 weeks in grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis to prevent rebound of pneumonitis symptoms. However, despite a prolonged weaning regime of immunosuppression following an episode of pneumonitis, pneumonitis may relapse without further exposure to immunotherapy, with cases of chronic immune checkpoint pneumonitis as described by Naidoo et al. [21] . This highlights that the biological effects of immunotherapy can persist for a long time, and relapse may occur following a prolonged wean.",

Invariably, the use of immunotherapy agents is currently occurring in the setting of advanced disease where the goal of prolonged cancer control is associated with improved survival. The mortality associated with the progression of cancer must be weighed up against the potentially life-threatening irAEs, and this can be a challenge for physicians with limited data available. The decision of whether to rechallenge with immunotherapy following high-grade toxicity is challenging for clinicians and patients. In general, it has been suggested that redevelopment of irAE after rechallenge is more common in patients with higher-grade irAE (grade 3 or 4). Santini et al. [22] recommend avoiding rechallenging patients who required hospitalization for their initial irAE, as the recurrence/new rate of irAE's was up to 87% in these patients. Interestingly, in a study of 93 patients who were rechallenged with immunotherapy for a range of different irAEs, the recurrence of new irAE was not more severe than the original event [23] .",

Each of the cases of immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis illustrates the different potential patterns that may arise when immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis develops. Given the variable onset and severity of pneumonitis, we recommend that immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis must always be considered as a differential, regardless of the time of onset. Special consideration should be given to patients with underlying lung disease or a significant smoking history, given the higher risk of mortality. The decision to rechallenge patients, while difficult, is possible. Early initiation and perhaps prolonged immunosuppressive therapy may be required to optimize patient outcomes. ",
