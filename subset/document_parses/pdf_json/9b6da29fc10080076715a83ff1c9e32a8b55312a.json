All the study NICUs routinely take care of very preterm and VLBW infants. The number of infants born in each study hospital per year ranges from approximately 2500 (NICU C) to 5500 (NICU A). Infants with VLBW and/or GA between 22 and 29 weeks admitted to the study NICUs each year range from approximately 40 (NICU D) to 140 (NICU A). All the NICUs have access to a wide range of paediatric specialists [level III B or III C NICU according to the Vermont Oxford Network (VON) registry definition]. The infant/nurse ratio ranges from 2/1 to 3/1 for the proper NICU cots, and from 6/1 to 4/1 for babies in the high-dependency unit.",

During 2019, the incidence of LOS in NICU C was higher than the previous years. To some extent, this was probably attributable to a transient reduction in the number of NICU nurses, with a consequent increase in the infant/ nurse ratio. This issue was partially solved in 2020, and this could have contributed to the lower incidence of LOS during that year in NICU C. Even if we cannot detail the specific contribution of nurses' number and COVID-related measures to LOS reduction, these data reinforce the observation according to which a strict infection-control bundle, which comprises both personnel implementation and specific infection-control measures, can contribute to LOS reduction among VLBW infants in settings with a high incidence of the disease.",
