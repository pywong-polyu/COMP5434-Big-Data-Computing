The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends collecting and testing an upper respiratory tract specimen for initial SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing (1), but the most sensitive specimen type has not been defined. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) have historically been considered the reference specimen type used for respiratory virus detection. In addition, anterior nasal swabs (ANS) are routinely used for influenza virus nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Recurrent shortages of swabs and personal protective equipment (PPE), however, have prompted evaluation of alternatives to NPS, including the use of patient self-collected ANS and saliva.",

Saliva also has the added benefit of being a swab-free specimen type known to contain high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (2) (3) (4) . Surprisingly few studies have assessed the performance of patient self-collected ANS for SARS-CoV-2 testing (5, 6) . Small sample sizes and the use of selected cases limit the available evidence for ANS. More performance data exist for saliva than for ANS (7) , but the published studies vary substantially in the way in which the specimens were obtained. Many saliva collection protocols require patients to cough before pooling saliva in their mouth (2, 3, 8) ; entail avoidance of food, water, or tooth brushing prior to testing (9); and/or rely on RNA stabilization reagents as a part of the collection device. Forced cough, if performed in the presence of a health care worker, necessitates the need for PPE, and restrictions on eating and drinking are not feasible in most health care settings. Furthermore, RNA stabilizers increase the cost of testing, are vulnerable to supply shortages, are not compatible with all NAAT chemistries, and can be potentially toxic to use. Larger studies that compare the performance of patient self-collected ANS and straight saliva to health care worker-collected NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection are needed. Therefore, we performed a prospective comparative study to evaluate the performance of patient self-collected ANS and saliva versus that of health care providercollected NPS for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.",

The selection and adequate collection of clinical specimens play essential roles in diagnostic test performance, and this holds true for sensitive NAAT methods. Both the CDC (1) and IDSA (10) endorse the use of NPS or ANS (either health care worker or patient collected) for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, few data from comparisons of the performance of different sample types collected from the same patient at the same time and by the use of FDA-authorized NAAT platforms exist.",

            "text": "This study represents one of the largest prospective comparisons of specimen types to date and demonstrates excellent agreement between provider-collected NPS and patient self-collected saliva and ANS. The majority (91.9%) of patients with positive results had SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detected in at least two specimen types concurrently. NPS and saliva samples had the greatest positivity rates overall. Given that all participants had a strong clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and molecular testing in general has a very high specificity, it is likely that the results for the NPS or saliva specimens that were the only specimens positive are true positives, but the lack of an accepted external reference standard precludes calculations of clinical sensitivity and specificity. Even though there was excellent qualitative agreement across specimen types, relying on ANS alone could have missed infection in 10 or 11 patients compared with relying on NPS or saliva alone, respectively. Missed COVID-19 cases have major clinical implications affecting isolation decisions for symptomatic patients and are a lost opportunity for contact tracing.",

            "text": "No single sample type detected all potential COVID-19 cases, and discrepant results were not always explained by high C T values (i.e., low RNA concentrations near the limit of detection of the test). There are several potential explanations for false-negative results. First, inadequate swab collection technique is possible. We did not include a host genomic marker to ensure the presence of respiratory epithelial cells on the swab, nor did we compare patient self-collected ANS to health care provider-collected ANS. Previous respiratory virus studies, however, suggest that the performance of patient self-collected ANS is equivalent to that of provider-collected ANS (11) . We also did not evaluate the impact of swab type on SARS-CoV-2 detection. This study relied on foam nasal swabs and flocked nasopharyngeal swabs, so the results may not be generalizable to other swab types. Additionally, the level of viral replication in the nasopharynx or posterior oropharynx/salivary glands may vary over the course of infection. We did not collect information on the duration or type of symptoms at the time of specimen collection, which is an additional limitation of the study. Lastly, in an attempt to exclude the possibility of RNA degradation in straight saliva as a potential explanation for false-negative results, we performed stability studies at ambient and refrigerated temperatures for up to 5 days and saw no reduced TMA or PCR signal (data not shown).",

            "text": "In conclusion, NPS and saliva were clinically superior to ANS alone for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients. These observations, along with other recent reports (9, 12) , suggest that straight saliva is an acceptable specimen type for symptomatic patients, especially if swab or PPE supplies are limited. However, not all patients could provide an adequate volume of saliva, and saliva is a complex matrix that requires clinical laboratories to validate this specimen type on their respective NAAT platforms. Saliva processing also required an additional pipetting step to dilute the specimen in ATM prior to testing. Additional processing has work flow and ergonomic implications for the clinical laboratory. Despite sample dilution, an increased rate of indeterminate or invalid results was observed for saliva (3.3% for saliva versus 0% for swabs in saline). This could be related to issues of sample viscosity affecting the automated pipetting and/or internal control inhibition. Repeat testing of the original specimen (diluted 1:1 in ATM) did not resolve invalid results and, therefore, is not recommended. We did not test whether a higher dilution factor (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) with proportionally more ATM would reduce the invalid result rate without losing sensitivity. Regardless of the approach, repeat testing and recreation of the dilution series increase the time to results, the amount of labor required, and the overall cost of testing.",
