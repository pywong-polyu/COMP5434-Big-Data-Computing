            "text": "On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization upgraded the outbreak of COVID-19 to pandemic status. On 15 March 2020, the South African president declared a national state of disaster under the Disaster Management Act of 2002. On 26 March 2020, national lockdown, which included measures stipulated in guidelines for education in emergencies, was implemented in South Africa. The presidential declaration and subsequent lockdown came at a time when some of the universities in South Africa were already struggling either to commence the academic year, or to make up for time lost due to persistent student protests relating to several student demands. However, disaster management now entailed that all schools and institutions of higher education were forced to close immediately for extended periods, necessitating alternative ways of ensuring access to education. The qualitative case study presented in this article sought to document the intervention strategies developed by two universities located in remote parts of Eastern Cape Province to deliver education during the COVID-19 restrictions. A second aim was an examination of the challenges experienced by the two institutions' largely rural student population. The authors collected data using a questionnaire completed by 15 educators and 30 students from the two universities. They also analysed official communications documents from the universities addressed to lecturers and students. The results indicate that access to online teaching and learning platforms and resources for students from poor rural communities in South Africa is challenging, and that there are gross inequalities in educational outcomes for learners from different socioeconomic backgrounds. This affects the future plans of higher education institutions to provide teaching and learning through online-based platforms. The authors conclude their article by providing recommendations to support online learning in rural areas, which has the potential to expand higher education access post-COVID-19.",

Starting with the national state of disaster declared by the South African president on 15 March 2020 (RSA 2020a), the pandemic has resulted in several life-changing developments in the country, as has been the case around the world. In particular, the field of higher education has experienced a considerable impact. What makes the South African context interesting is that several of the nation's 26 public universities were already struggling before the outbreak of the pandemic due to ongoing student protests over a number of issues, including dissatisfaction with accommodation (Mokhoali 2020), university management (Magubane 2020) and student registration exclusion tuition debts (Meyer 2020) . In early 2020, some of the protests had become violent, leading to the temporary closure of some universities (Grobler 2020; Kajee 2020) and the arrest of several students (Bhengu 2020) . Therefore, learning in some South African universities had not yet started for the year when COVID-19 necessitated the closure of all campuses.",

Plecher (2020) indicates that in 2019, the urban population of South Africa was around 66% of the country's total population. This reflects the distribution of the student population, specifically in provinces like Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and Limpopo, which are generally described as rural. Pierre Du Plessis and Raj Mestry (2019) conclude that, independent of COVID-19, the government of South Africa has been struggling to deliver quality teaching and learning to the country's rural areas. According to Michael Gardiner (2008) , the legacy of poverty and neglect in former \"homelands\", 2 which are mostly located in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu Natal and Limpopo provinces, is far from eradicated. The state of rural education in South Africa has its roots in apartheid and its policies of dispossession (DoE 2005) . Besides poor road networks, lack of electricity and low economic status, rural communities have limited access to information and communications technology (ICT) (Hlalele 2012) . During the COVID-19 pandemic, \"not enough attention has been given to rural education\", and \"COVID-19 and the implementation of online learning has magnified the challenges faced by rural learners and teachers\" (Dube 2020, p. 138) , consequently marginalising them.",

This is because curricular \"improvements\" are mainly influenced by technological advancements, which are available in urban areas long before they reach rural settings. For decades, the changing learner context has required a move from traditional classrooms to a combination of physical and virtual spaces (Suorsa and Eskilsson 2014) . This has resulted in the emergence of learning management systems (LMS), course management systems (CMS) and virtual learning environments, which include Moodle, Blackboard Learn, Sakai and other web-based systems. However, to realise their full potential for all students, these new tools must be selected and adapted to suit the context of learners (Ssekakubo et al. 2012) , otherwise they will fail (Ssekakubo et al. 2014) . For example, while the benefits of digital learning are immense for developing countries, adopting learning systems from developed countries without adapting them to local contexts will not work (Khan et al. 2010; Khan 2004) ; to be successful, they must match the contexts of local learners.",

In Africa in general, and South Africa in particular, this inspired a leap into remote and online learning necessitated by a desire to save the academic year. As a result, the government of South Africa collaborated with several non-governmental entities to devise ways of continuing delivery of education. Several initiatives emerged based on online, mobile and social media platforms, including the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Lockdown Digital School, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and WhatsApp groups. The government also collaborated with various mobile network providers to offer \"zero-rated\" 4 educational applications (apps). However, despite these efforts, South Africa's education system was ill-prepared (Dube 2020) . Since the country has not experienced any major epidemics in the past few years, there was little in place to deal with an emergency of this nature, and different learner contexts remained a major factor in South Africa's efforts to deliver education during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Based on our assumption that all universities' strategies to maintain delivery of education would involve online platforms, we expected university lecturers and students forced to operate from their underserved village homes to be subjected to a particularly challenging experience of trying to teach and learn. Our particular interest led us to choose our two sample universities, referred to as University X and University Y in this article. 5 Our qualitative case study employed purposive sampling to identify and seek responses from educators (lecturers) and students from the Faculty of Education at University X and from the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities at University Y. Both universities are located in remote parts of the province of Eastern Cape in South Africa. The majority of students in this province live in rural villages, on farms and in informal settlements, 6 where there are difficulties in establishing and maintaining network connectivity. South Africa is known for its high levels of inequality (World Bank 2018), and glaring inequalities can be found in rural areas of provinces such as Eastern Cape, where the majority of the population rely on monthly government grants. A month before the COVID-19 lockdown, increases to government grants (equating to an overall 4.5% increase) resulted in grants ranging from the lowest (R 445 or about USD 29.62) for child support to the highest (R 1880 or USD 125.14) for persons over the age of 75 and war veterans.",

Both institutions are located in socially and historically disadvantaged communities because of the policies of the apartheid government prior to 1994. Owing to their rural location, it was particularly difficult for these universities to suddenly transition from face-toface to online teaching and learning (Mbodila et al. 2016) . For instance, neither of the communities has an adequate ICT infrastructure able to abruptly support online teaching and learning activities. Eastern Cape has electricity and network connectivity problems, a state of affairs which affects education programmes that need both (Steyn and Van Greunen 2014) . In the discussion section, we report that some of the students in our study needed to walk long distances to access mobile phone connectivity, which would allow them to access the internet, depending on whether or not they had \"data bundles\" (service provider packages for internet access). These conditions made the students \"digital strangers\" (Prensky 2001) .",

In the interim, they communicated the commencement of preliminary steps to lecturers and students, including the uploading of learning materials on the Blackboard LMS. This provided reassurance that the disruption to education would be temporary. While the boost to online teaching and learning would come from providing laptops and data to students, by the 112th day of the national lockdown (in mid-July 2020), some higher education institutions (including the two universities in our study) had still not delivered these resources due to logistical delays, thus greatly disadvantaging rural learners.",

Our findings indicate that both lecturers and students were experiencing challenges, ranging from being able to access the internet to learning how to competently navigate the online learning space. Emerging themes in our study revealed that issues included training for readiness in online teaching and learning, work-life balance, school-life balance, pillars (resources) to support online learning, digital/information technology literacy, physical and psychological environment and wellness, and learner engagement. Given that network connectivity -which affects access to mobile network-based data and learning applications -was a major challenge, we recommend that government collaborate with network providers to facilitate connectivity in rural areas. In addition, the provision of zerorated data currently benefits mostly urban learners, so access also needs to be given to rural learners from formerly marginalised universities.",

An additional and crucial consideration in education during emergencies is that of digital literacy. A deliberate capacity-building initiative to train both educators and students would be instrumental in ensuring a smooth and successful transition from conventional to virtual classrooms. The South African government needs to act quickly to make online learning a viable reality, especially for learners in rural areas who need support to access and benefit from this relatively new learning experience. Government should also provide resources to higher education institutions so they can package support interventions that are informed by learner-specific contexts. Importantly, equipping educators and students for online learning has the potential to expand access to higher education post-COVID-19.",
