Around the end of May, the \"new normal\" of Turkey had been declared by the government. 9 In June, domestic flights had begun, and public spaces opened for visitors. Preventive measures still continue today. Intercity travels and flights have reduced their seats sold and seats are spaced to allow for social distancing. Shops are accepting only customers wearing masks, and the number of visitors is restricted according to their space. Barbers are allowed to welcome only 1 customer for each session. People over age 65 and under age 20 are allowed to leave home occasionally. Schools are expected to open by the end of August 2020. The health system is \"normalizing\" as well. The pandemic has been lifted and quarantine wards are closed. The workforce has shifted from part-time to full-time work. Outpatient clinics are now accepting patients for medical services. By June 25, 3 135 424 tests had been performed, 193 115 patients had been confirmed with COVID-19, 165 706 recovered, and 5046 died. 10 Candidates for testing, quarantine, or hospitalization were as follows 11 Even the epidemic curve of Turkey is expected to decline to the lowest level in September, and the health authorities are alerted for new epidemic spikes in the coming weeks.",
