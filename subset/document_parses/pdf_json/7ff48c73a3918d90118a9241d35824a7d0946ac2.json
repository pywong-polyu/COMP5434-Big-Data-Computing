[1] [2] [3] Long-term exposure to particulate and gaseous pollutants has been associated with negative impacts on pulmonary function in adults and children, 4 5 increased risk of asthma development, 6 increased severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms, 7 faster progression of emphysema 8 and incidence of malignant neoplasms of the lung. 9 Short-term exposure is associated with worsening of pulmonary function in adults, 10 11 aggravation of asthma and bronchitis in adults and children 12 13 and increased incidence, hospitalisation and mortality due to respiratory tract infections. [14] [15] [16] [17] Short and long-term exposure to air pollutants may impair host immune defenses, resulting in increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. 18 19 Most prior research on air pollutants and respiratory infections has focused on impacts among children 20 21 or individuals with cystic fibrosis. [22] [23] [24] However, the link between pollutant exposure and acute respiratory infections among adults has received comparatively less attention, even as mortality rates due to lower respiratory infections (LRI) among children under 5 years have declined globally without corresponding improvements in the adult population. 25 Acute respiratory infections among adults are common and represent a major source of disease burden. 26 The number of LRI-linked deaths among people above 70 years old rose from nearly 750 000 to 1.1 million annually between 2000 and 2016. 25 Acute respiratory infections account for approximately 5 million emergency department visits in the USA yearly, and for the largest share (41%) of antibiotics prescribed in the adult outpatient Key messages \u25ba Is exposure to ambient air pollutants associated with respiratory infection in adults? \u25ba An increase in residential concentration of PM 2.5 , NO x and NO 2 from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the previous 2-6 weeks period was associated with 4%, 15% and 21% higher risk of reporting a respiratory infection. \u25ba These findings indicate that fine particulate and traffic-related air pollutants may increase the risk of respiratory infection among adults.",

[31] [32] [33] A hierarchical high-resolution spatiotemporal model is used to predict outdoor concentrations at each participant's residence for each 2 weeks period from January 1999 through the end of participant follow-up. Participants provided residential address information for the entire study duration. The model integrates data from US Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System regulatory monitors, three types of MESA air-specific monitoring campaigns conducted in the study communities and at homes of study participants and hundreds of geocovariates in a universal kriging and spatial smoothing framework. [33] [34] [35] The median (range) cross-validated R 2 values of the prediction models across study regions were 0.79 (0.54-0.85) for PM 2.5 , 0.72 (0.50-0.92) for NO x , and 0.78 (0.45-0.90) for NO 2 . For primary analyses, timescales for assessing associations were selected a priori as the average exposure 1 year before an MESA examination (long-term exposure) and the 4 weeks starting from 14 days before an examination date (short-term exposure). We also conducted sensitivity analyses using average exposures in the 2-weeks period covering 14-28 days prior to an examination.",

It could be argued that this is overadjustment, if in fact these observed long-term secular trends of reduced reporting of respiratory infections were caused by declines in air pollution. In that case, our estimates of effect may be attenuated relative to the true magnitude of effect.",

[58] [59] [60] Initial investigations using limited individuallevel data also point to an increase of approximately 7% in mortality rate for each additional 1 \u00b5g/m 3 in longterm PM 2.5 exposure. 61 While high-quality representative individual-level data remain scarce, this rapidly evolving body of literature suggests that air pollutants may exacerbate the severity of COVID-19, especially in the presence Open access of other key risk factors such as advanced age, obesity, and comorbid health conditions.",

            "text": "The mechanisms through which pollutants potentially increase the risk of respiratory infection are still being studied. Particulate and gaseous pollutants are thought to cause respiratory injury through induction of oxidative stress and inflammation in the airways. 18 62 Particles are removed through exhalation, mucociliary clearance or phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages; or they may be translocated through respiratory epithelial surfaces. 9 63 Particle deposition and clearance vary by individual-level factors such as age, sex, smoking status, concomitant conditions like asthma and COPD, activity levels and breathing patterns, which may therefore affect the risk of developing pollutant-related disease. 9 Particles that remain in the respiratory tract can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, inhibition of mucociliary clearance mechanisms, disruption of epithelial tight junctions and impairment of macrophage antimicrobial phagocytic activity, potentially enhancing susceptibility to respiratory infections. 18 64 There is mounting in vitro and in vivo evidence for the pulmonary immunotoxicity of fine particulate matter, although a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. 65 Particulate matter appears to enhance Streptococcus pneumoniae biofilm growth and colonisation of human middle ear epithelium cells in vitro, and to increase pneumococcal colonisation of the nasopharynx in an animal model. 66 Oxides of nitrogen are absorbed in both the upper respiratory tract and pulmonary regions, and their reactions with surface epithelial fluids may result in oxidative stress, while absorbed components may cause deep lung irritation and immunomodulation of host response to infection, possibly increasing susceptibility or worsening the severity of existing infection. 67 In the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Disease in Adults (SAPALDIA), increased exposure to NO 2 was linked to higher risk of respiratory problems leading to doctor visits among participants with underlying COPD and chronic bronchitis. 68 This suggests that particulate and traffic-related pollutants may elevate the virulence of secondary pathogenic agents in the event of concurrent exposure in the human respiratory tract, partly through inhibition of immune function. Some investigators have hypothesised that air pollution may increase the mortality risks associated with the novel epidemic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2. 69",

Sufficiently detailed CDC influenza activity data for our period of interest were not readily available for most study regions, reducing our ability to assess the interesting potential interactive role of community-level influenza activity on the pollutantillness relationship. The outcomes were self-reported, although trained research staff conducted the interviews consistently over follow-up. In addition, we used outdoor residential pollutant concentrations that do not take into account the actual microenvironments in which participants spend time. Importantly, we utilised high-quality exposure predictions in an ethnically and geographically diverse and well-characterised cohort that permitted ample confounder control and exploitation of fine spatiotemporal variations in exposure.",

The potential burden of these illnesses-in lost productivity, healthcare utilisation and antibiotic use-suggests that control of particulate and traffic-related pollution may provide substantial individual and societal benefit. In light of the increased attention to respiratory infections in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, these results also may provide an insight into the potential role of pollutants in modifying the risk of novel viral infections. Given the known deleterious effects of pollutants on the respiratory system, including increasing the risk of infections, and preliminary linkages to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, it is suggested that reducing pollutant exposure may prevent severe illness and death due to COVID-19. Because respiratory infections, possibly including COVID-19, will remain major health problems among adults, two recommendations can be inferred from our study. First, it may be beneficial for older adults who spend substantial amounts of time in the home to utilise air purification equipment such as filters. Second, multipronged regulatory actions to control pollution at the societal level remain critical public health priorities including science-based adjusments of air quality standards and concerted efforts and resources in areas with high concentrations of particulate and traffic-related pollutants.",
