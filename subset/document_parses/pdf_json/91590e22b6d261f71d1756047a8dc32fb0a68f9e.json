HFNCO therapy generates a flowdependent FiO 2 . 5 HFNCO therapy is able to maintain a high FiO 2 by delivering flows higher than the spontaneous inspiratory demand, thus minimising room-air entrainment. In order to maximise the benefit of HFNCO, the flow rate must be titrated to match the patient's inspiratory demand and severity of respiratory distress. Second, HFNCO is also able to decrease anatomic dead space by washing CO 2 out of the upper airways.

This spares the body the energy cost of warming and humidifying inspired gas. Warm humid gas is also associated with better conductance and pulmonary compliance compared to dry and cooler gas. It also improves mucociliary function, thereby facilitating secretion clearance, decreasing risk of atelectasis and improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio and oxygenation. One potential concern that has been raised about the use of HFNCO in COVID-19 patients is that it could aerosolise the respiratory tract pathogen. Using evidence from several recently published studies, the WHO concluded that HFNCO does not create widespread dispersion of exhaled air, and therefore, should be associated with low risk of transmission of respiratory viruses. 9 They do recommend wearing a standard medical face mask if a medical provider is within 2 m of the patient. However, a newer study showed that the distance of droplet dispersion from coughing increases by an average of 0.42 m with highflow nasal cannula, and travelled further than the WHO-recommended 2-m safe exclusion zone. 10 Based on this evidence, at our institution we ensure that COVID-19 patients on HFNCO are at the least in singleoccupancy rooms with either negative pressure or high-efficiency particulate air filtration systems, and that all our healthcare workers caring for those patients wear full airborne personal protective equipment (i.e. N95 masks or equivalent, gown, gloves, goggles, hair covers and face shields).",

The physiological benefits of HFNCO are improved oxygenation, decreased anatomical dead space, decreased metabolic demand of breathing, decreased production of carbon dioxide, superior comfort and improved work of breathing, positive nasopharyngeal and tracheal airway pressure and better secretion clearance.First, the most important clinical benefit of HFNCO is that of efficient supplemental oxygen delivery. HFNCO therapy generates a flowdependent FiO 2 . 5 HFNCO therapy is able to maintain a high FiO 2 by delivering flows higher than the spontaneous inspiratory demand, thus minimising room-air entrainment. In order to maximise the benefit of HFNCO, the flow rate must be titrated to match the patient's inspiratory demand and severity of respiratory distress. Second, HFNCO is also able to decrease anatomic dead space by washing CO 2 out of the upper airways. Reduction in anatomic dead space then leads to improved work of breathing and lowerDisclosure: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

While alveolar recruitment results from the positive airway pressure, the magnitude of this effect is variable, and its clinical significance remains somewhat controversial. However, studies have estimated the positive pressure delivered through HFNCO to equal roughly 1 mm H 2 O for every 10 l of flow. 7,8 In order to maximise the above-mentioned benefits of HFNCO, it is imperative to maintain the flow at the highest tolerated by the patient, usually at least 30-40 l/minute.",
