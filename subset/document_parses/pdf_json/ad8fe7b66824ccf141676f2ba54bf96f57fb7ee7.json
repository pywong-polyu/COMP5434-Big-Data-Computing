Sharing experiences in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking international cooperation is an effective way to facilitate countries' search for appropriate measures to prevent and control the pandemic. The new local confirmed case of COVID-19 suddenly appeared in Beijing on June 11, when there are 56 consecutive days with no new local cases but rapidly controlled in a short period. Its systematic strategy to combat the pandemic is worth sharing and learning from. Beijing's pandemic prevention and control measures can be summarized in the \"coordination, classification, and collaboration\" approach. Based on this prevention and control strategy, Beijing's anti-pandemic work coordinated the government, society, and individuals' forces. It divided the critical works of pandemic prevention and control, coordinated the conflict between anti-pandemic work and production life, and finally achieved the smooth anti-pandemic work. Beijing's experience in fighting the pandemic can provide one of the solutions to mitigate the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis.",

After a new case was diagnosed locally in Beijing on 11 June, the government quickly organized an epidemiological investigation and targeted the source of infection-Xinfadi Market-within 24 h. In the early morning of 13 June, the government issued an announcement that the Xinfadi market was temporarily closed, and 11 communities around the market were closed for management. After that, the government took a series of targeted measures to prevent and control the pandemic. Government departments play a key role in the development of prevention and control policies, the deployment of personnel, and the proper allocation of resources.

The second is the closure of some of the priority neighborhoods, with nucleic acid testing in priority areas and for priority groups. Unlike the Pandemic in Wuhan, the masses are also relatively free to leave Beijing for production and living needs.

Of these, coordination, classification, and collaboration are interrelated . The combination of the three promotes mutual cooperation among the government, society, and individuals, which is conducive to the mutual coordination of anti-pandemic work, production, and life. The coordination is government-led. In the process of pandemic prevention and control, the roles played by the government, social organizations, and the masses are different. Therefore, based on clarifying the functions of district-level governments, social organizations, and the masses, the Beijing municipal government has coordinated the corresponding anti-pandemic work to ensure the reasonable allocation of anti-pandemic resources. The relevant state departments and the Beijing Municipal Government are the decision-makers. As decision-makers, they first quickly set the general level of prevention and control based on the development of the Pandemic in Beijing, in order to allocate human and material resources appropriately. Subsequently, relevant city and district government departments organized relevant professionals to conduct citywide surveys, actively test and track close contacts, and fully control fever clinics and nucleic acid testing sites in hospitals at all levels. By 20 June, the number of nucleic acid testing facilities had expanded to 124, and the maximum daily testing capacity had increased from 100,000 to more than 230,000. 9 At the same time, the process of building the city's nucleic acid testing capacity and the nucleic acid testing capacity of secondary general hospitals continues. In response to the problems in the prevention and control of hospital infections, city leaders first quickly interviewed the person in charge of relevant medical institutions. Strengthening the supervision and inspection of hospital infection prevention and control work, and strict implementation of medical staff, patients, and accompanying staff of the prevention and control requirements were ensured to maintain the capital's pandemic prevention and control situation. In addition, the municipality strictly manages the number of visitors to Beijing from medium-and high-risk areas to reduce the risk of infection.",

After the second Pandemic in Beijing, the government quickly mobilized social forces to participate in the prevention and control of the pandemic.

For example, they were assisting community workers with outreach and surveys, delivering household items to people in home isolation, and providing psychosocial support services. The general public, on the other hand, consciously fulfilled their responsibilities, reduced travel, protected themselves, and actively cooperated in the prevention and control of the pandemic.
