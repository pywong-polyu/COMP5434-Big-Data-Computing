Using a standard extraction sheet, data were gathered for all patients admitted to the Toxicology Unit with self-poisoning between Jan 1, 2019, and Aug 31, 2020. Only patients classified by the treating clinician as having intentionally self-poisoned were included. Data on date of admission, age or date of birth, sex, and poisoning method were collected. No data on ethnicity were available. We used interrupted time-series analysis to calculate weekly hospital admissions for self-poisoning before (Jan 1, 2019-March 19, 2020) and during (March 20-Aug 31, 2020) the pandemic, overall and by age (age <25 years vs \u226525 years) and sex.

Being in lockdown appears to have contributed to feelings of isolation, experiences of domestic violence, financial and job insecurity, and social stigma associated with COVID-19, all of which can contribute to an increased risk of suicidal behaviour. 1 Despite potential concerns over the negative impact of the pandemic on suicide and self-harm, emerging evidence from many countries suggests that during the early months after the COVID-19 outbreak, there was either no change or a reduction in suicide deaths. 2 This evidence, however, needs to be interpreted with caution given that almost no data from low-income and middleincome countries (LMICs) were included in this study.",

From April 27, 2020, the rules were changed to allow individuals time outside their homes to allow access to essential services. The initial lockdown periods were enforced by the army and police, and movement was continuously and strictly restricted, except for eme rgencies and for people working in essential services.

We developed a living systematic review that searches the literature daily via PubMed, Scopus, medRxiv, bioRxiv, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset by Semantic Scholar, the Allen Institute for AI, and the WHO COVID-19 database. We used an extensive list of search terms for suicide (eg, \"suicid*\"), suicidal behaviour (eg, \"attempted suicide\"), and self-harm (eg, \"self-harm*\"), in combination with terms for COVID-19 (eg, \"coronavirus\" OR \"COVID*\" or \"SARS-CoV-2\"; appendix 3 p 1). Databases were searched between Jan 1, 2020, and March 23, 2020, with no language restrictions (appendix 3 p 1). As of March 23, 2020, there were 47 articles on LMICs (24 [51%] were based on media reports), with no studies accounting for temporal trends in self-harm, and only one time-series study reporting on the impact of the pandemic on suicide rates in Peru (a middle-income country); this study found a decrease in suicide deaths.",

Some caution is required in case individuals who had self-harmed were less likely to present to hospital after self-poisoning. Failure to seek treatment might result in adverse consequences of untreated poisoning, including death, and in the lack of appropriate psychiatric assessment and aftercare in this high-risk population. If the fall in hospital presentations during the pandemic reflects a reduction in the medical treatment of people who have self-poisonedeg, because of their concerns about the risk of contracting COVID-19 while in hospital-rather than a true decline in incidence, then public health messages should emphasise the importance of seeking help early. See Online for appendix 3 for self-poisoning in Sri Lanka through routinely collected hospital data. This register included both retrospective (Jan 1, 2019-June 15, 2020) and ongoing collection of hospital admissions for self-poisoning. The start date was chosen to include sufficient time before the pandemic to allow for the modelling of pre-pandemic trends. All individuals who present with poisoning at Teaching Hospital Peradeniya are admitted to the Toxicology Unit for treatment, and there were no changes to poisoning admission procedures because of the pandemic. The physical location of the Toxicology Unit changed within Teaching Hospital Peradeniya, with the previous location being designated a COVID-19 isolation ward on March 26, 2020. This change resulted in the capacity of the ward being reduced to 18 beds from 36. However, the admission policy remained unchanged, such that patients requiring hospital treatment were admitted irrespective of bed availability. Both accidental and intentional poisoning admission numbers were collected from the Toxicology Unit admission books, and the classification of accidental or intentional was decided by the treating clinician. Admission book data and information from bed head tickets were used to identify cases of self-poisoning (ie, intentional self-harm by ingesting poison). A bed head ticket is the medical record of the inpatient and contains all relevant information regarding the patient's stay, including any related history. The overall number of admissions per month were collected from the admission books and used to trace bed head tickets for detailed information regarding admissions (eg, type of poison ingested). Where bed head tickets were unable to be traced, admission books were revisited to collect admission dates. Admission due to accidental poisoning was excluded from the analysis. Using a standard extraction sheet, data were gathered for all self-poisoning cases admitted to the ward between Jan 1, 2019, and Aug 31, 2020. Data were collected by trained clinical research assistants under the supervision of the study authors, who regularly checked the admission books against the data collected from bed head tickets to ensure cases were not missed. The data were extracted by a single research assistant. Data on date of admission, age or date of birth, sex, and poisoning method were collected. Ethnicity data were not available from routine records. Ethical approval for the register was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya.",

We fitted Poisson regression models with a scale parameter to account for overdispersion. We fitted models for the overall number of presentations by sex and age groups. We used the fp function in Stata statistical software (version 16.1) to incorporate longer-term time trends as fractional polynomials in each of these models. We hypothesised that there would be a step change in weekly hospital presentations, and therefore all of our models included a binary coded predictor in the model that represented the pandemic period and included the period when lockdown restrictions were in place. We report the effect of this predictor as a rate ratio with 95% CI. For age-stratified and sex-stratified models, we used the Kandy district population data as an offset term to allow us to make a direct comparison between the strata. To test whether the impact of the lockdown measures differed by age or sex, we fitted interrupted time-series regression models including age or sex (binary variable) as a covariate and formally tested for an interaction. We graphically present weekly changes in self-poisoning admissions overall, and by age group, sex, and poison type.",

We found that during the first 5 months of the pandemic, the number of hospital admissions for selfpoisoning reduced by nearly a third, mainly due to a reduction in presentations due to overdoses of analgesics. The findings of this study differ from similar previous investigations in neighbouring countries (India and Nepal), where there are reports of an increase in hospital presentations for self-harm 7 and suicide. 6 However, these previous investigations did not take into account prepandemic trends. 6, 7 Given that pre-pandemic reports have indicated that the number of people presenting to hospital with self-harm and suicide in India and Nepal have increased over time, [17] [18] [19] the reported increases during the pandemic might reflect increases due to other underlying factors, as opposed to an increase related to the pandemic. A previous investigation in another middle-income country (Peru) modelled underlying trends of suicide and indicated a step reduction in suicide during the first few months of the pandemic. This reduction is similar to the findings of suicides in high-income countries. [20] [21] [22] Tracking the effects of the pandemic will be key, as emerging evidence from Japan, Vienna, and Puerto Rico suggests that following an initial decline in suicidal behaviour, rates have started to increase. 2, 23 The reduction in hospital presentations for selfpoisoning in Sri Lanka during the first few months of the pandemic period could be due to a reduced incidence of self-poisoning as a consequence of increased social integration during times of community-wide disasters. 24 The absence of data to assess social integration, or community-level mental distress (including community self-harm), means the hypothesis is difficult to test. Evidence in high-income countries suggests that levels of suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviour in the community have not changed during the pandemic period. 25, 26 Reassuringly, the age-adjusted rate of suicide in Sri Lanka in 2020 was slightly lower than the rate in 2019 (13\u00b79 per 100 000 vs 14\u00b72 per 100 000 population), with suicide deaths due to poisoning also showing a decline (data available on request from the Department of Police, Sri Lanka).",

The absence of a rise, as indicated in our data, might reflect increased proximity of household members during the pandemic period; thus, the opportunity to self-poison might have decreased or access to services after a self-harm incident might have been controlled by perpetrators of domestic violence. In addition, domestic violence and conflicts are often associated with alcohol misuse by male household members in Sri Lanka. 31 During the early pandemic restrictions, the Sri Lankan Government banned the sale of alcohol. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 2019, the alcohol sale ban appears to have resulted in a reduction of self-reported family problems as a consequence of \"husband[s] reducing alcohol use\". 32 The survey also indicated that 80% of respondents who reported consuming alcohol had reduced their consumption during the pandemic (both legal and illegal).",

If self-poisoning in the community has not declined, a reduced willingness to present to hospital might have serious implications for the long-term health of individuals who have ingested poison. If so, increasing awareness about the importance of seeking treatment immediately after self-poisoning should be part of public health messages during the pandemic, while taking care to avoid any inadvertent glamourisation of self-harm behaviours. Further work assessing and tracking the level of community level mental distress is urgently needed, with specific investigations into whether treatment seeking for self-poisoning has changed.",

The pandemic restrictions did not affect farming activities, and agricultural supplies, including agrochemicals, were still available. 35 The movement restrictions and closures of centres that collect and distribute produce have disrupted the market for perishable fruit and vegetables, affecting farming livelihoods. 35 The negative economic impact coupled with access to pesticides might result in increased self-harm and suicide in farming households as the impact of the lockdown measures is realised. Nearly two-thirds of the Sri Lankan work force are part of the informal economy: these individuals are likely to be hardest hit by the negative impact of the pandemic on the national economy as it is a group that is already at highest risk of suicide and self-harm. 36 Support for these individuals must continue and be increased as needed to prevent suicide and self-harm.",

            "text": "This study has methodological limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, we tracked the impact of the pandemic only on people presenting to hospital with self-poisoning and it is possible that during the pandemic people substituted self-poisoning with other methods. Individuals who self-harm by other methods might be less likely to present to hospital because the method is more amenable to self-care or associated with a higher case fatality. 37 Second, the data used in this analysis for presentations before June 1, 2020, were collected retrospectively through admission book and bed head ticket notes review. Whilst every attempt was made to retrieve at least the basic characteristics for each admission, we were unable to do this for a small proportion of cases. The inclusion of these cases might have altered our results, although our sensitivity analysis did not indicate that this would have been the case. Third, given that the physical location of the ward changed within Teaching Hospital Peradeniya after 6 days of the announcement of lockdown in Sri Lanka, we are unable to formally evaluate whether the changes we observed were driven by a reduction in self-poisoning presentations to hospital, or due to a knock-on effect on referrals within the hospital because of the change in location and reduction in ward capacity. It is possible that staff in the outpatient department (synonymous with an emergency department) were less likely to refer patients with poisoning because fewer toxicology beds were available. In the first 10 weeks of the pandemic, we found no evidence that occupancy rates differed compared with the same days in 2019 (appendix 3 p 2). It is against hospital policy to turn away patients who need admission-if capacity is reached, patients are admitted as 'floor' patients and allocated to wards. We found evidence this occurred during early June, 2020, sug gesting that ward capacity is unlikely to have been a significant contributor to our findings. Fourth, we could not accommodate seasonal trends in our models as we were only able to collect data for 15 months before the pandemic. However, comparison with March, 2019, did not suggest that any of the changes observed following the onset of lockdown in March, 2020, could be due to seasonal effects. Fifth, our analysis is restricted to a single hospital in the Kandy district, and known regional variations in suicidal behaviour in Sri Lanka 38,39 mean that our findings might not apply to other districts. Last, the results referred to here are restricted to the impact of COVID-19 during the early months of the pandemic. As the effects of the initial lockdown measures are realised and the pandemic continues, it will be important to continue surveillance to assess the longer term consequences of the pandemic and the lockdown, such as socioeconomic repercussions.",
