The objective of this research is to design a measurement that could be utilised to predict the efficacy of a lockdown decision. Methods: One would expect that the effectiveness of lockdown lies in the assumption that the virus spreads from one area to another area in a rippling way. If the virus spreads in a radiating way, then lockdown should be an effective countermeasure to contain the pandemic. On the other hand, if it spreads indiscernibly or randomly, then a lockdown decision would have lesser or little effect on the containment. We mainly combine graphs and metric to compute correlation matrices, which would measure whether the virus spreads in a rippling way. The metric used is to measure the boundary (or county) distances between counties. We take 3073 counties and equivalents in the USA and explore the property of contagion with respect to distance. The distance between any two counties is measured by the number of neighbours (or counties) between them. Then, we study the relation between contagion and distances. The relation between distance (complexity of neighbouring) and confirmed cases (contagion) is further explored. Results: Then, we study the relation between contagion and distances. The relation between distance (complexity of neighbouring) and confirmed cases (contagion) could be explored. Our research shows county lockdown in the USA plays no important role in containing the spread of coronavirus for the time being. Conclusion: Rippling effect in the USA regarding COVID-19 is not significant. This indicates other robust approaches or policies should be taken into consideration, rather than a simple lockdown policy.",

            "text": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of deaths, tracking the contagion and containing the spread has become an important global issue. The pandemic affects all sorts of people, regardless of their ages. 1 The transmissibility and severity of the pandemic have also caused a huge concern about risk management, 2 since the strength of the healthcare system would be put into its ultimate test. 3 Many countries have adopted preventive measures or containing approaches to combat such pandemicamong them, lockdown probably is the measure taken the most despite its controversy. Lockdown would bring some psychological issues, 4 educational problems, 5 and so on, 6 despite the fact that other alternatives are also adopted. [7] [8] [9] Decisions of lockdown might affect the trajectory of contagion of COVID-19. 12, 13 Though some claim they are very effective, 14 some regard them controversial. 15 Henceforth, some systematic approaches and models are applied in studying the effect of lockdown. 10, 11 In addition to some criteria for lockdown decision, 16 one also needs to consider the timing of lockdown. 17 Too early lift of the lockdown might cause a second wave of pandemic, while a delayed one might further deteriorate the economy and normal daily life. In order to evaluate a lockdown decision, one needs to delve into the spreading mechanisms of COVID-19. If it spreads in a pattern that ripples from areas to their neighbouring areas, then one could expect that a lockdown might deter the rippling spread and contain the virus; if not, then one could also anticipate that a lockdown decision would produce little effect on the containment. Such rippling effect is witnessed by studying the spreading behaviours between all the bordering areas. The main objective of this paper is to study the property of such spread in the USA during some period of time. 18 We study 3073 Counties and Equivalents in the USA to understand whether lockdown in the county scale is an effective approach for the time being. We devise a systematic mechanism to answer this question by combining the graph theory and metric, in particular the minimal distances between nodes, in one framework. The Counties are identified with nodes (or vertices) of a network (or tree). The number of neighbours from one county to another is associated with the edges. Then a metric of minimal edge is applied to calculate the distance between two counties. This distance will reveal the number of bordered counties between any two counties -the higher the value, the more the bordered counties between the two given counties. The basic idea is if a county has more bordered counties, then it would have higher contacting rate of the virus -if the rippling effect really presents. We will trace the relation between contagion and distance to identify whether the rippling effect really exists in the USA. Henceforth, the values of distances will serve our independent variables. Then we measure the similarity of evolution (from a period of 169 days) between counties via correlation matrix. These values will serve our dependent variable. The relation between distance (complexity of neighbouring) and confirmed cases (contagion) could be explored. Our research shows there is little rippling effect of COVID-19 between neighbouring counties in the USA. This result shall reach a conclusion that a county lockdown decision in the USA plays no important role in containing the spread of coronavirus for the time being. This result also echoes other research of invalidity of lockdown in western European countries. 19 ",

The essential part of lockdown or not depends on the effectiveness of such measurewhich in turn relies on the rippling spread of the virus. In this article, we sample county data in the USA for a period of time and utilise our minimal metric, which takes the number of bordered counties into consideration, to study the relation between the contagion of COVID-19 and the distances. Our result shows that the spread of virus in the USA is not related to the rippling type of spreading. To some degree, this indicates a lockdown in county scales would not be an effective containing approach at this stage. This shall shed some light on how to effectively adopt other methods to deter the contagion of this virus. There are some limitations, shortcomings and future work. Firstly, we do not take the gender, age, etc., into consideration. Hence, our conclusion only applied to the general public. However, some lockdown policies might benefit some groups from the contagion. Secondly, we do not really tackle the qualitative properties of the lockdown, but only focus on the numeric values. This might be a shortcoming by overlooking the exact content and procedures capsulised in a lockdown policy. Thirdly, this study focuses solely on USA territories. In order to grasp a much comprehensive picture about lockdown policy again contagion of COVID-19, lockdown policies and effect in other countries should also be compared. In this study, we mainly use chain metric as our distance function. Other structural metrics 20 could be also applied in the future work. In addition, if the lockdown policy does not work, one should further explore the underlying reasons for the failure: whether it is people who are reluctant to comply with the rules or whether the viruses are clever enough to detour around the lockdown policies. 21 ",
