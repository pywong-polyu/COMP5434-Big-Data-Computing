By March 22nd, New York City was a global epicenter of the pandemic, accounting for over 5% of cases worldwide (Evelyn, 2020) . On April 9th, there were more confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state of New York than any other country (Winsor et al., 2020) . Urgent measures were taken to control the spread of COVID-19, including a state-wide shelter-in-place order, and individuals had to adapt to shifting restrictions, home confinement, unexpected financial strain, and uncertainty regarding risk of infection.",

The majority of research aimed at characterizing the effect of the pandemic on mental health have been largely limited to samples from China and Europe. COVID-19 related experiences and increased psychopathology symptoms may vary as a function of geographical location, spread of disease, and government response, and it is critical to determine whether initial results generalize to other regions. Moreover, most studies have failed to consider what specific aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to changes in psychopathology, and it is unclear whether the pandemic is having a global impact on mental health or more specific experiences are associated with particular disorders and symptoms. Finally, few studies have examined longitudinal, within-person changes in symptoms among U.S. samples, and even fewer have sought to examine predictors of poor outcomes (Lee et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Thus, the current study aims to examine longitudinal, within-person changes in internalizing symptoms, pandemic-related experiences contributing to changes in symptoms, and pre-pandemic predictors of changes in symptoms among a U.S. population situated in one of the epicenters of the pandemic.",

This model purports that personality can be defined by five dimensional traits: neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness (McCrae & John, 1992) . The Five-Factor Model has gained much traction over recent years, leading many researchers to investigate its links to psychopathology. Though research supports relationships between all five traits and various forms of psychopathology (Malouff et al., 2005) , particular traits have shown more consistent, general relationships with psychopathology disorders and symptoms. Neuroticism, which reflects a trait disposition to experience negative emotions (Lahey, 2009) , has often emerged as a robust, nonspecific risk factor for psychopathology (Klein et al., 2011) . Research indicates that neuroticism shows strong relationships with internalizing disorders, suggesting that it may reflect a general liability for psychopathology (Kotov et al., 2010; Tackett et al., 2008) . Indeed, initial evidence has indicated that greater neuroticism was associated with increased stress (Liu et al., 2020) and predicted increased negative affect (Kroencke et al., 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

HRV is a measure of the autonomic nervous system's ability to flexibly respond and adapt to challenging stimuli in the environment Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is an indicator of HRV that is thought to index vagal control of the parasympathetic nervous system. Like HRV, RSA is measured by examining the variations in time between consecutive heart beats, but, unlike HRV, RSA specifically examines this variation during respiration cycles. RSA measures the increase in heart rate during inhalation and a decrease in heart rate during exhalation. Thus, RSA is a measure of the parasympathetic modulation of the heart via the vagus nerve. Research suggests that lower resting RSA indexes poorer emotion regulation and executive functioning capabilities (Beauchaine, 2015; Hamilton & Alloy, 2016) . Meta-analyses have found that blunted RSA is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders (Chalmers et al., 2014; Koenig et al., 2016) and is a marker of depression symptom severity and response to treatment (Chambers & Allen, 2002) . However, no studies have examined whether RSA predicts changes in internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Pre-COVID-19 self-report measures of neuroticism, anxiety, and depression as well as RSA were collected from undergraduate students. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in New York, participants were invited to complete a follow-up assessment between April 17th and May 30th, which coincided with a spike in COVID-19 cases and shelter-in-place orders. The follow-up assessment included self-report measures of internalizing symptoms and COVID-19-related experiences. We hypothesized that there would be increased internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also conducted analyses examining what COVID-19 experiences were associated with changes in internalizing symptoms. Finally, given that high neuroticism and a blunted RSA have been associated with greater psychopathology, we hypothesized that greater neuroticism and lower RSA would predict greater increases in psychopathology. We also conducted an exploratory analysis examining whether there was an interaction between neuroticism and RSA in relation to changes in psychopathology. We hypothesized that the combination of both high neuroticism and blunted RSA would predict the greatest increases in psychopathology. We aimed to add to the extant literature highlighting the importance of neuroticism and RSA as a risk factors for psychopathology by examining whether these risk factors predicted sudden changes in internalizing symptoms in the context of a global pandemic.",

The IDAS-II is a 99-item self-report questionnaire that measures a range of depression, anxiety, and bipolar symptoms over the past two weeks (Watson et al., 2012) . Each symptom is rated on a 5-point Likert scale from not as all (1) to extremely (5). Individual items are scored to create a total of 18 subscales. In the present study, the IDAS-II was used a diagnostic screener. Additionally, distress, fear/obsessions, and positive mood symptom composites were calculated using the factor weights from Watson et al. (2012) that has since been replicated using normed data (Nelson et al., 2018) . The IDAS-II demonstrated good to excellent internal consistency at the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 assessment (\u03b1 ranged from 0.71-0.88 and 0.73-0.90, respectively).",

Conversely, school concerns and home confinement concerns were both independently associated with decreases in the positive mood symptom composite. This provides evidence to suggest that school-related challenges, such as the sudden transition to online teaching platforms, as well as strict lockdown measures, may be contributing to lower positive mood. The distress symptom composite showed no independent associations with specific COVID-19 pandemic experiences, indicating that while pandemic experiences may have some independent relationships with symptom changes, these experiences may also be contributing to a higher order factor (e.g., broader internalizing dimension), which is associated with changes across all three internalizing symptom composites.",

Third, although the IDAS-II was used as a diagnostic screener, diagnostic interviews are still required to confirm categorical psychopathology. Additionally, although we chose to investigate resting state RSA, other measures of RSA may also be important to consider. Lastly, the psychometric properties of the Pandemic Experiences Survey are not as sound as other more rigorously tested measures due to the time constraint in developing this measure. Thus, this questionnaire does not have factorial, convergent, or discriminant validity. Future studies are encouraged to monitor symptom change over the course of the pandemic, especially among those with high neuroticism and low RSA, to determine whether heightened internalizing symptoms present in the beginning of the pandemic are transitory or sustained throughout the pandemic and if personality and autonomic vulnerability factors are predictors of symptom trajectories and/or other long-term mental health outcomes. Measures of neuroticism and RSA are relatively low cost and do not take much time to administer. Therefore, it may be advantageous for clinicians and researchers to use these methods to target samples that may be more reactive to pandemic related experiences and in need of additional mental health resources.",
