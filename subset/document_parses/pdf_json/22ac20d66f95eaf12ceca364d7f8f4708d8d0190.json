The obtained results show that smart city construction significantly improves the quality of public occupational health, and it is still valid after a series of robustness tests. The effect of this policy is stronger in cities that belong to the Pearl River Delta region or sub-provincial level cities. This study indicates that the central government should improve the pilot evaluation system and the performance appraisal mechanism of smart cities from the perspective of top-level design during the process of promoting smart city construction, which aims to correctly guide local governments to promote the construction of smart cities. To achieve the full improvement effect of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health, local governments should implement smart city strategies in a purposeful and planned way according to the actual situation of the development of the jurisdiction.",

The strong aspiration and the demand for a better life of people in all countries, especially in developing countries, have injected endless impetus into urbanisation. Urbanisation has greatly promoted the development of society, economy, and science and technology. However, at the same time, it has brought great challenges to the sustainable development of human beings, and it also brings new challenges to the Earth's capital environment (1) . Urban issues (such as traffic, environment, housing, employment, public safety, and health) are prevalent in cities worldwide. These problems have begun to seriously affect the sustainable development of the economy and the quality of life of human beings (2) . With the gradual maturity and wide application of internet technology, human beings have stepped into the era of knowledge networks. Knowledge innovation and application have become the key factors leading to economic and social development and progress (3) . Especially since the beginning of the 21st century, as the global urban population continues to increase, as a solution to the economic and social problems brought by unprecedented rapid urbanisation, smart city construction has become a trend of the times and plays an important role in promoting and leading the healthy development of cities.",

Once the concept of a \"smart city\" was put forward, foreign countries, especially developed countries in Europe and the United States, actively put it into practise, and the construction system of smart cities has become increasingly perfect. In the United States, Europe and developed Asian countries, including (Japan, South Korea, and Singapore), smart city construction projects are in full swing and have achieved remarkable results (5, 6) . After more than 40 years of rapid development through reform and opening up in China, urban issues (such as serious environmental pollution, frequent safety accidents, traffic congestion, and housing shortage) have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the quality of public occupational health is suffering from a huge impact due to problems such as imperfect regulations and standards, lax safety supervision and law enforcement, imperfect supervision systems and mechanisms, weak safety foundation, and weak emergency rescue capacity. Therefore, driven by the Internet of Things, Internet and cloud computing-based information technology, smart city pilot policy of China has begun to develop.",

Can the pilot policies of smart city construction improve the quality of public occupational health? Based on the balanced panel data of 20 cities in Guangdong Province, China, this article empirically tests the impact of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health. The main marginal contribution is reflected in the following three aspects. First, this article uses the data from 20 cities in the Guangdong Province from 2001 to 2019 for the first time and discusses the influencing factors of public occupational health quality from the perspective of smart city construction, which has important practical significance for how to effectively improve the public occupational health at present. Second, this article uses the smart city pilot as a \"quasi-natural\" experiment, effectively overcomes the estimation errors of traditional research methods, and conducts a multidimensional robustness test, which aims to be more accurately analysing the impact of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health. Third, from the perspective of administrative levels and regional differences, this paper further analyses the factors that may affect the policy effect of smart city construction and provides some enlightenment for the reasonable layout and continuous improvement of smart city construction policies.",

This involves developing new ways and measures to improve urban public management and provide public services (7) . There are many similarities between the concepts of smart cities and digital cities (8, 9) , but smart cities are considered to be a broader concept that aims to unite, facilitate, and encourage the dissemination of information to improve the quality of public life. All of these are different due to the different cooperative relationships among urban stakeholders (10) . Different governance methods of smart cities lead to vague and inconsistent views on the concept of smart cities (11) . Nevertheless, most scholars agree that smart cities are a broad concept. By mobilising various forces and applying interdisciplinary knowledge, smart city subjects seek innovative and sustainable governance solutions to solve many problems of urbanisation. In other words, smart cities can be described as regions presented in a forward-looking way.",

As one of the goals of smart city construction and high-quality economic development, the influence of these factors on the quality of public occupational health has undoubtedly become one of the key areas for scholars to study (12) . From the perspective of enterprise management, Chen et al. (13) performed a statistical analysis of 410 major gas explosion accidents from 1980 to 2000 and determined that the proportion of accidents caused by human factors exceeded 96.59%, indicating that coal mine accident is a management problem rather than an unsolvable technical problem. The \"Swiss Cheese Model\" proposed by Reason (14) established the link between unsafe behaviours, unsafe conditions, and organisational management behaviours, and attributed the cause of accidents to the superposition of individual mistakes and organisational management mistakes.",

Mine accidents in China mainly occur in small and medium-sized coal mines dominated by township coal mines because they lack clear property rights, stable expectations, adequate safety input, and perfect occupational health conditions (15) . Cohn and Wardlaw (16) used corporate data in the United States and determined that an excessive corporate debt ratio would lead to insufficient investment and more work-related accidents. Nie and Zhao (17) used the panel data of coal enterprises of China from 2001 to 2006 and determined that the corporate debt ratio significantly increased the number of deaths in mining accidents and greatly affected the quality of the occupational health of workers. In addition, the low level of production technology, lack of safety measures, backward health concepts, and lack of property rights protection systems are also the key factors that threaten the quality of occupational health (18) .",

            "text": "The last aspect concerns the impact of political factors on the quality of public occupational health. The role of government regulation is first emphasised. Lewis and Alford (19) believed that the occupational health of workers was determined by the enforcement of government regulatory policies. Using the legislation of the United States in 1941 and 1969, they tested the relationship between enforcement and coal mine mortality and determined that the strengthening of government regulation could help reduce the number of mining deaths, thus, improving the quality of occupational health of workers. However, Grey and Scholz (20) determined that the safety regulatory agencies in the United States were ineffective when using the data, thus, proposing a theory to refute regulation. Appropriate hard regulation can, indeed, improve the quality of occupational health (21) , but overly strict regulatory policies cannot achieve the purpose of protecting workers and improving safety (22) . Despite the lack of binding legal force, soft regulation is considered an important governance tool to improve the quality of occupational health, especially when combined with hard regulation (23, 24) . Some scholars also emphasise the influence of political connexions. Fisman and Wang (25) used data on Chinese-listed companies from 2008 to 2013 to analyse the relationship between political affiliations and corporate accidents and determined that the death rate of politically affiliated companies was two to three times higher than that of companies without political affiliations. Jia and Nie (26) regard the \"centralisation-decentralisation-centralisation\" of key state-owned coal mine regulators in China from 1995 to 2005 as a \"quasi-natural\" experiment and find that decentralisation of coal mine supervision leads to more collusion between local governments and coal mining enterprises, resulting in higher mortality and lower occupational health quality.",

According to the transaction cost theory proposed by Coase, transaction cost refers to the cost of obtaining accurate market information, negotiation, and contract costs (28) . Smart can expand limited rational cost, inhibit opportunism behaviours, reduce the uncertainty, and enhance the role of trading frequency to drive the enterprise transaction cost reduction (29) , to change the enterprise organisation form, to influence enterprise production, management, marketing, and the purchasing mode, to significantly strengthen the internal management, and to improve production efficiency (30) , which helps improve the occupational health of enterprises. Smart city construction optimises the government service function and improves the efficiency of the occupational health quality management of the government, which realises the wisdom of economy, transportation, environment, life, government service, and other fields through the accumulation of big data and the development of emerging technologies (31) . Especially in the field of government services, smart city construction realises the reengineering of government processes and the transformation of government functions, which help to improve the governance capacity and the management level of the government and provide capacity guarantees for the quality of public occupational health. Smart city construction can effectively alleviate the disadvantages of collusion between the government and enterprises, which improves the ability of the government to supervise public occupational health. The literature on government-enterprise collusion points out that the existence of information asymmetry between the central government and local governments and the economic performance appraisal system under political centralisation leads to the formation of collusion between local governments and enterprises (26) . Smart city construction can contain many people in the government and enterprises and embed input control, processing control, and output control into the system to effectively reduce the opportunistic behaviours, such as mutual use, collusion, and collusion between local governments and enterprises caused by the information asymmetry between the central government and local governments. Through the construction of smart cities, the government can effectively improve its decision-making and execution; enterprises can effectively improve operational efficiency and reduce transaction costs, and the public can enjoy a more convenient, comfortable, and healthy life.

For industries that rely on technology research and new technology, smart city construction policies may differ greatly due to differences in factor endowments in different regions. Because the institutional framework of regional development is the key factor that restrains the actual effect of policy, soft constraints (such as economic structure, education system, and policy reform) will restrict the effect of capital and other hard inputs. The actual development of smart cities in China is influenced by politics, economy and geographical location. Different regions have great differences in resources, technologies, and public occupational health management policies, which may affect the effect of smart city construction on improving public occupational health.

Cities with higher administrative levels are distributed in areas with convenient transportation, complete infrastructure, and a high level of openness. Their development advantages promote the accumulation of factor stocks, which aims to mobilise resources for urban innovation construction and promote and improve the construction system of smart cities. At the same time, cities with higher administrative levels have more power of administrative examination and approval, a higher financial scale, and more central strategic policy status.

            "text": "To more accurately assess the impact of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health, we incorporated six variables (including the economic development level, industrial structure, fixed asset investment level, population size, urbanisation level, research and development level, and government transition effect) into the control variables. The first variable considered is the level of economic development. Safety management investment is insufficient and is the important factor that brings about safety accidents to take place frequently. The economic development level is the higher area, and the safety management investment and the technical level are higher (37) . This article controls the impact of the economic development level on the quality of public occupational health by adding per capita GDP. The second variable considered is industrial structure. Safety accidents have obvious industrial characteristics. Both the mining industry and the construction industry belong to industries with poor safety status, and the fatality rate of the mining industry is much higher than the social average. In this article, the ratio of the total output value of the tertiary industry to the total output value of the secondary industry is used to measure the industrial structure. The third variable considered is an investment in fixed assets. The improvement of investment in fixed assets can help enterprises upgrade equipment and technical transformation, thus improving the safety management level of enterprises and reducing the death level of safety accidents (38) . This article uses fixed assets investment to measure. The fourth variable considered is population size. We controlled for the effect of population on the quality of public occupational health by adding the variable of population size. The fifth variable considered is the level of urbanisation. The higher the level of urbanisation, the higher is the public demand for health, which is conducive to promoting the improvement of the health level. Therefore, the improvement of the urbanisation level may lead to the improvement in the quality of public occupational health. This article uses the proportion of the urban population in the total population of each city for the measurement. The sixth variable considered is the level of research and development. A low level of production technology is an important factor leading to the low quality of occupational health (39) , and the improvement of the research and development level is conducive to reducing the occurrence of occupational safety accidents and improving occupational health quality. In this article, the proportion of research and development personnel in the total population was measured (40, 41) . To ensure the accuracy of the measurement results, this paper performed logarithmic processing of the indicators. Descriptive statistics of related variables are shown in Table 2 . The number of observations in the treatment group is 43, accounting for approximately 11.32% of the total number of samples.",

Without controlling other factors, columns (1) and (2) show that the coefficient of smart city construction is negative, and the significance levels are 1% and 5%, respectively, indicating that smart city construction is powerful in promoting the quality of public occupational health. This article continues to introduce six control variables to obtain columns (3) and (4). The obtained results show that the coefficients of smart city construction are \u22120.276 and \u22120.179, respectively, and both pass the significance level of 1%, indicating that smart city construction reduces the death rate and the number of deaths by 0.276 and 0.179 units, respectively. Based on the results, it can be found that smart city construction has a significant positive effect on the quality of public occupational health. Hypothesis 1 is confirmed. From the obtained results of the control variable, the economic development level, the level of investment in fixed assets, the population size, the urbanisation level, the research and development level effect for the accident mortality have a significant negative effect except for industrial structure, but, in terms of deaths, only the economic development level, industrial structure, and population scale have a significant effect.",

If the treatment and the control groups had different time trends before being affected by the smart city pilot policy, the changes in the quality of public occupational health may not be caused by the smart city pilot but by the time trend before the policy pilot. With the help of the framework of event analysis, this paper examines again whether there is a parallel trend in the changes of the quality of public occupational health quality in the treatment and control groups before the smart city construction policy. Figures 3, 4 report the estimated dynamic effects of coefficients with dependent variables of the death rate and the death number, respectively. Figures 3, 4 show that the coefficient of smart city construction has not been estimated at the 5% significance level before the pilot year virtual variable, which indicates that the treatment and control groups were verified to meet parallel trend assumption. Namely, the smart city construction pilot-relative control group after the treatment group death rate significantly decreased is the result of smart city construction rather than the result of differences in advance. Meanwhile, the impact of smart city construction pilots on the quality of public occupational health has good policy sustainability.",

Specifically, control variables are first used to predict the probability of each city becoming a pilot city for smart city construction. Then, we used the nearest neighbor-matching method to match the control group of the smart city construction pilot city so that there was no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group before the smart city construction policy was issued to reduce the endogeneity problems caused by self-selection bias during the smart city construction pilot. Figures 5, 6 are the kernel density maps of the propensity score before and after matching, respectively. The obtained results show that there is the significant closeness between the treatment group and the control group after the matching; thus, the control group samples obtained through propensity score matching are effective. Finally, the DID model is used to identify the impact of smart city construction on public occupational health quality. Because PSM can solve the deviation problem of observable covariables to the greatest extent, while the DID model can eliminate the influence of unobserved variables, such as constant and synchronous change with time, the combination of the two methods can better identify the impact of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health.",

To control for the effects of these factors, the cross-term (Z * i Trend t ) of the baseline variable (Z i ) and the time-linear trend (Trend t ) are incorporated into the regression model to control the effect of the inherent differences between cities on the quality of public occupational health from a linear perspective.

This article constructs the interaction term of Wise and SUB variables to investigate the effect of administrative level differences on the impact of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health. Among the 20 cities in the Guangdong Province, Guangzhou and Shenzhen are subprovincial cities, while the other 18 cities are general prefecturelevel cities. When city i is Guangzhou or Shenzhen, SUB is assigned to one; otherwise, it is assigned to zero. The result is obvious from Table 9 . The coefficients of Wise * SUB are negative and pass the 1% significance level, which indicates that the effect of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health is stronger in sub-provincial cities, that is, the smart city construction effect on the improvement of the quality of city public occupational health is affected by the administrative level difference. Hypothesis 2 is adopted. Hypothesis 3 assumes that the improvement effect of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health may also be affected by regional differences. In this paper, the interaction term of Wise and PRD is used to investigate the effect of regional differences on the impact of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health. According to the \"Outline of the Reform and Development Plan for the Pearl River Delta region (2008-2020)\" issued in 2009, this paper demarcates the regional scope. Nine cities, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Jiangmen, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Huizhou, and Zhaoqing, are classified as PRD, and the remaining 12 cities are classified as non-PRD. When city i belongs to PRD, RGO is assigned a value of one; otherwise, it is assigned zero. As can be seen from the regression results of columns (1) and (3) in Table 10 , the coefficients of Wise * RGO are negative and pass the significance level of 1%, indicating that the improvement effect of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health is stronger in PRD. Namely, the improvement effect of smart city construction on the quality of public occupational health is affected by regional differences. Hypothesis 3 is also adopted.",

The obtained results determined that smart city construction significantly improves the quality of public occupational health, which is still valid after the parallel trend test, falsification test, PSM-DID test, and a series of other robustness tests. The effect of smart city construction on improving public occupational health quality is affected by the difference in administrative levels. Compared with general prefecture-level cities, the effect of smart city construction on improving occupational health quality is stronger in sub-provincial cities. The effect of smart city construction on improving public occupational health quality is also affected by regional differences. Compared with the region of the non-Pearl River Delta, the effect of smart city construction on improving the quality of occupational health is stronger in the region of the Pearl River Delta.",

First of all, with the aim of strengthening the policy effect of smart city construction and improving the quality of public occupational health, all government departments should deepen the construction of smart cities and deeply understand the integration of smart city construction. Then, local governments should give full play to the role of public service providers, build technological innovation and research platforms, and provide good research innovation and research environment, which aims to ensure that the smart city pilot can provide the continuous technological impetus for improving public occupational health in a stable market environment. Finally, the central government should promote smart city construction according to local conditions, fully consider the administrative differences and regional differences of the city, and implement supporting policies to ensure the effective operation of smart city pilot mechanisms and the full release of policy dividends to effectively improve the quality of public occupational health.",

            "text": "in the south of China, Guangdong Province is a very important economic province in China and a pioneer of reform and opening up. Since 1989, the GDP of Guangdong has been the first in China, and it has become the largest economic province in China. Its economic aggregate accounts for 1/8 of the national total, which has reached the level of uppermiddle-income countries. This paper uses the sampling data of Guangdong Province, which mainly considers two aspects. First, the data availability, because most cities did not release occupational health management-related indicators, but the \"Guangdong Statistical Yearbook\" and \"Statistical Bulletin on National Economic and Social Development\" of 20 cities released the related indicators. The second, the representativeness of the sample. Since the new century, the production safety accident types involved in transportation and warehousing, trade and manufacturing, construction and other fields and the economic and social development level of PRD and the eastern, western, and northern of Guangdong Province have obvious imbalances, which are similar to those of the whole country of China. We collect balanced panel data from 2001 to 2019 for 20 cities at the prefecture level and above in the Guangdong Province of China. All data are obtained from the \"Guangdong Statistical Yearbook\" and the \"Statistical Bulletin of National Economic and Social Development\" of each city.",
