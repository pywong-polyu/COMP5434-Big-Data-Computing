[2] [3] [4] Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) should be favored wherever population densities are high, but the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation recently listed covid-19 as the 45th most common cause of death in Africa, despite it being the 12th leading cause globally. 5 No obvious reason exists why covid-19 would not spread as efficiently in Nairobi, Accra, or Lagos as it has in New York City, London, or Mumbai. Most of the systematic evidence about the impact of covid-19 in Africa comes from South Africa, which has documented more than 750 000 cases, more than 20 000 deaths, and a case fatality rate of 2.7%. [6] [7] [8] The so-called \"Africa paradox\" has been the focus of several editorials in prominent journals, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] proposing several explanatory theories. These include that exposure to other coronaviruses has induced cross reactive herd immunity, 14 that the younger age structure of African populations allows its populations to tolerate covid-19 better, 15 that experience gained doi: 10 .1136/bmj.n334 | BMJ 2021;372:n334 | the bmj during the Ebola crisis allowed public health agencies across Africa to contain covid-19 better, 16 and that certain live attenuated vaccines (BCG vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and measles vaccines) engendered robust non-specific innate immune responses that also protect against covid-19. [17] [18] [19] We postulate a more mundane explanation for the Africa paradox: insufficient data. Africa is the world's poorest continent. Disease surveillance is resource intense and takes time to establish de novochallenges that are magnified in a global health emergency. Identifying deaths due to covid-19 might be challenging in countries with limited resources to establish new disease surveillance systems, particularly in countries with already high background mortality rates.",

A recent diagnosis of malaria was mentioned several times. However, in the absence of laboratory confirmation of this diagnosis, we interpreted this skeptically: malaria has effectively been eliminated from Lusaka but is still often diagnosed on the basis of unexplained fever or malaise without laboratory confirmation, symptoms that could easily have been due to covid-19 itself.

Conservatively, 15% of all participants who died between June and September 2020 had covid-19 during this period. If we assume that lower intensity PCR results (that is, cycle threshold 40-45) reflect waning viral loads and are not false positives, then the prevalence of covid-19 approached 20% of all deaths. Only a minority of the deceased had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before death. Several points merit further discussion. Firstly, most deaths occurred in the community and outside of medical care. Among the majority of people who died in the community, none had been tested for covid-19 before death. This is undoubtedly an important factor in underestimating the impact of covid-19 in Lusaka. Secondly, testing was rarely conducted among the minority of deaths that occurred in a facility, although nearly all these patients had presented with a constellation of symptoms typical of covid-19. We conclude that testing was neither widespread nor systematic. Thirdly, deaths with covid-19 occurred quite evenly across the age spectrum, not just among older people. Most deaths were in people aged 20-59 years. This pattern is distinct from that described in the US, the EU, and China [28] [29] [30] ; it is more typical of the death by age distributions and population age structures common in African countries. Although covid-19 was relatively under-represented in the younger population and relatively over-represented in the older population, the overall age distribution of deaths with covid-19 was similar to that seen in the burial registry cohort, supporting the theory that the presentation of covid-19 by age in this cohort is at least partially due to the expected distribution of deaths in Lusaka.",

The preponderance of gastrointestinal symptoms among children with covid-19 has been described previously. [31] [32] [33] [34] Such symptoms may occur as part of a broader constellation of complaints that may include respiratory symptoms in isolation or as part of the multisystem inflammatory disorder that has been identified as a rare complication of covid-19 in children. In its November 2020 update, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported that children accounted for between 0.00% and 0.23% of all covid-19 related deaths in the US, with 17 states reporting no deaths in children. 35 Given the extreme rarity of deaths with covid-19 among children in high income countries, we were surprised to observe any such deaths in a group of 70, let alone seven deaths with covid-19.

            "text": "If our data are generalizable to other settings in Africa, the answer to the question \"Why did covid-19 skip Africa?\" is that it didn't. To date, most of the systematically collected data on covid-19 in Africa come from South Africa, and those data suggest a substantial impact of covid-19. 6-8 However, South Africa is a comparatively wealthy nation with significant resources and expertise in surveillance. This makes it unrepresentative of most other African nations, including Zambia. Finding evidence of widespread systematic testing elsewhere in Africa is difficult. From sampling of blood donors, Kenya has reported seroprevalence rates among blood donors of between 5% and 9%, even as PCR positivity was reportedly low. 38 However, blood donors are probably not representative of the general population. As of November 24, 2020, the Nigerian Centers for Disease Control reported that only 0.3% of its population had been tested for covid-19. 39 Neither Nigeria nor Kenya reported the impact of covid-19 in terms of hospital admissions or deaths. Across the continent, as of October 30, 2020, the Africa Centers for Disease Control reported a cumulative total of 21 million tests for SARS-CoV-2, of which around 60% came from only This shows significant polarization to younger population age structure. Age distributions for the sampled and total populations are very similar, suggesting that the sample was representative of the larger population. By comparison, deaths with covid-19 show a relative increase in deaths among older people and a relative decrease in younger age groups. This tendency for deaths to be concentrated in older people is not unique, but the extent of the skew toward older people is less pronounced than that seen in the US, EU, and China. In those populations, the proportion of deaths is virtually nil in people under age 50 and almost entirely concentrated in those 65 and above, with deaths in children being almost undetectably few. By contrast, 10% of deaths in Lusaka were in children five of Africa's 54 countries: South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Kenya, and Ethiopia. 40 By contrast, the US, a country with less than a third the population of Africa, has conducted more than 192 million tests, for a per capita rate nearly 30 times higher. 41 Given these realities, an \"absence of evidence\" documenting the impact of covid-19 in Africa could easily be misconstrued as \"evidence of absence.\" However, understanding the true extent of covid-19's impact on Africa is critical. Firstly, a moral imperative exists that the world acknowledge suffering wherever it exists. Pragmatic reasons also exist, however. For one, if Africa's citizens themselves view covid-19 as posing little threat, they may be less vigilant about taking actions that mitigate their personal risk, such as socially distancing or wearing masks. Likewise, this error accepted at a global level could put Africa at a lower priority for access to covid-19 vaccines. The consequences of the misconception in both cases would be measured in lives.",

Within this period, we saw dynamic shifts in the biweekly prevalence of deaths with covid-19. Predicting how patterns of transmission might shift in the future is impossible, which justifies our ongoing surveillance work. Secondly, our study could infer links between deaths and covid-19 only when a PCR signal was detectable. This would fail to identify deaths indirectly due to covid-19, such as from heart attacks or strokes, that were separated in time from the infection. In an attempt to quantify the degree of excess mortality indirectly attributable to covid-19, we are collecting age and season specific burial records from Lusaka from the past several years. Thirdly, our assessment of underlying risk factors was limited by the completeness and accuracy of medical chart data and the possibly faulty recall of the next of kin. Hence, we had no way of verifying these conditions or assessing their duration and severity. An analysis of the association between potential risk factors and deaths with covid-19 is under way in our group. We note that the risk factor analysis provides insight into the related question of why some people are more likely to succumb to covid-19 than others, but it does not pertain to the question of Heat map corresponds to number of covid-19 positive cases by referral clinic for 70 covid-19 positive deaths in study. The four wards with the highest case burdens were George, Chawama, Kanyama, and Emmasdale compounds. These are also four of the poorest areas of Lusaka with the highest population and population densities. Bottom panel: satellite view of Lusaka taken using Google Earth, highlighting Kanyama and Chawama wards. These are the two largest population centers in Lusaka and the most impoverished. Even at lower magnification, the increased population density in these wards is readily apparent, as are the sharp delineations between these and adjacent more affluent areas of the city. The congestion becomes more apparent in the street level inset figures causality, which we attempted to answer through the process of adjudicating cases on the basis of clinical presentation. Fourthly, because the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are age specific, our data cannot be used to infer the incidence of infection in the larger population but can tell us only about the prevalence of deaths with covid-19 across age groups. Lastly, our results came from one city, in one African country, over a short three month span. By contrast, key strengths of the analysis included the close proximity of our laboratory to the sample collection site (less than five minute walk), the fact that the PCR reaction required a positive result against two genetic targets (thereby minimizing the potential for false positive results), the high level of experience in postmortem sampling and data collection by our team (which had been conducting essentially identical surveillance for more than three years before the covid-19 expansion), and the fact that enrollment was done systematically and without prior knowledge of clinical presentation or PCR results from antemortem testing. Specifically, our data were collected only after consent and enrollment procedures were complete. On this last point, we believe that this significantly reduces or eliminates selection bias through the enrollment process. All deaths that occur at, or pass through, UTH must be cleared by the morgue to receive a burial certificate, making the UTH morgue a final common pathway regardless of where the death occurred (community or facility) or clinical presentation. This fact also minimizes the risk of selection bias.",

As the two sets of tests were separated in time and could reflect an actual decline in viral load over time, our negative results do not necessarily invalidate the earlier results, and we opted to include them as presumptive positives for this reason. However, we can assume that the decision by the clinical staff to test these patients was not made at random but rather was based on increased clinical suspicion. Therefore, the pre-test probability of a positive result was probably higher than for the remaining 68 deaths in this analysis. This applies only to two cases, however, and therefore does not affect our overall conclusions.",

In pink are deaths without covid-19; in yellow are those in which covid-19 was detected at cycle threshold (CT) value <40; in purple are additional cases in which covid-19 was detected at CT value 40 and 45. Results falling in 40-45 range would be considered \"indeterminate\" results, but that does not mean that they are false positives. Given the high index of suspicion, a more parsimonious explanation is that they represent true positives, albeit at lower signal intensity. This could reflect natural biological variation (eg, waning signal intensity at end of arc of infection) or variations in sample collection, sample degradation over time, or laboratory processes. Bottom panel: same data shown as proportions of positive results, at both thresholds, by age strata. The highest proportions of deaths with covid-19/total deaths are seen clustered in older people. However, the highest number of cases is concentrated among those <60 years, with similar proportions of covid-19 detections across most age strata",
