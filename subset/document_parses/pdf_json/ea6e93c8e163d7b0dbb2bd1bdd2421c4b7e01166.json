Most genetic variation arises as a result of drift and have no phenotypic effect. However, variants of concern (VOCs) have emerged which carry signature amino acid substitutions in key areas of the immunodominant spike protein, with evidence of altered virus characteristics [1] . For example, VOCs have been associated with increased transmissibility, evasion of immunity from infection and vaccination, and reduced susceptibility to monoclonal antibody therapies [2] [3] [4] . Several VOCs have temporally coincided with spikes of infection rates in countries where they first arose, such as B.1.1.7 (Alpha in the World Health Organization classification) [5] , B.1.351 (Beta) [6] , P.1 (Gamma) [7] , and B.1.617.2 (Delta) [8] .",

B.1.1.7 has been shown in multiple studies to have increased respiratory shedding [12, 26, 27] . We demonstrate that this is seen in B.1.617.2 as well. Although patients with B.1.617.2 presented earlier in the illness course in our cohort, the observed higher viral load is sustained across the entire duration of illness up to day 21, which would not have been impacted by timing of presentation or diagnosis. These virologic data provide a mechanism to support the epidemiologic data suggesting greater transmissibility of these VOCs [28] . Infection control policy with regard to duration of isolation of infected patients, and public health control policies to reduce population-level transmission, may have to be relooked given higher viral loads and prolonged shedding, and further study should quantify the duration of infectivity by subjecting interval respiratory specimens to viral culture. Higher viral loads have been associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in some studies, though inconsistently and it is not clear whether this reflects cause or effect [29, 30] . [31] [32] [33] [34] . A separate study of vaccine-breakthrough infections by B.1.617.2 has also shown reduction in clinical severity with faster decline in viral loads in vaccinated individuals [35] . Detailed epidemiologic investigation was beyond the scope of this study, and we could not perform calculations of vaccine effectiveness against VOCs in our cohort. The population vaccination program in Singapore started in January 2021, and coverage increased gradually to 26% at the end of the study period [36] . Further study should evaluate vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants against both transmission and severe disease.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study. Firstly, due to the small sample size, there were few patients requiring supplemental oxygen or ICU admission, and fewer deaths. Smaller but statistically significant differences in clinical presentation with VOCs could have been missed due to inadequate power. For example, large population studies in the UK have found a signal toward increased mortality associated with B.1.1.7, which was not observed in a smaller cohort of hospitalized patients [10, 11, 37] . Larger cohort studies comparing different VOCs should be conducted to corroborate our findings. Secondly, as this was a retrospective study, testing was not protocolized and PCR testing was conducted on the basis of assessment by individual managing physicians. Initial respiratory samples were also not processed in a centralized laboratory, and hence estimation of viral load and shedding using Ct value is only a surrogate measure. However, SARS-CoV-2 testing protocol in Singapore is conducted in a standardized manner using only validated PCR assays, and any possible inter-assay variability would have been distributed equally across the entire cohort. Lastly, there are important differences between the control cohort from 2020 and the VOC cohort from 2021, which introduce bias to comparison between these cohorts. However, better management and treatment protocols, and improved testing and contact tracing (with a resultant higher proportion of asymptomatic [17.2% in VOC cohort vs 0.6% in wild-type cohort] and early infections) in the VOC cohort are expected to have biased toward decreased severity compared to retrospective controls. Due to the limited ability to adjust for other unrecognized confounders, these findings, while of concern, should be interpreted with caution. There were also limited virologic and sequencing data available from wild-type infections in 2020, though this would not have impacted the difference in viral loads observed between B.1.617.2 and other two VOCs studied.",

As such, our cohort entire spectrum of disease caused by VOCs, as opposed to only severe infections in cohorts of hospitalized patients in other settings. Due to the relatively small number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore and a large healthcare resource buffer capacity, local healthcare systems have not been overwhelmed by large case numbers, obviating the significant confounding factor of resource limitations on clinical outcomes and mortality. The high mortality rate reported from the outbreak of B.1.617.2 (and other variants) in India has raised concerns regarding increased pathogenicity, especially as novel VOCs continue to increase in frequency across the world. Our finding of an association between VOC and clinical severity is concerning if replicated in other situations, and has been corroborated in recent technical reports from Public Health England and Public Health Scotland [14, 25].
