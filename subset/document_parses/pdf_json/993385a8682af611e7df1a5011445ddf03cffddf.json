            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) created widespread disruption to the economy, healthcare systems, education, neighborhoods, and social life. Social distancing, quarantine, and travel restrictions led to a reduction in economic activity and job losses, particularly for those in the hospitality, tourism, and transportation sectors [1, 2] . Individuals with higher education were more likely to work in jobs compatible with remote work, whereas those with lower education were more likely to work essential jobs [1] . Employment losses were higher among individuals working in jobs requiring face-to-face interaction [1] . Further, food system disruptions resulted in changes in consumer demand, and stockpiling led to concern over food shortages and higher prices [2] . Early evidence suggests that food insecurity dramatically increased as a result of the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 [3] [4] [5] and health, economic instability, and food insecurity are closely linked [6] . Healthcare workers faced direct infection risks, and high healthcare costs, shortages of protective equipment, and low numbers of ICU beds and ventilators exposed weaknesses in patient care delivery. Access to care for many who may have a higher risk of exposure was limited due to lack of health insurance [2] . Schools across the nation quickly transitioned to online formats, resulting in reductions in employment and productivity for parents, due in part to a loss of childcare, and disruptions in access to free school meals. These shifts called into question the adequacy of student learning in digital environments and impacts on the social lives of students [7, 8] . Disaster mental health research suggests that emotional distress is ubiquitous among affected populations and mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, are particularly likely with COVID-19 [9] . The limited literature on the psychological effects of global pandemics has demonstrated increased psychological distress [10] , which can result from the primary effects of the disease and secondary effects (i.e., economic depression, loneliness, social isolation) [11] . Studies on the psychological impacts of COVID-19 have found higher reports of loneliness and depression during the pandemic as well as an association between job insecurity and financial concern and symptoms of depression and anxiety [11] [12] [13] .",

            "text": "New York State experienced an early surge in the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States beginning on 8 March 2020 and peaking in positive test daily rates on 14 April 2020, with 11,571 individuals testing positive (43.1% daily positive rate) [14] . Amid challenges with testing capacity and reliability, these numbers are likely an underestimate of the actual disease burden in the state [15, 16] . On 20 March 2020, Governor Cuomo issued the Executive Order \"New York State on Pause\", a stay-at-home order with closure of all non-essential businesses for the state to slow the spread of the coronavirus [17] . The rising infection and death rates are disproportionately experienced by racial and ethnic minorities, lower-income communities, and essential workers of whom many are from the aforementioned communities. Analysis of infection rates shows that Black and Latino individuals are three times more likely to become infected with COVID-19 and are twice as likely to die than whites in the United States [18] [19] [20] . Population-level data show that lower-income individuals are less likely to get tested and are more likely to be positive when tested. This corresponds to populations with lower paid jobs that are more likely to be essential such as individuals working in municipal, factory, service, and healthcare settings and therefore at greater risk of exposure [19] . With widespread community disruption and risk factors at the individual, community, and policy levels that create health disparities, the present study takes a social determinants of health approach to examining differential impacts of COVID-19 in New York State [21] .",

When a disaster or public health emergency occurs, it results in disruption to systems and infrastructure, impacting the routines of daily life and the stability of households and communities [23] . In addition to the primary health impacts of a hazard such as injury, illness, or property damage, there are many secondary health effects that influence the health and well-being of individuals. To more fully understand the health consequences of the pandemic for families, it is important to characterize a broader range of impacts on health determinants. Using the social determinants of health framework [22] , this study examines differences in the primary and secondary health impacts of COVID-19 among low-income and minority groups in New York State.",

The survey was adapted from the validated National Food Access Research Team survey [24, 25] . Questions about food access and security were adopted directly from the National Food Access and COVID Research Team (NFACT) survey and validation analysis of the survey showed an alpha value of 0.70 [24] . Additions to the survey included validated questions for anxiety and depression and a set of questions about the COVID-19 impact on employment and health adopted from COVID-19 surveys in the PhenX COVID-19 Toolkit, a battery of consensus measures for \"Phenotypes and eXposures\" vetted and assembled by expert working groups funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . A quota-based non-proportional sample of 415 individuals in New York State, excluding counties in the New York City metropolitan area due to the vastly different context of city and state communities, was recruited by Qualtrics during the phased reopening stages of NY State on Pause [33, 34] . Quotas were set to oversample minority (50% Hispanic, 50% African American) individuals with low income or low education (50%) and male respondents (50%) to ensure a sufficient sample size to analyze the experiences of individuals at high risk of adverse COVID-19 risk and consequences. Research shows that in 2018, 89% of white, 88% of Hispanic, and 87% of Black Americans and 81% of Americans with an annual income of less than USD 30,000 used the internet [35] ; therefore, a web survey is appropriate for reaching the target population. Participants were recruited from survey panels maintained by Qualtrics [36] . Panel members were eligible to participate if they were aged 18 or older and lived in New York State, excluding New York City. Potential participants were asked about their race, ethnicity, education, income, and gender to target filling the quotas set for the study. Participants that met the inclusion criteria but fell outside of the quotas needed for the sample were ineligible to continue. A total of 1,274 people began the survey, and 475 people were excluded due to ineligibility, such as not living in a recruitment county, not fitting in the quotas, or not consenting to participate. Another 325 participants were removed due to poor quality responses, such as speeding, straight-lining, or providing nonsense responses [37, 38] . A response rate is not available with panel data collection through Qualtrics because the research team does not have access to how many people were invited to participate in the survey. Data are only available on how many people started and completed the survey.",

Other research suggests that the groups most vulnerable to psychological distress due to COVID-19 are those who have contracted the disease, at higher risk to contract the disease, and with pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or substance abuse problems [9] . Confinement to homes can add to emotional distress, and extended confinement, inadequate supplies, difficulty securing medical care/medications, and financial losses can exacerbate emotional distress [9] . Although this study reported higher rates of anxiety among Hispanic New Yorkers and no differences in depression by race/ethnicity, worry among minority individuals over economic stability, healthcare access, and education was observed. Concern over food access and security has been reported elsewhere [4] . Only one study has examined differences in emotional distress due to COVID-19 by income, race, and ethnicity. The study found that low income and unemployment were associated with total stress score, which included worry about the socioeconomic costs of the pandemic [43] . White respondents had the lowest stress scores, Black respondents had intermediate scores, and Asian and Hispanic respondents had the highest scores [43] .",

To mitigate this limitation, survey questions asked respondents specifically about social determinants of health in relation to COVID-19. The sampling frame was designed to oversample individuals at increased risk of COVID-19. As a result of purposive sampling, generalizations cannot be made about New Yorkers. Given documented COVID-19 disparities, understanding the experiences of individuals with greater risk was privileged over representativeness. The survey was administered through a web-based platform; therefore, individuals without access to the internet were systematically excluded from participation. Given the widespread impact of the pandemic in New York State, the methodology was selected to facilitate timely completion of data collection during phased reopening from NY on Pause and provide an important snapshot of the lived experiences of many New Yorkers.",

The majority of differences were reported between Hispanic and white New Yorkers, with the largest differences reported between other or multiracial respondents and white respondents. Given the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on minority populations, improved policies and programs to address COVID-19 changes to work environments for positions in the service industry, healthcare, and factory settings could reduce risks of exposure and improve worker safety for minority populations. Amid increased risk of COVID-19 infection and death among Hispanic and Black Americans and systemically racist systems in the United States, increased participation of persons of color in pandemic and public health policy making is critical. Pandemic and emergency planning requirements for federal and state agencies could require increased stakeholder participation from diverse groups, and funding for community planning processes would support increased participation by groups that experience a disproportionate burden of adverse outcomes. However, it is important to be mindful of the burden and to also establish policies and processes that support improved outcomes such as racial sensitivity and implicit bias training for all employees in the healthcare and public health sectors and inclusion of measures to identify at-risk groups in hospital and clinic protocols. Future pandemic relief legislation may also consider including additional financial supports for these groups. Future research is needed to understand the long-term health consequences of the pandemic on the social determinants of health among populations most at risk. Research on interventions that best support communities of color is also critical to improve health outcomes.
