            "text": "Generating conversational gestures from speech audio is challenging due to the inherent one-to-many mapping between audio and body motions. Conventional CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of all possible target motions, resulting in plain/boring motions during inference. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) that explicitly models one-tomany audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared code and motion-specific code. The shared code mainly models the strong correlation between audio and motion (such as the synchronized audio and motion beats), while the motion-specific code captures diverse motion information independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts poses training difficulties for the VAE model. A mapping network facilitating random sampling along with other techniques including relaxed motion loss, bicycle constraint, and diversity loss are designed to better train the VAE. Experiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method generates more realistic and diverse motions than state-ofthe-art methods, quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be readily used to generate motion sequences with user-specified motion clips on the timeline.

            "text": "Existing algorithms developed for audio to body dynamics have some obvious limitations. For example, [12] adapts a fully convolutional neural network to co-speech gesture synthesis tasks. Nevertheless, their model tends to predict averaged motion and thus generates motions lacking diversity. This is due to the underlying one-to-one mapping assumption of their model, which ignores that the relationship between speech and co-speech gesture is one-to-many in nature. Under such an overly simplified assumption, the model has no choice but to learn the averaged motion when several motions match almost the same audio clips in order to minimize the error. The above evidence inspires us to study whether or not explicitly modeling this multimodality improves the overall motion quality. To enhance the regression capability, we introduce an extra motion-specific latent code. With this varying full latent code, which contains the same shared code and varying motion-specific code, the decoder can regress different motion targets well for the same audio, achieving one-to-many mapping results. Under this formulation, the shared code extracted from audio input serves as part of the control signal. The motion-specific code further modulates the audio-controlled motion, enabling multimodal motion generation.",

Early methods generate human motion for specified audio input by blending motion clips chosen from a motion database according to hidden Markov model [28] or conditional random fields [27] . Algorithms focusing on selecting motion candidates from a pre-processed database usually cannot generate motions out of the database and does not scale to large databases. Recently, deep generative models, such as VAEs [23] and GANs [14] , have achieved great success in generating realistic images, as well as human motions [39, 17, 29] . For example, [36] utilizes a classic LSTM to predict the body movements of a person playing the piano or violin given the sound of the instruments. However, the body movements of a person playing the piano or violin show regular cyclic pattern and are usually constrained within a small pose space.",

As a result, Speech2Gesture [12] proposes a more powerful fully convolutional network, consisting of a 8-layer CNN audio encoder and a 16-layer 1D U-Net decoder, to translate log-mel audio feature to gestures. And this network is trained with 14.4 hours of data per individual on average in comparison to 3 hours data in [36] . Other than greatly enlarged network capacity, this fully convolutional network better avoids the error accumulation problem often faced by RNNbased methods. However, it still suffers from predicting the averaged motion due to the existence of one-to-many mapping in the training data. The authors further introduce adversarial loss and notice that the loss helps to improve diversity but degenerates the realism of the outputs.

            "text": "Due to lack of 3D human pose data, the above deep learning based methods [36, 12] have only tested 2D human pose data, which are 2D key point locations estimated from videos. Recently, [10] collects a 3D co-speech gesture dataset named Trinity Speech-Gesture Dataset, containing 244 minutes motion capture (MoCap) data with paired audio, and thus enables deep network-based study on modeling the correlation between audio and 3D motion. This dataset has been tested by StyleGestures [16] , which is a flow-based algorithm [22, 16] . StyleGestures generates 3D gestures by sampling poses from a pose distribution predicted from previous motions and control signals. However, samples generated by flow-based methods [22, 16] are often not as good as VAEs and GANs. In contrast, our method learns the mapping between audio and motion with a customized VAE. Diverse results can be sampled since VAE is a probabilistic generation model. Human motion prediction. There exist many works focus on predicting future motion given previous motion [17, 35, 39] . It is natural to model sequence data with RNNs [11, 19, 31, 39] . But [17] has pointed out the RNN-based methods often suffer from error accumulation and thus are not good at predicting long-term human motion. So they proposes to use a fully convolutional generative adversarial network and achieves better performance at long-term human motion prediction. Similarly, we also adopt a fully convolutional neural network since we need to generate long-term human motion. Specific to 3D human motion prediction, another type of error accumulation happens along the kinematic chain [35] because any small joint rotation error propagates to all its descendant joints, e.g. hands and fingers, resulting in considerable position error especially for the end-effectors (wrists, fingers). So QuaterNet [35] optimizes the joint position which is calculated from forward kinematics when predicting long-term motion. Differently, we optimize the joint rotation and position losses at the same time to help the model learn the joint limitation at the same time. Multimodal generation tasks. Generating data with multimodality has received increasing interests in various tasks, such as image generation [18, 42] , motion generation [38, 43] . For image generation, MUNIT [18] disentangles the embedding of images into content feature and style feature. BicycleGAN [42] combined cVAE-GAN [26] and cLR-GAN [6, 9] to encourage the bijective consistency between the latent code and the output so that the model could generate different output by sampling different codes. For video generation, MoCoGAN [38] and S3VAE [43] disentangle the motion from the object to generate videos in which different objects perform similar motions. Different from [38, 43] , our method disentangle the motion representation into the audio-motion shared information and motion-specific information to model the one-to-many mapping between audio and motion.",

But in practice, we notice the decoder will ignore the shared codes S and reconstruct the motion only from I M . This is unwanted since the final motion is solely determined by the motion-specific features, being completely not correlated with the control signal (audio). Thus, another data flow (M SAIR = g(S A , I R )) is introduced so that the decoder has to utilize the information contained in the shared code extracted from audio to reconstruct the target. The I R is generated from the mapping net f R , whose input is a random signal from a Gaussian distribution. The mean and variance of the distribution is cal-culated from the I M of the target motion per channel.

As we described in Sec. 4.1, the model easily results in the degenerated network, which means the shared code is completely ignored and has no effect on the generated motion. Our solution to alleviating such degeneration is introducing an extra motion reconstruction with audio extracted shared code S A and random motion-specific code I R . Ideally, the generated mo-tionM SAIR resembles its GT from some aspects but is not the same as its GT. In our case, We assume the generated poses are similar in the 3D world space. Thus we propose relaxed motion loss, which calculates the position loss and penalizes the model only when the distance is larger than a certain threshold \u03c1: Motion-specific code alignment. Although the motionspecific code could be sampled from Gaussian distribution directly, we noticed that the realism and diversity of the generated motions are not good. The problem is caused by the misalignment of the Gaussian distribution and the motionspecific code distribution. Thus, the mapping net is introduced to map the signal sampled from Gaussian space to the motion-specific embedding. At the training stage, we calculate the mean and variance for every channel and every sample of the I M . The sampled features will be fed into a mapping network, which is also a variational autoencoder, before concatenating them with different shared codes to generate motions. Motion-specific code reconstruction. Although the model could model the multimodal distribution of audio-motion pair by splitting the motion code into audio-motion shared one and motion-specific ones, it is not guaranteed the decoder can sample multimodal motions. For example, suppose the mapping net only maps the sampled signal to a single mode of the multimodal distribution. In that case, the decoder still could only generate unimodal motions, which is also known as the mode-collapse problem. The bicycle constraint [42] (M \u2192 I \u2192 M and I \u2192 M \u2192 I) is introduced to avoid the mode-collapse problem, which encourages a bijection between the motion and the motionspecific code. Since the motion reconstruction loss has already been introduced, an extra reconstruction loss of the motion-specific code is added as supplement:",

Formally, it is defined as: (15) where theM a1 andM a2 represent clips from the same motion sequence, N represents the count of the motion clips, which is T 50 in our experiments. Please note that jitter motion and invalid poses can also result in high diversity score. So higher diversity is preferred only if the generated motion is natural. Multimodality. Multimodality measures how many different motions could be sampled (through multiple runs) for a given audio clip. Note that multimodality calculates motion difference across different motions while diversity calculates (short) motion clip difference within the same (long) motion.

The \"+mapping net\" model also outperforms the baseline model in the L 1 metrics and gets a similar PCK metrics, but the model could generate multimodal motions. We notice that the diversity of the motions generated by \"+mapping net\" model is not as good as the baseline model. The realism score of the \"+mapping net\" model is also worse than the baseline model, which may be due to the users prefer the motions with more dynamics.

Despite the model could generate multimodal motions and provide users the ability to control the output motion, there exist some limitations. For example, the generated motion is not very related to what the person says, future work could be improving the meaning of the generated motion by incorporating word embedding as an additional condition.",
