It is a major source of revenue and a growth driver for other industries like retail, transportation, and infrastructure. Recent years have seen a surge in tourism development, particularly in underdeveloped countries where governments have taken proactive measures (Bansbardi et al., 2013) . Numerous research has been conducted in this area to determine the economic effect of tourism in various countries (Baloglu and McCleary, 1999; Kozak et al., 2007) . Moreira and Iao assert that there is fierce competition among tourist destinations worldwide for tourists. Due to the tourism industry's intense competition, building and maintaining positive images of destinations is necessary. Destination images are crucial in determining behavior or travel behavior in terms of destination selection, desire to revisit, and intention to spread word of mouth (Onatski et al., 2014; Webster and Ivanov, 2014) .",

The boom in the tourism industry was and has been contributed by the emergence of affluent middle-class people as well as the easing of restrictions on movement for both locals and foreign visitors. Besides, the sector has expanded to become one of the globe's most-watched outbound and inbound tourist markets (Thomala, 2020) . The number of local trips in China reached around 2.4 billion in 2020, although the year has been characterized by the COVID 19 pandemic (Wang K. et al., 2020) . This would indicate an increase of more than 50% compared to the trips made within a decade ago. As of 2016, total Chinese revenue on tourism and travel amounted to 3.94 trillion yuan, translating to a 15.2% increase from the previous year (Li et al., 2016) . The industry improved China's gross domestic product by 2.1% and an estimated 22.5 million jobs (Thomala, 2020; Wang K. et al., 2020) . All these have been contributed by considering aspects such as the multiple heritage sites, infrastructure, community interactions, and tourists' safety, among other factors such as the destination image formation (DIF) and tourist satisfaction (TS).",

            "text": "The term \"destination image\" refers to the process through which people try to form an impression of a particular vacation destination. The destination image encompasses beliefs, feelings, perceptions, and knowledge about a destination, in addition to direct and indirect information gained while traveling to the destination, such as through associations, tourismrelated channels, social platforms, and the Internet facility. The significance of developing destination images for managers stems from the fact that they have a considerable impact on tourists' purchasing decisions and actions (Pike and Ryan, 2004) . Further, studies have shown how people are more drawn to a destination's image based on their emotions and impressions rather than the facts of the destination itself (Kim and Yoon, 2003; Abodeeb et al., 2015) . Kozak (2001) investigated how tourists' perceptions of a destination are developed, both domestically and internationally. According to Kozak, tourists who are delighted with their vacations are eager to tell their friends and family about it. When tourists are happy, they are more apt to return to the same destination and suggest it to others. The overall image of a destination is an essential mediator in the relationship between brand associations and future visitor behavior, according to Qu et al. (2011) . Furthermore, Hanzaee and Saeedi (2011) found that the overall image plays an important role in helping to mediate the association between destination brand associations and future tourist behavior.",

When making strategic marketing decisions for tourism locations, it is crucial to determine the destination's image due to the assumption that a positive DIF creates trust toward tourist destinations and increases tourists' satisfaction (Coban, 2012) . Trust is a notion deeply linked to tourist satisfaction; consequently, regardless of the concepts, trustful tourists report a high level of fulfillment. TT is reliant upon TS (i.e., attractions, lodging, accessibility, facilities, and activities) and fulfillment of expectations (Chi, 2012) . The overall image of the destination (attractions, accommodation, accessibility, amenities, activities, local community, and commerce) is a predictor of TT (Prayag, 2009) . TT is impacted by essential services, attractions, and accessibilities (Kastenholz et al., 2013) . TT in a destination is impacted by the destination's image, personal involvement, place attachment, and overall satisfaction (Prayag, 2009) .",

It is anticipated that Asia will become the globe's most popular vacation destination and largest tourist-producing region in the near future. Notably, Tourism in PRC was almost non-existent prior to 1978, when it unlocked its gates to the outside world. Since then, China has become a significant tourism marketplace. China's tourism officials have been concentrating their efforts on evolving national tourism (Zhang et al., 2016) , and this study examines domestic Chinese tourists primarily.",

Numerous scholarly studies (e.g., Landorf, 2009; Hosseini et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have concentrated on the sustainability and resource management of Heritage Sites, additionally to the significance of Heritage Sites in attracting international tourists (Su and Li, 2012) . There has been a relatively slight investigation into the impact of tourist destination image formation (LCP, A, ALP), on tourist trust, by using tourist satisfaction as a mediated variable in heritage sites, particularly those in China. For this purpose, we developed a synthesized research framework to explore the following research questions: RQ1: How does DIF and tourist satisfaction influence tourist trust? RQ2: How do DIF influences tourist satisfaction impact on tourist trust? RQ3: How does tourist satisfaction mediate the relationship between DIF and tourist trust? This paper's structure is as follows: section \"Review of literature\" includes a literature review. Second, section \"Conceptual Framework\" covers how the hypotheses were generated, while section \"Research Methodology\" explains the research methodology and the statistical analysis of this study, respectively. Section \"Discussion\" contains the discussion and closing remarks. The study comes to a close with a review of the study's limitations as well as future research prospects.",

            "text": "Destination image formation is defined as the collection of an individual's beliefs and thoughts about a specific environment or setting. In the same vein, the environmental and social aspects of a destination's image quality are two of the most important factors in determining its perceived quality (Jiang et al., 2016) . Previous studies (e.g., Soliman, 2019; Carvalho, 2022; Dai et al., 2022) have shown that the image of a location is a significant component that impacts travelers' decision-making, destination selection, and future behavior. Image has been a well-known term in the disciplines of customer behavior and marketing for a long time (Stepchenkova and Morrison, 2008) . According to Del Bosque et al. (2006) , image results from customers' perception of the company, consisting of impressions, beliefs, and feelings toward a company. Conversely, DIF also includes the participation of the local community (LCP), authenticity (A), access to local products (ALP), and the services provided to tourists. In addition, destination image has been widely recognized as an important construct that influences tourist behavior, tourism-related decisions, and destination marketing (Picazo and Moreno-Gil, 2019; Song et al., 2019) . Researchers generally agree that destination image include several components, such as cognitive, affective, and conative elements (Gartner, 1994) . Semantic designative, evaluative, and prescriptive aspects have also been identified. Elbaz et al. (2021) identified four dimensions of destination attractiveness, namely access, amenities, scenery and locals, while Jiang et al. (2016) identified destination service infrastructure and destination facilities as the most significant factors of a tourism destination for international visitors. Travelers are increasingly relying on information from a wide range of online resources, thanks to the rise of the internet. However, there may be significant visual disparities and inconsistencies between various sources, platforms, or agents (Choi et al., 2007; Tang and Jang, 2009) . Despite the broad theoretical consensus in favor of LCP in tourism strategies, in practice, destination guests rarely have real influence over important choices (Dragouni and Fouseki, 2018; Su et al., 2019) . Tourist visits in China have been affected by the authenticity and commodification of local community objects and local community practices. Cultural heritage is a priceless asset that contributes to the cultural and economic qualities of the host community in a tourist destination (Yang et al., 2017) . Intangible cultural heritage with the community is protected to preserve its uniqueness and vulnerability. The protection of the cultural heritage is done through school education, folk protection, salvage operation, and museum preservation.",

            "text": "In the tourism industry, a great deal of research has been conducted on customer satisfaction (Ramkissoon and Mavondo, 2015) . The pleasure a customer experiences after a purchase or a series of customer-product interactions is called satisfaction. According to the literature, visitors' perceptions of their travel experience begin with the mental assessment of travelers' encounters with different destination characteristics (Sharma and Nayak, 2019) . Tourist satisfaction with natural and cultural sites could increase their attachment to a location (Ramkissoon, 2016) . Therefore, Organizations responsible for destination management (DMOs) are more concerned with providing and maintaining the characteristics appropriately for travelers to enhance the quality of their vacations and make them memorable (Jing and Rashid, 2018) . Additionally, consistent execution of destination characteristics might attract additional tourists, ensuring their satisfaction (Sangpikul, 2018) . Formerly, several scholars have identified several destination characteristics that can be broadly classified as commodities or services. For example, Lo et al. (2013) divided destination characteristics into four categories: cultural/heritage, social, economic, and environmental. According to Sevin\u00e7 and G\u00fczel (2017) , various characteristics serve as attracting and satisfying elements for tourists. Sukiman et al. (2013) established a link between both visitor satisfaction and travel experience. In addition, Ragavan et al. (2014) and Valduga et al. (2019) assessed tourists' perceptions and satisfaction with a tourist destination by evaluating a variety of destination attributes such as accommodation, food, attractions, image, products, accessibility, culture, communities, and price, as well as other attractions that are important components of a tourist destination. Similarly, Ghosh and Sofique (2012) stated that cultural/patrimonial attractions are essential to the tourism product. Tasci and Boylu (2010) , on the other hand, focused on the issue of safety during tourists' trips to measure their satisfaction. In support, Manui and Wongsai (2017) conducted research on international tourists' feelings of safety while visiting the island. In addition, furthermore, Kim et al. (2015) listed the essential criteria of tourist-friendly destinations. As a result, measure their satisfaction. Accommodation, accessibility, attractions, restaurants, and safety are among the key features.",

A destination that instills trust in the eyes and minds of tourists can simply be marketed (Abubakar, 2016) .",

Travelers may be inclined to choose a well-known place as a means of reducing the risk of travel (Choi et al., 2016) . By meeting tourists' emotional and basic requirements, destinations and tourists can build mutual trust (Roodurmun and Juwaheer, 2010) . According to the findings of a recent study, some tourist locations have been able to acquire the trust of their visitors because of their open pricing policies and attention to detail in their landscaping. Additionally, social media reviews revealed that effective traffic management and tourist-friendly amenities were critical in building visitors' trust in a destination . The existing literature does not have a standard scale for the assessment of TT in a destination. The majority of tourist research has used a trust instrument borrowed from other fields, such as social science , branding (Delgado-Ballester, 2004) , and e-commerce . Certain researchers (Marinao et al., 2012; Artigas et al., 2017) established a scale based on a qualitative approach without requiring formal attestations.",

Another study revealed that local community participation increased tourist trust through institutional credibility, which significantly influenced both individual and collective preferences (Dragouni and Fouseki, 2018) .",

It has become increasingly important for managers and marketers in international tourist destinations to ensure that their visitors have a positive and memorable experience . According to Mai et al. (2019) , TS is an emotional response that occurs when comparing expectations and perceptions of service performance to real perceptions gained via physical encounters with products or services.

Tourism destination formation, according to Della Corte et al. (2015), has a beneficial effect on tourist services. Other facilities could help travelers retain information and foster good conversation about the destination among customers. Similarly, Ridho et al.

Engeset and Elvekrok (2015) explored that authenticity effectively increases tourist satisfaction among tourists.

According to Taie (2013) , an increase in satisfaction can improve tourists' loyalty through the mediating role of trust. Satisfaction and loyalty are critical components; It is essential to know the psychology of travelers in leisure, hospitality, and tourism in order for a location to be successful. Specifically, a customer who values loyalty is dedicated to consistently repurchasing or patronizing a company or product in the future (Elbaz et al., 2021) . International tourism destinations' marketers and managers are increasingly focused on increasing visitor satisfaction and creating an unforgettable travel experience (Lee C.-F. et al., 2017) . Hassan and Soliman (2021) illustrated that trust positively impacted holidaymakers' intention to revisit the destination. Moreover, some prior studies have investigated the connections among satisfaction, trust, and loyalty. For instance, dos Santos and Basso (2012) discern that the tourist-healthcare provider relationship moderately impacts intent formation, while trust is developed in both personnel and the enterprise based on tourists' satisfaction with grievance handling systems. In turn, positive word-of-mouth and repurchase intention are fundamentally triggered by trust. There has recently been much discussion about Muslim travelers' satisfaction with the destination, and there has been an apparent desire for halal travel. Muslim tourist satisfaction is generated, according to Olya and Al-Ansi (2018) , by the variety and quality of halal products and services available at the tourist attraction, which comprises medical, environmental, spiritual, and quality performances. A visitor's confidence and certainty toward product or service providers at tourism sites/places due to a relationship exchange between the two parties is commonly defined as tourist trust (Sirdeshmukh et al., 2002) . The hospitality and tourism industries rely on developing and sustaining relationships among their stakeholders . TS and loyalty to a tourist destination are closely tied to their level of trust in the place they visit (Artigas et al., 2017) . This study assessed the tourist satisfaction influence on tourist trust, and the following hypothesis was made for this purpose:",

Currently, several studies have been concentrated on destination image formation, tourists' satisfaction, and tourist trust in advanced countries such as America, Austria, Spain, South Korea, and France, etc. (Guzman-Parra et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2021) , with comparatively fewer studies have been conducted in emerging nations which is increased amputates of the scholars to get more diverse corporate viewpoints. Our rationale for doing this study is to establish a link between LCP, A, ALP, and DIF, all of which contribute to TS and, ultimately, TT. Thus, the Chinese tourism industry is ideal for this study since it is easy to access for the researchers. A survey was identified as the best method for gathering data for this study, and a questionnaire was designed to that end.",

Located on the Pearl River, which is accessible to the South China Sea, the city is Guangdong's political, economic, scientific, educational, and cultural capital. A multifunctional metropolis since the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC), Guangzhou has seen numerous transformations during the last two thousand years. Furthermore, it is one of China's most famous tourist destinations. Foshan is a progressive city. Following China's open-door policy, it was one of the first ports in China to engage in foreign trade. It has also grown to become the thirdlargest city in Guangdong Province due to manufacturing and tourism. In recent years, it has invested resources to further develop its thriving tourism business. It is located on the northern bank of the Pearl River, approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Guangzhou in Guangdong Province. The city, which dates all the way back to nearly 5,000 years ago, was named after three Buddha statues discovered in this location during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Shenzhen is a young and modern metropolis in southern China adjacent to Hong Kong. It is best known for its fast development over the last decades; it attracts flowing business people to seek opportunities, especially cheap but good-qualified electronic products. It is also a great holiday destination with fabulous tourist attractions and markets for traditional local products.

SmartPLS 3.3.3 was selected because of its statistical efficiency and low sensitivity to sample size than other software for covariance-based SEM (Hair et al., 2019) . Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was a popular approach to measure the complex relationships between variables used in the research model up to the last decade. Since 2010, the trend has changed; scholars use partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) significantly in social sciences Avkiran et al., 2018) . The PLS-SEM approach is preferable to CB-SEM because it allows measuring the structural model with numerous constructs, indicator variables, and structural paths without imposing distributional assumptions on the data. More crucially, PLS-SEM is a causal-predictive approach to SEM that emphasizes prediction in estimating statistical models, whose structures are designed to provide causal explanations . As a result, this technique overcomes the apparent dichotomy between explanation as typically emphasized in academic research -and prediction, which is the basis for developing different implications (Hair et al., 2019) . In addition, user-friendly software packages are available, such as SmartPLS (Ringle et al., 2015) , which generally require little technical knowledge about the method. This study aimed to ascertain the relationship between DIF, TS, and TT. Thus, we investigated the model's constructs for validity and reliability prior to evaluating the expected influences. The constructs' validity and reliability are summarized in Table 3 . The dependability index of each item's loading factors is more than the threshold value of 0.60 (Henseler et al., 2014) . Likewise, additional reliability measures such as Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability, and rho A all exceed the recommended value of 0.70 (Henseler et al., 2014) . For the purpose of determining the convergent validity of reflective constructs, the AVE (average variance extracted) approach was used. Each construct had an AVE value greater than the normal value of 0.50 (Hair et al., 2019) . The reliability and convergent validity of all reflective constructs included in the research model were assessed in this study. Each construct's AVE square root was bigger than the variance shared by all constructs. As a result, the conditions for reliability and validity have been met. Henseler and Ringle questioned Fornell and Larcker's method of determining discriminant validity, claiming that it cannot be relied upon to determine discriminant validity (Henseler et al., 2014) . They advocated using a heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) approach to assess discriminant validity in partial least squares standard error of the mean (SEM) (Hair et al., 2019) . We used this method to assess discriminant validity, which is believed to be a more appropriate method. The HTMT method is defined as the correlation between constructs and the correlations within the same construct items. Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt argued that HTMT should have a standard value smaller than 0.90 . Thus, HTMT values greater than 0.90 imply a lack of discriminant validity for the construct. Each construct's HTMT value is less than 0.90, as indicated in Table 3 . As a result, the measure met discriminant validity standards.",

            "text": "When analyzing structural equation modeling, ensure that the issue of collinearity has been resolved. When the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) exceeds 5, it indicates that there may be a collinearity issue between the dimensions (Hair et al., 2011) . In this study, the VIF value of the structural equation modeling is less than 5, ranging between 1.473 and 3.379, showing no collinearity across the study dimensions. The metrics SRMR, NFI, and RMS theta are often employed in PLS-SEM to assess the overall model's suitability. The SRMR value has a range of 0 to 1. When the SRMR is less than 0.08, the model is considered excellent (Hu and Bentler, 1998) . The NFI value ranges from 0 to 1. The greater the value of NFI, the better the performance. When NFI exceeds 0.9, it implies that the model fits well (Bentler and Bonett, 1980) . The RMS theta value should only be used to evaluate reflecting measurement models. A value of RMS theta less than 0.12 suggests that the model fits well (Henseler et al., 2014) . The SRMR for model evaluation verification in this study is 0.057. Despite the fact that the NFI score of 0.832 is less than 0.9, the difference is not significant. The value of RMS theta is 0.123. Despite being greater than 0.12, it is also acceptable. As a result, the model used in this investigation was shown to be pretty well suited in general. Table 4 displays the collinearity analysis and model fit. The R2 value is considered when evaluating a model's explanatory ability. The R2 value ranges from 0 to 1-the greater the explanatory power, the greater the value. When the R2 value is close to 0.50, the model has modest explanatory power. When the R2 value is close to 0.75, the model has a high degree of explanatory power. According to Table 5 , perceived ease of use has a 54.4 percent explanatory power for tourist trust. The explanatory power of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use to tourist satisfaction is 70.4 percent. As a result, the model in this study explains the latent variables extremely well and has a high level of explanatory power.",

Only a few studies on rising countries like China have been published prior to this one. In addition, the few studies that have been done in emerging countries demonstrate a lack of focus on the tourism sector, despite its critical role in a country's socioeconomic development. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating the impact of destination image formation on tourist trust in the Chinese heritage tourism context. The present study explores the direct relationship between DIF and TT. Additionally, we measured the direct relationship between DIF and TS. Likewise, we also measured the direct connection between tourist satisfaction and tourist trust. Moreover, the current research also measured the indirect relationship of destination image formation on tourist trust through TS in the Chinese tourism context. We first focused on the direct relationship between DIF practices (LCP, A, ALP) and TT. The results revealed that all three dimensions of DIF pillars (LCP, A, ALP) significantly influence TT, which approved our hypotheses H1.1 to H1.3. Prior studies confirmed that DIF positively influenced on TT . Similarly, Huete-Alcocer et al. (2019) explored that DIF has been shown to be a significant predictor of positive TT. Additionally, the results from another study indicated that perceived authenticity is an essential element to build tourist trust in the tourism framework (Jeong and Kim, 2019b) . It has also discussed the role of access to local products and building trust and personal relationships among different tourism stakeholders. Similarly, it was revealed that access to local products has a positive role in enhancing tourist trust (Roy et al., 2017) . The plausible reason for this significant relationship was the quality DIF practices used to enhance the TT. Another reason might be that the three factors, such as LCP, authenticity, and ALP, worked effectively in the Chinese tourism industry, enhancing tourist trust.",

Understanding these processes will have the benefit of providing destination marketers and managers with the knowledge they need to differentiate their destination offerings and foster a lifelong emotional connection with tourists.

Key elements of the tourist connection, for instance, satisfaction and attachment, should be considered in addition to physical features by destination marketers or managers in order to better suit travelers' actual and symbolic requirements. Destination managers' concern for guests' well-being and interests is shown in these characteristics. Tourist sites with a good reputation have a competitive advantage over others because of the trust that tourists have in it, such as whether or not their travel expectations are met or surpassed and how many related uncertainties are minimized, for example. An emotional connection can be formed between a place and its visitors if they have confidence in it, which can lead to increased return visits and recommendations from those who have been there. Therefore, destination marketers must rely on trust, developing a destination's image and customer satisfaction to build long-term relationships with travelers that will lead to a loyal customer base.",

Others, though, disagree and have stated that tourist trust does not ensure visitors return to a site because they are typically predisposed to choose a new destination even when the experience is pleasant and happy (Trang, 2018) . Moreover, Chi and Qu (2008) believe that destination trust has little to do with destination image. Nonetheless, the current study demonstrates and validates the presence of essential links between DIF, TS, and TT; the present study results provide valuable implications for researchers, managers, and supervisors. The tourist organizations should organize some professional training on improving their professional skills such as communication and management skills for their employees who are weak in these areas. The managers should establish the rewards and compensations for those employees. Moreover, customer satisfaction is also very important for building tourist trust; therefore, employees should be trained to enhance customer satisfaction at their workplaces. These steps can help to improve the destination's image and increase tourist satisfaction.",

Particularly, the findings show that TS has a totally mediating influence, which has never been previously observed. Furthermore, based on the best available knowledge, the current study is the first in the context of Chinese tourism to include TS as a mediator of the relationship between DIF and tourist trust.
