            "text": "Following the onset of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world, a large fraction of the global population is or has been under strict measures of physical distancing and quarantine, with many countries being in partial or full lockdown. These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.",

As of March 6, a travel ban was issued for school trips to Italy. On March 10, Belgian authorities advised to cancel all indoor events of 1,000 participants or more. Furthermore, physical distancing measures were taken with companies being advised to allow their employees to work from home as much as possible. A closure of all schools, cafes and restaurants was ordered as well as a cancellation of all public gatherings as of March 13 at midnight. On March 17, the Belgian National Security Council announced additional measures to be taken, thereby imposing stricter measures of physical distancing, prohibiting non-essential travel to foreign countries and within the own borders (i.e., only allowing people to leave their homes to buy food or to go to work, at least when working in healthcare, transport or other essential professions), closure of shops providing non-essential services with the addition of penalties for everyone not abiding with the rules. A lockdown was imposed on Wednesday March 18 at noon. The borders were closed as of March 20. Throughout the epidemic, the government continuously stressed the importance of measures of physical distancing and hygiene, thereby avoiding physical contacts, ensuring regular washing of the hands, coughing and sneezing in the inner elbow, not shaking hands and staying at home when having COVID-19 related symptoms [3] . social life and economic constraints while maintaining control over pressure exerted on the health care system. After a specific exit strategy is implemented, a careful monitoring of the outbreak is necessary to avoid subsequent waves of COVID-19 infections.",

The model is contrasted to Belgian data on the daily number of new hospitalizations and deaths prior and after mitigation strategies have been imposed. The model accounts for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. Age-specific data on social contacts is used to inform transmission parameters [4] and serial serological survey data is incorporated in the model to inform the prevalence of past exposure to the disease [5] . The impact of the intervention measures as well as various exit strategies upon relaxing lockdown measures are studied in the context of this model. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide specific details on the (stochastic) compartmental model, its parametrization and estimation of model parameters based on several data sources. Moreover, we study the impact of intervention measures and subsequent exit strategies on the spread of COVID-19. The results of fitting the stochastic model to the available data is presented in Section 3. Furthermore, the impact of various exit strategies on the number of new hospitalizations is visualized using an extensive scenario-analysis. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss limitations and strengths of the proposed approach and we present avenues for further research.",

In this model, individuals are susceptible to infection when in compartment S, and after an effective contact (between a susceptible and infectious individual) the susceptible individual moves to an exposed state E at age-and time-specific rate \u03bb(t), referred to as the force of infection (with boldface notation representing a vector including age-specific rates). After a latent period, the individual becomes infectious and moves to a pre-symptomatic state I presym at rate \u03b3. Afterwards, individuals either develop symptoms (state I mild ) with probability 1 \u2212 p or remain completely free of symptoms (compartment I asym , probability p). Asymptomatic cases recover at rate \u03b4 1 . Symptomatic infections are either very mild and such cases recover at rate \u03b4 2 = \u03b4 1 (for an age-dependent fraction of these individuals, represented by the vector \u03c6 0 ) or they move to a state I sev at rate \u03c9 prior to requiring hospitalization (i.e., severe infection is defined as requiring hospitalization). When severely ill, implying hospitalization, individuals move to state I hosp with probability \u03c6 1 , or become critically ill (I ICU ) with probability 1 \u2212 \u03c6 1 . Hospitalized and critically ill patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) recover at rate \u03b4 3 and \u03b4 4 with probabilities {1 \u2212 \u00b5 hosp (a)} and {1 \u2212 \u00b5 icu (a)}, respectively, where \u00b5 hosp (a) and \u00b5 icu (a) represent the age-specific case-fatality rates (i.e., probabilities of dying when severely ill and hospitalized on a general ward or admitted to ICU).

Transmission of the disease is governed by an age-and time-dependent force of infection. The age-specific force of infection in age group k = 1, . . . , K, denoted by \u03bb(k, t), is defined as the instantaneous rate at which a susceptible person in age group k acquires infection at time t. Furthermore, the time-invariant transmission rate \u03b2(k, k ) represents the average per capita rate at which an infectious individual in age group k makes an effective contact with a susceptible individual in age group k, per unit of time.

This hypothesis entails that c(k, k ) are the per capita rates at which an individual in age group k makes contact with an individual in age group k , per unit of time, and q is a proportionality factor capturing contextual and hostand disease-specific characteristics such as susceptibility and infectiousness. The (K \u00d7 K)-matrix C containing the elements c(k, k ) is referred to as the social contact matrix describing mixing behaviour within and between different age groups in the population. Social contact rates c(k, k ) are estimated based on social contact data from Flanders (Belgium) collected in 2010 [7, 8, 4, 9] .

An overview of the different prior distributions is presented in Table B4 of Appendix B.

The time-dependent effective reproduction number R t is shown in Figure E3 of Appendix E. The posterior mean for \u03c9 is in line with estimates regarding the delay distribution for hospitalizations [18] implying an average duration between symptom onset and hospitalization of about 2/\u03c9 = 6.353 days (95% CI: 5.930, 6.802). Furthermore, the average length of the incubation and (asymptomatic/mild) infectious periods, \u03c1 \u22121 and \u03c3 \u22121 asym , are estimated to be 4.577 days (95% CI: 4.480, 4.672) and 5.091 days (95% CI: 4.994, 5.192), respectively, similar to values reported in the literature (see Table B3 ). For individuals experiencing severe symptoms, the average length of the infectious period, constrained due to isolation in hospital, is limited to approximately 10.077 days (95% CI: 9.650, 10.531).

In Figure 7 , we show the impact of relaxing lockdown measures by increasing contacts made by people at different locations. More specifically, we present stochastic realizations of the model to predict the number of new hospitalizations under different scenarios with changes in contact behaviour as of May 4, 2020 (Phase 1a, Scenarios S1-S3) and May 11, 2020 (Phase 1b). From May 4 onward, we presume that work-related contacts will increase from 20% (baseline scenario -see Table 2 ) to 30% of the pre-pandemic number of contacts at work (or transmissibility is reduced to an extent equivalent with the assumed reduction in work-related contacts), and that the number of transport contacts and contacts during leisure and other activities will increase respectively from 20% to 30% and from 10% to 20% of their pre-pandemic values. On top of that, work, transport and leisure contacts stay constant (scenario S1) or increase to 40%, 40% and 30% (S2) or 50%, 50% and 40% (S3) of the pre-pandemic values, respectively, from May 11 onward. Moreover, a delay of one week is considered for each change in social contact behaviour (i.e., a full extent of all changes in behaviour is reached on May 18, 2020). A small to moderate increase in the contacts at work, transportation and during leisure (blue and purple scenarios) leads either to a complete reduction of hospitalizations or a constant number of new hospitalizations over time. Only the most extreme increases in contacts give rise to a resurgence of COVID-19 implying a second wave of COVID-19 infections (scenario S3 -orange lines).",

In general, the stochastic model describes the observed data well, even in the absence of changes in contact behaviour after intervention measures were relaxed. Although the observed number of hospitalizations tends to remain constant, thereby deviating from a further decrease thereof in the baseline scenario, no large differences between observed and predicted values are found. Following the gradual relief of the intervention measures, no resurgence of the disease is noticeable to date (end of June).",

As age-specific heterogeneity has been proven to be of great importance in terms of transmission, clinical presentation and mortality for COVID-19, our model explicitly accounts for such age differences informed by age-specific data. Consequently, our model enables a more granular investigation of disease dynamics and the impact of intervention measures targeting specific age groups. Model predictions of, for example, the time-dependent prevalence in the population can be made for different age groups, which is especially relevant to assess whether herd immunity levels are reached in age groups at the highest risk for severe disease.",

Needless to say, the model is updated progressively as new data becomes available and extensions towards improving the model and incorporating up-to-date information are considered in future research. Although several scenarios have been displayed, the single scenario which will unfold in reality in the next weeks and months is driven by unpredictable human behaviour and governmental decisions in case of a resurgence of the disease. Nevertheless, displaying and investigating a range of potential scenarios is crucial in quantifying the impact of certain imposed changes, and of key importance to guide policy makers to shape exit strategies.",

In such a situation, a high number of new hospitalizations will be reported with a peak size which is inversely related to the level of sustained transmission in the period preceding the wave of new COVID-19 infections. Lifting the stringent lockdown measures without adequate exit strategies put in place would inevitably have led to a large increase in the number of new infections as the population immunity is still too low to rely on herd immunity (see, e.g., estimated seroprevalence in Figure 5 ). This signals an insufficient depletion of susceptibles in order to prevent subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks in the future. Our scenario analyses present both short and long-term predictions of new waves based on the current levels of population immunity. However, to date, both the level of protection against infection in the presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well as the extent of the (humoral and cellular) immune response in relation to the symptoms of the infected person are still very unclear [5] . In the model, we assume that acquired immunity after recovery lasts for the entire time period under study.",

Faes et al. (2020) [18] showed that the time between symptom onset and hospitalization is indeed non-exponentially distributed, albeit that the best fitting distribution (i.e., a Weibull one) is difficult to incorporate in this modeling framework. As important aspects of the transmission dynamics and the disease are still uncertain, some of the simplifications made in the model will be revisited and updated as biomedical insights improve (e.g., regarding potential seasonality in COVID-19 transmission). As a result of limited information with regard to hospital discharge, the model is currently not able to directly predict the burden on hospital capacity. This will be particularly relevant for surveillance of pressure on the healthcare system in future COVID-19 waves. However, based on the model output in terms of new hospitalizations and information with respect to length of hospital stay, an indirect calculation thereof is straightforward. In the current analyses, we did not distinguish between hospitalization of individuals in elderly homes and individuals from the general population, nor between deaths in hospitals and nursing homes, mainly due to the lack of detailed information to do so. Our model therefore focuses on the general population. Next to that, we disregard potentially important factors such as seasonality (i.e., induced by changes in temperature, humidity, exposure of the virus to ultraviolet light, etc.) entailing an impact on social behaviour and transmission potential of the virus to an extent that is largely unknown to date [35, 36] . Finally, in the scenario analyses presented in this paper, we assume that no external re-importation of the disease in the population occurs, albeit that the stochasticity of the model is able to account for this, at least to a limited extent.",

For example, the individual-based model by Willem et al. [29] enabled the direct study of contact tracing and case isolation as a control measure. The meta-population model by Coletti et al. [28] studied the impact of mobility on disease transmission. This stochastic model enabled the detailed fitting to age-specific serology and incidence data using MCMC. As there is no single best model to study all possible research questions related to the spread and control of the disease, we compared model outputs and conclusions, as their predictions need continuous finetuning and validation [37, 38] . In conclusion, predictions from our model are useful to inform subsequent serological sample studies and to explore various exit scenarios with respect to disease transmission as an input for the investigation of the economic impact of COVID-19 epidemics on society.

A re-analysis of these (initial) findings by Held and McConway and Spiegelhalter [2, 3] , however, clearly shows that children between 1 and 10 years old have on average only 27% (95% CI: 8-91%) of the viral load of adults aged 20 years or more. For the mathematical model proposed here, we do not differentiate between infectiousness and susceptibility in children as compared to adults directly [4] . However, as children are presumed to be more likely to have a higher probability of being asymptomatically infected (see Section B.2), and the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals r \u03b2 is (assumed) equal to 0.51 [5] , children are implicitly less infectious, hence, contribute less to the transmission process relative to adults.",

In Figure E9 , the impact on the estimated overall prevalence over time is depicted. The estimated overall prevalence and corresponding 95% credible interval are shown for the original sensitivity curve (black dashed line with gray shaded area) and the alternative sensitivity curve (red solid line with red shaded area) as presented in Appendix D. The impact on the estimated prevalence is very limited. Moreover, the estimated seroprevalence at the cross-sectional time points is almost identical for the two sensitivity curves (not shown).",
