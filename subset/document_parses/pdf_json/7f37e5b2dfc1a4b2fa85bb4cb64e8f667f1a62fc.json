            "text": "The building of an effective wastewater-based epidemiological model that can translate SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater to the prevalence of virus shedders within a community is a significant challenge for wastewater surveillance. The objectives of this study were to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and the COVID-19 cases at the community-level and to assess how SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations should be integrated into a wastewater-based epidemiological statistical model that can provide reliable forecasts for the number of COVID-19 infections and the evolution over time as well. Weekly variations on the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and COVID-19 cases from April 29, 2020 through February 17, 2021 were obtained in Borough of Indiana, PA. Vector autoregression (VAR) model with different data forms were fitted on this data from April 29, 2020 through January 27, 2021, and the performance in three weeks ahead forecasting (February 3, 10, and 17) were compared with measures of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). A stationary block bootstrapping VAR method was also presented to reduce the variability in the forecasting values. Our results demonstrate that VAR(1) estimated with the logged data has the best interpretation of the data, but a VAR(1) estimated with the original data has a stronger forecasting ability. The forecast accuracy, measured by MAPE, for 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks in the future can be as low as 11.85%, 8.97% and 21.57%. The forecasting performance of the model on a short time span is unfortunately not very impressive. Also, a single increase in the SARS-CoV-2 concentration can impact the COVID-19 cases in an inverted-U shape pattern with the maximum impact occur in the third week after. The flexibility of this approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different locations where the wastewater surveillance system has been implemented.",

            "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, clinical diagnostic testing for COVID-19 on individual levels does not by itself provide a holistic indicator of community health risk. One significant concern with COVID-19 is that most cases in the U.S. are often asymptomatic and presymptomatic, allowing infected individuals to spread the virus without knowing that they are carriers (Moghadas et al., 2020) . Moreover, a considerable percent of patients recovered from COVID-19 could still carry and shed virus (Landi et al., 2021) . This implies that to monitor the current state and spread of the epidemic, other surveillance tests should be used in conjunction with the clinical testing data. Among the common surveillance strategies, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to monitor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater has demonstrated to be an effective technology for public health surveillance (U.S. CDC). As more and more municipalities, laboratories, and universities have taken the efforts to implement systematic wastewater surveillance in the U.S., crucial areas were also identified requiring additional research to further strengthen this approach and take full advantage of its potential for public health actions (Kitajima et al., 2020; Shakil et al., 2020) .",

Currently, descriptive and graphical analyses, correlation analysis , and linear regression analysis (U.S. CDC; Vallejo et al., 2020) are the major tools in the public health interpretation and of wastewater surveillance data. The descriptive analysis and visualizations provide a summary of the sample studied, but the findings are limited to empirical descriptions and interpretations of the epidemic phenomena . In addition, the Spearman's rank correlation test and the regression analysis have limitations, i.e. they are primarily designed for independent data with linear correlations. The wastewater-based epidemiology data being analyzed are in the context of time series data, i.e., dependent data, and may not be linearly correlated either. Thus, the use of those methods may produce misleading inferences.",

Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) prediction models is a general method for fitting multiple versions of a prediction model and then combining (or ensembling) them into an aggregated prediction (Breiman, 1996) . Bagging is a straight-forward algorithm in which b bootstrap copies of the original training data are created, the regression or classification algorithm is applied to each bootstrap sample and, in the regression context, new predictions are made by averaging the predictions together from the individual optimal algorithms. There are several bootstrapping methods appeared in the literature, the stationary block bootstrap scheme as outlined in (Politis and Romano, 1994) was applied to investigate the performance of bagging VAR on our data in this study. A non-parametric stationary block bootstrapping algorithm is developed and demonstrated in Table 2 .

However, no correlation was detected between the two and SARS-CoV-2 concentrations or COVID-19 cases. This finding was also confirmed in (Vallejo et al., 2020) . Therefore, influent wastewater characteristics will not be analyzed in what follows. Descriptive statistics of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and COVID-19 cases for the three studied catchment areas are summarized in Table 3 . Fig. 2 (top panel) illustrates the distributions of the weekly COVID-19 cases and SARS-CoV-2 Concentrations in the IB data. It can be seen that the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 Concentrations is right skewed, after logarithm transformation the distribution becomes less skewed but more regular. That is why most of the data analysis on wastewater data suggest to log transform this variable (U.S. CDC). Distribution of the weekly COVID-19 cases is more like uniform but with some spikes as expected. These spikes can make the data analysis more challenge and the forecasting less reliable. A logarithm transformation can make this variable a slightly more stable. Same conclusion can be drawn for the Salt Lake (SL) City and Green Bay (GB) data as all the mean values are greater than the median values in these data (Table 3) .",

The best forecasting performance of VAR(1) comes from the SL data, as can be seen that the MAPE for 1 week forecast is 11.85% and that for 2 weeks is only 8.97%, both are close to the 10% range. According to Shumway and Stoffer (2017) , MAPE close to 10% indicating a good forecasting performance. The worst forecasting performance comes from the GB data, even though the MAPE for the first week is 31.65%, which can be considered reasonable. The low performance on the GB data is mainly due to the short time span as the length is only 20 weeks. The forecasting ability for the VAR(1) and log-log VAR(1) are very close to each other based on the IB data. The log-log VAR(1) models forecasts slightly better for the first week, but the VAR(1) model forecasts better for both week 2 and week 3 in the future. Thus, it can be concluded that the VAR (1) outperforms the log-log VAR(1) in fitting the data, but not in forecasting future COVID-19 cases. Moreover, one can see that the 95% confidence intervals generated from the VAR(1) model for the IB data includes negative values, which is because there are some zero (0) cases in the data. This problem can be overcome by using the Bootstrap methods.",

As the goal is to forecast the COVID-19 cases from the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater, Fig. 6 shows how a single shock in SARS-CoV-2 concentration impact the COVID-19 cases in the future based on the log-log VAR(1) model for IB data. It can be observed that an increase in the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the current week implies a steadily increase in the COVID-19 cases in the following three weeks and with the maximum impact occur in the third week.

There are, however, two major obstacles (see NIH https://grants.nih.gov/grants/ guide/rfa-files/RFA-OD-20-015.html) in this process: (1) how to enhance and standardize the methods to reduce the cost, time, and inaccuracies in detecting the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater, and (2) how to analyze the data collected and deliver the results to the public.

As it can be seen from the GB data (the sample size for modeling is only 21), the forecasting error can be as high as 100%. Thus, care must be taken when the length of the data is short in practice. Second, the basic VAR model can only be used to model regular (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) data, but not the irregular data. However, it was noticed that in some areas wastewater was monitored multiple times and/or irregularly in each week (such as in some areas in Utah, SARS-CoV-2 concentration were measured irregularly every Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, or sometimes even on Thursdays). If this is the case, to benefit from as much as of the data collected, Mixed-Frequency VAR (Schorfheide and Song, 2015) or Bayesian Mixed Frequency VARs (Eraker et al., 2015) are recommended.",

For example, in the IB data, wastewater sample were collected every Thursday at approximately 7:00 AM, but the COVID-19 cases used were reported on later Wednesday. The second discrepancy is between the wastewater catchment area (where the wastewater sample collected) and the corresponding ZIP code area (where the COVID-19 cases reported). Take the IB data as an example again, where the wastewater catchment area includes two ZIP code areas (15,701 and 15,705) , but these two areas together just cover 92.45% of the population in the wastewater sewer shed. Therefore, more fitting and forecasting accuracy can be gained if the reliability of data collection procedure can be improved. ",

Benefiting from the relatively abundant time series data available, this study has presented that a multivariate time series model, VAR, can be used to forecast the COVID-19 cases at a community level using SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the wastewater. Several important conclusions can be drawn from our data and analysis. First, if the goal is to understand the dynamic relationship between the COVID-19 cases and SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater (Fig. 6) , then the VAR(1) model should be estimated using the logged data. But, if the primary goal to is forecast the future trend and infection counts in the future, the model should be estimated with the original raw data. This conclusion is quite contrary to the current analysis recommendations (U.S. CDC). Second, for short time series, the forecast for the first week is more reliable than that for two or more weeks ahead; but when the time series is relative long, the forecasts for two to three weeks can be reliable. Finally, bootstrapping method can be used to further improve the quality of model estimation and forecasting.",
