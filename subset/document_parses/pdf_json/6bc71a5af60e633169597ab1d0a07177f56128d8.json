            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, which affects different aspects of human life. Until 11 January 2020, more than 88.8 million confirmed cases and 1.92 million death cases have been recorded and its infection rate is still rapidly increasing worldwide [1] . Several laboratory identification tools are used for the detection of COVID-19, such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology [2, 3] . Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard to detect COVID-19 [4] . However, a high false alarm rate usually occurs due to the sample contamination, damage, or virus mutations in the COVID-19 genome. Medical imaging can be considered a first-line investigation tool [5] . Several studies [6, 7] suggested performing chest computerized tomography (CT) image as a secondary test if the suspected patients show symptoms after a negative RT-PCR finding. For instance, in Wuhan, China, among 1014 COVID-19 patients, 59% had positive RT-PCR results, but 88% had positive CT scans. Besides, among the positive RT-PCR results, the CT scans achieved a 97% sensitivity [8] . Thus, CT scans can detect COVID-19 with higher accuracy than RT-PCR. Moreover, CT images can show early lesions in the lung and they can be used for the diagnosis by radiologists. However, radiologists require significant diagnostic experience to distinguish COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia [9] . Radiologists need to carry out two tasks for COVID-19 patients which are identification and severity quantification. The purpose of identification is to identify COVID-19 patients among other patients to isolate them as early as possible. Severity quantification can help medical personnel prioritize the patients who will require emergency medical care. It requires a high evaluation time for radiologists to carry out both tasks. Thus, developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions specific to identification and severity quantification of COVID-19 can offer a fast, efficient, and reliable alternative that can supplement conventional medical diagnostic strategies. Recent studies showed that state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve or exceed the performance of medical experts in numerous medical image diagnosis tasks, such as skin lesion classification [10] , brain tumor detection [11] , breast cancer detection [12] , and lung pathology screening [13, 14] .",

            "text": "In general, COVID-19 recognition from other types of pneumonia has a unique difficulty compared to other lung diseases, such as tuberculosis screening, lung nodule detection, and lung cancer diagnosis. This difficulty arises from the high similarity between different types of pneumonia (especially in the early stage) and large variations in various stages of the same type. Powered by large annotated datasets and modern graphical processing units (GPUs), machine learning especially deep learning techniques, have achieved outbreak performance in several computer vision applications, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Recently, deep learning techniques on chest CT scans and chest X-ray (CXR) images have had increased popularity for diagnosing different lung diseases, showing promising results in various applications. Several studies have been published on CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis systems, using machine learning models [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Several representative studies are summarized and reviewed below. Harmon et al. [20] trained and evaluated a series of deep learning networks on a diverse multi-national cohort of 922 COVID-19 cases and 1695 non-COVID patients to localize lung parenchyma, followed by identification of COVID-19 pneumonia. AH-Net was utilized for lung volume segmentation, achieving a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 95%, while 3D-Densnet-121 was employed to recognize lung regions as COVID-19 or non-COVID. The average score of multiple lung regions was utilized for the classification scheme, achieving 88.9% accuracy, 85.3% sensitivity, and 90.1% specificity. Wang et al. [21] introduced a deep regression framework for automatic pneumonia identification by jointly learning from CT scan images and clinical information (i.e., age, gender, and clinical complaints). Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with ResNet50 as the backbone was used to extract visual features from CT images. The initial clinical information collected from admitted patients (fever, cough, trouble in breathing, etc.) was analyzed by a Long short-term memory (LSTM) network and concatenated with demographic features (age and gender) and extracted visual features from CT images. Finally, a regression framework was utilized to diagnose the suspected patient as Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or normal. The proposed framework was evaluated over 900 clinical cases (450 CAP and 450 normal), achieving accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-Score of 0.946, 0.942, 0.949, and 0.944, respectively. In a similar approach, Mei et al. [22] proposed a joint AI algorithm to combine chest CT findings with clinical data (symptoms, exposure history, and laboratory testing) to diagnose COVID-19 from non-COVID patients using a dataset of 905 cases. The joint model achieved high discriminative performance with 0.92 area under the curve (AUC), 84.3% sensitivity, and 82.8% specificity, outperforming a senior radiologist who achieved 0.84 AUC, 74.6% sensitivity, and 93.8% specificity. The drawback of combined systems is the availability of clinical information, especially when a large number of suspected patients are waiting to be diagnosed. Furthermore, the proposed studies do not show the infection location in the lung which can be useful for the medical personnel for longitudinal monitoring of the patients.",

            "text": "The aforementioned machine learning solutions with CT imaging were limited to only COVID-19 detection. However, COVID-19 pneumonia screening is important for evaluating the status of the patient and treatment. In particular, COVID-19 related infection localization and the segmentation of pneumonia lesions is a crucial task for accurate diagnosis and follow-up of pneumonia patients. Zhou et al. [23] proposed a lesion detection system that can quantify COVID-19 infection regions from the chest CT scans. Three independent two-dimensional (2D) U-Nets are used for x-y, y-z, and x-z views of CT scan, where for each model, five adjacent slices are used as an input, while the network outputs infection prediction mask for the middle slice. The three intermediate binary predictions are aggregated by a simple sum up, with a threshold value of 2 to detect infection pixels. Moreover, to alleviate the data scarcity for annotated infection masks, a dynamic model was developed for data augmentation by simulating the progression of infection regions using multiple CT scan readings from the same patient. With the augmented data, the proposed system showed a performance of 78.3% DSC and 77.6% sensitivity. Besides, deep learning has a high potential to automate the lesion detection task, but requires a large set of high-quality annotations that are difficult to collect during the current pandemic. Learning from noisy training labels that are easier to generate has the potential to alleviate this problem. Wang et al. [24] introduced a novel framework to learn from noisy COVID-19 infection masks. They first proposed a new Dice loss metric, which integrates Dice loss and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Then, a novel COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation network (COPLE-Net) was developed that can segment COVID-19 infected regions with various scales and appearances. Moreover, an adaptive self-ensembling training strategy was proposed, which outperforms standard deep learning training strategies in scenarios of learning from noisy segmentation labels. The proposed framework achieved promising segmentation results with Dice, Relative Volume Error (RVE), and 95 percentile of Hausdorff Distance (HD-95) of 80.72%, 15.96%, and 17.12 \u00b1 29.35 mm, respectively. HD-95 is the distance between the segmentation results and the ground truth in 3D space. Wang et al. [25] proposed a weakly supervised deep learning framework for COVID-19 classification and infection localization. A three-stage framework was introduced, where, first, the lung regions were segmented using a pre-trained 2D U-Net model slice by slice; then, a proposed deep convolutional neural network (DeCoVNet) was used to classify the entire 3D lung volume to COVID-19 or non-COVID. Finally, COVID-19 lesions were localized by integrating the activation regions in the classification network obtained by gradient class activation map (Grad-CAM), with activation maps from the lung segmentation model obtained by a 3D connected components method (3DCC). Therefore, the proposed algorithm does not require annotated infection masks in the training phase, as no dedicated segmentation model is used for infection localization, while ground-truth masks were provided by a professional radiologist for test set only to evaluate the network performance. The introduced algorithm was trained and evaluated on a dataset of only 313 COVID-19, and 229 non-COVID cases achieving classification results of 0.959 AUC value, and 0.976 precision-recall (PR)-AUC. However, a poor infection segmentation performance was reported with a 68.5% of hit rate (HR). Authors in [26] proposed a system that carried out lung and lesion segmentation for CT images using DRUNET, which provides a DSC value of 95.9% for lung segmentation. On the other hand, lesion segmentation network based on DeepLabv3 scored a mean DSC (mDSC) of 58.7% [27] , the network was trained using 4695 CT slice for lung and lesion segmentation. From the previous studies, the performance indicators for lesion segmentation are lower than lung segmentation. Thus, a room for improvement is available. Authors in [23] required a large annotated dataset to increase the performance as only 201 scans were used in the reported results. This is also a problem in other reported research articles [25, 26] . Furthermore, authors in [23, 25] were dealing with images in a 3D environment, which will increase the computing cost and increase the evaluation time.",

            "text": "For severity quantification, several studies recommended that using deep learning can help in the quantification of COVID-19 lung opacification. Moreover, it can eliminate the subjectivity in the initial assessment for COVID-19 patients. Chaganti et al. [28] presented a method that automatically segments and quantifies abnormal CT patterns in COVID-19 patients. The proposed system utilized 9749 chest CT volume and segmented lesions, lungs, and lobe areas and used four matrices for severity quantification: percentage of opacity, percentage of high opacity, lung severity score, and lung high opacity score. Despite the good performance, no clear evaluation metric for segmentation network models was presented. Another work classified the severity into four classes (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) [16] . Lung and lesion segmentation were carried out using the UNet model via commercial tools with a median DSC of 0.85% for both models. Shen et al. [29] created a system that considers computer and radiologist evaluations to determine the COVID-19 patient severity. The computer approach consisted of four phases: segmentation of the lung and lobes, segmentation of the pulmonary vessels, filter out pulmonary vessels from the lung region, and detection of infection. The lesion segmentation was done using thresholds and adaptive region growing. The work showed that the Pearson correlation between computer and radiologist evaluation ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373. The work was carried out using 44 patients only. Thus, a small sample can lead to the bias of computer approach evaluation. Pu et al. [30] created an automated system to quantify COVID-19 severity and progression using chest CT images; 120 patients were used to train and evaluate two U-Net models for lung and vessel segmentation. The proposed system achieved 95% and 81% DSC for lung and lesion segmentation, respectively. It is notable that the model failed to deal with pneumonic regions that are very small and near the vessels. Besides, the work used small datasets for training and testing, and a total of 192 CT volumes were used in this work.",

Several works addressed lung and lesion segmentation, as shown in the previous section, which can help physicians to diagnose COVID-19 accurately and to assess the treatment response. The performance of the lesion segmentation models is still low compared to lung segmentation. This work aims to propose a system to identify and classify the severity of COVID-19 patients into four levels: mild, moderate, severe, and critical infection. Besides, the work investigates different deep learning methods for detecting COVID-19 infected slices from CT volume. For segmentation, U-Net [35] and feature pyramid network (FPN) [36] models were investigated with different encoders to achieve the best performance for lung and lesion segmentation. ResNet18 [37] , ResNet50, ResNet152 [37] , DenseNet121, DenseNet161, and DenseNet201 [38] were used as the backbone encoder for the segmentation models. Additionally, a reliable method was proposed to identify COVID-19 slices from the prediction maps generated by infection segmentation models. Besides, COVID-19 infection is quantified by computing the percentage of infected lung pixels on the segmented lung CT slices. Finally, a 3D volumetric visualization is developed to show the overall infected area in the lungs. This work uses several datasets from 1139 patients (51,027 CT slices) for training and validation and thus the system dealt with different images from different devices with varying image quality levels.",

For infection segmentation, instead of 5-fold cross-validation, 10-fold cross-validation was used. Class imbalance in the dataset impacts the performance of the deep learning models. Thus, data augmentation was used to balance the size of each class in lung and lesion segmentation datasets to ensure every possible aspect of avoiding data overfitting [43] . This step is crucial for the training phase to reduce the associated error from the lung segmentation task, which might propagate to the subsequent lesion segmentation task [44] . We performed data augmentation by applying rotations of 90, \u221290, 180 degrees for CT images and ground truth masks. Table 4 summarizes the number of images per class used for training, validation, and testing at each fold. Independent training and evaluation were provided for both the networks, where original CT slices were used as input to the lung segmentation models, and lung segmented CT slices were used as inputs to the lesion segmentation network, where infection masks were used as groundtruth.

For each model, it was observed that three encoders: DenseNet, 121, 161, and 201 are the top-performing ones for lung segmentation. However, it is visible that the FPN network with different encoders did not improve the results compared with different U-Net architectures, which is a standard network for segmentation tasks. U-Net with DenseNet, 121, 161, and 201 encoders showed the best DSC performance for lung segmentation. DenseNet 121 is the best-performing network for lung segmentation with IoU and DSC of 95.35% and 97.11%, receptively. The outputs of the top three networks compared with the ground truth are shown in Figure 4 . It can be observed that the segmentation of U-Net with DenseNet, 121, 161, and 201 is highly consistent with the ground truth. An interesting observation is the ability of the three networks for creating the segmentation mask for the small lung region. This is considered a challenging task for the deep learners as shown in rows 2 and 3 in Figure 4 , where it was shown that the network can generate a mask for the small lung slices. Although the lungs can be severely affected by COVID-19 lesions, the trained model successfully segmented the lung boundaries, as shown in Figure 4 . This reflects the robustness of the model proposed in this study for lung segmentation.

The confusion matrix for the classification of 1110 patients is shown in Figure 8 and the quantitative evaluation is summarized in Table 8 . From the confusion matrix, it can be observed that the system can reliably classify severe (CT4) volumes with 100% accuracy. Moreover, the majority of normal cases, CT0, were classified correctly; only 12 cases were misclassified, whereas 8 out of the 12 studies presented a low infection percentage of 2-4% by the proposed model. Despite that, the data description of MosMedData Dataset [42] mentioned that no viral pneumonia is shown in CT0 cases. Other types of lung diseases might be present in CT0 cases. Another explanation can be due to errors in the image acquisition phase. Any motion, including breathing and body movements, can lead to small artifacts on the images, which can lead to confusing the lesion model decision. Figure 8 shows that all COVID-19 cases were detected as CT1, CT2, CT3, and CT4; none of the COVID-19 cases were predicated as normal (CT0). In other words, the system can distinguish COVID-19 patients from healthy cases through the entire test set. Thus, the severity classification performance matches the results obtained in the detection section. Furthermore, the proposed system showed lower sensitivity values for moderate (CT2) and severe (CT3) compared to CT0, CT1, and CT4; this can be related to how the dataset was labeled by radiologists.
