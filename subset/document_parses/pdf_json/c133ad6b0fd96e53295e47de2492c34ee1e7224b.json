Cloud computing in IoMT is also used to store IoT data as part of a collaborative effort. Cloud computing has provided new avenues for providing services to users with better user experience, scalability, and proper resource utilization compared to traditional platforms. However, these cloud platforms are susceptible to several security breaches evident from recent and past incidents. Trust management is a crucial feature required for providing secure and reliable service to users. e traditional trust management protocols in the cloud computing situation are centralized and result in single-point failure. Blockchain has emerged as the possible use case for the domain that requires trust and reliability in several aspects. Different researchers have presented various blockchain-based trust management approaches. is study reviews the trust challenges in cloud computing and analyzes how blockchain technology addresses these challenges using blockchain-based trust management frameworks. ere are ten (10) solutions under two broad categories of decentralization and security. ese challenges are centralization, huge overhead, trust evidence, less adaptive, and inaccuracy. is systematic review has been performed in six stages: identifying the research question, research methods, screening the related articles, abstract and keyword examination, data retrieval, and mapping processing. Atlas.ti software is used to analyze the relevant articles based on keywords. A total of 70 codes and 262 quotations are compiled, and furthermore, these quotations are categorized using manual coding. Finally, 20 solutions under two main categories of decentralization and security were retrieved.

Caregivers and healthcare providers can use this information to make timely and data-driven decisions about an individual's health status. is information, on the other hand, is sensitive and personal. As a result, users must guarantee that their medical information is kept confidential, secure, and private. Security and privacy are two of the most pressing concerns in the internet of things. e IoMT devices are resource constrained, and they are reluctant to support the substantial resource requirements of conventional security algorithms due to resource constraints. It is also becoming more popular to develop internet-of-things (IoT) applications in a cloud computing environment since cloud computing environments have the potential to provide infrastructure and capabilities to devices that have limited resources. Because the internet-of-things devices have limited processing and storage capabilities, a cloud layer is required to complement the storage and processing requirements [1, 2] . Aside from that, the internet-of-things devices are not very safe, and the usual security strategy cannot be applied to these devices [3, 4] . e internet of medical things (IoMT) uses devices like cell phones to improve a person's health. But what makes IoMT exciting for the future is its scientific potential. Doctors and researchers can use medical gadgets to uncover new diseases and cures. For example, the public may create a global dataset documenting all individuals' clinical tales [5] . In an untrusted environment, not having a trusted context means ignoring some possible risks: personal health data are considered sensitive and should be protected. Personal and patient-centered care-IoMT-allows patients to share health data with their doctors and provide remote medical support services to maintain personal health records and manage medications. In order to address IoMT security flaws, the BCT makes use of the most recent encryption technologies.",

Cloud computing is becoming a de facto requirement for providing services and scalable and efficient resources [8] . Computer services like software, databases, data analytics, servers, and networking can be delivered through the internet to provide more flexible resources, faster deployment, and cost-efficiency in terms of economies of scale. It is referred to as \"cloud computing\" in some circles. Cloud computing has tremendous economic importance, and it is increasingly emerging. Cloud storage services, however, actually face significant confidence and security issues. In general, the three most significant trust challenges in cloud computing are an absence of suitable information, lack of transparency, loss of control, and assurance measures. In March 2020, 5.2 million guest records were exposed due to a third-party AWS database vulnerability. Similarly, in 2019, 540 million Facebook user records and 49 million Instagram user records were compromised due to the AWS database security vulnerability of third-party applications. Also in 2019, 10.6 million user records of MGM Resorts users were breached due to cloud server vulnerability [4, 9] . In 2016, Cloudflare's platform was compromised by a flaw that leaked encrypted data from its clients, affecting at least 2 million websites [10] . For over 8 hours, Microsoft Azure's public cloud storage failures impacted similar cloud businesses. A data compromise involving Amazon Web Services resulted in the release of the U.S. voters' personal details in June 2017 [10] . A recent survey in 2020 by Check Point Inc. highlights that 82% of users feel that traditional security strategies cannot handle the cloud security threats, and 52% consider that the public cloud is more vulnerable than the conventional environment [11] . All these issues and surveys point to the lack of user trust in the cloud environment and inherent problems of trust management even after a lot of development in the field of cloud computing.",

            "text": "Many scholars have reviewed the aspects of trust management in cloud computing. Li et al. have implemented a novel approach to trust that allows cognitive behavior to be analyzed and predicted by users [12, 13] . Trust models, together with evolutionary algorithms, have also been introduced [14, 15] , as have many useful techniques for trustenabled service management [16, 17] . However, the conventional trust paradigm typically depends on a centralized trust control center for third parties, leading to delays, congestion, and possible single point of failure. Furthermore, in a centralized trust system, as proof of trust is not revealed to all users, the findings of the trust assessment are entirely verifiable by the users. Medical data can be stored and processed in the cloud using IoMT devices connected to cloud services. Cloud-based IoMT security, privacy, and trust issues rapidly arise. Researchers recently paid increased attention to security, privacy, and trust [2] . Data security ensures the data's integrity, validity, and, most crucially, authenticity. It also ensures that only authorized individuals can read and modify data. Privacy preservation is another important goal to keep in mind when constructing IoMT. It accounts for the severity and sensitivity of materials shared across an open and insecure channel. Privacy preservation involves content and context. Content privacy protects patient data from leakage, but patient privacy is difficult to achieve because an attacker can identify patient health based on the attending doctor's identity. Contextual privacy is also critical. Protecting the communication's context is a contextual privacy. Various symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods are utilized in IoMT-enabled healthcare systems. Recent research shows that using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques on resource-constrained devices like IoMT is not optimum. e solution is to use simple privacy-preserving methods on IoT devices and the cloud for complicated ML algorithms. Many studies have been published on cloud-based IoMT security in healthcare systems.",

When it comes to the creation of a modern decentralized trust model, the decentralization aspect of the blockchain is very important [18] . Blockchain offers a modern way to create a trust-enabled cloud computing environment [19, 20] . Blockchain can also be a possible solution in this environment to provide security, trust, and authentication services. To date, a number of researchers have proposed a blockchain-based solution for trust management, which has garnered widespread attention. In this study, we have examined a variety of pertinent topics and examined, classified, and contrasted them. On the other hand, blockchain-based trust building in a cloud-based system is fraught with problems and difficulties, such as blockchain assaults, the high overhead of consensus mechanisms, and delays in real-time transaction processing. Furthermore, this work provides various suggestions for future research in the area of blockchain-based trust management. e following are the most significant contributions made by this study: e existing blockchain-based trust techniques are reviewed for cloud computing systems. On the basis of established parameters, the various blockchain-based trust techniques are compared for cloud-based systems that were accessible. Cloud computing and IoMT and their layered architecture are integrated. Prospective research directions are identified in blockchain-based trust management for cloud-based systems. Research is suggested for future work, i.e., integrating IoMT with blockchain and machine learning, 6G, and the effect of quantum computing on IoMT.",

Usually, the third-party management center requires a conventional identity management approach. e authentication center provides services of identity authentication on request to cloud entities. It can effortlessly lead to security threats and risks, such as excessive certification center authority and single point failure. Identity federations are one of the alternative solutions that are broadly distributed systems to address security and trust problems across multiple domains, though they increase system design and operational complexity [48] .

After establishing their identity and evaluating blockchain authorization, users submitted data sharing requests via the service agent and were provided with the relevant data service. e suggested approach employs a Shapley value-based incentive mechanism that is further validated using the SVM model and generates mining revenue via PoW, PoS, and PEFT consensus mechanisms. Zhu et al. (2019) designed a controllable blockchain data management (CBDM) model for cloud computing [62] . It used both the normal voting nodes and the third-party higher-level trust authorities for transaction verification. e model provides data management in a controlled manner and increases efficiency and trust. It utilizes a SaaS service for cloud storage. is scheme proposes two new user registration and voting and counting algorithms. A key generation scheme based on bilinear pairing techniques has been used to provide security to the system during the registration process. Access control is a methodology to restrict access or control access to protect the corporate and user's personal data in the cloud. However, centralized access management techniques frequently result in the loss of data integrity, privacy leaks, and the possibility of hacker assaults. To address these challenges, a blockchain-based access control architecture-dubbed AuthPrivacyChain has been suggested and deployed based on enterprise operations [63] .",

            "text": "e AuthPrivacyChain designed an access control and identity authentication mechanism to address the entities in the blockchain with unique IDs. Using blockchain's decentralized nature, the distributed and decentralized control system for cloud access has been introduced, thereby improving the privacy and security of data applications. e proposed model provides access control in the form of decentralized access control, revocation using revocation authorization, and privacy protection using the AES encryption algorithm. It refines users' data protection and privacy and effectively resists internal and external attacks. Cloud computing has become a vital technology in the era of industry 4.0 for globalization and intelligent computing development. Cloud manufacturing faces many technological challenges-including security, reliability, data manipulation, and single failure points, constrained by conventional centralized architecture and third-party trust entities [64] . e paper [65] applied a collaboration arrangement between consumers and resource providers using the blockchain-based decentralized cloud manufacturing application model. A smart contract named blockchain-based DCMApp (decentralized cloud manufacturer application) was used for the provision of service under the agreement. It uses an IPFS for storage and anyone from PoS, PoW, or DPoS for a consensus mechanism. e cloud service-level agreement (SLA) does not always assure that it can be credibly implemented and automatically as expected. is study introduced a conventional SLA service model and named it witnesses, containing cloud service interaction protocol [61] . e role is to detect service infringements and guarantee the credibility of data transactions. e proposed model obtained benefits from cloud transactions in which the witnesses are the ordinary nodes of the blockchain network. e witness model basically comprises three attributes: witness selection, violation detection, and audit. Witness selection uses the Nash equilibrium principle; the audit mechanism uses the payoff function and violation detection through the unbiased sorting algorithm. Witnesses assist by monitoring the transactions to successfully proceed and oblige all parties to fulfill their credit obligations. In conventional cloud storage for data deletion, the single-bit return protocol is typically used, which can easily result in unreliable deletion. However, some deletion strategies have drawbacks, such as nonverifiable deletion A blockchain-based data deletion framework was implemented by [62] to boost verification, reliability, efficiency, accountability, and transparency. e proposed secure data deletion scheme has two main functionalities: transparency and malicious behavior detection. A publicly verifiable data deletion scheme provides transparency, and cryptographic primitives such as ECDA along with timestamping provide malicious behavior detection. Both file/data operations are registered in the blockchain to guarantee the data deletion on the server is truthful. K. Bendiab et al. (2018) proposed a novel blockchain-based identity management model, which accords the operative trust authority service to cloud computing schemes [63] .",
