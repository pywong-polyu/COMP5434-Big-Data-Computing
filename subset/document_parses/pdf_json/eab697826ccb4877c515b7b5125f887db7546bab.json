However, a significant proportion of people hesitate to accept vaccination and some refuse, which poses a major challenge for vaccine control against infectious diseases [2] . As a background for such vaccine hesitancy, the existence of sociodemographic, psychological, physical, and contextual barriers has been identified [3] and, particularly regarding psychological barriers, many related factors in the explanation and modeling for evaluation, such as the 3Cs (Complacency, Convenience, and Confidence) model [4] and the 5Cs (Confidence, Complacency, Constraints, Calculation, and Collective responsibility) model [5] , have been proposed. These factors include individualspecific factors and environment-dependent factors. Regarding sociodemographic barriers among personal factors, different tendencies have been observed by various studies. For example, women and older adults have both been reported to be vaccination barriers as well as promoters [3] . The basics of psychological barriers can be considered in the context of how to grasp the relationship between vaccination efficacy and risk. Regarding the efficacy of vaccination, the seriousness of the target infectious disease, perception and anxiety about the possibility of infection, and the degree of understanding of the efficacy of the vaccine itself are related [6] . Regarding the risk of inoculation, knowledge about vaccine non-responsiveness [6] and risk preference are related [7] . In this respect, it has been pointed out that there are different gender-specific tendencies regarding risk preference and vaccine inoculation behavior [8] .",

A survey among schoolteachers and staff by Gargono et al. [10] found differences in some psychological variables, although similar factors affected pandemic and seasonal vaccine inoculation and the reasons for vaccinations were the same. By contrast, Vaux et al. [11] reported that there was a difference in inoculation factors between the vaccines, such as that the high risk of infection was not a predictor in the pandemic vaccine. A survey of clinical risk groups with asthma, chronic heart disease, diabetes, etc. by Sammon et al. reported that the pandemic influenza vaccination rate was lower than that of the seasonal vaccine, although similar factors affected both vaccines [12] .",

Because the main complaints of influenza are fever and malaise, it is difficult to distinguish it from COVID-19 based on symptoms alone, and to diagnose COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen tests, are required [13] . In Japan, although the number of infected people is small in comparison with other countries, the implementation system of tests for diagnosis was insufficient around the fall of 2020. If there was a strong suspicion of a new coronavirus infection after receiving instructions from a public health center or seeing an attending physician, the patient was mandated to undergo tests such as RT-PCR, the results of which were not immediately known [14] . In addition, owing to the small number of infected people, those infected and their close contacts tended to be given special attention. In some cases, the workplace ordered them to remain at home longer than necessary. At the stage when the vaccine against COVID-19 was not yet available, the 2020/2021 seasonal influenza vaccination was recommended for the purpose of preventing influenza, which is difficult to distinguish from COVID-19 [15] . In other words, the expectation for the efficacy of the vaccine is to prevent not only influenza itself but also the possibility of being treated for COVID-19, while the vaccine itself is a seasonal influenza vaccine that has been generally inoculated thus far, with the risk of adverse reactions relatively well known. In such a distinctive situation, examining the factors that contribute to vaccination may provide new insights into vaccine hesitancy.",

Participants were workers aged 20 to 65 years at the time of the survey and were stratified by cluster sampling according to gender, age, and region of residence. Participants provided informed consent before answering the questionnaire. After participants with insufficient responses were excluded, 27,036 individuals were enrolled. We then excluded 195 people infected with COVID-19 and 204 who were close contacts, meaning that 26,637 were finally available for analysis.

Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccines. It is influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence\" [19] . Because vaccination is an effective means for infectious disease control and is indispensable for the acquisition of herd immunity, the existence of such vaccine hesitancy is a major issue in infectious disease control [2] . Many studies have pointed out that various influential factors have an effect on vaccine hesitancy. The present study, performed at the time of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, targets vaccination behavior in special situations that have not been experienced so far, namely that it is difficult to distinguish influenza from COVID 19 on the basis of initial symptoms and that, given this may impose a burden on the medical system, seasonal vaccination was recommended to help prevent such a situation. In addition, it is possible to compare the already reported effects of COVID-19 vaccine with the intention to be inoculated [17] . Therefore, the purpose of our study was to provide new findings for research into vaccine hesitancy.",

From our results, we considered that more subjects with underlying disease were vaccinated because of the perceived susceptibility of these three dimensions. However, vaccination decisions will not only be made through risk perception of infection but also by comparing the positive and negative aspects of vaccination, such as efficacy of the vaccine and the risks of side effects [6] .",

If contracting influenza it was necessary to consult a medical institution or contact a health center in a situation whereby it was difficult to distinguish influenza from COVID-19, complicated by problems that occurred in the diagnostic process and results. At the time of the survey in Japan, where the number of infected people was smaller than in Western countries and the establishment of testing systems such as RT-PCR was delayed, it took time to make a definitive diagnosis [14] and there was also prejudice against infected people. According to ISO 31000 [21] , the international standard for risk management, risk is the effect of uncertainty on various purposes, and uncertainty is an important factor in risk assessment. Specifically, the higher the uncertainty, the higher is the risk perception. The annual influenza vaccination rate for the Japanese population is reported to be around 30%-40% for adults under the age of 65 years [22, 23] , and in this study conducted in December the vaccination rate was already slightly higher than was stated in these reports. This may be due to the relatively high risk of contracting seasonal influenza, resulting in increased perception of vaccine efficacy.",

In the area of health behavior, it has been reported that smokers also have a higher risk preference: they do not measure their blood pressure, do not use floss to brush their teeth, and have more accidents at work or at home than non-smokers [25] .

Our results suggest that the lower the risk preference, the higher is the vaccination behavior, arising from recognition of the greater risk of non-vaccination against the background scenario that the vaccine is highly effective. In addition, regarding risk preference and vaccination, a positive relationship between risk aversion and the demand for influenza vaccine has been reported [18] . However, there are gender differences in this relationship, with risk preference being positively associated with vaccination behavior in men but not in women [8] . Our results showed that women had lower ORs than men, but women could have similar relationships, indicating that risk preference could affect vaccination in women although to a lesser extent than in men, which is a new finding. In addition, although the analysis results were not shown in this paper, no similar effect was observed on the COVID-19 pandemic vaccine. Such risk preference may affect the vaccination behavior of COVID-19 and seasonal vaccines, especially in women. Risk preference is generally measured by asking whether to bring an umbrella according to the probability of rain, as in this study, or whether or not to participate in the lottery based on the probability of winning and the amount of money, an approach also used in vaccine research [8, 18] . We used the question about bringing an umbrella because more people are familiar with it.",
