Phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is required for its function and inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium impairs N phosphorylation, viral transcription, and replication. Here we report that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains GSK-3 consensus sequences and that this motif is conserved in diverse coronaviruses, despite limited overall sequence conservation, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be sensitive to GSK-3 inhibitors including lithium. We conducted a retrospective analysis of lithium use in patients from three major health systems who were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2. We found that patients taking lithium have a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio = 0.51 [0.34 -0.76], p = 0.001). We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3. Knockout of GSK3A and GSK3B demonstrates that GSK-3 is essential for N phosphorylation. Alternative GSK-3 inhibitors block N phosphorylation and impair replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells in a cell-type dependent manner.",

The response to this crisis will require multiple approaches for detection, prevention, and treatment. With three major b-coronavirus epidemics in less than 20 years, it would also be prudent to anticipate new coronavirus outbreaks in the future. In addition to development of effective vaccines, antiviral strategies that target conserved mechanisms in coronavirus replication and transmission may be needed for COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus outbreaks. Recent high throughput screens have identified bioactive compounds that impair viral replication and infectivity in tissue culture models of infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronvavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, their mechanisms of action and their clinical efficacy remain to be fully delineated and additional targets may be needed to combat SARS-CoV-2, new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and potential novel coronavirus outbreaks in the future.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses express a nucleocapsid (N) protein that is essential for viral replication, transcription, and assembly [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . N proteins from the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) and from SARS-CoV, which caused the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, are phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) within an arginine-serine (RS) domain present in N proteins of diverse coronaviruses [7] [8] [9] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Phosphorylation of the JHMV N protein is required for recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX1 and for transcription of long subgenomic RNAs 8 ; inhibition of GSK-3 impairs recruitment of DDX1, binding to viral mRNAs, and viral replication. N These observations suggest that inhibition of GSK-3 could impair coronavirus infections in vivo, including COVID-19 [25] [26] [27] . A recent phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 N protein is highly phosphorylated within the RS domain 1 , but whether GSK-3 phosphorylates SARS-CoV-2 N protein and whether lithium has any effect against SARS-CoV- 2 have not yet been tested. Here we show that GSK-3 is essential for phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, that alternative GSK-3 inhibitors impair N phosphorylation and SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells, and that litihum therapy is associated with significantly reduced risk of COVID-19. Targeting GSK-3 may therefore provide an antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and for coronavirus infections that may arise in the future.",

The RS domains of N from SARS-CoV and JHMV include repeated motifs (SXXXS) 9 that are frequently associated with GSK-3 phosphorylation, in which the C-terminal serine is phosphorylated by a priming kinase 28 , which then allows GSK-3 to phosphorylate multiple serines or threonines spaced 4 residues apart in the C to N terminal direction (Fig. 1A) . The sequence of the RS domain of SARS-CoV-2 N is 90% similar to N from SARS-CoV, and both proteins contain two sets of three SXXXS motifs each (labeled \"a\" and \"b\" in Fig. 1A and 1B) . While the N protein sequences of other coronaviruses diverge, they retain SXXXS motifs (Fig. 1B) . In addition, the fourth serine (presumed priming site) is always preceded by an arginine in the -3 position 4 (SRXXS).

Similarly, mutation of the two putative priming sites in SARS-CoV N blocks phosphorylation by GSK-3 9 . To test whether the SARS-CoV-2 N protein also requires priming site serines, we mutated serine-188 and serine-206 of SARS-CoV-2 N protein to alanines (N S188A,S206A ) and then expressed the single and double mutant N proteins in HEK293T cells. The single mutant form N S188A migrates in the same position as phosphorylated wild-type N protein whereas the N S206A migrates more rapidly, suggesting that it is hypophosphorylated (Fig. 2C ). Mobility of the N S188A,S206A protein is similar to dephosphorylated N protein and is not affected by GSK-3 inhibition LiCl (Fig. 2C ) or treatment with alkaline phosphatase ( Figure S2A ). Additionally, both of the single serine to alanine mutants are more sensitive to LiCl.

Our analysis of retrospective EHR data on SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from three major health systems across the US showed a ~50% reduced risk of COVID-19 in patients taking lithium. We show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3 and that lithium and other GSK-3 inhibitors block N phosphorylation, as shown previously for JHMV and SARS-CoV 9 . We also show for the first time that GSK-3 is unequivocally essential for N phosphorylation using GSK3A/B double KO. Diverse GSK-3 inhibitors inhibit N phosphorylation and impair SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture models. GSK-3 inhibition may therefore allow safe and effective therapy for COVID-19. As we find GSK-3 consensus sites in the N proteins of diverse coronaviruses, GSK-3 inhibitors may also be effective antiviral therapy in other coronavirus infections, including those that may arise in the future.",

For instance, details on medicine usage were derived from records of prescription orders, but information on compliance before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing is not available. In addition, the collection of a non-random sample population can create a collider bias and lead to distorted associations. For example, the COVID-19 test was restricted particularly in the early pandemic to symptomatic patients so that many asymptomatic patients in the EHR were not tested.

Furthermore, the clinically well tolerated drug Enzastaurin was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in A549-Ace2 cells 1 and viral-mediated cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells 4 . However, the effects of these inhibitors has been variable in different cell lines and in different laboratories. For example, Bouhaddou et al did not observe inhibition with Enzastaurin in Vero6 cells and we did not observe inhibition with Enzastaurin in A549-Ace2 cells or Calu-3 cells. The reasons for this cell type specific effect and variability between laboratories is unclear, but may include differences in the expression and/or activity of targeted signaling pathways in different cell lines that may arise as an adaptation to cell culture conditions and passage number. Nevertheless, it remains clear that GSK-3 is essential for N phosphorylation, as GSK3 knockout abrogates N phosphorylation, and given the essential functions of phosphorylated N in viral transcription, replication, and packaging 8 , developing GSK-3 inhbitors that safely and effectively inhibit N phosphorylation is a promising potential approach to controlling SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections that may arise in the future.",

Combined loss of GSKA and GSK3B impairs phosphorylation of N and b-catenin and enhances sensitivity to LiCl. B. GSK3B was deleted in GSK3A -/cells using CRISPR (GSK3 DKO). N protein was expressed in both wild-type and DKO cells in the presence of increasing concentrations LiC for 18h as above and immunoblotted for N protein, phospho-GS (pGS), total b-catenin, GSK-3a/b, and bactin. N is not phosphorylated in DKO cells and mobility is not affected by LiCl treatment. Total b-catenin protein accumulates in absence of GSK-3. C. Serine-188 and serine-206 were mutated to alanine by site directed mutagenesis and single and double mutant N proteins were expressed in 293T cells in the presence of vehicle or 10mM LiCl and immunoblotted for N protein, pGS, or b-actin. The double mutant N S188A;S206A migrates similar to dephosphorylated wild-type N. Single mutants are more sensitive to LiCl. D/E. N protein was immunoprecipitated from wild-type HEK293T cells treated with or without 10mM LiCl for 18h (indicated by \"CTL\" or \"LiCL\" below each lane in panel D) or from GSK3 DKO cells (panel E). Immunoprecipitated N protein was added to an in vitro kinase reaction with recombinant GSK-3b.

Given the major coronavirus epidemics over the past 20 years, including SARS, COVID-19, and MERS, new coronavirus outbreaks in the future are possible. Multiple approaches will be needed to address current and potential future outbreaks, including the development of medications that target common features of coronavirus. Interfering with the conserved dependence of the nucleocapsid protein on the host protein GSK-3 may be a viable approach to treat COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus outbreaks. Methods Plasmids, antibodies: The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene was PCR amplified from cDNA derived from the isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CA-CZB017/2020 (Genbank MT385497.1), nucleotides 28254-29513, and cloned into pCS2MT in frame with five N terminal myc epitope tags (https://www.addgene.org/153201/). Priming site mutations were generated by site directed mutagenesis to modify serine-188 and serine-206 to alanine based on prior observations with SARS-CoV-1 9 . Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N protein were purchased from Invitrogen (#PA1-41386). Antibodies from Cell Signaling included phospho-Glycogen Synthase (#3891), phospho-S6 (#4858), b-catenin (#9562), phospho-b-catenin (#9561), GAPDH (#2118), PKC\u03b1 (#2056), PKC\u03b4 (#2058), PKC\u03b5 (#2683), and phospho (Ser) substrate (#2261).

SARS-CoV2 N was expressed in MLE12 cells, treated with LiCl for 18h, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for N protein (upper panel) and phosphorylated b-catenin (lower panel). Alkaline phosphatase (AP) treatment of cell lysates increases electrophoretic mobility. \"P\" indicates slower migrating, phosphorylated N and \"un-P\" indicates dephosphorylated species. B. N was expressed in 293T cells, treated with 10 mM LiCl, and cell lysates were harvested at different time points for Western blot analysis. CoV-2 N protein (upper panel); b-actin (lower panel) is loading control. C. Alternative GSK-3 inhibitors Kenpaullone and AR-A014418 inhibit N protein phosphorylation. SARS-CoV2 N expressing 293T cells treated for 18h with Kenpaullone or AR-A014418 at the indicated concentrations were immunoblotted as in panel B.Supplementary Figure S2 . A. Serine-188 and serine-206 of SARS-CoV-2 N protein were mutated to alanine and single and double mutant N proteins were expressed in 293T cells. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) treatment of cell lysates increases electrophoretic mobility. B. mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin had no effect on N phsohorylation. SARS-CoV2 N expressing 293T cells were treated with Rapamycin (50 and 200 nM) in the presence of LiCl for 18h and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for N protein (upper panel) and phosphorylation of -catenin (middle panel) and S6 (lower panel). Rapamycin inhibited S6 phosphorylation but had no effect on N phosphorylation. \"P\" indicates phosphorylated N; \"Un-P\" indicates dephosphorylated species. C. N expressing 293T cells were treated with LiCl or the SRPK inhibitor SRPIN340 separately (left panel) or in combination (right panel) and cell lysates were then harvested for Western blot analysis as in panels A and B. Figure S3 . A. N expressing 293T cells were treated with DMSO or increasing doses of Enzastaurin and then stimulated with 200nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 30 mins prior to lysis. PKC activity was assessed with an antibody that detects phosphorylated PKC substrates. b-actin is shown as a loading control. B. N expressing 293T cells were treated with DMSO or increasing doses of the PKC inhibitors Enzastaurin and G\u00f66976 and stimulated with PMA as in panel A. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for N protein (upper panel), phospho-GS (middle panel), or phosphorylated PKC substrates (lower panel). G\u00f66976 does not affect phosphorylation of N or GS. C. The structurally related PKC inhibitors Sotrastaurin and G\u00f66983 inhibit N phosphorylation. N expressing cells were treated with Sotrastaurin or G\u00f66983 at the indicated concentrations and then lysates were immunotted for N and p-GS as above. D. Global PKC knockdown does not affect phosphorylation of N protein or GS. N expressing 293T cells were treated with vehicle or LiCl, then transfected with siRNAs directed against PKC\u03b1, PKC\u03b4, or PKC\u03b5 individually or in combination, as described previously 46 . Cell lysates were immunoblotted for CoV-2 N protein, pGS, or PKC isoforms as indicated in figure. b-actin was a loading control. E. N protein was immunoprecipitated from GSK3 DKO cells as in Fig. 2E and added to an in vitro kinase reaction with recombinant GSK-3b. Phosphorylation of N protein assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift was inhibited in the presence of 5uM Enzastaurin, 10uM Sotrastaurin, or 2uM CHIR99021.",
