A vital step in the battle against it is the successful screening of infected patients, together with one of the effective screening methods being radiology examination using chest radiography. Recognition of epidemic growth patterns across temporal and social factors can improve our capability to create epidemic transmission designs, including the critical job of predicting the estimated intensity of the outbreak morbidity or mortality impact at the end. The study's primary motivation is to be able to estimate with a certain level of accuracy the number of deaths due to COVID-19, managing to model the progression of the pandemic. Predicting the number of possible deaths from COVID-19 can provide governments and decision-makers with indicators for purchasing respirators and pandemic prevention policies. Thus, this work presents itself as an essential contribution to combating the pandemic. Kalman Filter is a widely used method for tracking and navigation and filtering and time series. Designing and tuning machine learning methods are a labor-and time-intensive task that requires extensive experience. The field of automated machine learning Auto Machine Learning relies on automating this task. Auto Machine Learning tools enable novice users to create useful machine learning units, while experts can use them to free up valuable time for other tasks. This paper presents an objective method of forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak using Kalman Filter and Auto Machine Learning. We use a COVID-19 dataset of Cear\u00e1, one of the 27 federative units in Brazil. Cear\u00e1 has more than 235,222 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 8850 deaths due to the disease.

Explore the rise kinetics of an epidemic can help create well-grounded algorithms to predict and learn the essential features of infectious diseases' growth dynamics. The strength of the outbreak is represented in mathematical functions, modeling the transmission, and this is commonly estimated using time-series analysis describing the plague spread as a function of time (Viboud et al. 2016) .",

Additionally, in 2004, the first automatic feature selection methods are released (Samanta 2004) . A full model selection has been the initial effort to automatically construct a whole ML pipeline by simultaneously choosing a preprocessing, feature selection, and classification algorithm while controlling every method's hyperparameters (Escalante et al. 2009 ). From 2011, several different ways of applying Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning (Komer et al. 2014; Snoek et al. 2012 ) and model selection (Thornton et al. 2013) . In 2015, Kanter and Veeramachaneni presented the automatic feature engineering without domain knowledge (Kanter and Veeramachaneni 2015) . Ardabili et al. use a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to forecast COVID-19 cases (Ardabili et al. 2020 ). Pinter et al. use hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) to predict time series of COVID-19 infected individuals and mortality rate (Pinter et al. 2020 ). Erraissi et al. present a Spark ML approach to predict COVID-19 cases (Erraissi et al. 2020) .",

Researchers have handled this optimization problem using several different methods. The first approach is primarily based on Bayesian Optimization (Komer et al. 2014; Kotthoff et al. 2017) , which employs a probabilistic model to catch distinct hyperparameter configurations and their performance. Auto-sklearn, one of the most notable works relying on this approach, embraced a random-forest-based sequential model-based optimization technique for overall algorithm configuration. It utilizes meta-learning to recognize a previously optimized dataset closest to the given dataset and utilizes the famous dataset's configuration to bootstrap the iterative optimization procedure.",

The second approach using the Kalman Filter is to use the SEIR method; in this case, the data generated from the SEIR model were used in the filter. The third and last is the use of the hybrid data set, which consists of joining the data from Cear\u00e1 and data generated from the SEIR model, before applying the data in the Kalman filter.

Figure 6 shows the prediction for the COVID-19 death rate curve in the state of Cear\u00e1 one month before the curve plateau was reached.

The proposed Kalman Filter prediction approach is providing encouraging results for short-term predictions. Kalman filter-based proposed model is showing a large mean average error in the longterm. Hence, it can be concluded that the proposed prediction model is suitable for short-term prediction i.e., daily and weekly. The proposed prediction model can be updated to accommodate medium-term time-series predictions to discover the curve's plateau, but with large error in the absolute number of cases. Table 2 presents the results for the H2O AutoML applied to Cear\u00e1 COVID-19 deaths data set. The model id shows the best models chosen. The generalized linear model (GLM) was the one that obtained the best result. The first column present the name of model used (Fig. 7) . Figure 8 shows the prediction curve for COVID-19 deaths in Cear\u00e1 with the best model obtained by the H2O.ai framework.

Table 4 compares the best two approaches presented in this study with state of art regression models. TPOT and Kalman Filter obtain the best R 2 score. The Prophet is a nonlinear model that modifies the seasonality, trend, and holidays of the time series. Holt-Winters is a method applied to time series. We use the multiplicative method due to the curve's growth in the data, generally an exponential shape.

The exponential increase in cases strongly suggests that the epidemic growth is an underlying biological phenomenon instead of the number of tests completed. Some studies indicate that there is a particular generality from the temporal growth of COVID-19. Even though these facts, in a limited community, the exponential development of instances cannot stay forever. Hence, the stochastic model of disease spread saturates sometime. Forecasting plays a vital role in several study regions due to its benefits in conserving funds or improving the decision-making process to benefit the market.

The AutoML models used at work have considerable success. However, such models need to have training data that was not available at the beginning of the pandemic. The Kalman Filter model was accurate in terms of the longterm plateau date and the number of short-term forecasting cases. For long-term forecasting, AutoML models are a good option based on available training data. The distinction between the approach presented and the one usually used in other studies is that the use of Kalman Filter provides a long-term prediction at the beginning of the epidemic period using data from other countries/regions and the application of AutoML allows the semi-automatic selection of best model with better precision for the prediction of COVID-19 deaths.",

Several improvements are emerging to improve the standard of SIR-based models suitable for this COVID-19 outbreak. As an alternative to the SIR-based models, this study showed the use of machine learning models to predict the outbreak progression. We show that by using the Kalman Filter and AutoML models, we can achieve very high accuracy in predict COVID-19 cases. This study also shows that it is possible to achieve a R 2 score of 0.99 on the prediction of COVID-19 deaths. The study presented has as main findings that using the TPOT application in predicting COVID-19 cases has a high R 2 score. The Kalman Filter can be used effectively for long-term prediction. The main limitations of using the method are that in AutoML approaches, training data is needed to create the models, making its use impractical at the beginning of the pandemic. The Kalman Filter approach needs data from other countries/cities to feed the model, which makes it feasible to use the approach but with the risk that if the behavior of the country's epidemic curve used to feed the model has very different characteristics from the region where we want to get the death curve can lead to a high margin of error. The difference between the approach presented and the one commonly used in other studies is that the use of Kalman Filter allows a long-term prediction at the beginning of the epidemic period using data from other countries/regions and the application of AutoML allows the semi-automatic choice of best model with better precision for the prediction of COVID-19 deaths.
