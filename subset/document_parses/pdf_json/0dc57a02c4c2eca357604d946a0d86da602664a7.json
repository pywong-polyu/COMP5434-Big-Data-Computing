It also plays an important role in the education and training of young people and professionals [66, 67] . In a simulated environment, the weather, lighting, and other factors can be controlled, which cannot be controlled in a real environment. Multiple scenes can also be presented in a short time and randomly presented in a sequence, thus breaking the restrictions of time and space and being conducive to multi-sensory experiments and the collection of physiological data [68] . VR technology has also been applied in mental health education [69] ; the prevention, assessment, and intervention of mental illness [70] [71] [72] ; in the medical field [73, 74] . Existing studies have confirmed that VR technology can successfully treat delusions, hallucinations, and other psychiatric symptoms, as well as improving the effectiveness and generality of cognitive and social skills, with the recognition that immersive VR therapy is safe, acceptable, and has a long-term effect [75] .",

Relevant studies have proved that using virtual scenes for education can improve people's emotions and consciousness [78, 79] . The current virtual scene construction technology is riper, and the virtual scene is more flexible and controllable and can also be used to explore the interaction between people and the scene.

A VR system consists of a computer, a headmounted display, headphones, and motion-sensing gloves [80] . Compared to television and other media, VR can cause a greater degree of improvement in positive emotions, which seems to be mediated by a stronger sense of presence and natural interaction [76] . Presence, also known as a sense of presence, is a sense of being in an intermediary environment [81] , which is a psychological state of being. It is also a specific cognitive process [82] ; that is, the psychological experience of individuals feeling themselves in the virtual environment created by computer monitors. There are three main categories: personal, social, and environmental. Personal presence is the extension of the experiencer's sensory emotions to the virtual environment, resulting in an immersive experience and a sense of psychological participation. Social presence is the degree of coexistence and interaction with other creatures in the virtual environment, while environmental presence is the degree to which experiencers respond to the environment [83] . Self-efficacy is an intermediary between social presence and cognitive presence [84] . Researchers have proposed that it is necessary to further explore the differences in VR technology in different environments and the impact of such differences on individual self-efficacy [85] .",

            "text": "Sheridan proposed the development of a scientifically useful presence metric and determined its significance and value in remote operation applications [86] . Mel and Slater believed that presence is not the same as immersion [87] . They established an equation, where the left side contains presence, and the right side contains the factors of immersion and the differences between individuals. Time [88] , content [89] , user characteristics [90] , attention resources and participation, immersion, and interaction [91, 92] are all factors that affect the sense of presence. Its measurement methods include objective measurement and subjective reporting. Observing postural response amplitude, measuring heart rate and skin electricity, and observing facial expressions, gestures, head movements, eyes, intonation, and other social behaviors can reflect the sense of presence [93] [94] [95] . The Presence Questionnaire (PQ) was developed and revised in 2005 based on four dimensions [96] : control, sensation, distraction, and reality. The virtual environment physiologically stimulates the emotional state of the user, which, in turn, enhances their sense of presence [97] . It is regulated by the environment, which attracts the senses and attention and promotes active participation, which may be real, virtual, symbolic, or some combination thereof [98] . Schubert argues that Glenberg's embodied cognitive framework is the means used to explain the sense of presence. Presence is the result of media perception [99] . In the process of presence perception, a mental model of virtual three-dimensional space is constructed. This model is composed of possible behaviors in space, and the body's actions are the core. In other words, because the virtual environment is perceived according to specific actions, the mental state of presence is generated. The production process of the sense of presence is consistent with the theory of embodied cognition that cognition is generated through physical experience and its activity mode. Therefore, in this study, EMG is used as another indicator of presence.",

Studies have pointed out that simulating the experience of an urban or natural environment has a positive effect on mental health [101, 102] , and virtual nature may be a beneficial supplement to actual nature. It helps people to reconnect with the real natural world and promotes interactions between people and nature [103] . In addition, VR environments have the restorability of physical forest environments and are even more attractive and coherent. Some researchers have applied VR technology to the study of psychological recovery due to exposure to a natural environment [104] , proving the stimulating effect of forest environments and natural sounds in VR on the recovery of psychological stress. Exposure to VR-based natural environments can promote stress reduction and the improvement of mood [105] , which provides a practical basis for exploring VR-based restorative environments. Although natural environment experiences can bring restorative feelings [18] , existing studies have also shown that participants in virtual natural environments show more positive psychological effects, compared to in urban environments [47] . On the one hand, restorative environments, especially environments based on VR, are not necessarily only natural environments, and so, it is necessary to explore different healing factors. On the other hand, immersive VR systems can create intimate interactions with the environment through headgear and controllers, thus creating high-presence experiences from the perspective of a first-person narrative, which is conducive to reducing boredom [76] , stimulating positive emotions, and improving the sense of self-efficacy [106] ; however, existing studies on the restoration of positive and negative emotions and cognitive functions from the perspective of VR-based environment settings and interactions are few, and further studies on the mind-body action mechanism are needed.",

Different VR restorative environment experiences will have different healing effects on the directions of change in individual emotions and self-efficacy.

Figure 15 shows the descriptive statistical results of positive and negative emotions and self-efficacy. In order to further clarify how the emotional and self-efficacy score of the participants changed after the scene experience, whether it was significantly increased or decreased, and whether there were different directions of change between different scenes, a paired samples t-test was conducted for the positive and negative emotional and self-efficacy scores of the five groups before and after experiencing the VR scenes. The results are shown in Table 2 . In the Env1, for positive emotions, there was no significant difference before and after the VR scene experience. For negative emotions, it was significantly reduced after the scene experience. For general self-efficacy, the margin of difference before and after the VR scene experience was significant, self-efficacy increased after the scene experience. It was found that the VR urban environment visual experience significantly reduced negative emotions, but had no significant impact on individual positive emotions or self-efficacy, which was not consistent with our expectations. In the Env2 condition, for positive emotions, there was no significant difference before and after the VR scene experience. For negative emotions, the score of negative emotion after scene experience was significantly lower than before. For general self-efficacy, there was a significant improvement after the VR scene experience. It was shown that the visual experience in the VR restorative environment significantly reduced negative emotions and significantly increased self-efficacy, but had no significant influence on individual positive emotions. In the Env3 condition, for positive and negative emotions, there was a significant decrease after the VR scene experience. For general self-efficacy, there was no significant difference before and after the VR scene experience. It was found that the interactive experience in the VR restorative environment significantly reduced positive and negative emotions, but had no significant influence on individual self-efficacy.

For negative emotions, it was significantly reduced after the scene experience. For general self-efficacy, there was a significant improvement after the VR scene experience. It was found that the VR restorative environment interactive experience with fishing significantly reduced negative emotions and enhanced self-efficacy, but had no significant influence on positive emotions.

The low-tohigh-pass EMG filtering was set in the range of 1-500 Hz, and the EMG and EEG signals after initial noise reduction were obtained. Furthermore, the noise caused by errors in the experiment was manually deleted.

The time domain eigenvalues were the root mean square (RMS) and the mean absolute value (MAV), and the frequency domain eigenvalues were the mean power frequency (MPF) and the median frequency (MF), reflecting contraction of the brachioradialis muscle of the participants' arm, which was used as a body participation index reflecting the VR scene experience. Partly due to the relatively small sample size and the normal test of experimental data showing that they did not follow a normal distribution, the scene before the experience and the experience in the process of electromyographic signal characteristics were separately subjected to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and we obtained the results: RMS, Z = 7.818 (p < 0.001), MAV, Z = 7.818 (p < 0.001), MPF, Z = 4.800 (p < 0.001), and MF, Z = 2.698 (p < 0.001). The significant differences between the time and frequency domain eigenvalues of EMG in the five groups before and during the scene experience are shown in Figure 16 . Combined with the descriptive statistical results, the EMG eigenvalue was significantly increased compared to the baseline level during the scene experience, indicating that the scene experience enhanced the contractive activities of the arm muscles, reflecting an increase in body involvement. The EMG time and frequency domain characteristics in the different experience scenes were compared. The results of the K-W one-way ANOVA were RMS \u03c7 2 (4) = 6.295 (p = 0.178) and MAV \u03c7 2 (4) = 7.124 (p = 0.130), and the EMG time domain characteristics in the different scenes did not significantly differ: MPF \u03c7 2 (4) = 14.410 (p = 0.006) and MF \u03c7 2 (4) = 13.823 (p = 0.008).

Compared to the physical environment, the VR forest environment had the same healing effect and was more attractive and coherent [49] ; however, as the participants only experienced a visual scene with VR equipment (i.e., without other sensory experiences), the advantages of rich multi-sensory VR technology experiences, in terms of promoting emotional and behavioral responses, have not yet been fully exploited [112, 113] . Therefore, by adding other sensory stimuli in Study II, the participants could temporarily get away from reality and forget their worries, through experiencing environmental content and interactive activities, thus enhancing their immersion, relaxation, and emotional relief. In addition, most participants were first-time users of VR devices and were not comfortable with the weight of the headset, handle operation, or vertigo caused by the brain's asynchronous perception of movement [114, 115] , which affected the overall experience, to a certain extent; in future research, this should be taken into consideration, and timely attention should be paid to the physical and mental state of the participants. In addition, we provided participants with a quiet urban environment without people and discovered the healing effect of VR urban scenes. Previous studies have shown that stressed individuals prefer to be alone or with only a few persons to recover, a combination of refuge, nature and rich in species, and a low or no presence of social, which could be interpreted as the most restorative environment for stressed individuals [116] , so the selection of the restorative environment may be not only different between the natural and urban environments, but may also be related to an individual's environmental preferences and the physical properties of the scene itself, such as existence of people in the scene, its brightness, and color saturation.",

In addition, it is unknown whether the absence of sound in the VR scenes affected the associated environmental healing. Previous studies have confirmed that natural sound has a strong impact on recovery [117, 118] . Sound is an important element to improve the immersion of virtual reality. The absence of sound further reduces the differences in the healing effects of the different scenes.",

EMG data feedback supported the differences in the sense of control and participation in the different scenes. We only found a difference in the sense of presence between the VR restorative environment interactive tour group and the other four scenes, which may be due to the fact that this scene's experience mode broke the visual experience of the VR urban environment and this visual experience of the VR restorative environment without any operations. Autonomous handle control was added to the scene experience mode consisting of only visual experience, which allowed participants a certain sense of control; however, it differed from the more interesting interactive tasks in the VR restorative environment, such as interactive sightseeing, fishing, and watering activities. Accordingly, the participants quickly completed the exploration independently, and the limited sense of control and richness of scene content did not meet their expectations, which affected their sense of presence.",

They are more alert to negative stimuli and pay more attention to their internal world for a longer time, while non-high-anxiety groups tend to pay more attention to happy information. Their lockdown time is also longer [30, [124] [125] [126] ; however, this particular attentional bias may be enhanced in virtual reality, which may stimulate negative feelings, allowing participants to make different evaluations of the VR restorative environment and different interaction activities, which have different effects on emotional interventions.",

However, according to the hypothesis, for those in the visual experience group, who did not need to learn and operate the controller, the task was less difficult than for the interactive experiencing group, and so, their participation and enjoyment were lower than in those who performed the fishing and watering activities; therefore, these factors influence the presence due to VR [127] . Some studies have shown that emotions in the virtual environment are correlated with a sense of presence [128] , which also explains the interaction between presence and emotion [30] . Therefore, we believe that such an association is the reason why individuals achieved better positive emotion enhancement in these scenes. However, due to the inherent defects of the design between groups, individuals were not allowed to experience all five different scenes, thus making the sensitivity of scene changes weak and leading to no significant differences in the healing effect. In addition, participants had expectations for the VR scene experience and, when the impact of scene differences on emotion and self-efficacy was less than their expectations, there was no difference between the groups across the different scene experiences. The results of this study are consistent with the results of previous research on VR restorative environments, where the healing effect of the environment may be far greater than the impact of media or activity mode changes [49] . In future research, if the within-group design with more sensitivity to experimental processing is adopted to increase individuals' perceptions of differences in different scenes, other experimental results may be obtained.",

The reason for this discrepancy was that most of the participants recruited for the experiment were students who had been studying or working indoors for a long time. The VR urban scene was different from their pressure environment familiar to the participants, thus meeting one of the characteristics of a restorative environment: the feeling of being far away. Empty urban environments, which are free from crowding and oppression, and experiences without directed attention have a restorative effect [89] . Therefore, from another perspective, we also found that not only the natural environment, but also the urban scene, may have healing effects on those people who have been indoors and in stressful environments for a long time.",

The influencing factors and the internal psychological mechanism of the recovery effect of restorative environments have been widely treated as the research focus of environmental psychologists; however, previous research on restorative environments has mostly been based on real scenes or non-interactive immersive VR scenes. In this study, a restorative environment was achieved by VR technology and 3D dynamic interactive activities, thus enhancing the connection between environment and people, which was lacking in previous studies. The interactive tasks focused on the activities of people in the environment, which enhanced their interests and avoided the adverse emotional reactions caused by a lack of interaction for a long time and prevented its effects on physiological indicators. On the basis of this innovation, research on the connection between the environment, behavior, and psychological experience can be supplemented to explore the differences in healing and the presence of experience due to different scenes, as well as the influence of restorative environments on individual emotions in VR scenes. We also used EEG feedback to prove the effect of the VR restorative environment on cognitive recovery, serving as a useful supplement to the research of restorative environments on individual cognitive recovery.",

At the same time, it provides a theoretical basis for the practical application of environmental recovery. VR technology has a good restorative function and application value when people cannot access natural environments with high recovery potential [129] . This technology makes it possible for urban office workers, students, and special groups (e.g., individuals with disabilities) to effectively recover in a restorative environment. Therefore, this study has both theoretical value and practical significance. Although VR technology has drawbacks, such as high cost, difficulty of replacing real natural environments, and the ethical risk of accelerating separation from the natural world, considering the high application value of this technology and the trend of continuous development and improvement, we can look forward to an era in which VR serves millions of families.",

In this study, we only discussed the effects of restorative environments from the perspective of vision, and did not include auditory stimuli, which may have a greater impact on healing. In future research, sound can be added to the experience of VR scenes in order to explore the recovery effect of restorative environments in a more comprehensive way. In addition, it was found that some participants in this study began to become a little upset after 5 min of experiencing the scene due to completion of the required activities, or familiarity with the environment, or as they tried to explore whether there were any further tasks that needed to be completed in the VR environment. In future research, the balance between scene design and time setting can be further considered, and the interference of irrelevant variables can be controlled by increasing the richness of the experimental scenes and the complexity of interaction activities, or by shortening the experience time. In addition, we found that the occurrence of motion sickness and physical discomfort due to the immersive VR scene experience could affect the emotional state of participants and the pleasure of the experience, to some extent [30] . Finally, different VR scene experiences will bring different senses of presence, which may be one of the reasons for the differences observed in the healing effect.",
