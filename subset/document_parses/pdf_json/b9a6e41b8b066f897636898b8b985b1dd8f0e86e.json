In both cases: a = 1, r 0 = 1.6 and \u03b8 = 5\u03c0/6. An example of a double maximum is shown in Fig. 2 for a = 1, b = 6, r 0 = 1.6, and for a particular hitting angle \u03b8 = 5\u03c0/6. The unbounded distribution is also shown for comparison. As expected, the instantaneous flux to any target position the targeted position is higher for a bounded system until about t \u2248 90 (2.5 in units of b 2 /D) since, in the unbounded case, part of the flux leaks into the external region r > b. For times greater than this, the opposite trend occurs. The slow decrease in the unbounded case is due to the possibility for the diffusing particle to return to the target after a long time away from it, whereas in the bounded case the particle is consumed rapidly.",

            "text": "As already underlined, the confining boundary leads to a redistribution of the hitting probability in the course of time. The time integral of j(\u03b8 ,t) can therefore approach its infinite time value long before the time integral of j * (\u03b8 ,t). In other words, the probability to reach a specific target can be much more concentrated for a confined system than for an unbounded one, providing the starting position r 0 is well chosen. The diffusive echo phenomenon is thus not merely a mathematical curiosity, but may be exploited to significantly enhance the efficiency of a passive diffusive search. More specifically, for example, it may play a role in determining where a therapeutic molecule should be injected in a cell in order to more efficiently reach a targeted zone in the inner core of the cell. For a core of one-sixth of the cell size, b = 6a, the ideal starting location is close to r 0 2a for a target located at the angle \u03b8 = 5\u03c0/6, i.e. on the opposite side of the core from the departure point. The dependence of the diffusive echo on \u03b8 is subtle (see Fig. 4 ). For small and large \u03b8 , only one maximum is present, i.e. there is no diffusive echo. The explanation relies on the sink effect of the absorbing inner circle. For small values of \u03b8 , the direct flux to the targeted point specified by \u03b8 is not impeded by the remaining part of the absorbing inner circle. As a consequence, the direct flux to the target is sufficiently high so that it is not overcome by the subsequent indirect flux from the outer boundary. On the other hand, for a targeted point on the opposite side of the inner circle (\u03b8 \u03c0), the absorbing inner boundary plays the role of a sink that prevents direct diffusion towards the targeted point, allowing the confinementcontrolled diffusion to dominate. For intermediate \u03b8 values, these two processes compete and a double maximum in j(\u03b8 ,t) may appear. On the right hand side of Fig. 4 , one clearly sees the gradual build-up of a second, reflection-induced flux maximum. For \u03b8 = 5\u03c0/6 (dashed line in Fig. 4 ), the diffusive echo is more apparent since the two maxima have a similar amplitude. The dependence of the diffusive echo on the degree of confinement may be explained similarly (see Fig. 5 and 6 ). For small values of b, the reflecting boundary guides the diffusing particle around the central circle. Due to the proximity of the absorbing inner boundary, there is almost no direct diffusion toward the specific targeted \u03b8 -point, particularly if it is on the opposite side of the starting point. All possible 'direct' trajectories are indeed too close to the absorbing central zone and only 'indirect' trajectories can survive and contribute to the flux on the targeted point, especially when the starting point is close to the inner absorbing circle (i.e. for small values of r 0 ). For larger values of b, i.e. for a weaker confinement, this indirect flux decreases since many of the indirect trajectories seep from the target area and are no longer focused on it. The intensity of the direct flux becomes comparable with the reflected one, enabling a diffusive echo on the targeted point since these two fluxes are time shifted. Finally, for very weak confinement (b a), the reflected flux is tenuous and one recovers the unbounded behavior. For very strong confinement, we observe a narrow distribution of the flux whose maximum occurs at a much shorter time than in the unbounded case (see Fig. 6 , the first two curves on the left). This effect strongly depends on the starting position r 0 as expected from a simple explanation in terms of survival of trajectories. Indeed, for r 0 very close to the confining boundary, almost all the trajectories are focused initially towards the absorbing central zone. For highly confined systems (small b), these trajectories cannot escape and are absorbed due to the lack of space. As a consequence, the average time needed to reach a specific targeted point is reduced since almost no trajectories can survive for a long time. On the contrary, as soon as r 0 is no longer close to b, some trajectories may escape through the back side (or on the left/right sides) during the first instants of the diffusion process and then be guided by the confining boundary, leading to a higher contribution to the flux on a distant point. Among all trajectories, the weight of the longest ones increase in the distribution of the hitting times: the flux maximum is thus higher than in the unbounded case, and occurs at a later time. Then, as explained above, for higher values of b, the space available to the diffusing particle becomes sufficient to allow for longer and longer survival times, and the hitting times distribution broadens and flattens. There is therefore an optimum value of the confining parameter b for which the flux on a specific targeted point is the highest (this optimal b value being close to 3 for r 0 = 1.6 as shown in Fig. 6 ).",

Initially, the flux is null, j 1D (0) = 0, whatever the starting position. It then increases, reaches a maximum and decays exponentially to zero. The exponential time decrease is controlled by the square of the first root, k 2 01 , which is nine times smaller than the square of the other roots.

The diffusive echo induced by moving obstacles is also worth considering, given its relevance for real diffusive processes. In a similar vein, an effort could be made to determine the role of the absorbing central area in the manifestation of the diffusive echo. These results could shed light on biological diffusive processes such as those that govern the (passive) search for a specific target in a living, confined environment where traps or lethal zones may impede the search.",
