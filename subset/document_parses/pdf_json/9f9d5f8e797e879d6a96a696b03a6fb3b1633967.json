While awaiting such countermeasures, mitigation efforts coupled with robust testing remain essential to controlling spread of the disease. In particular, serological testing plays a critical role in providing important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information. However, this information is only useful if the results can be accurately interpreted. This pandemic placed clinical testing laboratories and requesting physicians in a precarious position because we are actively learning about the disease and how to interpret serological results. Having developed robust assays to detect antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2, and serving the hardest hit areas within the New York City epicenter, we found three types of discordances in SARS-CoV-2 test results that challenge interpretation. Using representative clinical vignettes, these interpretation dilemmas are highlighted, along with suggested approaches to resolve such cases.",

The United States was hit particularly hard, accounting for ~25% of all cases and deaths while constituting only ~5% of the global population. New York City (NYC) became the initial epicenter of the American outbreak, reaching >6,300 daily hospitalizations in early April 2020.

Initially, these assays focused on detecting viral RNA [4] [5] [6] [7] , the gold-standard for active infection. However, this genome sequence also allowed cloning and purification of viral proteins, thereby enabling development of serological testing [8] . Serological assays provide essential information about infectious diseases, including (i) identifying acute, subacute, and prior infections through detecting pathogen-specific IgM and IgG isotypes, respectively, to enable determination of true disease prevalence [9] ; (ii) providing insights into host immune responses to infection [10] ; (iii) quantifying antibody titers in recovered patients to identify convalescent plasma donors [11] , and (iv) enabling isolation of neutralizing antibodies to produce therapeutic monoclonal antibodies [12] [13] [14] [15] .

The spike protein is the most divergent antigen among hCoVs, whereas the nucleocapsid is reasonably conserved [28, 29] . Therefore, spike protein-based tests are considered to be more specific [9, 28] . However, the magnitude of a humoral response highly depends on antigen dose, and the nucleocapsid is the most abundant viral protein.

An adult patient with a positive RT-PCR result and mild disease, who initially tests negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, warrants a A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t second test, potentially using nucleocapsid as the target antigen. A similar sequential testing approach was deployed when screening healthcare workers with equivocal results [49] . Although the current gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is RT-PCR, a negative result, even in a patient with high clinical suspicion, is not rare. RT-PCR testing can have false negative rates as high as 54%, though this is highly variable depending on the study and the test utilized [50] . As with serological testing, timing of sample collection is important and is intimately related to the kinetics of virus replication. Based on a meta-analysis of 7 studies, the false negative rate for RT-PCR is highest prior to symptom onset (<5 days postexposure), is lowest ~8 days post-infection, and then steadily increases [51] . Importantly, repeat testing increases diagnostic sensitivity, even when conducted on the same day as the initial test [7] , although retesting remained negative in this patient. In addition to analytical errors in conducting RT-PCR testing, pre-analytical variables, including timing and method of sample collection, sample handling, and specimen type, also affect diagnostic performance [52] . Indeed, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum had higher sensitivity for viral RNA detection than the commonly collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens [53] , thus providing Given these issues with RT-PCR, adjunct diagnostic tests are useful to increase diagnostic sensitivity. CT imaging was adopted early in the pandemic, given reports of characteristic shared features in infected individuals [54] and increased sensitivity when combined with RT-PCR [55] [56] [57] . Serological testing is a potentially more accessible and cost-effective adjunct for diagnosis. There is growing evidence for positive serology in suspected patients with negative RT-PCR results [42, 58] , and testing schemes combining molecular and serological testing increase the sensitivity for diagnosing disease [10, 59] .",

The high sensitivity of serological tests, later in the disease course, allows for a high positive predictive value for diagnosis in the context of high seroprevalence (>90% in areas like NYC with >20% seropositivity) [19, 60] . The reproductive number (R 0 ), a basic epidemiological measurement, represents, on average, the number of people the disease is spread to by an infected individual. R 0 describes the relative \"contagiousness\" of a pathogen and varies dramatically between organisms. For example, one of the most infectious agents is measles virus, with an R 0 that is normally stated as 12-18, but was reported to approach >200 in certain conditions [61] , whereas the 1918 H1N1 flu was estimated to have an R 0 of ~2.0 [62] . Initial reports suggested that the R 0 for SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4-2.5 [63] with more recent estimates reaching as high as 5.7 [64] . Given the relatively high R 0 for SARS-CoV-2, how is it that no other household member, who were constantly around one another in quarantine, were infected by this patient? This raised concerns for whether the patient was a false positive, or conversely, whether the family members were false negatives.",

An initial study from two hospitals near Wuhan studied 105 index patients and 392 family household contacts [66] . Of these 392 household members, only 16.3% (64 members) subsequently contracted SARS-CoV-2 from the index patient. This rate was noted to be higher than that reported for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, two related coronaviruses [67, 68] . Interestingly, the secondary attack rate for household members under age 18 was 4%, whereas it was 20.5% for those >18, demonstrating more frequent transmission among adults than children. Within their cohort of 105 index patients, 14 immediately self-quarantined within their households \"with masks, dining separately, and residing alone\" [66] , resulting in no subsequent family member becoming infected. Although this needs replication in larger studies, the initial results suggest that quarantining infected individuals within the household may significantly curb household transmission. Similarly, another retrospective analysis of contact tracing data in Guangzhou identified a household transmission rate of 17.1% [65] . This study also found a positive correlation between transmission rate of an infected adult to other household members based on age, with household members <20 years of age having a secondary attack rate of 5.2%, whereas those >60 had a secondary attack rate of 18.4%.",

Most importantly, physicians must inform patients that serological testing does not determine if they are immune, but rather provides evidence of prior infection.
