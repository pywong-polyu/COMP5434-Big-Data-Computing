            "text": "Cities become mission-critical zones during pandemics and it is vital to develop a better understanding of the factors that are associated with infection levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many cities severely; however, there is significant variance in its impact across cities. Pandemic infection levels are associated with inherent features of cities (e.g., population size, density, mobility patterns, socioeconomic condition, and health & environment), which need to be better understood. Intuitively, the infection levels are expected to be higher in big urban agglomerations, but the measurable influence of a specific urban feature is unclear. The present study examines 41 variables and their potential influence on COVID-19 cases and fatalities. The study uses a multi-method approach to study the influence of variables, classified as demographic, socioeconomic, mobility and connectivity, urban form and density, and health and environment dimensions. This study develops an index dubbed the PVI-CI for classifying the pandemic vulnerability levels of cities, grouping them into five vulnerability classes, from very high to very low. Furthermore, clustering and outlier analysis provides insights on the spatial clustering of cities with high and low vulnerability scores. This study provides strategic insights into levels of influence of key variables upon the spread of infections as well as fatalities, along with an objective ranking for the vulnerability of cities. Thus it provides critical wisdom needed for urban healthcare policy and resource management. The pandemic vulnerability index calculation method and the process present a blueprint for the development of similar indices for cities in other countries, leading to a better understanding and improved pandemic management for urban areas and post-pandemic urban planning across the world.",

            "text": "The highly transmittable coronavirus has created a public health crisis that has disrupted many spheres of society across the globe, including health infrastructure, business, economy, education, transportation, and the emotional well-being of people [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The impacts and the full consequences of the highly contagious COVID-19 infection are still evolving and presently unclear. While it is established that more than 250 million 6 people have been infected across the globe, the factors behind the rapid spread of the COVID-19 infection in urban settings have still not been addressed satisfactorily. At the beginning of this pandemic, many researchers hypothesized that climate and weather could be mitigating factors for the spread of COVID-19 [7] [8] [9] , but infections in every corner of the world, irrespective of climate and weather, proved the weakness of these and similar conjectures 10 . It has also become part of the dominant narrative that global mega-cities and other metropolitan regions are the zones most severely affected by this pandemic 11, 12 . It is commonly understood that cities are the primary hot-spots for COVID-19 infection due to the higher concentration of population and economic activities. Cities in the United States (US) are no exception to the global trend [13] [14] [15] . They are said to be highly vulnerable to this pandemic because of their urban vibrancy, including high connectivity, density, socioeconomic makeup, high mobility, and diverse activities with high levels of direct machine learning approaches and have statistically generated weights to estimate the importance of various indicators. Weights of different indicators of community vulnerability can also be assigned by experts. For instance, a recent study 46 proceeded this way to develop a pandemic vulnerability index (PVI) of counties in the contiguous US states. Similarly, Smittenaar et al. 51 developed a COVID-19 community vulnerability index based on relative weights of 40 indicators elicited from subject-matter experts. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) heuristic was used to demarcate vulnerability levels of urban districts in India 52 . Since the importance of underlying factors of cities to COVID-19 vulnerability is largely unknown and expertise on this subject matter is limited, we argue that a data-driven approach is advantageous for developing a vulnerability index of US cities.",

We leverage a hybrid knowledge-based and data-driven approach to comprehend the associations of complex and interlinked relations among various indicators of urban areas to COVID-19 cases and deaths. We focus primarily on the number of COVID-19 infection cases for the main analysis, and then summarize our validation using death prevalence in the discussion section. Although many previous studies have focused on specific US states and vulnerability indices have been developed for counties, as discussed above, cities are the places on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to develop a PVI at the city level -hereafter referred to as PVI-CI-by investigating 41 influential variables over 3,069 cities in the contiguous US. The outcomes of this research will help us to understand the most influential variables driving the pandemic in urbanized areas. The vulnerability index can also be used to evaluate risks by studying the combination of hazard and exposure components. The findings will be helpful for city-specific policy development and implementation. They may also reveal the role of sustainability measures towards developing resilient cities. The lessons learned from this research may contribute to post-pandemic city planning.",

Since the younger generation possesses a greater tendency to socialize and interact with others and to do so without COVID-19 safety protocols, and since much of the lower aged population was excluded from early-stage vaccine coverage, they quite likely contributed to the spread of the virus. Some other demographic variables such as household size (0.14), family size (0.14), the share of the non-citizen population (0.12), the population working outside of the principal city (0.11), the size of elderly population (0.11), and the share of the minority population (0.09) also have high contributions to the spread of COVID-19, as articulated in Table 1 . A higher household and family size indicate that people have more crowded living conditions under the same roof, which increases the risk of infection of family members from one infected member after exposure on large contact network. Moreover, a larger household and family size often indicates precarious socioeconomic conditions that may compromise people's ability to withstand this highly infectious disease via established health care services. The non-citizen and minority populations are often involved in informal job sectors such as food delivery and retail businesses which may also increase the chances of their exposure to COVID-19. Additionally, the non-citizen population has limited access to healthcare services, which makes them reluctant to test and seek health care. The population working outside of the principal city contributes to the COVID-19 diffusion, probably indicating the degree of contacts between place-based communities living a certain distance away from each other. Elderly populations are among the critical victims of the COVID-19 pandemic due to their underlying health conditions. Thus, a higher number of elderly residents increases the probability of viral transmission. Interestingly, the total population (0.03) and people living in group quarters (0.06) show a negligible influence on COVID-19 cases.",

The built-up ratio is also an important variable, which receives relatively high weight (0.13). The number of dependent cities (0.13) around a major city is another influential variable among the ten variables related to urban form & density due to better transport connection and greater interaction opportunities for social, economic and business activities. Additionally, the retail employment density (0.10) has a relatively robust influence on COVID-19 diffusion, as presented in Table 1 . On the other hand, the land area of the city (0.04), the employment density (0.09), the population of dependent cities (0.07), the number of households (0.04), and diversity of land uses (0.08) have a limited effect on the spread of COVID-19 cases. The results in Table 1 indicate that, among the variables of human mobility and transport connectivity, distance to the nearest metropolitan city (0.25) is the most influential. This is in line with the strong effect of dependent cities, population density, and congested living mentioned earlier. Metropolitan living and higher density have made social distancing quite challenging, which renders cities closer to a major metropolitan city more vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to others. We also note that travel duration in public transport (0.19) and number of airports (0.18) are significant variables for viral propagation owing to limited opportunity for social distancing and fertile ground for exposure to populations from other regions and countries. As for travel duration, we also observe that the increased use of public transportation and higher travel duration to work exert a strong influence on the spread of the virus due to the possibility of infection from other passengers when social distancing is hardly feasible. On the other hand, walkability (0.14) has a comparatively greater role in reducing viral transmission, which indicates that neighborhoods with a higher walkability score have lower rate of COVID-19 transmission.

Extant research 7, 9, 53 has indicated that air quality improvement due to lockdown-induced mobility reduction has significant impacts on controlling the COVID-19 diffusion. In particular, we observe here a higher weight (0.27) for the air quality index (Table 1) .

The findings of this study also show that large cities are not always the most exposed to the pandemic, which is a departure from a widely held view. For example, despite being one of the most populous city in the state, San Francisco is not rated as a city with very high vulnerability, like Los Angeles and Riverside, but only features high vulnerability. Along the same idea, the big cities of New York City, NY, Portland, OR, Denver, CO, Detroit, MI, Charlotte, NC, Philadelphia, PA, and Phoenix, AZ are all highly vulnerable, but other cities in their respective states are worse off and belong to the very high vulnerability category. The case of Seattle, WA, is also noteworthy here. It is one of the largest cities that recorded some of the nation's earliest COVID-19 cases, but it belongs to the high vulnerability category of the PVI-CI. Thus, the size of a city by itself does not determine the level of vulnerability. However, a few large cities are very highly vulnerable.

According to Figure 3 , most of the cities classified as Low-High outliers are located in California, Texas, and North Carolina. For example, Portola in California is a low vulnerability outlier in a High-High cluster due to its small population and low residential density, higher number of children and elderly, low household and family size, lower rate of unemployment, lower number of airports, higher supply of infrastructure per person for health care facilities, high walkability index, lower use of public transport, and better air quality.

These are the most influential characteristics that make cities vulnerable to the rapid spread of COVID-19. On the other hand, a high share of elderly people, distance from large metropolitan cities, and a large share of working population are associated with low vulnerability. Thus, population and housing density, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population, and the openness of the layout of the city are the salient variables signalling the level of vulnerability of a city to viral infections like COVID-19.",

We do so for a set of 300 randomly selected cities as the deviation between the PVI score by NIEHS and their corresponding PVI-CI. The Pearson's correlation between the two series is 0.1602, which indicates the two indicators of vulnerability are not equivalent overall, but account for different aspects of the vulnerability of place-based communities to the COVID-19 pandemic. The deviation of standardized scores estimated by NIEHS to their corresponding standardized PVI-CI is mapped in Figure 4 in five classes around the mean to better contextualize the differences between the two indicators. The vast majority of cities have deviation between -1.5 and 1.5 (75.33%). In this group, 82 cities have very low positive or negative deviation (-0.5 to 0.5), while a large number of sampled cities (108) have moderately positive deviation between 0.5 to 1.5. Only 36 cities have deviation between -1.5 to -0.5. Specifically, we find that 8 cities have a very low deviation of their PVI-CI score compared to their county NIEHS score (from -0.05 to 0.05), including Jerseyville (IL), Olympia (WA), Laurens (SC), Dumas (TX), Guymon (OK), Winnsboro (SC), Salem (OR), and Guthrie (OK). Also, there are only 10 sampled cities that shows large negative deviation (<-1.5) between NIEHS PVI and PVI-CI scores, against 64 with large position deviations. The 10 cities that show the largest deviations (large positive or large negative) between scores are Tooele (UT), Harvard (IL), Roosevelt (UT), Santa Paula (CA), Longmont (CO), Fairfield Glade (TN), Newport (VT), Sutherlin (OR), Newton (MS), and McComb (MS). The first five cities in this list have higher PVI-CI score compared to the NIEHS score (large negative), whereas the other five are in the reverse situation. A moderately positive skewness in deviations is also observed. Overall, cities with a higher positive deviation in their vulnerability scores tend to be over-represented in the southern states, particularly in Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Alabama. In contrast, some clusters of cities in the western states (esp. California, Utah, and Colorado) have large negative deviations. However, the large number of cities whose PVI-CI and NIEHS scores are similar (very low deviation) are scattered across the US with no notable spatial trend. It is important to note that there is no discernible variable that is particularly relevant to the deviation between the vulnerability scores. There are some probable data-related reasons for this high deviation between vulnerability scores. First, the cities which have high deviation tend to be located in relatively large counties; thus, these counties are not a good representation of the PVI-CI score at the county level. Second, these cities are often located at the boundary of a county that is under the influence of multiple nearby counties. Third, another city may have the higher influence in that particular county compared to the one which is randomly selected. As a whole, we conclude the PVI-CI is an effective measure of the vulnerability of cities to COVID-19 and this is corroborated by the alignment with the PVI devised by the NIEHS. ",

The goal here is to see if the vulnerability status of cities is meaningfully different accordingly to the severity of the consequences, that is when we calculate the feature importance based on death rates instead of infection case rates, while following the same methodological steps. Table 2 . In other words, this alternative vulnerability index would provide a different ranking for cities by death rates. There could be a number of reasons for this: while the PVI-CI based on cases may point to one ranking for cities, PVI-CI based on deaths can be relatively different because the variables that are associated with deaths due to COVID-19 are different from the variables responsible for the spread of the disease, irrespective of the virulence of the infection. For example, a higher elderly population may raise the death rate because of a host of co-morbidity factors associated with age, but this may not be critical in spreading the disease and increasing the total case count. Both indices based on cases and on deaths can be useful for insights generation and decision making. However, from a policy perspective, by prioritizing the case count as the target variable, governments can improve their understanding of factors that lead to increased case counts, develop policies and plans to mitigate the infection rate, and this can logically be expected to lead to decreased death rates also.",

Since the variables are measured on diverse scales and units (e.g., percentage, absolute number, ratio), normalization brings them in a consistent format which is an essential data prepossessing step for model building. All 41 variables are transformed to the scale between 0 to 1 by max-min normalization. High Walkability index implies a large number of walking trips, which reduces travel by public transport. Thus, a city with a high walkability score has a lower risk of disease spreading.

We further compared the scores derived in our study with the scores calculated by the NIEHS for a 10% random sample of cities.

Moreover, there are no other studies in the literature that would have estimated the vulnerability of cities under the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, PVI-CI scores from the most effective of the three feature ranking methods are compared with the PVI scores provided by NIEHS 46 .",

The PVI scores of 300 counties corresponding to the sampled cities were collected from the PVI dashboard of the NIEHS. Although the PVI scores by the NIEHS are at the county level, this can be utilized as proxy ground truth for the city score since PVI scores at the city level are not available. We have used county-level PVI data to represent scores of cities. In most cases, the representative county lies within the city. Only a few cities in the selected sample lie in more than one county. In that case, the PVI score of a county consisting of the city center is taken into account. At first, the absolute differences between the PVI scores of the NIEHS and our individual proposed methods are calculated for each of the 300 cities. Then, the sum of the squared differences is calculated and divided by the number of sampled cities (300). Finally, the root means square error (RMSE) of the PVI scores for the selected cities are calculated by taking the square root of the above value. This procedure is repeated for all three feature ranking methods (FC, MIR, and SKB). From the deviations of the PVI-CI scores with respect to the NIEHS method, we have also calculated the number of cities that lie within the deviation range of 0.1. The purpose of this calculation is to see how many cities have PVI-CI scores closer to the NIEHS PVI scores. The deviation in vulnerability scores of the sampled cities are presented in Figures 6 and 4 . Both PVI-CI and NEIHS scores are normalized using Z-score normalization to calculate the deviation between corresponding scores. A geo-visualization of the deviation between pairs of scores is presented in Figure 4 . Figure 6 depicts the deviation of PVI scores of sampled cities calculated by alternative feature ranking methods from the respective county's scores determined by the NIEHS. The results show that the FC method yields the lowest deviation in scores. A total of 31.7%, 24.7%, and 29.2% of sampled cities have PVI score deviation below 0.05 with the FC, MIR, and SKB methods, respectively. Cumulatively, 62.7%, 44.7%, and 55.4% of sampled cities have PVI score deviation less than 0.10 with these three methods, respectively. In contrast, more than one-third of sampled cities have a PVI score deviation greater than 0.15 with the MIR method. Based on this evaluation, it can be concluded that both FC method and SKB generates vulnerability scores of sampled cities that are the closest to the PVI scores from the NIEHS. In addition, we have also calculated the RMSE to select the most effective method based on how close the PVI-CI score is to the PVI of their corresponding counties. The RMSEs of the FC, MIR and SKB methods are 0.097, 0.155, and 0.111, respectively. As a result, the FC method can be considered as the best one to determine the vulnerability scores for cities.",

There are over 3,000 cities that vary in size, density, socioeconomic makeup, air quality, healthcare infrastructure, and mobility and connectivity patterns. Thus, this study has collected 41 variables in five dimensions for 3,069 cities to develop a synthetic index of vulnerability to the pandemic. The choice of these variables is primarily based on the findings of recent literature related to COVID-19 infection rates and deaths and their association with city environment characteristics. The outcome variables of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected on June 30, 2021, from the USA Facts web portal57 . Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths are published for US counties. To obtain city-wise data on the prevalence of the pandemic, county-level data are scaled to the city level using the ratio of city population to the population of the county or counties in which the city is located. Tables 3 \u223c 7 provide detailed description of all the selected variables and their grouping in five broad thematic dimensions.",

This study is therefore expected to be valuable to governmental agencies in their effort to manage pandemic-associated variables, as well as for future PVI and urban vulnerability research and post-pandemic urban planning.",
