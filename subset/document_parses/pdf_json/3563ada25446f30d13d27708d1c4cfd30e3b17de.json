For those living in care homes, this may not always occur and residents may spend significant parts of the day unengaged, especially those living with more advanced dementia. Digital technologies are increasingly being used in health care and could provide opportunities for people living with dementia (PLWD) in care homes to engage in meaningful occupations and support care staff to provide these activities. With technology advancing at a rapid rate, the objective of this scoping review is to provide an up-to-date systematic map of the research on the diverse range of digital technologies that support engagement in meaningful occupations. In particular, focus will be given to barriers and facilitators to inform future intervention design and implementation strategies, which have not yet been clearly mapped across the full range of these digital technologies.",

This will enable comparison between mechanisms of action, barriers and facilitators to implementation which will be useful for future research and intervention design.

This is despite national guidelines recommending that people living with dementia (PLWD) should be offered activities tailored to their preferences [4] . Barriers include limited resources, understaffed environments and time constraints [5, 6] . PLWD in care homes are at risk of spending significant parts of the day socially unengaged [7, 8] ; one study identified that residents spent as little as 10% of the day socially engaged [9] . Loneliness and isolation can lead to feelings of unhappiness and even cause fear for some PLWD [10] . A lower mortality rate has been reported in care home residents involved in social activities [11] and a positive relationship between social interaction and a higher quality of life has also been reported in PLWD [12, 13] . Engaging in activities that are meaningful or personalised to the PLWD have been reported to reduce agitation [14, 15] , improve affect and engagement [16] , although these benefits have not been consistently reported between reviews [17] . In addition, these interventions, by their nature, often involve increased social interaction which may be acting as a confounding factor [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

UK data on the uptake of digital technology in care homes is limited. Research in the USA has demonstrated rising trends in the adoption of technology in care homes [24] but having access to technology does not necessarily mean it is used to its fullest capabilities [25] . Previous reviews have provided a broad overview of technologies developed for PLWD [22, 26, 27] although some have included technologies unrelated to the engagement in meaningful occupations [22, 26, 27] , or with limited focus on the care home setting [26, 28] . The care home setting is a distinct environment with many contextual factors that need to be considered in order to successfully implement an intervention [5, 6] . More recently, Goodall et al. [29] undertook a systematic review of technologies used to provide meaningful activities for PLWD. As with previously mentioned reviews, the majority of research was conducted in the community. Reported benefits of individualised technologies included improvements in mood, behaviour, self-identification and relationships [29] . The authors highlight some potential challenges in the application of technology in the care home setting; the majority of the technologies required assistance from another person, time constraints for care staff and potentially a higher proportion of residents having more advanced dementia than in the community [29] . Although a breakdown of each study's barriers and facilitators specific to the care home setting has not been provided.",

Not all studies, however, solely focused on PLWD [32, 33] or the care home setting [34] [35] [36] . Reported benefits of using a touchscreen device included improved engagement, behaviours and quality of life [31] . Challenges to using a touchscreen device included the ability of residents to physically hold the device, reflective glare, internet connectivity, battery life and concerns with residents data being kept confidential [31] . Importantly, only devices with touchscreen interfaces were included in this review, excluding a range of other digital approaches. When designing new technology, it is important to consider the barriers and facilitators to all types of interface.",

[37] is the only review to our knowledge that has focused on the use of technology to promote meaningful engagement for PLWD specifically in the care home setting. Two areas of research were described: robotics (n = 14) and multimedia devices (n = 6) [37] . The majority of research (n = 12) focused on 'robopets' which are animal-like robots that mimic an animal in appearance and behaviour [38, 39] , for example AIBO a dog-like robot [40] . Only six studies which utilised non-robotic technologies [34, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] were identified by the review [37] , which appears to show a relatively limited range of research on multimedia technologies. Neal et al. suggest for people with more advanced stages of dementia, only technologies which facilitate social interaction will provide meaningful engagement [37] . Although, they also conclude that there is limited research which has explored the perspectives of PLWD when using a technology, as the majority of studies focus on the perspectives of care staff or family [37] . Facilitators and barriers to using and implementing these technologies were not explored in detail in this review.",

Additionally, we have developed a broad list of search terms on the topic of social connectedness and we will include sociology databases to identify socially interactive technologies that maintain connections with others. This is an especially important area at this time because of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on people living in care homes and the resulting loss of social contact they may have with friends and family. This will focus on technologies that directly facilitate social interaction between two humans (i.e. video calls, Skype or email) rather than activities which are deemed social because of their application in a group setting, such as robopets. A broad range of technology interfaces will be included rather than focussing on specific types of interface as this will enable a comparison of facilitators and barriers between technology designs.",
