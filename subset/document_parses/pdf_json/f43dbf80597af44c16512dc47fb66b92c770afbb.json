Then, we compared the mean monthly cases during the previous 5 years (2015-2019) and the monthly cases in 2020 or 2021. Results We found significant reductions for invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs) in adults and H. influenzae-invasive diseases in 2020 and 2021 in comparison to the previous years, but not for invasive meningococcal diseases and IPDs in children.",

In this period, 73/94 IPD cases among adults were caused by non-PCV-13 serotypes (77.7%), which is consistent with the general serotype switch we observed in the last 10 years (data not published). Interestingly, all other isolates were serotype 3. Nonetheless, no significant differences were found in serotypes prevalence during the years. Considering the monthly cases in the period 2020-2021, the decrease in IPDs in comparison to the previous 5 years was evident (Fig. 1c) .

With the aim of reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the Italian government applied strict social distancing measures, similarly to many other countries in the world. From the second wave (October 2020), these measures were differentiated based on regional epidemiology, thus avoiding a national lockdown [5] . In this perspective, we aimed to determine the impact of such measures on the diffusion of vaccine-preventable bacterial-invasive diseases in our region. In fact, SP, HI and NM-invasive infections share with SARS-CoV-2 and many other respiratory pathogens the need of close contact and droplets for their airborne transmission. Thus, social distancing and related protection measures have a great potential against all three pathogens, considering their efficacy against the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 [6] .",

The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (ISS) in its 2020 report for IBDs highlighted the general decrease for all three pathogens in terms of cases notification [7] . In agreement with other authors [2, 3] , the ISS takes into account the possibility of a partial under-notification, especially in the more difficult periods of the pandemic.

Older people are affected by lower vaccination rates compared to children, but they were more isolated thanks to lockdown or social distancing. In fact, in this population we could highlight the stronger decreases in IPDs coincidental to more strict social distancing rules periods. In the same way, in England, lockdown-related measures led to a strong reduction of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs) in comparison to the same period of previous years [9] .",

Anyway, some studies reported HI as a major bacterial co-infection with COVID-19, in terms of both concomitant invasive infection and respiratory co-infection [10, 11] . In our region, we could not determine an increase in HI-invasive infections, while respiratory infections lack a systematic surveillance. On the contrary, we determined a significant reduction of HI-invasive diseases in 2020 and 2021. As for IPDs in adults, the reasons stand in the impact of the pandemic on the adult population, more affected by this IBD and the prevalent airborne transmission of HI.",

Unfortunately, regional data on 2020 vaccinations are still not available and this issue will require further investigations. Another limitation of this study regards its reduced coverage of the Italian population. Nonetheless, our findings are consistent with previous studies [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and support the hypothesis of a decrease of vaccine-preventable IBDs due to COVID-19 spread and its consequences. In particular, different transmission mode based on pathogen or population age should be further investigated. For these reasons, additional local and national data will be needed to confirm our findings and to follow possible evolutions of vaccinepreventable IBDs prevalence after the pandemic.",
