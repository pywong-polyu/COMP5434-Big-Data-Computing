A more holistic approach towards preventing unintended pregnancy during the pandemic, or even endemically in the normal situations, can help reduce the rate of induced abortion. All in all, access to safe and legal abortion is a fundamental right of women, on the other hand, legal prohibition is not an effective tool for reducing the incidence of abor-tion. It is necessary to consider ethical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence) in the decision making process. The restricted abortion laws will only lead to increased unsafe and clandestine abortions and consequently delay care and increase the associated mortality and morbidity, affecting the health and lives of women.",
