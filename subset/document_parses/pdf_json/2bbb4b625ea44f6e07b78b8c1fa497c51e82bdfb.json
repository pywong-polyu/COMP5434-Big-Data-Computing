The pathophysiology of ARDS results from an acute systemic inflammation that leads to a cytokine storm. The increase in proinflammatory cytokines within the lung, leads to the recruitment of leucocytes, further propagating the local inflammatory response and conducting to an abnormal gas exchange.",
