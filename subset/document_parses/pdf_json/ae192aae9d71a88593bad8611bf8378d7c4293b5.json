Increased resource availability, awareness, attention, and formalized responsibility facilitate an increase in BPM success [3] . Though BPM has yielded some success, and despite significant organizational investments in BPM activity, BPM still experiences implementation and expansion challenges [4] . These challenges relate to organizations' inadequate grasp of their methodologies. Additionally, organizations often apply adhoc, instead of organization-wide (org-wide), enhancements that yield more effective and longer-term results [4, 5] . It, therefore, is apparent that an understanding of the various aspects that facilitates BPM success remains vital [5, 6] . To this end, BPM provides a governance structure that regulates the modernization of alwaystransforming businesses and org-wide value chains [2] . BPM governance's impact is far-reaching. It allows organizations to monitor and scrutinize their BPM practices, BP performance, and outcomes. BPM governance, furthermore, helps to rank the importance of BP improvements, increase the organization's capabilities, and manage downstream improvement initiatives [5, 7, 8] . Still, enterprises often struggle to address BPM challenges effectively [9, 10] . The literature is unable to assist as it lacks empirical examination of the business aspects that cause governance-related challenges in BPM. Hence the grand challenge from the BPM 2019 conference that we \"take a more empirical angle in our work, trying to identify genuine issues that organizations are facing\" [11] . To contribute to this knowledge gap, this study's research question was \"What are the governance challenges that constrain BPM in a large South African financial services corporate?\" Thus, this paper aimed to describe the corporate's governance-related BPM experiences.
