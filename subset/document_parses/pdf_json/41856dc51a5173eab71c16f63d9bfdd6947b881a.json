This may reflect that humans are outliers in traits correlated with parasite richness: population density, geographic range area, and study effort. The high degree of parasitism could also reflect amplified disease risk associated with agriculture and urbanization. Alternatively, controlling for other variables, cultural and psychological adaptations could have reduced parasitism in humans over evolutionary time. Methodology: We predicted the number of parasites that would infect a nonhuman primate with human phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic position, and then compared observed parasitism of humans in eight geopolitical countries to the predicted distributions. The analyses incorporated study effort, phylogeny, and drivers of parasitism in 33 primate species.",

When analyzed collectively, however, human populations showed consistently lower than expected richness of protozoa and helminths, but higher richness of viruses. Thus, human evolutionary innovations and new parasite exposures may have impacted groups of parasites in different ways, with support for both hypotheses in the overall analysis. Conclusions and implications: The high level of parasitism observed in humans only applies to viruses, and was not extreme in any of our tests of individual countries. In contrast, we find consistent reductions in protozoa and helminths across countries, suggesting reduced parasitism by these groups during human evolution. We propose that hygienic and technological advances might have extinguished fecal-orally or indirectly transmitted parasites like helminths, whereas higher human densities and host-shifting potential of viruses have supported increased virus richness. Lay Summary: Vastly more parasite species infect humans than any other primate host. Controlling for factors that influence parasite richness, such as the intensity of study effort and body mass, we find V C The Author(s)",

New zoonotic infections emerged when humans shifted from a hunting-and-gathering mode of subsistence to a more settled, agriculture-based lifestyle that included close contact with domesticated animals [2, 3] . Later, the aggregation of people into urban centers led to the emergence of \"crowd\" diseases like measles and smallpox, which could persist only after human populations reached a critical size [3] . Permanent settlement, agriculture, close contact with domesticated animals, and crowding are human traits commonly used to explain the exceptionally high diversity of human parasites and pathogens, which stands at 1415 species by one count [2] and 2107 by another count [4] . By comparison, our closest great ape relatives all have fewer than 100 parasites recorded [5, 6] , and share fewer than expected parasites with humans [4, 7] .",

            "text": "Thus, at first glance, it appears that humans are hyperparasitized, and it is tempting to point to key transitions in human evolution, including agriculture and the rise of highly dense urban populations, as the cause. Several factors, however, call into question this view of human exceptionalism. One factor involves the intensity of study effort on the parasites of primate hosts: humans are much more intensively studied for infectious organisms than are other primates, leading to a greater discovery of parasites and pathogens. This aspect of sampling bias affects many investigations of species richness, including studies of both parasites and free-living organisms [8] [9] [10] [11] . In addition, humans have relatively large body mass among the primates. Larger bodies could provide more niches for parasites to colonize, and body mass covaries with increased exposure through greater food intake [8, 12] . Another factor is geographic range size. Humans have successfully colonized most terrestrial landmasses on Earth, with a geographic range size that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the range of any other primate. Parasite richness covaries with geographic range size because a host with a larger geographic range is likely to experience more diverse habitats across its range, resulting in contact with more different parasites and pathogens [13] . Thus, it could be that exceptional human parasitism simply reflects the extensive geographic range of the human species, especially when combined with greater study effort, higher population density, and relatively large body size.",

            "text": "Another factor could plausibly have the opposite effect-to reduce human parasite richness-but it is rarely considered. Humans possess a multitude of cultural behaviors for avoiding parasites [14] . One example is cooking, a uniquely human behavior that increases the available energy in food [15] and also reduces the risk of exposure to parasites in food [16] . Similarly, use of spices in cooked foods may play a role in preventing spoilage [17] . In addition to the example of medical treatment that may come to mind, humans practice many diverse hygienic behaviors [18] , such as washing hands before eating or using only one hand for unsanitary practices, and avoid potentially infectious materials, motivated by the emotion of disgust [19, 20] . While infection avoidance behaviors are present in other animals [21] [22] [23] , the extensive, pervasive, and culturally perpetuated nature of the disgust response across human societies may be a feature that distinguishes humans from other animals [24] . These innovations and their social transmission set humans apart from other animal species, and thus could account for a reduction in parasite exposure across humans' evolutionary history.",

The parasites of humans and nonhuman primates are diverse, spanning a variety of taxonomic groups, transmission modes, mutation rates, and life cycles [8, 25] .

We focused on parasites classified as helminths, protozoa, and viruses, which are the best-studied groups of parasites infecting primates. We included nonhuman primate species for which at least two species of helminths (including cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes), protozoa, and viruses had each been described in at least two papers in the literature, thus limiting our study to 33 primate host species.

Examples of references that we included are as follows: prevalence surveys of a population, accounts of particular incidences or case studies, or surveys of patients at a hospital presenting with certain symptoms (e.g., prevalence of hookworm in patients with diarrhea). We excluded reviews, perspectives, recommendations, or analyses of previously published data. We also excluded reports from within immunocompromised patients, reports that only included symptoms, and proMed emails and other outbreak reports that were not published in a journal. We did not include studies or surveys of the disease in nonhuman host species, nor studies that surveyed for the parasite in the environment. If no parasite species was named in the title or abstract, we assigned the paper to the parasite associated with the disease in which the paper was categorized in the database. We inferred species counts from the reported diseases as conservatively as possible; for example, if multiple papers reported \"Adenovirus,\" we counted that as one species in that country unless the studies identified multiple lineages of Adenovirus to the species level.

A major logistical concern when comparing the parasite richness of humans and nonhuman primates is that the intensity of sampling for parasites varies across and within host species, and the relationship between study effort and parasite species richness is often nonlinear, especially within well-sampled species. To address this problem, we calculated Chao2 estimates [10] for the parasite richness of each parasite type for each host. The Chao2 method estimates species richness from patterns of incidence across sampling events [30] . Based on analysis of artificial datasets simulated to mimic the structure of the Global Mammal Parasite Database, we previously found that estimating richness using Chao2 is relatively more precise and unbiased than other methods of controlling for uneven sampling effort across species, and especially useful for making comparisons across species [11] . In this study, we thus use an estimate of species richness that is based on patterns of parasite species discovery in different studies, rather than an observed value (although we refer to this value as \"observed\" to draw a contrast with the predicted values, see below). To estimate Chao2, we used the \"fossil\" package for R version 3.6.0 [31, 32] . All data were log 10 transformed prior to analysis.",

To assess effects, we examined 90% credible intervals from the posterior distribution of coefficients, fitting effects for each of the different parasite groups by using indexing [38] . We ensured convergence across the chains, withR values estimated to be 1 for all coefficients.

            "text": "However, humans remain unique from other primates in many ways that could influence parasite richness itself, or that could affect the discovery of new parasites in humans. For example, country-level populations of humans are not isolated from the globalized population; global travel and trade could contribute to the continued and historical introduction of new parasites into human populations [39] in a way that is not analogous to primate species. For example, local parasite richness of humans is likely to be influenced by immigration of parasites from connected, mobile human populations. This interconnectedness of human populations could be argued to result in higher parasite species richness than would be expected for an isolated population. However, most parasites of nonhuman primates are host-generalists [25] , meaning that parasites could immigrate to a host from other host species with overlapping ranges, arguably analogous to the connections between human populations. Thus, we cannot clearly attribute our results to definitional differences in geographic range for human populations and primate species. Another way in which humans differ from nonhuman primates is that humans receive medical care, and have the ability to report their own symptoms. These factors contribute to higher awareness of a broader diversity of parasite species in humans than in other hosts. Although we applied ecological methods to control for study effort [11] and focused on countrylevel data, human parasite research-and thus, discovery-may be biased in unique ways that are not fully addressed through the use of these methods. For example, given interests in public health, research has devoted much effort to resolving viral lineages in humans, which could inflate measures of viral richness. Importantly, however, we expect that these biases and many of the other most relevant traits of humans would increase the observed parasite species richness relative to expectations, yet we find evidence of the contrary for two broad parasite groups. Our results thus highlight the importance of testing prominent and even apparently obvious patterns-such as the hyperparasitism of humans-with statistically rigorous methods.",

In a comparative study of primate parasites, Pedersen et al. [25] found that most helminths were host-specific, viruses tended to be host-generalists, and protozoa were intermediate in their specificity. Specialists may be more prone to extinction than generalists [41] , which can potentially use multiple hosts as a sort of \"safe haven\" when other hosts are declining toward extinction [7] . In addition, despite previous findings that phylogenetically close species should demonstrate the highest degree of host sharing [42, 43] , humans have lower similarity of host-specialist parasites with their close relatives, the other great apes, than predicted [4, 7] . In light of these previous findings, our results of lower-thanpredicted parasite richness in helminths and protozoa may be the result of a loss of host specialists over evolutionary time. In addition, viruses could be uniquely difficult to extinguish, independent of host specificity, because of their faster rates of evolution and greater potential to shift between hosts [44, 45] . These factors could explain the consistently higher observed than predicted richness of viruses in humans.",

For example, the complex and environmental life cycles that are more common among helminths and protozoa might make them more susceptible than viruses to extinction as a result of hygienic interventions like toilets [46] . Humans' urban ecosystem may also reduce their exposure to parasites with complex lifestyles, as has been shown for nonhuman primates that live in urban habitats [47] . In contrast, more of the viruses can be transmitted via close contact [25] . In fact, many viral, close-contact transmitted diseases emerged once humans lived in high enough densities to sustain them (i.e., \"crowd epidemic diseases\"), and could not have persisted in small, dispersed hunter-gatherer groups [3, 48] . In addition to the nearly global human distribution, humans are expanding their range on a more local scale into forests and wild areas, providing more opportunities for transmission from other species [49] . As noted above, our results may also reflect research biases that our methods could not fully account for, such as greater effort to resolve viral diversity in humans relative to nonhuman primates.",

These results raise many questions for future research, including how patterns of parasitism vary across human populations with differing lifestyles and cultural practices on a finer scale. For example, the human populations in this study comprise a wide range of urban and rural settings, access to plumbing, refrigeration, and sanitation resources, and cultural beliefs, all of which may influence parasite richness. Understanding how these factors shape parasite richness within individual human populations will provide clearer explanations for the broad-scale patterns that we uncover here.",
