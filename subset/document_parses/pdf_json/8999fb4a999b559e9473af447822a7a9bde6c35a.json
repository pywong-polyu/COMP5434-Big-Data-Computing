            "text": "Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in January 2020, different methods have been developed and employed for diagnostic testing and screening. In addition to the most commonly adopted laboratory tests via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [1, 2] or chest computer tomography (CT) scans [3] for diagnosis, a variety of digital technologies, often employing artificial intelligence, have also been investigated for COVID-19 screening [4, 5, 6] . Among these, automatic audio-based COVID-19 detection has drawn increasing attention due to its numerous advantages, including its flexi-\u22ef \u22ef ble, affordable, scalable, non-invasive and sustainable data collection methods. Existing literature has mainly investigated the information content of different audio modalities (e.g. cough, breathing, and voice) [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and the power of various machine learning techniques, especially deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . While success has been witnessed recently in COVID-19 detection from audio signals through machine learning techniques [10] , there is still a paucity of work on continuous monitoring of COVID-19 disease progression. This could provide individual-specific timely indication of disease development at scale, guide personalised medical treatments, potentially capture disease onset to curb transmission, and estimate recovery rate, which plays a key role for determining quarantine rules during the current post-peak and . This is evident here in spectrograms of one participant, repeating the same sentence on 6 different days. The participant reported positive test results from 2020-11-10 to 2020-11-18, and reported negative test results from 2020-11-22 to 2020-12-26, indicating a recovery trend. The fundamental frequency and its harmonics (black box) for positive recordings demonstrates the lack of control in vocal cords, indicated by its non-separability. An increasing separability can be seen from positive to negative recordings over time, suggesting the recovery of voice characteristics. Similarly, the harmonics in the frequency range [2kHz 4kHz] (blue box) manifest an increasing separability, also reflecting the recovery trend.",

It would also allow better resource management in health care systems, while remotely monitoring patients and bringing them to hospital (only) when necessary. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 disease progression varies among individuals, with mean disease duration ranging between 11 days to 21 days depending on gender and age, co-morbidities and time receiving treatment [20, 21, 22, 23, 24] . By continuously monitoring patients' disease progression, individual-specific information could be captured to benefit both patients and doctors. In addition, compared to the commonly adopted uncomfortable diagnostic methods of RT-PCR tests, and radiation-intensive CT scans that need to be conducted on hospital sites, audio-based monitoring of disease progression can be non-intrusively repeated on a daily basis and for prolonged periods, proving a good fit for longitudinal remote monitoring.",

We hypothesize that this could be captured longitudinally via audio signals in automatic monitoring systems. Though the participants in our study may not experience all three stages, it is assumed that audio characteristics are affected during clinical progression of disease. Fig. 2 shows spectrograms of one participant reading the same sentence over a 43-day period. They reported COVID-19 infection followed by recov-ery. As indicated in the black box, the fundamental frequency and its harmonics are not clearly separable when the participant tested positive (top row) especially on 2020-11-14, indicating a lack of control of vibration of the vocal cords. The separability increases after recovery. This matches the observed clinical course of COVID-19 disease progression [26] , with the least separability 5 days after the first positive test result (2020- [11] [12] [13] [14] , and an increase in separability 9 days after infection (2020- [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Similar patterns are also observed for the harmonics in the high frequency range between 2 kHz to 4 kHz (blue box). There is no obvious difference in the spectrogram patterns between 2020-11-18 (positive) and 2020-11-22 (negative), reflecting the difficulty of the COVID-19 detection task in general. Overall, this evolution of the spectrograms with disease progression shows that COVID-19 infection can manifest as changes in the acoustic representations, and modelling the audio sequences longitudinally might benefit COVID-19 detection.",

This is not considered in most conventional audio-based COVID-19 detection systems, which so far only used a single audio sample, rather than sequences. This makes the automatic detection a hard task and may lead to wrong predictions. While modelling the evolution of the spectrograms longitudinally, the individual's past audio signal can serve as a 'baseline', and the predictions can be corrected given this reference. Additionally, the spectrogram for each individual when healthy can be used as a reference for its own infected status, and modelling the relative changes in the audio sequences longitudinally is likely to be more accurate for COVID-19 detection. In a much generalised sense, the mean and the standard deviation of the audio recordings in individual's healthy state, are both personalised. This provide a good threshold for the non-healthy states and benefits the COVID-19 detection. Motivated by these advantages, we explored the potential of modelling the sequential audio recordings longitudinally, as biomarkers of disease progression, focusing on how best to capture dynamic changes in the au-dio sequences over time, and aiming to demonstrate predictive power.",

P2 yields \u03b3 = 1 since all the predictions are positive. Further, the probability of positive increases from symptom onset day 0 to day 8, and decreases slightly to day 16, which matches the clinical course in general. For a negative participant P3 (Fig. 5c) , the predicted probability is consistently below 0.5, corresponding to negative predictions that align with the test results. One type of disease progression that transitions from negative to positive is not included, due to the limited number of participants in the cohort.

We analysed the predicted trajectories over similar time period. Though many participants report symptoms on the first day they start recording, which may not be the first day they experienced symptoms, the increasing trend in the first few days could still suggest the initial worsening of patients' conditions. We define the 7 day window to be from either the first day of reported symptoms, or the day of the first positive test if no symptoms are reported before that. This leads to 12 eligible participants in the test cohort, where we found 8 out of 12 (66.7%) show an increase in predicted probability, similar to the statistical analysis.

Though it is difficult to draw statistical conclusions due to the limited number of participants, these results still suggest differences in the predicted recovery rate for different individuals. In terms of practical applications, the individual-specific recovery monitoring may be beneficial in providing prompt feedback to self-isolating patients, and more importantly, can provide treatment guidance for doctors according to each individual's recovery status. Specifically, when a sharp decrease in the predicted probability is observed, it indicates that the individual is recovering well. Conversely, no decrease in the predicted probability over a long time period may require further or more effective treatment.

For sequence lengths with more than 2 samples (Fig. 2a) or around and more than 4 days (Fig. 2b) , the model can produce reasonably good predictions.

For each modality, audio recordings are first converted to spectrograms, and fed into a VGGish pre-trained network for higher-level feature representations, which could help leverage and transfer the knowledge learnt from an external massive generalaudio dataset [27] . The embeddings converted by VGGish from the three modalities are concatenated to form a multi-modal input vector for the subsequent GRUs based prediction network. The reason to choose GRUs over a Long Short-Term Memory neural network is due to fewer parameters in limited data size regimes. GRUs also use less memory and executes faster, which benefits potential model deployment.

Despite the accuracy of \u03b3 = 0.79 for participant c, the predictions fluctuate between positive and negative predictions, which suggests the possible solution of personalisation. Participant d was predicted positive for the 1st point with the probability of 0.55, which is possibly due to the inadequate audio dynamics.
