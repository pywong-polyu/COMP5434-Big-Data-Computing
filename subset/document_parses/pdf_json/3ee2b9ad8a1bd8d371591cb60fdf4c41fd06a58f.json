However, the most explored variant is looking at how to choose a seed set of a given size, that maximizes the number of activated nodes for selected model of social influence. This has been studied mostly in the area of static networks, yet other kinds of networks, such as multilayer or temporal ones, are also in the scope of recent research. In this work we propose and evaluate the measure based on entropy, that investigates how the neighbourhood of nodes varies over time, and based on that and their activity ranks, the nodes as possible candidates for seeds are selected. This measure applied for temporal networks intends to favor nodes that vary their neighbourhood highly and, thanks to that, are good spreaders for certain influence models. The results demonstrate that for the Independent Cascade Model of social influence the introduced entropy-based metric outperforms typical seed selection heuristics for temporal networks. Moreover, compared to some other heuristics, it is fast to compute, thus can be used for fast-varying temporal networks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Social influence maximization is a research topic that has been posed in 2003 by Kempe et al.

Assuming a static social network and a given influence model, typical social influence maximization task is to choose a set of k nodes that will result with the highest influence (number of activations) across all methods. As presented in Related Work, this area has been investigated at the beginning for the case of static networks. However, recently researchers extended their interest to other kinds of networks, including multilayer [18] or temporal networks [11, 23] . This is caused by the fact, that for some applications these networks are more suitable for representing several types of processes, especially related to information diffusion. Here, an aggregated graph is not capable to represent the ordering of events, crucial for studying these processes. This is the reason why temporal networks are the model chosen in the case of modelling diffusion processes.

It was defined with main goal to increase the coverage within the network with properly selected seed nodes [16] . Due to the difficulty of finding the exact solution, several heuristics, with the most effective greedy approach [16] and its extensions with adjustable computational performance [9] were proposed trough the course of last years. Apart from that, other seed selection methods were explored, including heuristics based on centrality measures [32] , community seeding [38] , k-shell decomposition [17] , genetic algorithms [34, 35] and other solutions [10] . One of their goals is avoiding overlapping the regions of influence and increase the distance between seeds. It was a key concept behind Vote-Rank method [36] and the studies with its extensions. Initial works in the area of information diffusion were related to static networks, and later evolved towards temporal networks. They focused on seed selection in dynamic networks and comparison of different approaches [20] . They also focused on links, changing topologies and nodes availability [14] . Recent studies focused on topological features of temporal networks figured out temporal versions of static centrality measures [26, 30, 31] and they can be used for seed selection. As a generalization of the closeness centrality for static networks, Pan and Saram\u00e4ki define the temporal closeness centrality [25] . Takaguchi proposed method to represent the importance of a temporal vertex defined as temporal coverage centrality [29] . Beside the topological features, recent studies highlighted the dynamics of temporal networks as significant factor of information diffusion [12] . They showed that dynamics-sensitive centrality in temporal networks performed seeds selection much better than topological centrality. In [2] temporal sequence of retweets in Twitter cascades was used to detect a set of influential users by identifying anchor nodes.

For instance, Takaguchi et al. evaluated the predictability of the partner sequence for individuals [28] . In [37] authors proposed entropy-based measure to quantify how many typical configurations of social interactions can be expected at any given time, taking into account the history of the network dynamic processes.

Another work is using measures based on entropy for analyzing the human communication dynamics and demonstrating how the complex systems stabilise over time [19] . The results presented in the last work are important to understand that the implications of stabilisation are significantly affecting the diffusion. In the case when our social circles do not change, information has less possibilities to reach different areas of the network. As a consequence, if information has limited chances to appear in some parts of the network, the same would apply to social influence. This observation was the inspiration of our work in which we wanted to find the nodes that have the most-varying neighbourhood, thus the highest chances to spread information to others.
