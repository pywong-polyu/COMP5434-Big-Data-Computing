Early in the pandemic, much of this focus was on hospital and emergency department care delivery models to ensure the safety of non-COVID-19 patients and health care workers. However, providing much needed outpatient assessments for COVID-19 patients during a pandemic is also fraught with challenges. From our review of the literature, best practices for a dedicated pandemic ambulatory outpatient clinic have not previously been described. We present a model for creating a dedicated ambulatory pandemic clinic at our institution for the acute care needs of COVID-19 patients. Methods: To address the current pandemic, the Mayo Acute Symptoms of COVID-19 Clinic was implemented on April 13, 2020, with the aims of providing a stand-alone location for COVID-19 patients to have acute outpatient evaluations as well as diagnostics. Results: Recognized challenges addressed included consideration of airflow recirculation patterns in standard medical office buildings, optimization of protocols to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), limiting total exposure time during patient flow, and reducing surfaces and spaces that patients would physically contact. To this end, unique methods of patient scheduling, patient flow process, staff training, and PPE protocols were developed and are explained in detail in this article. Conclusion: In the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as inevitably in future pandemics, outpatient medical facilities need to be prepared to care for nonhospitalized and nonemergent pandemic patients. We offer a practical approach that has been successful at our institution, with opportunity for local adaptation based on need and resources.",

            "text": "Given the highly infectious and often rapidly progressive nature of COVID-19, many health care systems created specialized wings, clinics, or entire hospitals with dedicated staff to treat COVID-19 patients. This helped decrease burden on emergency departments (EDs) and inpatient hospitalizations. The challenge remained in providing expeditious triage, testing, and symptomatic treatment for patients, as well as keeping infected patients from interacting with noninfected patients and providers without personal protective equipment (PPE). In our review of the literature, we were unable to find any published best practices for a dedicated pandemic ambulatory clinic. Published descriptive articles reviewed included the creation of a clinic adjacent to an ED for the purpose of both evaluating and testing for COVID-19, general and specialty clinic preparation guidance, and recommendations from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). [2] [3] [4] [5] However, to our knowledge, a dedicated ambulatory pandemic clinic has never been described in the literature. We present a model of how we created a dedicated ambulatory pandemic clinic at our institution to address the acute care needs of COVID-19 patients at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. This strategy is applicable to other clinics and health care systems during this pandemic crisis and, most importantly, will serve as a template for outpatient management of future pandemics. ",

The building had some limitations inherent to the structure. The first challenge encountered was to minimize the risk with standard recirculation patterns in air handling. It was clear that this step would be a rate-limiting variable for planning safe and effective care during any infectious pandemic. As a result, our process for rooming each patient was designed around the inherent building limitations. Understanding the natural limits of the building structure and ventilation, we devised a protocol that minimized the amount of time that each patient would spend within the building space and all aerosol-inducing testing was performed outdoors. We chose a single hallway as the contaminated space and that hallway was chosen because it shared access to the laboratory and radiology. This hallway was then isolated from the rest of the building with physical barriers built by our facilities team. Any rooms that shared ventilation with the contaminated rooms were considered nonusable space ( Figure 2 ).",

Diagnostic capabilities of the clinic included plain radiographs, blood and urine tests, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing, and electrocardiograms.

Any staff members involved in the direct care of patients were provided the following PPE: gowns, gloves, medical masks, and eye protection (goggles or face shield), in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO. 1 Providers were supplied disposable stethoscopes for all examinations, and each room was cleaned after each patient use with Sani-Cloth germicidal disposable wipes. Any materials in the examination room that could not be covered by plastic sheets were removed for most efficient cleaning between uses, and all furniture was removed from the lobby to avoid congregating as well as to limit any hard surfaces that could be touched by patients.",

We scheduled all aspects for the pa-tient at the same time, blocking a 20-to 30-minute slot total for each individual patient, with the aim to have only one patient in the building at a time. For this reason, scheduling had to be completed manually for each patient by a dedicated MASCC scheduler who understood this process. Our scheduler would instruct each patient to arrive 15 minutes early, to remain in his or her car in the parking lot, and to complete the nurse rooming questionnaire by phone before the nurse would escort the patient into the building. The multidisciplinary MASCC team, including our scheduler, a phlebotomist, a radiology technician, 2 nurses, and 2 providers prehuddled before each patient to determine whether there should be any variations in the planned flow.",

Initial flowcharts were developed and modified to ensure minimal transportation of supplies, patients, and equipment for patient flow, as well as preventing exposures and saving time in the office by reducing motion within the patient flow. 1. Reducing patient on-site time: Key to reducing patient and staff exposure to COVID-19 was limiting patient time in the building. Utilizing video visits allowed providers to perform an initial evaluation of the patient and identify potential diagnostic needs. The in-person visit flow then reduced contact time for all staff members and minimized a patient's time in the building. Coordinating staff seeing the patient in an assembly line fashion reduced the PPE usage to 1 set per staff member per patient. 2. Optimizing patient flow: As our experience evolved, the MASCC consolidated face-to-face visits to occur at a narrower time of day, in the late afternoon and early evening hours, and narrowed the provider panel to 1 MASCC provider. Additional MASCC or CVC patients were also present during these late afternoon hours for diagnostics. This allowed the facility that was initially requisitioned for the MASCC to return to regular full-time use for non-COVID-19 patients during the day by consolidating the patients with COVID-19 symptoms later in the day and into the evening. The building was deep cleaned each evening again before the non-COVID-19 regular clinic patients returned the following morning.",

There was a need to evaluate patients with COVID-19 symptoms and negative RT-PCR testing as if they might have COVID-19. However, this same subset of patients should also be evaluated for non-COVID-19 causes for their symptoms. In our MASCC experience of patients with COVID-19 symptoms, we diagnosed a broad array of other medical conditions: mononucleosis, tonsillar abscess, Strep pharyngitis, Bechet syndrome flare, influenza, RSV infection, bacterial and viral pneumonia, hyponatremia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), urinary tract infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema, asthma exacerbation, breast cancer with new pulmonary metastatic lesions, and pulmonary emboli. Experienced general internists and family medicine physicians with superior clinical acumen are needed for the care of this unique subset of symptomatic patients during a global pandemic. We experienced providing direct medical care at the forefront of new pandemic testing that was evolving rapidly and with controversy regarding false-negatives, implications for viral shedding, and non-FDA-approved testing. 6 Our experience also included several different types of clinical scenarios including the following:",

In our case, early in the pandemic, this gap included patients with COVID-19 symptoms as well as known COVID-19positive patients who needed diagnostics and a faceto-face physical examination but were not acutely ill enough to warrant ED evaluation or hospitalization. It was also important to provide proper and prompt triage for those patients who may indeed need to be sent to the ED or directly admitted. A dedicated pandemic clinic allowed our health care system to provide direct patient care without putting other nonaffected patients at risk for exposure.",

However, we believe that other health care systems could still replicate and adapt this model to an existing clinic if a standalone facility is not feasible. For example, the check-in process of an existing clinic could be transitioned to a virtual check-in with standardized screening questions such as the ones used by our staff as well as initial provider evaluation virtually for all patients. Other ideas include requisitioning a floor of the parking garage on campus for temporary (curtained) examination rooms to allow for best outdoor ventilation. Moreover, freestanding units such as a mobile medical unit vehicle or prefabricated modular office units could be arranged in a parking lot area. Finally, an outdoor vital sign and ambulatory oxygen nurse station with an available provider for evaluation could be implemented at a COVID-19 drive-through testing line. For each of these considerations, patient flow, room and equipment sterilization, ventilation, and ability for laboratory and radiography www.qmhcjournal.com studies to be obtained would have to be adapted depending on the available layout and local regulations.",
