With over 1.9 billion people overweight or obese globally, 3 implications for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic morbidity and mortality are substantial. Even after adjusting for age and obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and coronary heart disease, obesity remains a strong independent predictor of excess morbidity and mortality. 1, 4, 5 These findings although concerning are not entirely unexpected. 6 Obesity and poor clinical outcomes have been described with other viral pathogens, most notably influenza A (H1N1) during the 2009 pandemic, when obesity was associated with increased hospitalizations, need for intensive care support, and deaths. 4, 7, 8 In addition to the relationship between obesity and clinical outcomes, emerging evidence suggests a link between higher body mass index (BMI) and higher incidence rates of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection 4, 9, 10 suggesting increased BMI may enhance susceptibility to infection. If correct, there would be important implications for individual-level risks and population-level transmission dynamics, particularly among populations with high rates of obesity. 4 However, data supporting this association is limited, and given the absence of convincing precedent from other pathogens additional evidence is required to confirm these findings.",

            "text": "Prior studies that report an association between increased risk of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection with higher BMI are intriguing and raise important questions about factors driving transmission. Given the enormous global burden of overweight and obese adults, delineating risks for infection is a public health priority. Interestingly, our findings appear to diverge from recent data that examines the risk for COVID-19 by BMI including a nationwide case-control study from South Korea 9 and a cross-sectional study from a primary care surveillance network in the United Kingdom 22 that identify an increased risk of COVID-19 with increasing BMI; and a recent meta-analysis of 20 studies that reported a pooled increased risk of 46\u00b70% (OR = 1\u00b746; 95% CI, 1\u00b730-1\u00b765; p < 0\u00b70001) with 18 of 20 studies demonstrating higher COVID-19 risk among obese individuals. 4 Our study did not identify an increase in adjusted seroprevalence with increasing BMI and conversely identified a trend to lower infection risk with higher obesity classes. This trend was consistent when both considering all data and when performing subgroup analysis on a high transmission site where the increased force of infection would be expected to more precisely delineate heterogeneity in infection risks. Reasons for the difference between our and prior study outcomes may be multifactorial with differences in study design and population behaviors likely influencing findings. However, we believe the primary difference is we examined SARS-CoV-2 infection risk using serological methods unbiased to exposure risks or presence or absence of symptoms at study entry versus other studies examining risks for clinically apparent infection (i.e. COVID-19). Given obese individuals exhibit more pronounced symptomatology including fever, as our data indicates, this population is more likely to meet testing criteria, more likely to be tested and therefore more likely to be over-represented in studies that identify cases through routine surveillance approaches. 23, 24 As such, although our study findings appear inconsistent with most prior studies of obesity risk, in fact the question being asked was different.

            "text": "Unfortunately, conflation of COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 infection is commonplace, as evidenced by confusion over case-versus infection-fatality rate. 24 Our finding that obesity is associated with increased COVID-19 compatible symptoms among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals provides benchmark data for understanding symptom heterogeneity in mild infections by BMI. We demonstrate that not only are well established measures of severe disease such as hospitalization, intensive care requirements and death more common among obese individuals 5,25,26 , but that obesity is also an important driver of increased symptomatology in non-severe infections. While our data does not provide insights into the mechanism driving these findings, it informs our understanding of symptomatology and obesity, guides our interpretation of epidemiological data, and highlights the potential implication of using passively collected symptom-driven surveillance data to characterize the epidemiology of infectious pathogens. We also identify an interesting influence of age on obesity symptom reporting, with a compelling association below 40 years of age but near complete absence of effect in older adults. These findings are notable given they imply the established interaction between obesity and age on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, with obesity disproportionately driving increased disease severity among younger age groups, 5,25 extend throughout the spectrum of disease and are not restricted to severe disease. The reasons for this phenomenon are unclear and deserve study but do fit within the broader understanding of obesity and age in which the all-cause relative risk of death associated with increasing BMI decreases with age. 27 Given the fundamental role of the adaptive immune response in both the resolution of infection and the severity of disease, 11 we also probed multiple binding and functional immune markers to assess differential immune responses between obese and non-obese individuals. While, previous studies noted poor seroconversion and inadequate seroprotection across vaccine trials, 28 we did not detect meaningful differences in binding or neutralizing antibodies, T cell activity, or other functional humoral .

These findings, while notable, should be considered in the context of this largely asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic cohort, that may not capture the full range of disease burden associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, the overlapping and indistinguishable antibody and T-cell helper profiles point to unaltered adaptive immunity with BMI, raising the possibility that BMI-driven immunological changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection may manifest largely within the innate immune response. Significant alterations in chronic inflammation, particularly driven by persistent innate cytokine responses from adipocytes, have been noted in the setting of obesity. 29 Dissecting the influence of adipocyte inflammatory responses, associated cytokine storm, and enhanced symptomatology, particularly among individuals with a high BMI, may point to mechanistic differences in viral sensing across populations. These data point to remaining knowledge gaps on the relative importance and interplay of the humoral, cellular and innate immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. 30",

The study population are industry employees with over-representation -compared to the US population --of persons of Hispanic ethnicity, white race, male sex, and younger individuals with lower rates of comorbidities including obesity and as such findings may not be generalizable. Given 53% of the invited employees participated in the study, an unmeasured selection bias may have been introduced. Several additional potential study limitations should be noted but any impact of these limitations would be expected to be evenly distributed across cohort participants and therefore not introduce a systematic bias and impact study findings. These include (i) limited recall of COVID-19 compatible symptoms, (ii) delayed seroconversion relative to reported symptoms, so depending on timing of infection and blood sampling, some registered symptoms may not be due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (ii) false positive serological results.

With the exception of congestion (0\u00b787 [0\u00b743-1\u00b770]), a similar and consistent but non-significant trend was observed for all symptoms (Figure 2). Overall, obese individuals registered more symptoms (2\u00b726 versus 1\u00b740, OR 1\u00b710 [1\u00b702-1\u00b722]) and more primary symptoms (1\u00b705 versus 0\u00b758, OR 1\u00b724 [1\u00b704-1\u00b748]) than non-obese. Differential symptom reporting was more pronounced in those under 40 years of age. Fever was more commonly reported among obese vs non-obese individuals under 40 years of age (OR 4\u00b799 [1\u00b797-13\u00b735]) but not over 40 years (OR 1\u00b732 [0\u00b730-5\u00b757]). Similarly, reporting \u22656 symptoms was more common among obese vs non-obese under 40 years (OR 3\u00b70 [1\u00b732-6\u00b785]) but not for those greater than 40 years (OR 0\u00b794 [0\u00b718-4\u00b726]). A strikingly similar trend was observed for the majority of other symptoms and aggregate symptom measures (Figure 3).
