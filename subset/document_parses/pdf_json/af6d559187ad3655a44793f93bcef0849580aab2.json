Fever was the main manifestation, present in all patients, followed by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal features, present in 89% and 81% of the patients, respectively. Myocarditis occurred in 21% of the patients and in 68% of them required intensive care. The Kawasaki disease phenotype occurred in most patients (77%). All patients had elevated inflammatory markers, with elevated CRP being the most found (98%). Anemia and lymphopenia were present in 79% and 72%, respectively. Laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was found in 77% of the patients, with 39% positive RT-PCR and 84% positive serology for SARS-CoV-2. An immunomodulatory treatment was performed in 91% of the patients, with 67% receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) associated with glucocorticoid, 21% receiving IVIG, and 3.5% receiving glucocorticoid.

However, a few weeks after the arrival of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe and in the USA, there was a change in the clinical and epidemiological pattern of the infection in pediatrics. Case reports and case series described a new hyperinflammatory syndrome in previously healthy children and adolescents, requiring hospitalization, most of them in pediatric intensive care units [4] [5] [6] . These patients presented fever and involvement of several organs and systems, such as gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, mucocutaneous, and neurological symptoms, among others. Laboratory tests revealed intense inflammatory activity and coagulopathy [7, 8] .",

These are classic findings in KD, and are the main clinical similarities between PIMS-TS and KD [13, 14] . However, as described in other case series from different countries, we also found in our cohort the presence of abdominal manifestations, mainly abdominal pain [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In some series, some of these patients even underwent an exploratory laparotomy to clarify the abdominal pain [6, 8] . While fever and mucocutaneous manifestations were the main similarities observed between PIMS-TS and KD, the presence of abdominal pain was the main difference between the two diseases, since abdominal pain is rare in KD and is shown to be a frequent manifestation in PIMS-TS [13, 14] . Although both diseases have cardiovascular manifestations, the type and severity of involvement are different between PIMS-TS and KD [13, 14] . As observed in other series, we also observed in our PIMS-TS patients a higher frequency of myocarditis and a lower frequency of coronary artery changes, which are the main feature of KD [8, 19, 20] . Myocardial involvement associated with shock in KD, known as KD shock syndrome, is rare, affecting less than 10% of patients with KD [17] . In other words, in PIMS-TS, a myocardial involvement is common and severe, whereas a coronary artery involvement is mild and transient [23] [24] [25] .",

Recently, some guidelines and observational studies have advocated, especially in severe cases, the association of IVIG and glucocorticoids [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . In our cohort, we observed a higher frequency in the combined prescription of IVIG and glucocorticoids. These patients also presented a higher frequency of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit but a similar length of hospital stay when compared to patients who received only IVIG or glucocorticoid. These results were expected since the former group presented a more severe disease with need for intensive care.
