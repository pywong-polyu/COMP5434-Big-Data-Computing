Briefly, a DNA recombinase binds to primers and forms a DNA recombinase-primer complex to recognize the targeted DNA template. Next, the SSBs binds simultaneously to the displaced strands of DNA and stabilizes the formed nucleoprotein filament. Then, a strand displacing DNA polymerase recognizes the bound complex and initiates DNA synthesis [10] [11] [12] . RPA is a highly sensitive and rapid amplification method that has been used in a wide range of applications that require DNA amplification, including disease diagnosis, transgene detection, and food safety tests [13] [14] [15] . RPA assays can be performed within 20 min at a constant temperature ranging from 25 to 45 \u2022 C. Other advantages of RPA are that it is tolerant of numerous substances that inhibit amplification in PCR-based assays, and the reagents are sold in a lyophilized format suitable for in-field application [10] . This allows for a simple and rapid diagnosis of plant diseases.",

Cas12a is an RNA-guided nuclease that cleaves double-stranded DNA containing a T-rich protospaceradjacent motif (PAM). After cleavage, Cas12a cleaves the surrounding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is also called reporter DNA, in a nonspecific manner. Combined with RPA, DETECTR has successfully been used to perform highly sensitive and specific detection of various pathogens [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

The lateral flow assay (LFA) is an emerging detection device that can be read with the naked eye to detect amplified DNA products. In the classical LFA, amplified DNA with a Fluorescein phosphoramidite (FAM)/Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at one end and biotin at the other end is captured by biotin-binding protein (streptavidin) in the bottom line, which is close to the sample pad. Then, the FAM/FITC are recognized and bound by gold conjugate nanoparticle (Au-NP)-labelled anti-FAM/FITC antibodies. Therefore, the bottom line generates a color signal. In the CRISPR/Cas-based detection system, double-labelled single-strand DNA (ssDNA) is used as reporter and a defined amount of reporter is used in the LFA. Without target amplicon, the intact reporters are captured, and a majority of the gold conjugate is trapped in the bottom line, which leads to a weak signal in the top line referring a negative result. In the presence of target amplicon, the reporters are cleaved, and the labels are separated from each other by activated Cas protein. Consequently, less of the mobile gold conjugate can be retained on the bottom line. The bottom line intensity decreases and the top line intensity increases which refers positive result [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

ITS1 and ITS2 from E. fawcettii were downloaded from NCBI and used as templates for the primer design, as previously reported [7] . Several species-specific candidates forward (F) and reverse (R) primer sets (Table 1) were manually designed according to the TwistAmp Manufacturer's Principles Kit (TwistDX, Cambridge, UK). The primers were synthesized by Bioneer (Seoul, Korea). The RPA reactions were established according to the instructions in the TwistAmp Basic Kit (TwistDX) with few modifications. Briefly, a mixture of 2 \u00b5L of template DNA, 1 \u00b5L of forward primer, 1 \u00b5L of reverse primer, and 29.5 \u00b5L of rehydration buffer (TwistDX) was finalized to 47.5 \u00b5L with double-distilled water, and 2.5 \u00b5L of magnesium acetate (MgOAc) was added before starting the reaction. The reactions were performed at 37 \u2022 C for 20 min.",

The unique region of E. fawcettii was amplified through an RPA reaction, and the reaction product was directly added to the CRISPR/Cas12a reaction. The amplicon with a unique sequence could be specifically recognized by Cas12a and subsequently triggered CRISPR/Cas12a to cleave the double-labeled ssDNA reporter through the trans-cleavage activity [19, 24] . The lateral flow readout is based on the cleavage of a double-labeled reporter (FAM/FITCbiotin); the presence of many reporters causes anti-FAM antibody-gold nanoparticle conjugates (Au-NP) to gather at the C (control) line on the strip. In our experiments, when the activated CRISPR/Cas12a cleaved the ssDNA FAM/FITC-biotin reporter, the band intensity significantly increased on the T (test) line and decreased on the C line [30] (Figure 1) .

            "text": "Here, we developed a rapid and sensitive RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a-LFA system for diagnosing citrus scab. This method has several advantages compared to conventional PCR-based methods. First, the RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a reactions can be performed at constant and relatively low temperature (37 \u2022 C), therefore, eliminating the requirement of expensive special instruments such as thermocyclers. The reactions can be performed in closed hands or with a hand warmer. Second, the entire diagnostic process can be completed within approximately 60 min, including 10 min for crude DNA extraction, 20 min for the RPA reaction, 25 min for the CRISPR/Cas12a reaction, and 5 min for visual detection using a lateral flow assay strip. In contrast, PCR-based detection method requires at least 3 h including 60 min for DNA extraction, 90 min for PCR reaction, and 30 min for gel electrophoresis (Figure 1) . Third, the result can be easily read out using LFA strips which is not require special technique and equipment such as electrophoresis. Last, it is not necessary to use high quality and purified DNA for amplification template which is required for conventional PCR-based diagnosis ( Figure 4 ). Taken together, this newly developed technique has great potential for use as a point-of-care diagnostic tool. On-field diagnosis of citrus scab could help in creating an effective and accurate control strategy for farmers.",

The RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a detection system is combined with LFA to visualize the detection result. Furthermore, this detection system could be applied to a crude DNA sample which makes the whole diagnosis process easier. This new diagnostic method has the potential to be used for point-of-care diagnosis, enabling early disease diagnosis in citrus orchards, allowing a correct control plan to be established, thereby increasing the productivity of fruit. Also, since this method can be used for mass diagnosis, it has the potential to be used in breeding research, quarantine, and machine learning for artificial intelligence diagnosis. ",

Unique genomic regions of Elsino\u00eb fawcettii were amplified in an RPA reaction in 20 min at 37 \u2022 C, using crude DNA extract. The amplification product was added into a CRISPR/Cas12a mixture, and a trans-cleavage reaction was activated in the presence of the target amplicon and was completed in 25 min at 37 \u2022 C. The result was visible in 3 min using lateral flow readout. Without target amplicon, the intact ssDNA is captured in C line and then gold nanoparticle is trapped in the C line which refers negative result. With target amplicon, the labels are separated from each other by activated Cas12a and gold nanoparticle is trapped in the T line which refers positive result. ssDNA: single stranded DNA, streptavidin: biotin-binding protein, gt: goat, Au-NP: gold conjugated nanoparticle, C: control line, T: test line.",

For the lateral flow detection of the Cas12a-mediated trans-cleavage of the ssDNA reporter, the ssDNA was labeled at 5 with biotin and at 3 with FAM (5 -/6-FAM/TTATT/biotin/-3 ). The crRNA and ssDNA were synthesized by Bioneer (Seoul, Korea). The EnGen Lba Cas12a enzyme (NEW ENGLAND BioLabs, NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) was preincubated at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M with 1 \u00b5M crRNA in 1\u00d7 NEBuffer 2.1 (NEB) at 37 \u2022 C for 10 min to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex.

After incubation, 20 \u00b5L of the reaction mixture was mixed with 100 \u00b5L of HybriDetect assay buffer (Milenia Biotec, Giessen, Germany) in a 1.5 mL tube. A lateral flow strip (Milenia Biotec) was placed upright in the tube at room temperature (usually, bands appear on it within 2-3 min).",
