These were compared with results from 32 individuals who were on the intensive therapy unit (ITU) for non-COVID reasons. We demonstrate a higher frequency of autoantibodies in the COVID-19 ITU group compared with non-COVID-19 ITU disease control patients and that autoantibodies were also found in the serum 3-5 months post-COVID-19 infection. Non-COVID patients displayed a diverse pattern of autoantibodies; in contrast, the COVID-19 groups had a more restricted panel of autoantibodies including skin, skeletal muscle and cardiac antibodies. Our results demonstrate that respiratory viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the detection of a limited profile of tissue-specific autoantibodies, detectable using routine clinical immunology assays. Further studies are required to determine whether these autoantibodies are specific to SARS-CoV-2 or a phenomenon arising from severe viral infections and to determine the clinical significance of these autoantibodies.",

            "text": "Early data suggest that autoimmune phenomena may exacerbate the immune pathology associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or trigger long-term autoimmune complications secondary to bystander activation or molecular mimicry. There are reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection being associated with a number of autoimmune disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) (3) and various cytopenias (4). Anti-phospholipid antibodies have been detected in ~50% of hospitalized patients and linked to an increased incidence of cerebral infarction; however, the clinical relevance of this observation in COVID-19 remains controversial, as anti-phospholipid antibody generation in acute illness is a common, non-specific finding (5) (6) (7) . Also, neutralizing antibodies against type 1 anti-viral cytokines, interferon (IFN)-\u03c9 and/or IFN-\u03b1 have been found in more than 10% of patients with coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pneumonia (8) . By screening a yeast expression library, Wang et al. identified autoantibodies against cytokines (including type 1 IFNs), central nervous system (CNS) antigens and extracellular matrix proteins whose frequency correlated with disease severity (9) . Paediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome (PIMS-TS) is a rare condition that occurs as a late complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children suffering from this post-COVID 19 inflammatory condition were also seropositive for anti-endothelial antibodies that may contribute to their pathology (10) (11) (12) . We and others are now searching for tissue specific autoantibodies in adults. Kreye and colleagues screened for CNS autoantibodies using murine brain sections identifying anti-Yo and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) as well as a variety of antibodies against epitopes, including vessel endothelium (12) . Evidence has emerged that some of these antibodies may arise through cross-reactive recognition of self-antigens by antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 (13) .",

In particular, the severity of disease may require hospitalization and the more severe presentations of disease may influence the maintenance of autoantibodies during convalescence. To investigate any potential links between SARS-CoV-2 infection and autoantibodies we examined sera from acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients, some of whom had been hospitalized, for the presence of autoantibodies to a spectrum of antigens by indirect immunofluorescence. We identify a high frequency and wide range of clinically relevant autoantibodies in both acute and convalescent samples from COVID-19 patients. Their frequency and tissue specificity suggest that autoantibodies may contribute to the long-term consequences of COVID-19.",

Pathogenic mechanisms elucidated include molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, revelation of cryptic antigen and bystander activation, although which specific mechanism occur in which situation is usually uncertain. Similarly, just because an autoantibody is generated does not necessarily mean that the autoantibody is pathogenic. In some conditions such as myasthenia gravis there is a clear link between acetyl choline receptor antibodies and dysfunction of the motor end plate, whereas in some conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus the presence of high-titre ANA is a non-specific biomarker of disease and the autoantibodies are not thought to be pathogenic.

We cannot exclude the possibility that these observations are a non-specific consequence of severe respiratory viral infection, and the recruitment of further cohorts of patients (e.g. severe influenza) will address this possibility. Secondly, the COVID-19 cohorts were recruited prior to dexamethasone and tocilizumab becoming the standard of care for severe COVID-19. Only a minority of patients in each of our study groups received corticosteroids. Whether these treatments will affect the prevalence or pattern of autoantibodies detectable following COVID-19 requires further study. Lastly, indirect immunofluorescence only provides a qualitative assessment of the presence or absence of autoantibodies and does not provide quantitative assessment or confirmation of the exact antigenic target, which will need further study.
