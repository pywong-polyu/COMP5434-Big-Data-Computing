Information regarding a patient's HRQoL is usually obtained using a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM), which can be further classified as either 'generic' or 'condition-specific'. 1 Generic PROMs, such as the EQ-5D, 2 are designed to cover a general spectrum of health-related problems, and therefore are in theory applicable for any health condition. However, these generic measures may not capture important aspects of HRQoL specific to certain health conditions. In contrast, condition-specific PROMs focus on the domains of HRQoL that are seen to be affected by specific health conditions and are therefore in theory more sensitive to disease-specific improvements in HRQoL.",

The WAItE has been shown to have good psychometric properties, 8 as well as good levels of concurrent validity and test-retest reliability. 9 However, although specifically designed to be preference based (and therefore applicable for use in a CUA), a value set for the WAItE classification system has yet to be developed. A statistical algorithm has been developed to calculate QALYs indirectly by 'mapping' the WAItE to the generic, preference-based Child Health Utility-9 Dimension (CHU-9D), 10 however, this is generally seen as being a 'second best' solution compared with applying direct preference weights through the use of valuation study.",

Furthermore, recent research has shown that preferences gathered from different populations may differ. 16 In this study, we will collect data from a representative sample of the UK adult general population. It can be argued that adults will have a greater understanding of preference elicitation tasks as compared with children and may be better informed about the impact of ill health. Furthermore, as adult preferences are usually used to generate value sets for preference-based measures for adults, using adult preferences for child and adolescent health states provides a level of comparability in methodology across all age groups. Adult general population preferences have used to generate value sets for several generic preference-based measures of HRQoL for children and adolescents. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] When using an adult general population sample, there are several 'perspectives' that an adult can answer from, including their own health as an adult, the health state for themselves as a child and the health state in the context of a child at a specified age. In this study, the adult general population sample will be answering from their own perspective. It can be argued that when answering from this perspective, the adult respondent is under a 'veil of ignorance', meaning that their views should not be influenced by any views they may have about child health. Furthermore, using the adult's own perspective again provides a level of comparability with the methods usually used generate value sets for adult preferencebased methods. Adult population preferences elicited using their own perspective have been used in several previous studies. 17 19 21 22 Furthermore, this perspective was selected as the clearest and easiest to understand by the current study's patient and public involvement (PPI) group during the piloting process.",

From a theoretical standpoint, the standard gamble (SG) and TTO methods are regarded to be the most appropriate method of eliciting utility under uncertainty. 24 The SG method involves an individual being asked to choose between an assured, but impaired, health state option and a risky option in which the individual faces a chance of living in full health for a fixed amount of time or a chance of dying immediately. The TTO method involves asking the respondent to consider living in an impaired health state for a given time period, compared with living in full health for a time period equal to, or less than, that of the impaired health state. The time in full health is adjusted until this option is equally as desirable as the fixed time-period in the impaired health state.

Aside from general problems related to the framing and cognitive burden of the SG and TTO tasks, there are several other weaknesses for using these methods to generate a value set for HRQoL tool.

DCEs describe a health state in terms of its characteristics (or 'attributes'), which can be dimensions of health and quality of life more generally (eg, pain, tiredness). The extent to which an individual values each health state is expected to depend on the 'level' of these characteristics, which can be seen as the relative severity or frequency level of the dimension (eg, never, sometimes and always). DCEs present individuals with two (or more) health state options and each health state is described in terms of a set of attributes and associated levels. Individuals then choose which option they prefer.",

            "text": "It is worth noting that the best-worst scaling (BWS) method has also been used to value preferences for some adolescent preference-based measures, 25 26 and a recent study has argued that BWS may be easier to understand for adolescents due to its relative cognitive simplicity. 27 However, previous research has found that adult respondents find the DCE tasks preferable and easier to complete than BWS tasks 28 29 and other studies have raised concerns about using BWS for valuation exercises. 30 31 In terms of the mode of administration, studies using adult preferences have previously been conducted using both face-to-face interviews and using online surveys. For ease of recruitment, this sample will be recruited from an online panel managed by a survey and market research company. The online panel consists of individuals who have opted in to participate in online surveys in return for a small level of compensation. An online panel is a cost-effective way of recruiting respondents and has been widely used in general valuation studies. 32 Although online data collection may be more susceptible to data quality issues as compared with other methods, it has been noted that other data collection methods may also have issues related to data quality. 33 Anchoring One disadvantage of methods such as DCEs in the context of health state valuation is that the results generated are on a latent scale, meaning that the resulting preferences are measured in terms of unanchored utility with no units. 34 Therefore, these results in isolation do not provide estimates of utility values that are ranked on the 0-1 QALY scale. A number of methods may be used to anchor the latent utility estimates generated from DCEs onto the 0-1 QALY scale, including using a TTO value for the worst health state as defined by the classification system, 35 including a 'dead' state as part of the DCE tasks, 36 conducting a DCE task with a duration attribute included 37 or a hybrid approach involving a combination of DCE and TTO tasks. 38 In this study, we will use two different anchoring techniques. The first technique that we will use is the recently forwarded 'DCE-VAS' method. 34 This method involves the study participants rating three health states using the VAS: the best health state possible from the WAItE (1111111); the worst health state possible from the WAItE (5555555) and 'dead', and then using these responses to reweight the latent scale results from the DCE. These VAS states will be collected as part of the online survey.",

The final model selection will be determined based on model fit, as measured by the log likelihood ratio or McFadden's pseudo R 2 . 47 As previously mentioned, to reweight the latent coefficients calculated from the DCE onto the 0-1 QALY scale, both the EQ-VAS anchoring technique and the TTO anchoring technique will be used.
