Here, we analyse data sampled in a largescale manner from 379,875 people in the United Kingdom (UK) during 2020 to identify population variables associated with mood and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to investigate self-perceived pandemic impact in relation to those variables. We report that while there are relatively small population-level differences in mood assessment scores pre-to peak-UK lockdown, the size of the differences is larger for people from specific groups, e.g. older adults and people with lower incomes. Multiple dimensions underlie peoples' perceptions, both positive and negative, of the pandemic's impact on daily life. These dimensions explain variance in mental health and can be statistically predicted from age, demographics, home and work circumstances, pre-existing conditions, maladaptive technology use and personality traits (e.g., compulsivity). We conclude that a holistic view, incorporating the broad range of relevant population factors, can better characterise people whose mental health is most at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Consequently, it remains unclear which segments of society have been most affected or whether expert opinions align with population perspectives. Additionally, extant studies predominantly have used promotional materials that explicitly mention COVID-19, and target established cohorts, yielding high likelihood of recruitment bias from already non-representative subpopulations 13 .",

Specifically, we first confirmed whether there were differences in population distributions of standard depression, anxiety, tiredness and sleep measures between January 2020 (immediately prior to the COVID-19 outbreak reaching the UK), and May 2020 (during peak lockdown in the UK). We examined how the scale of these differences covaried with relevant population factors such as age, education, occupational and socioeconomic status. Next, we quantified prevalent views and estimated in a data-driven manner the dimensionality of self-perceived impact of the pandemic on daily life during lockdown in May 2020. We tested the degree to which there were both positive and negative aspects of self-perceived impact and whether these had significant explanatory value in terms of the standard mental health assessment measures. Finally, we used multivariate analyses to quantify the relative and collective importance of population factors in predicting the idiosyncratic ways that people's daily lives have been perceptibly affected by the pandemic.",

We first examine whether standard mental health self-assessment measures differed between the period of time just prior to the pandemic hitting the UK and mid-lockdown, and whether those differences covaried with population factors such as age, education and occupational status.

There was a simple linear relationship between difference in anxiety score mid-vs pre-pandemic and age (+0.40 SD for 60-80-year-olds, +0.10 SD for teenagers). This relationship also was evident for depression scores, with older adults also showing a small increase (+0.14 SD for 80+), whereas teenagers and young adults showed a small decrease (\u22120.12 SD). It should be noted that, in both cases, anxiety and depression scores already were higher by a large margin for teenagers and young adults than older adults pre-pandemic lockdown (pre-phase 16-26 minus 76-86 years: anxiety 0.89 SD, depression 0.82 SD).

Finally, linear modelling was applied using a robust train-test pipeline to quantify multivariate associations of online technology use, personality traits and compulsivity with self-perceived COVID-19 impact after factoring out sociodemographic variables (full results in Fig. 10 ). Correlating predicted by true PD-GIS scores for the test data sets showed that a substantial proportion of the variance was explained by these traits, with the relationship being strongest for health concerns (mean r = 0.32, p < 0.0001) followed by disrupted lifestyle (mean r = 0.24, p < 0.0001) and then appreciation of improved environment (mean r = 0.22, p < 0.0001). Bivariate correlations showed that a combination of small-scaled correlations formed the basis of this multivariate relationship. The most prominent predictors related to negative PD-GIS components of disrupted lifestyle and more health concerns-specifically, personality traits including 'self-security' and 'conscientiousness'-were associated with reduced scores, whereas technology addiction (i.e. problematic usage of the internet), stress from technology and compulsivity (reward drive and rigidity) were associated with increased scores.",

In this respect, results from the analysis of the PD-GIS scale are informative. First, the ways in which people consider themselves to have been affected are complex and highly idiosyncratic. Seven principal components were required to capture variance in selfperceived impact. Second, the positive and negative dimensions not only segregated from each other but also explained substantial variance in the standard mental health measures, providing different potential targets for mental health interventions both during and beyond the pandemic. Finally, along with the mental health measures, the dimensions of self-perceived impact covaried with key population variables like age. Therefore, although some potential approaches to mitigating the mental health impact of the pandemic may be generic, it is likely that Fig. 10 Correlation of trait and technology with PD-GIS component scores.

Linear modelling showed that collectively emotion, compulsivity and technology-use traits predict substantial variance (all p < 0.0001 two tailed and FWE corrected for multiple comparisons) in dimensions of self-perceived pandemic impact, particularly for health concerns. Violin plots show the distributions of Pearson's correlations for 100 models trained on random 50% subsets of the data (light grey) and the correlations of predicted vs observed values when those trained models were applied to the remaining 50% of the data (dark grey), to which it was naive, with means highlighted in black.

Non-significant correlations at the two-tailed criterion of p > 0.05 after FWE correction for multiple comparisons are underlined. The strongest relationships were evident for (i) disrupted lifestyle, which correlated positively with technology addiction and reward drive and negatively with self-security and conscientiousness; and (ii) health concerns, which correlated positively with stress from technology, technology addiction, reward drive and cognitive rigidity and negatively with self-security.

People who had been furloughed were less stressed and tired compared with healthcare workers, whereas those with loss of income reported more life disruption compared with those who had retained their jobs.

More selective associations were observed for particular disorders: elevated health worries in anxiety disorders and OCD and increased conflict at home in adults with ADHD 30, 31 . The pandemic outbreak for people with OCD may reinforce underlying health anxieties and serve to reinforce underlying belief systems; an initial study in OCD patients indeed reported worsening of symptom severity longitudinally following the outbreak of the pandemic 32 . Guidance to help management of OCD during the pandemic is available 33 . A previous survey of parents reported worsening of their children's ADHD symptoms during the pandemic 34 , which has been proposed to reflect the emotional dysregulation inherent to the disorder 30,35-37 .

A crucial aspect of these data is that, whereas certain conventional personality traits have been previously related to resilience, including during COVID-19 lockdown 39 , the roles of compulsivity and technology use have received very limited attention in this context. In part, this may be due to a historic lack of available, validated trans-diagnostic compulsivity instruments 40 .

We sought to maximise inclusivity through the high visibility to the general public of the BBC. Furthermore, the bias analysis showed only negligible scaled differences in mental health measures between those who did vs did not choose to complete the PD-GIS scale. The resultant sample compares favourably to bioresource-based and random sampling studies in terms of inclusivity of minority groups and age range. More importantly, stratified, formally representative population samples are often constrained to one or two measures of interest, including those deployed to date in the COVID-19 context. In contrast, our inferences are based on analysis models where broad psycho-socio-demographic variables are accounted for, this being enabled by unusually large sample size.

Participants could enrol for longitudinal follow-up, scheduled for 3, 6 and 12 months. People returning to the site outside of these time points were navigated to a different URL. On May 2, 2020, the questionnaire was augmentedin light of the COVID-19 pandemic-with an extended mood scale and an instrument comprising 47 items quantifying self-perceived effects on mood, behaviour and outlook (PD-GIS). PD-GIS specifically asked about changes due to the pandemic (increases and decreases). Questions regarding pre-existing psychiatric and neurological conditions, lockdown context, having the virus and free text fields were added. This coincided with further promotion via BBC2 Horizon and BBC Homepage.",

Participants with missing data were retained as some questions were contingent on others; therefore, observations per analysis vary with data availability. The questionnaire was organised into the following scales: demographics and lifestyle, online technology use, mood, personality, compulsive traits, and pandemic impact. Where appropriate, scales were summarised in the following steps. Agree-disagree and frequency items were filtered for missing data casewise within scale, converted to numeric, rank transformed to normality and subscale scores estimated using PCA. Components with eigenvalues >1 were varimax rotated and component scores estimated by regression. While there are other methods for determining factor fit, this is widely used in the literature and is convenient. PCAs are reported in Supplementary Figs. 12-16 and Supplementary  Tables 32-41 .",

To evaluate generalisability of the model and degree of overfit, a train-test pipeline was applied, whereby the model was trained by fitting the trait measures onto the scores for each individual PD-GIS component with 50% of the data, and the r value then estimated between predicted and true data when the trained model was applied to the same data, and the other 50% of the data, to which it was naive.

Significant correlations were evident between measures of self-perceived COVID-19 pandemic impact, as captured in the PD-GIS subscales, and the mood self-assessment items. Top right. Canonical correlation analysis confirmed this relationship in a multivariate manner, with 7 statistically significant correlation modes as evaluated using Bartlett's approximate chi-squared statistic for H(k)0 with Lawley's modification, the largest with canonical r = 0.56 and the last mode significant at p = 6.5e\u221226. These results show that the effects of the pandemic on daily life have a significant component in explaining individual differences in standard mental health assessment measures.
