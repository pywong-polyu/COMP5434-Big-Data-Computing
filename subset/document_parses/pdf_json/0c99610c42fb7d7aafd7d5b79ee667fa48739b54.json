Over 70 different common fabric combinations and masks were evaluated under steady state, forced convection air flux with pulsed aerosols that simulate forceful respiration. The aerosols contain fluorescent virus-like nanoparticles to track transmission through materials that greatly assist the accuracy of detection, thus avoiding artifacts including pore flooding and the loss of aerosol due to evaporation and droplet break-up. Effective materials comprise both absorbent, hydrophilic layers and barrier, hydrophobic layers. Although the hydrophobic layers can adhere virus-like nanoparticles, they may also repel droplets from adjacent absorbent layers and prevent wicking transport across the fabric system. Effective designs are noted with absorbent layers comprising terry cloth towel, quilting cotton and flannel. Effective designs are noted with barrier layers comprising non-woven polypropylene, polyester and polyaramid.",

            "text": "Comparative studies of common, household fabrics generally indicate these materials are more permeable than medical grade PPE and widely variable in their filtration efficiencies. For example, Rengasamy 18 provides caution that fabrics can exhibit a range of filtration efficiencies. Examples of sweatshirts, t-shirts, towels, and scarfs from different manufacturers were tested with polydisperse (75 \u00b1 20 nm) salt aerosols and 13 sizes of monodisperse salt aerosols (20 nm-1 \u00b5m) at face velocities of 5.5 and 16 cm/s. Particulate transmission through the materials was determined by measuring the particle count upstream and downstream of the filter media using a scanning mobility particle sizer. Fractional transmissions ranged from 40-90% for the polydisperse aerosol and 40-97% for the monodisperse aerosols at 5.5 cm/s. Davies 19 investigated the filtration performance of common household fabrics to remove airborne viruses and bacteria. Fabrics were exposed to aerosols containing either Bacillus atrophaeus (0.95-1.25 \u00b5m) or Bacteriophage MS2 (23 nm). Aerosols were delivered in a closed chamber at 30 L/min and particle counts were measured upstream and downstream of the filter media. Based on a combination of filtration efficiency and pressure drop, the highest performing fabrics were 100% cotton t-shirt and pillowcase. The surgical mask had a 96% mean filtration efficiency for the 1 \u00b5m particles and 90% for the 23 nm particles. In comparison, the 100% cotton t-shirt had a 69% mean filtration efficiency for the 1 \u00b5m particles and 51% for the 23 nm particles. The pillowcase had a 61% mean filtration efficiency for the 1 \u00b5m particles and 57% for the 23 nm particles. Hence these fabrics are far more permeable than N95 respirators. These investigations did not attempt to combine multiple types of fabric layers to achieve comparable performance as the NIOSH certified medical respirators and masks, such as the N95 respirators. Recently, Konda 20 studied several common fabrics such as cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, polyester blends with up to two layers. Cotton quilt and cotton/chiffon performed about as well as an N95 respirator at filtering saline aerosols. Although the methodology is in compliance with NIOSH 42 CFR Part 84 test protocol, the instruments are noted to have poorer counting efficiencies for particles smaller than about 300nm. Furthermore, unknown fractions of the aqueous aerosol particles are lost by evaporation as well as break-up into undetectable, smaller droplets. These aerosols did not contain virus nanoparticles that could be independently identified when transported through the materials. Blocking the transport of virus particles is a prime function of mask fabric.",

It remains well partitioned within the nanoparticle matrix of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid). Figure 2 is a scanning electron microscope image of a small cluster of primary nanoparticles. Most of the encapsulated nanoparticles have spheroidal shape with some shallow wrinkles. Wrinkles may be due to the sheer stress present during the formation of the core-shell structure. The measured primary particle sizes of the nanoparticles range between 10 and 200 nm, which is the same range as SARS-CoV-2 virus particles 17 , see Figure S1 . Zeta potential measurements indicate neutral surface charge over six decades of concentration, see Figure S2 This result is independent of the aerosol pressure that could be applied. Similar pore flooding can occur in salt solution aerosol testing. Nanoparticle transmission through porous materials begins to occur without pore flooding as the steady-state volumetric flow rate of air exceeds the incident volumetric flow rate of aqueous aerosol. Partial flooding decreases the effective material porosity and leads to exaggerated filtration efficiency. In practical terms dense fabric masks do not transmit nanoparticles into a mask, such as virus particles, without active respiration or permeating air convection.",

            "text": "The transmission measurement of nanoparticles through mask materials is based on test conditions that emulate ASTM methods, enable high precision and repeatability, and reproduce sensibly physiological conditions. The rate of human ventilation at rest is nominally 6 L/min 21 and can increase several-fold upon active exertion. Our testing establishes a baseline steady-state air flow of 14 L/min through each test material. Each test is subjected to a total threat of 2 mL aqueous solution containing the fluorescent virus-like nanoparticles at 0.5 mg/mL. This total threat volume is delivered by 26 pulses of aerosol, each lasting one second. The duration and overpressure of the pulses emulates forceful expiration, i.e. a spray resulting from a sneeze, cough or speech from an infected individual. The steady-state air flow being in excess of restful ventilation replicates a slightly elevated ventilation rate as a safety margin, prevents pore flooding, and enables improved statistical repeatability in the nanoparticle count measurements. The pulsed aerosol droplets are polydisperse in size and closely match the size range from forceful expiration. Nanoparticles transmitted through the test material are collected at a distance of 1 mm on a glass slide. The gas flow and slide placement configure the system to be well within the estimated collection regime, i.e. particle capture limit. 22 After a nanoparticle collides with the glass, the rebounded kinetic energy is insufficient to escape the attractive potential energy. Specific details about the aerosol transmission testing are described in the Methods Section, also see Figure 1 . Over 70 different common material arrays were evaluated under steady-state air permeation against pulsed aerosols that simulate forceful expiration. A list of materials is provided in the Supporting Information, see Table S1 . Table 1 summarizes our most notable transmission results and comparative statistics. Data for the 5-layer N95 respirator by 3M\u2122 are provided in the first row. This is the standard PPE recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) when caring for SARS-CoV-2 patients undergoing an aerosolizing procedure. Several 30 mm diameter samples were cut from around the respirator. The fractional transmission is the nanoparticle count transmitted through the material, normalized by the incident nanoparticle count. The fractional transmission standard deviation across all sampled locations exceeds the typical standard deviation for the nanoparticle counting measurement. This suggests that the filtration efficiency is dependent on the location of the mask. This is reasonable for a stack of non-woven layers that are pressed heterogeneously into a shape comprising highly varying curvature and thickness. Nonetheless the overall average and standard deviation of nanoparticle counts over 69 independent measurements are provided across the entire respirator.",

Specifically, Sheldon G mask with cellulose filter and combination masks, combining two outer layers of white denim with two inner layers of OLY-FUN nonwoven polypropylene and two-layer of Kona quilting cotton with four layers of OLY-FUN exhibit fractional transmissions of 0.16 \u00b1 0.06 ppt, 0.31 \u00b1 0.07 ppt, and 0.40 \u00b1 0.18 ppt, respectively. These mask designs achieve 72%, 55%, and 28% lower fractional transmission than the 5-layer N95 respirator, respectively. Effective materials comprise both absorbent, hydrophilic layers and barrier, hydrophobic layers. Although the hydrophobic layers can adhere virus-like nanoparticles, they may also repel droplets from adjacent absorbent layers and prevent wicking transport. High fiber density and tortuosity increases the probability of collision with aerosol droplets. Effective designs are noted with absorbent layers comprising terry cloth towel, quilting cotton and flannel. For example, two layers of terry cloth, two layers of white flannel, and four layers of Kona quilting cotton exhibit fractional transmissions of 0.50 \u00b1 0.12, 0.51 \u00b1 0.24, and 0.62 \u00b1 0.17, respectively. These commonly available mask materials exhibit fractional transmissions within 10% of the five-layer N95 respirator. Effective designs are noted with barrier layers comprising OLY-FUN (nonwoven polypropylene), lab coat (polyester/polyaramid), cotton coated with spray-on fabric protector as well as traditional synthetic aliphatic and aromatic polymer fibers. Although some terry cloth and cotton multi-layers are effective alone, inclusion of an additional hydrophobic repelling layer is recommended to prevent wicking transport for higher volume threats. Sole use of denim is not effective-in general the yarn bundles are very dense but spaced with wide interweave gaps to promote breathability in jeans. This is demonstrated by high fractional transmission by two layers each of 4oz light weight blue denim, 7oz midweight blue denim, and 11oz heavy weight stretch black denim of 3.91 \u00b1 1.82 ppt, 7.61 \u00b1 0.63 ppt, and 9.43 \u00b1 0.99 ppt, respectively. The two-layer denims exhibit 698%, 1359%, and 1684% higher fractional transmission than the 5-layer N95 respirator, respectively. The fusible polyesters considered are also highly porous. Several additional layered systems exhibit fractional transmission statistically equivalent to the duckbill surgical mask. These may be effective in conjunction with additional safeguards, such as social distancing, and smaller threat volumes. ",

Considering the results of this work and prior work, recommended mask designs include those multi-layered combinations in Table 1 that exhibit transmission either equivalent or lower than the transmission offered by 5-layer N95 masks. It is critical that the materials edges conform snugly to the face to prevent aerosol from entering gaps between the face and mask. The mask must not enable viral imbibition by the lips, tongue and saliva. Ideally the mask does not contact the lips, or there is at least one hydrophobic layer fabric in contact with the face, so aerosol trapped from the exterior does not wick through the mask and become transported by the mouth. Since aerosol transport through a mask is predicated on forced convection air flux, it is recommended that individuals wearing masks reduce inhalation intensity when placed in contact of an unsafe aerosol.",

Transport of nanoparticles in aqueous aerosol is predicated on forced convection air flux. For example, placing the aerosolizer jet in direct contact with the surface of an N95 respirator at 20 kPa gauge pressure results in instantaneous surface accumulation of water. No nanoparticles were detected on the opposite side of the respirator. This is condition occurred for all materials and masks, except for the most open, highly porous weaves. Direct aerosol jetting onto the densely woven fabrics exhibits the same surface flooding result. Pore flooding traps nanoparticles, preventing transmission through the material.",

A Master air compressor TC-20 pressurizes the solution to 20 kPa. The pressurized solution is emitted from the Master airbrush G22 as an aerosol due to shearing interactions at the airbrush tip with an opening diameter of 345 \u00b5m. For each trial, 2 mL nanoparticle solution is emitted from the airbrush in bursts with a duration of one second every five seconds until the airbrush fluid tank is depleted. The aerosol is released into a 1L vacuum filter reservoir sealed over a glass bottle during a steady state 14 L/min volumetric flow of air set using Sho-Rate rotameter #012. The vacuum filter is sealed so that the volumetric flow rate is approximately uniform within the test apparatus, and it is controlled so that the contained fluids exhibit laminar flow (Re = 1900 < 2000). The velocity of the aerosol at the nozzle facing the material samples estimated to be 297 cm/s. For each material a 30 mm diameter sample is cut and held tightly with an O-ring over a nozzle with an inner diameter of 10 mm. The material samples are held taut, and all samples consisting of layered materials are necessarily held without spacing between adjacent layers. As shown in Figure S3, a 0.5\" x 0.5\" glass slide is positioned 1 mm from the material sample to collect aerosol and droplets that are transmitted. A circle drawn on the opposite face of the glass slide indicates the position of the slide that aligns with the center of the material sample, and the aerosol that accumulates on the side facing the sample is analyzed using fluorescence microscopy.",
