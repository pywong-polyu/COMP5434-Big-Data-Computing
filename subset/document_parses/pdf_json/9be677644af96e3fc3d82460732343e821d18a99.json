            "text": "Background On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 outbreak as a new pandemic. In the meantime, plastic surgeons postponed their appointments due to the fair and rational allocation of medical supplies. These limitations made all junior and senior residents perform operations only on traumatic patients rather than those needing reconstructive procedures. This study aims to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on plastic surgery training programs in Iran. Also, the number of canceled surgeries will be determined to see the effects of the pandemic on the patients. Methods This retrospective case study considers a six-month timeframe in two consecutive years before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, the researchers evaluated the number of surgeries, types of procedures, age distribution, and gender distribution. The training program data of plastic surgery residents were collected from their logbooks and then analyzed in IBM SPSS Statistics 26. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05 at a 95% confidence level. Results The total number of surgeries decreased by 23.5% after the COVID-19 outbreak (p < 0.05). There was a 29.9% reduction in trauma cases, -78.9% in aesthetic surgeries, -17.7% in reconstructive surgeries, -51.8% in craniofacial surgeries, and -59.5%in microscopic surgeries for each resident. Conclusions This study provides an insight into the severity of the pandemic effects on the plastic surgery training programs and the patients. The reduced number of surgeries led to a depletion in surgical skills training. These effects will not wear off immediately after the pandemic; therefore, it is necessary to observe whether the pandemic will have any lasting effects on this subspecialty. Level of evidence: Level IV, risk/prognostic study",

            "text": "Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China, reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia caused by a novel virus called SARS-CoV2 on December 31, 2019 [1] . The affected patients manifested a wide range of symptoms from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory syndrome and acute thromboembolic diseases. On March 11, 2020 , the WHO announced the COVID19 outbreak as a new pandemic [2] . Ever since, all countries worldwide have undergone lockdowns of varying durations and limitations. Most medical subspecialties adjusted their activities to face this new situation, considering ethical principles and values [3] . In the meantime, plastic surgeons have postponed their appointments due to the fair and rational allocation of medical supplies. In Iran, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported on February 19, 2020. According to Iranian health authorities, there were 59,899 COVID-19 deaths in Iran with more than 1,615,184 confirmed active cases until February 20, 2021. After the first case was diagnosed in Iran, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education decided to cancel all elective surgeries for about a month. Nearly two and a half months later, the Iranian government lifted the limitations and allowed people to go back to work [4] including a limited number of elective surgeries under specific conditions. All these on and off limitations during the last year affected patients as well as health organizations worldwide [5] . Postponing non-delayable surgeries may harm the patient health and life quality [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, a very long waiting list is now being made for the foreseeable future in which patients should be prioritized with respect to their clinical status. This prioritization process also delays the surgeries of some patients with benign but potentially malignant situations.",

This makes residents show competence in performing a wide range of index operating procedures, being involved in teaching, and improving their abilities to manage multiple situations and leadership roles [9] . With the advent of SARS-CoV2 in the late 2019, Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education decided to cancel and postpone elective surgeries, something which played a significant role in aesthetic and reconstructive surgeries.

However, there are now only three plastic and reconstructive surgery subspecialty hospitals in Tehran which admit patients from all over Iran for medical care. Moreover, in other big cities of Iran, there are small plastic surgery wards that cannot provide wide ranges of treatment due to the lack of resources. As a result, those three subspecialty hospitals are considered the main centres for treating plastic surgery patients. One of these centres, in which this study was conducted, is panzdah-e Khordad Teaching Hospital. Annually, 5 or 6 general surgeons start their plastic surgery residency programs in this hospital. Being a resident in this tertiary referral centre in a country like Iran and operating on hundreds of cases will make very successful surgeons.

Elective surgeries were forbidden for several months in the post-pandemic timeframe, whereas surgeons could only perform non-delayable surgeries in other months. As discussed earlier, there are only three plastic surgery subspecialty hospitals in Iran as well as some plastic surgery wards of the large cities which suffer from lack of resources. This uneven distribution makes the three hospitals the main plastic surgery centres that admit a plethora of patients either for traumatic surgeries or elective ones. Thus, even with on and off limitations, there has been a significant number of operations during the pandemic. The total number of surgeries decreased by 23.5% during the post-pandemic period (p < 0.05). These limitations have also affected the residency training programs. The number of patients has reached half and below that of the last year in plastic, craniofacial, and microscopic surgeries. In other words, residents had half the chance to improve their skills in this field when their time was flying. Although traumatic surgeries lasted during the post-pandemic period, there was a 29.9% reduction in every resident's cases. In reconstructive surgeries, there was an 8.7% decrease in the total number of cases which caused a 17.7% reduction in resident cases. The reduced number of surgeries would lead to a depletion in surgical skills training, and reduced discussion contents in morning meetings and teaching conferences. Furthermore, if residents fail to complete their logbooks by the graduation time, they will miss their board certification exams. These effects will not [13] . In India, Sangeeta Thakurani et al. studied this specialty during the pandemic. They concluded that the escalating surge of plastic surgery cases in India was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and that it would take a long time and serious actions to return to normalcy [14] . There are also several studies addressing the effects of this pandemic on variable specialties. In nearly all of them, residency training programs have been reported to be the most affected area [15] [16] [17] . The use of telemedicine has increased during this pandemic; however, some countries suffer from the lack of required infrastructures.",

Suspicious patients are led to the grey ward in which a physician will examine them for clinical evaluation. An operating theatre then is prepared for the suspicious patients who need emergency surgeries. The hospital also employs educated personnel who will provide sufficient care for these patients both before and after their operations. They are also provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) including coveralls (a one-piece suit), masks, and goggles. The suspicious patients with non-emergency situations would be referred to a COVID-19 centre for further evaluation. Their surgical operations would be scheduled if the COVID-19 centre grants the permission. In elective surgeries, patients are screened with PCR tests. Surgeries are canceled in positive patients. Despite the strict precautions for prevention, one-third of operating theatre personnel were infected during the post-pandemic period.",

There are several conditions in which there is a golden opportunity for an intervention which can yield good outcomes. The lockdown may cause a waste of time for these patients. In addition, a very long waiting list is made for the post-pandemic period when patients must be prioritized in terms of their clinical conditions. This means a longer postponement for some patients, something which might be dangerous and affect their quality of life [6] [7] [8] . According to Negopdiev et al., it is also essential to increase the workload to shorten the time required to return to normalcy. They discussed a global estimation of elective surgery cancellation and estimated whether countries would increase their surgery cases by 20%. They also stated that it would take nearly 45 weeks to return to normal workloads and waiting lists [18] .",

Making these changes in teaching hospitals can slightly increase the admission rates during the pandemic.
