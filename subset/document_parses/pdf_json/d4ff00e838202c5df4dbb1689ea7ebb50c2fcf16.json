Its is clinically characterized by the sudden onset of excruciating pain in the involved site-usually the leg esp. if associated with abdominal involvement. The swelling is rapidly progressive, associated with purplish/ bronze discoloration and blister formation-usually hemorrhagic. Involvement of underlying muscle is always more extensive than the evident skin involvement. The blister serosanguinous fluid will contain GPR, but inflammatory cells are infrequent [4] . Pathology: there is cell lysis and gas formation in connective tissue and muscle with minimal inflammation [4] . The diagnosis of clostridial myonecrosis requires a high index of suspicion, since the infection spreads rapidly and death may occur within 24-48 h. Gram stain of a bulla allows for a timely diagnosis. Anaerobic cultures should be sent to determine appropriate antibiotic use. Imaging with X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan can demonstrate soft tissue gas (a late finding) and help determine the extent of infection [3] . (b) Spreading cellulitis with clostridial septicemia is a fulminant infection in neutropenic patients. A small area of purplish discoloration develops, often on the flank or abdominal wall. The lesion will expand rapidly over several hours, and more lesions appear in other areas. As it progresses, the lesions turn into brownish to blackish color with blister formation and crepitation. Clostridium can be captured in the fluid, but without inflammatory cells [4] . Clostridium septicum has been associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis), which typically is a fulminant infection of the intestines in neutropenic patients [18] .",

            "text": "Disseminated candidiasis can occur in neutropenic and non-neutropenic populations. The portal of entry is typically via gastrointestinal translocation or introduction from a central line. In patients with hematologic malignancies and stem-cell transplantation, non-albicans species predominate including C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . In solid tumors, approximately half of disseminated can- didiasis is secondary to C. albicans [32] . The epidemiology of these infections is likely related to the choice of fungal prophylaxis and resistance patterns of nonalbicans species [34] . The frequency of cutaneous manifestations in the setting of candidemia is reported to occur in 11-44% of cases [34] . The typical skin lesions are 5-10 mm pink papules, which rarely lead to eschar formation or skin necrosis. There are often numerous papules involving the trunk and proximal extremities [30] . Some lesions may be purpuric, especially if thrombocytopenia is also present [34] . Mortality associated with candidemia has been reported to be over 50%, therefore prompt recognition of skin lesions and initiation of empiric treatment is important [35] . Diagnostics can be challenging, positive blood cultures occur in less than 50% of the cases. It is important to consider obtaining tissue for histopathology and culture or using novel non-culture diagnostics. Histology typically shows fungal elements including pseudohyphae, hyphae and yeast within the dermis or blood vessels [34] . An echinocandin such as micafungin is recommended as empiric treatment in most patients [31] (Fig. 6 ).",

Blood cultures are typically negative in disseminated infection therefore it is recommended to obtain tissue biopsy with culture and histopathology. Skin manifestations are similar to Fusarium infections. Primary or localized lesions can present as cellulitis with focal erythema and swelling that can progress leading to the formation of bullae, necrotic ulcers and eschars. Invasive fungal sinusitis secondary to Aspergillus sp. can also extend to the skin leading to facial cellulitis; this is covered in further detail in the chapter about fungal infections.

Nikolsky sign is often positive. Many patients will also have mucosal involvement [72] . The two conditions are distinguished from each other based on body surface involvement; SJS involves <10% and TEN involves >30% with an overlap of disease characterization between 10-30% [71] . Many drugs have been linked to the development of SJS or TEN, particularly antibiotics. Sulfonamide antibiotics are most commonly associated with SJS or TEN however all antibiotics should be considered as an etiology [71, 73] (Figs. 12 and 13 ).",

Toxic erythema of chemotherapy presents with painful erythema and edema which can be present on the hands and feet or intertriginous areas. It is most commonly associated with methotrexate, cytarabine, anthracyclines, 5-fluorouracil, and taxanes [58] . Multikinase inhibitors such as sorafenib can cause a hand-foot-skin reaction which is characterized by painful hyperkeratotic plaques which develop in areas of friction such as the fingertips and joints [58, 74] . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors including imatinib or dasatinib are also commonly associated with cutaneous reactions which can include a maculopapular rash and facial edema [58, 75] . ",
