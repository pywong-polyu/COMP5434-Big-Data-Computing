In 2018, we initiated a practice (210 minutes) to teach writing for public health in our series of health communication practices. Students from other graduate schools (eg, health sciences and nursing) have also taken our course, meaning about 40 students attend the lecture and practice each year. Our program covers: the importance of audience awareness and the ability to take the perspective of lay audience readers 7,8 ; the importance of writing fluent materials that are easy to read and understand for lay audiences 6 ; and basic writing components such as goal setting, generating ideas, structuring, writing, and revising. 9 We emphasize enhancing students' ability to write to inform, and their ability to influence and encourage behavior change in lay audiences. Therefore, we introduced tactics such as using narratives (eg, case stories or story examples of patients to support arguments offered by public health professionals), 10,11 the heuristic rule of social norms that \"if many others are doing it, it must be good\" (eg, 4 out of 5 people are vaccinated), 12,13 and implementation intentions (ie, furnishing the goal intention with an \"ifthen\" plan that specifies when, where, and how the person will instigate responses that promote goal realization). [14] [15] [16] In our lecture and practice each year, we ask students to write health materials that encourage recipients to perform health behaviors as work assignments. These assignments use the writing-to-learn approach, which helps students process and integrate new information into their understanding through short, low-stakes writing assignments. 17,18 For students, writing materials to encourage behavior change in lay audiences is a different task from writing assignments (eg, research protocols and academic papers) that are assessed and graded in the School of Public Health. The writing-to-learn approach helps students to explore ideas about messages to encourage behavior change in lay audiences, synthesize the knowledge they acquired in our program with their ideas, and discover the possibility of writing persuasive materials with innovative ideas.",

After students finish drafting these materials, their drafts are shared with peers to generate discussion on the program content. From 2016 to 2019 in our practice, groups of about 4 students were asked to create a draft for a poster regarding a public health topic on A1 size paper for a group assignment. However, in 2020, COVID-19 restrictions meant that the program was conducted online using a web-based conferencing system. Therefore, we asked students to individually create an A4 size draft poster to encourage lay audiences to adopt preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic using Microsoft PowerPoint (Redmond, Washington, United States).

In the context of health communication, the \"tappers\" are health professionals and the \"listeners\" are lay audiences. The curse of knowledge indicates that health professionals may achieve poor communication results if they cannot imagine the mind of lay audiences, and underestimate the difficulties lay audiences face. 22 As shown in the aforementioned studies 4,5 and the student-produced work, health professionals often give directions to lay audiences with complex information using technical terms and statistics that are difficult for lay audiences to read and understand. This curse of knowledge of health professionals may make it difficult for lay audiences to become sufficiently interested in the information provided or make recommended behavior changes.",

One reason for this may be the tradition of the patient-doctor relationship in Japan that has remnants of the paternalism of passive patients and dominant doctors. 23 Debiasing the curse of knowledge among students will be the main target of our writing education. For future practices, regarding the message creation (ie, what is being said), getting feedback on students' drafts from their intended audience may make it easier for students to be aware of and debiase their curse of knowledge and revise their drafts appropriately. 7, 24 In terms of the delivery (ie, how it is being said), tools such as the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool 25 and the CDC clear communication index 26 make several clear recommendations for health professionals creating written health materials. These recommendations include revising technical language into everyday language, shortening long sentences, and adding informative headers to each section. Having students use such tools to evaluate their drafts may also make it easier for them to debiase their curse of knowledge and make appropriate revisions.",

We must study the metacognitive processes of skillful writers of health materials, and how they overcome their curse of knowledge. In addition, we must consider effective interventions involving metacognitive control to debiase the curse of knowledge when writing health materials. The wealth of previous studies on writing research in educational psychology may be helpful to achieve this. 27 However, the nature of public health writing means that experts inform and influence non-experts and encourage certain behaviors. This characteristic makes writing for public health and teaching writing difficult. Much effort is needed in this arena, and we are just getting started.",
