            "text": "Common viral causes of respiratory tract infections in humans are influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PiV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (HAdV), rhinovirus (HRV), bocavirus (HBoV), and coronavirus (HCoV). [1] [2] [3] Most of these viruses demonstrate seasonal patterns of circulation, particularly in temperate regions. 1, 4 During the development of this systematic review, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became a substantial pandemic; however, the long-term impact and whether this virus becomes a seasonal infectious disease is yet to be understood. 5 Real-time PCR is increasingly used to detect and identify respiratory pathogens. The PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value represents the number of amplification cycles required for amplification of the amplicon to exceed a basal fluorescence threshold level. It is inversely related to the amount of copies of the target region in the sample, meaning that a low Ct value corresponds with a high pathogen load. However, the use of Ct values as a proxy of genomic load is influenced by the assay (e.g. sample volume, chemical conditions and single copy or multi-copy region design) and factors within the sample (e.g. quality of sample, and inhibitors) that impact amplification efficiency. The absence of a standard curve in most assays means correction of most of these limitations is not possible. However, Ct values still provide semi-quantitative information. Results of diagnostic tests are usually reported as a positive or negative result using a specified cut-off, based on Ct value or integrated by an automatic algorithm interpreting different parameters of the potential amplification. Caution should be noted when interpreting Ct values, as they are an integer scale that represents a log result measurement of a log biological process.",

Several studies have attempted to elucidate the clinical utility of Ct values, including contradictory reports that Ct values are associated with disease severity, ICU admission and length of hospital stay (LOS). [6] [7] [8] Ct values may also have utility in clarifying diagnostic uncertainty when several respiratory pathogens are identified, particularly when using multiplex PCR respiratory panels. 9, 10 Notably, the unprecedented challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic have raised the level of interest in the clinical and diagnostic utility of Ct values, particularly whether rapid understanding of Ct values could be leveraged as an early measure of disease severity or utilized to guide patient management or public health decisions. [11] [12] [13] [14] A previous systematic review on the utility of Ct values in the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that lower Ct values are potentially associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19, and correlate with increased probability of progression to severe disease, increased disease severity, increased mortality and presence of biochemical and haematological markers. 14 Furthermore, observed changes in population distributions of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values can potentially improve estimates of an epidemic's trajectory, enabling real-time outbreak management and response. 15 This systematic review assesses the global medical literature for associations between Ct values of respiratory pathogens and clinical presentation or outcomes and therefore, whether they could provide valuable information to clinicians for more tailored decisionmaking. This systematic review does not include SARS-CoV-2 because the searches were carried out before COVID-19 and the literature on the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 Ct values and clinically relevant outcomes is still maturing. 14 ",

The majority (18/33, 55%) of studies were clearly identifiable as being in a hospital setting, and a large percentage of studies (15/33, 45%) were solely in children. There was wide variation across the studies with regards to sampling, sample handling and analysis. Gaps in reported methodology were identified in 12/31 (39%) studies; excluding two studies that were congress abstracts only (Table S2) .

In a study by Spencer et al. 23 in patients 3 years old (n = 1660 influenza A; n = 806 influenza B), low Ct values (25) compared with high Ct values (30) were associated with moderate to high self-rated illness severity for influenza A and to a lesser extent with influenza B.

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically assess and consolidate available evidence on associations between respiratory virus Ct values and clinical presentation or outcomes. Respiratory viruses were more commonly studied than bacterial infections, and among respiratory viruses, influenza, HRV and RSV were the most studied. Across all studies included, there was contradictory evidence regarding the association between Ct value and clinical presentation or outcomes. However, for some pathogens, there are trends that warrant further investigation. In studies of RSV, several studies reported associations between low Ct values and clinically relevant outcomes, including hospitalization, 8, 18 ICU requirement and LOS, 7 and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 6 However, other studies of RSV viral load (Ct values not reported, hence not eligible for inclusion in this review) have failed to identify associations with disease severity or ICU admission. 46, 47 Among HRV studies, despite numerous studies showing no associations, the three studies with cohorts >100 patients reported significant associations between low Ct values and symptom severity and hospital LOS. 6, 16, 29 A similar observation can be made with HBoV studies, particularly as other studies of HBoV viral load (Ct values not reported, hence not eligible for inclusion in this review) have shown significant associations with disease severity. 48, 49 Although few HCoV studies showed significant associations, the two studies identified for MERS-CoV suggest low Ct values are associated with disease severity and transmissibility, 17, 35 in line with reports of viral load studies for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. 14, 50 Interestingly, influenza studies gave conflicting reports for associations between Ct values and hospitalization or ICU admission. However, the largest influenza study identified (Spencer et al. 23 ) reported that patients with low Ct values were significantly more likely to self-report moderate to high disease severity and fever/feverishness. A similar observation was made in a study of influenza A viral load (Ct values not reported, hence not eligible for inclusion in this review) where patients with pneumonia had higher copies/mL than those with upper RTIs. 51 When interpreting the studies presented in this literature review, consideration must be given to various factors. 8, 52, 53 Many of the studies included patients in hospital settings, which potentially corresponds to greater disease severity and a less-striking difference in viral load. Indeed, studies of RSV and PiV in this review reported significantly lower Ct values for paediatric inpatients versus outpatients or controls. 8, 18 Considering the fact that many studies identified significantly lower Ct values in single versus co-infections, the lack of clarity in studies as to whether reports are sole infections has potential implications. Future studies investigating Ct values should consider the quantification of all pathogens present to obtain more detailed and consistent information on the impact of co-infections. The use Clearly defined methodology (see Table S2 ) (1) (2) (3) (4) There is evidence that genomic load in respiratory infections is affected by age and comorbidities. 23, 41, 46, 54 It is therefore important to consider the age and comorbidity profile of each of the studies when making comparisons, and future studies should consider adjusting comparisons to account for the impact of age and comorbidities.",

Study procedures varied widely between studies. Many studies had gaps in reported methods relating to sampling, sample handling and analysis, and most studies did not mention the use of standardized protocols and procedures; therefore within-study variability may have limited the ability to detect associations. Consistent approaches to standardize a given workflow (e.g. sample collection, pre-treatment, realtime PCR methodology) should be implemented to utilize Ct values as a proxy of genomic load linked to a given methodology. Alternatively, normalized genomic load/copies in the test media, using reference material or international standards when available, should be attempted, 55 and cross study comparisons where this is not clear should be avoided without normalization. Importantly, raw Ct values across studies should not be interpreted as a unit of genomic load as standard curves are needed to calculate the link between Ct values and genomic load in any given study. 52 Furthermore, trends in Ct values reported in many studies, including those within this review, are population data and caution should be taken if applying this to individual patients.

The protocol was restricted to consideration only of articles referring to Ct values as a measure of genomic load, meaning numerous studies that define genomic load other than using Ct values were excluded. Furthermore, it is inevitable that some studies investigating Ct values as secondary or post-hoc analyses were missed in the screening process. However, considering no aggregated outcomes were generated in this review, and no definitive conclusions made, the absence of these studies is unlikely to be a major consideration. Additionally, the high heterogeneity of reported outcomes meant it was not possible to conduct aggregated/meta-analyses, reducing the clinical utility of this review. A single reviewer conducted the data extraction and a second reviewer checked all the data points. Whilst this approach is generally accepted as adequate, it is acknowledged the optimal approach is double independent reviewer data extraction with a third reviewer resolving any discrepancies. However, given the large number of studies and outcomes identified, this was a pragmatic approach to ensure feasibility. Despite these limitations, the studies included provide insights into the potential clinical utility of respiratory pathogen Ct values, and future areas of research.",

However, unlike in patients with HRV, there was no significant difference in viral load between severe and very severe pneumonia. Houben et al.30 also reported correlation between Ct values and disease severity, which was more pronounced in patients with RSV as the sole infection.Two studies (Wishaupt et al.8 and Fuller et al. 18 ) investigated the association of Ct value with hospital admission, both of studies reported significantly lower median Ct values in hospitalized versus non-hospitalized paediatric patients. In Fuller et al., 18 no association was observed in patients 5 years old. Three studies investigated association of Ct value with LOS. In the study by Hasegawa et al., 7 a multivariable model indicated the risk of 3 days LOS was significantly higher in groups with intermediate (Ct 20.8-24.2) or high (Ct <20.8) viral loads, compared with low viral loads (Ct 24.3); OR 1.43 (95% CI, 1.20-1.69) and OR 1.58 (95% CI, 1.29-1.94), respectively, P < 0.001.
