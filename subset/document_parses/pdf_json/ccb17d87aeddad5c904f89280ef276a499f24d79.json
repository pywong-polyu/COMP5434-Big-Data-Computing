Nasal breath was investigated in 24 consecutive patients suspected of having Influenza-A-infection by MCC-IMS. In 14 Influenza-A-infected patients, infection was proven by PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Ten patients with negative PCR diagnosis served as controls. For picking up relevant VOCs in MCC-IMS spectra, software based on cluster analysis followed by multivariate statistical analysis was applied. With only four VOCs canonical discriminant analysis was able to distinguish Influenza-A-infected patients from PCR-negative patients with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This present proof-of-concept-study yields encouraging results showing a rapid diagnosis of viral infections in nasal breath within 5 minutes by MCC-IMS. The next step is to validate the results with a greater number of patients with Influenza-A-infection as well as other viral diseases.",

The breath sample was drawn into the sampling loop using an internal pump with a flow rate of 200 milliliter per minute. In the sampling loop the collected sample was pre-separated by isothermally heated multicapillary gas chromatography column (60\u00b0C) into single analytes, which finally entered the IMS unit based on their retention times. In the IMS unit the analytes were ionized by beta radiation with a tritium source (99 MBq). Afterwards the generated ions were accelerated in a 50-mm-long driftube under the influence of an electric field (400 V/cm) towards the detector which is also tempered to 60\u00b0C. On their drift way they collide with air molecules from the drift gas (400 ml/min) flowing in the opposite direction getting separated depending on their ion mobilities and detected by the collector electrode sampled every 10\u00b5s. IMS measurements were performed in positive ionization mode. The received IMS spectra were stored internally in the device and later analyzed offline.",
