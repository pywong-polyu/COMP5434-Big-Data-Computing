Over 85% of these deaths originate in low-income/developing countries in Asia and Africa. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the development of vaccines that avoid the use of \"living\" viruses and furthermore, vaccines that have viral antigens capable of generating powerful heterotypic responses. Our strategy is based on the expression of the fusion of the anti-DEC205 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) coupled by an OLLAS tag to a viral protein (VP6) of Rotavirus in Nicotiana plants. It was possible to express transiently in N. benthamiana and N. sylvestris a recombinant protein consisting of the single chain variable fragment linked by an OLLAS tag to the VP6 protein. The presence of the recombinant protein, which had a molecular weight of approximately 75 kDa, was confirmed by immunodetection, in both plant species and in both cellular compartments (cytoplasm and apoplast) where it was expressed. In addition, the recombinant protein was modeled, and it was observed that some epitopes of interest are exposed on the surface, which could favor their immunogenic response.",

The genus RV belongs to the family Reoviridae, they are non-enveloped viruses that are approximately 100 nm in diameter. The virion is composed of three layers of proteins that encompass the viral genome, which consists of eleven segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and codes for six structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6 and VP7) and six non-structural ones [1, 2] . The inner layer of the virion is formed by 60 dimers of the VP2 protein and small amounts of RNA polymerase (VP1) and guanyltransferase (VP3), which together form the core of the virus. Around the core is a second intermediate layer composed of 260 trimers of the most abundant structural protein of the virion (VP6) forming a double-layer particle. The outermost layer is made up of two VP7 and VP4 proteins. The smooth surface of the virus is composed of 780 copies of the VP7 glycoprotein organized in the form of trimers, while 60 spicules formed by VP4 project outward from the viral surface [3, 4] .",

            "text": "To date, two attenuated RV vaccines have been authorized to be applied worldwide (Rotarix, GSK and Rotateq, Merck). Rotarix is composed of a human RV strain and RotaTeq is composed of five human-bovine recombinant RV strains [5, 6] . However, the protection induced by these vaccines against gastroenteritis was 80% in high-and middle-income countries, while it was only 39% and 70% in some low-income countries in Africa and Asia [5, 6] . For these reasons, it is necessary to study new platforms for the expression and production of recombinant RV proteins that can serve as vaccines based on \"non-living\" viruses that induce broadly heterotypic protection based on highly conserved antigens. On the other hand, with the application of modern biotechnology and the development of genetic transformation, the necessary foundations were laid for the use of plants as safe, effective, and affordable alternative systems to produce a wide variety of recombinant proteins of pharmaceutical interest, enzymes, antibodies, and hormones [7, 8] . Recombinant proteins can be produced in plants by stable genetic transformation or transient expression. Proteins generated by transient expression (magnifection) have been shown to have benefits, as human pathogens are not involved, sterility is not required during production, expression is rapid and high level for use in clinical trials for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval [9, 10] . However, no system is totally optimal for the expression of any recombinant protein in plants, due to the physical characteristics and the therapeutic application of each product [7] .",

            "text": "Some research groups have worked to obtain transgenic plants that express some proteins that make up the RV capsid, with the aim of developing a possible oral or nasal vaccine in a plant system. The VP6 protein was expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves in potato virus X (PVX) fused to the virus capsid or free. The VP6 produced in plants was mixed in vitro with the VP2 protein produced in baculovirus, both proteins were assembled into virus-like icosahedral particles (VLP) [11] . The assembly of VP6 in VLP suggests that possible post-translational modifications in the plant do not affect the ability of the protein to assemble. In addition, the production of specific antibodies against VP6 was observed after the first 15 days of the first inoculation in mice with total protein extracts expressing the antigen, indicating that the protein retains the property of being highly immunogenic by the parenteral route [12] . In another study, VP7 and VP6 were expressed in potato and it was shown that VP6 retained the property of forming trimers such as the native protein [13] . On the other hand, VP6 has been expressed with other proteins that are part of the capsid of the virus in tomatoes and tobacco [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . All this background shows that plants can produce recombinant antigens that retain their immunogenic epitopes [15, 19, 20] .",

The expression vector for plants of deconstructed virus pICH31070-scFv-anti-DEC205-OLLAS-VP6 was constructed by restriction ligation. The resulting plasmid was used to transform E. coli (DH5\u03b1), using the method described by Sharma and Schmike [22] ; the transformation was performed with an Easyject Optima electroporator (Equibio, England). Recombinant clones were analyzed by restriction enzymes and confirmed by sequencing. Vectors were introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101) by electroporation. For the expression of the recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm and apoplast, the vector pICH15879 [23] and pICH20155 [24] were used, respectively; these vectors were supplemented with the vectors pICH31070-scFv-anti-DEC205-OLLAS-VP6 or pICH7410-GFP and the integrase module (pICH14011) [24] and untransformed Nicotiana plants were used as negative controls [10] .",

With the PDB format obtained from the Phyre2 program, protein modeling was performed using the PyMOL program. As can be seen (Fig. 6A) in the modeling obtained, the recombinant protein consists mostly of \u03b2 sheets, in the case of the VP6 protein it consists of \u03b1 helices and \u03b2 sheets highlighting in two different colors (\u03b2 sheets in magenta color and the \u03b1 helices in blue color). In addition, the fusion regions between the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region of the antibody are highlighted, in this case the adapter (Gly 4 Ser) 3 (green color), and the fusion between the scFvanti-DEC205 antibody and the VP6 protein through the OLLAS tag (yellow color) (Fig. 6B) . Finally, one of the most important domains and epitopes of the recombinant protein stands out: the OLLAS tag and the domain of residue 332-397 of the VP6 protein (red color), the OLLAS tag and the domain of residue 332-397 are exposed on the surface of the protein, in the case of the VP6 protein the domain is of great importance since it has been reported to be one of the domains that can confer greater protection against rotavirus (Fig. 6C and D) .",

On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that rotavirus disease may be an independent risk factor for intussusception. Therefore, the WHO emphasized that the benefit-risk profile of both licensed RV vaccines remains favorable, and the benefits outweigh the risk of intussusception; however, further investigation is needed on the risk of intussusception intestinal attributable to RV disease [33, 34] . A large group of researchers are currently focusing on generating alternatives for vaccine production; however, there are some limitations that impede their progress. Among the main limitations are the production platforms, the specificity for antigen delivery, the adequate stimulation of the immune response, the yield of the recombinant proteins, and, above all, the high production costs. An alternative to overcome some of these limitations is plants [27] . The production of rotavirus capsid proteins in plants has shown great interest, since different working groups have focused on the production of one or more proteins that Fig. 6 Three-dimensional structure of the scFv-anti-DEC205-OLLAS-VP6 recombinant protein. A The secondary structure of the recombinant protein is shown indicating the \u03b1 helices and the \u03b2 sheets in different colors, both of the antibody and the antigen. B Secondary structure of the protein indicating the adapters in different colors: in green the adapter of (Gly 4 Ser) 3 , and in yellow the OLLAS tag. In orange and red the VP6, the red color in the VP6 indicates a residue 332-397 of the VP6 protein. The blue color indicates the variable region of the antibody heavy chain against DEC205, the magenta color shows the variable fragment of the antibody light chain. C and D Globular structure of the recombinant protein indicating two epitopes of interest for the detection of the protein, as well as for the induction of an immune response make up the capsid of the virus. On the other hand, to overcome the limitation of specificity for antigen delivery, new vaccination strategies are being developed by directing the antigens specifically to dendritic cells, through the use of specific antibodies against a dendritic cell receptor coupled to the antigens, which will allow the processing and delivery of antigens by means of MHC I and MHC II to T cells [35] .",

We could not make such an accurate calculation of the final concentration because it lacked purified protein. As for the expression of the GFP recombinant protein, the same did not happen, as can be seen in Fig. 3 , there was greater expression in the cytoplasm than in apoplast. In addition, comparing the expression in both species of plants, it can also be observed that in N. benthamiana is faster in terms of expression time of GFP in apoplast and cytoplasm and that there is a greater intensity of fluorescence, which indicates that there is a greater production of GFP (Fig. 3) . It is necessary to highlight that despite observing GFP in the agro-infiltrated leaves of both N. benthamiana and N. sylvestris in the two cell compartments (cytoplasm and apoplast), only a 26.9 kDa band could be observed in the lanes corresponding to the extraction of GFP from the cytoplasm (Fig. 4) .

This is consistent with what was reported by Hashemi [37] , where they expressed transiently the human growth hormone in potatoes, tobacco, and lettuce. However, they found that in potatoes and tobacco, there was greater expression compared to lettuce leaves. Although the expression levels in tobacco and potato leaves were really high, tobacco produces high levels of toxic alkaloids and phenolic substances that are released during the milling and extraction of proteins and that can interfere with protein performance recombinant. Therefore, although GFP could be detected in apoplast, it is possible that a considerable amount of recombinant protein is degrading and therefore cannot be visualized by Coomassie staining.

The result of the model gives us an approximation of what aspect the recombinant protein could acquire and if true, the fusion of the viral protein with the anti-DEC205 would not alter the ability of the antibody to acquire a suitable conformation for the recognition of the DEC205 receptor. In addition, in modeling, it can be seen that the OLLAS tag is exposed on the surface of the protein, which is ideal for the detection of the recombinant protein (Fig. 6D) . On the other hand, it is reported that one of the epitopes or domains that induce greater protection against rotavirus is residue 332-397 of the VP6 protein [38] . By selecting this residue in modeling, it can be seen that this epitope is exposed on the surface of the viral protein (Fig. 6D) , which indicates that the recombinant protein may be able to generate a potent immune response through two pathways, one of which is through the introduction of the antigen to dendritic cells by scFv-anti-DEC205 and generate a cellular immune response by activating T lymphocytes mediated by the presentation of antigens by the major histocompatibility complex. On the other hand, being VP6 one of the subunits of the most immunogenic rotavirus capsid and presenting one of the domains that induce greater protection against rotavirus on its surface, a humoral and/or cellular immune response can be generated only from the recognition of the viral or epitope protein.",

However, despite using this codon optimization process, no significant increase in the expression of the recombinant protein was observed on SDS-PAGE. Codon bias between the transgene and host expression is known to affect the expression levels of heterologous proteins [40] . At present, for the expression of recombinant proteins, the impact of codon optimization remains quite unpredictable, as there are multiple interrelated factors (promoter strength, A + T content, mRNA secondary structure, mRNA stability) that affect protein expression by optimizing a genetic sequence [39] [40] [41] . Therefore, based on all the current information on codon optimization, it is difficult to predict which strategy, if any, will design the \"optimal\" gene sequence, so it would be necessary to make different versions of the gene to determine the best one version to be expressed in the expression model [41] .",
