The calculations of the adhesion energy of nanoparticles to the different structures, in addition to the calculations of energetic characteristics for aerosol nanodroplets, require an application of statistical physics methods. An investigation of equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of droplets and aerosols with liquid nanodroplets can be performed within the framework of classical statistical mechanics. The nanodroplets may reveal implicit collective properties and self-organization into structures at a macroscopic level [8] .

Thus, there was a need to use approximations that allowed a reasonable comparison of theoretical and experimental results to be made. The properties of aerosol systems were determined by their interacting components, i.e., nanodroplets and gas. There exist many phenomena at the molecular level that lack explanation. Under these conditions, it is difficult to predict the behavior of nano-objects and their assemblies, or to control these nanosystems. For the investigated aerosol systems, a fundamental role is played by the energy characteristics of the separate nanodroplets, their interaction energies with the surrounding gas, and the paired interactions of nanodroplets. Investigation of the pointed energy characteristics is a major focus of the current article.",

The calculations of atom interaction energy with an object outside the framework of continual approximation, when it is necessary to account for the repulsion of atoms and pair correlation in its position, have attracted significant interest. For an interaction of isolated atoms with solid objects, the continual approximation is correct and accounts for the repulsion of an atom from the solid body atoms (without accounting for an atomistic structure of the solid body and the possibility of atoms penetrating into the body). However, in the case of atom-liquid interaction, this approach is insufficient. In the equilibrium system of liquid-vapor, an interchange of atoms between both phases takes place, and the equilibrium is dynamic. To take account of an interchange between two phases, it is necessary to equally account for a discrete structure of both the vapor and liquid. A mathematical technique to describe this process should be similar for both phases.",

The paired interatomic interactions were described using the Lennard-Jones potential. The structure of the droplets was modeled using a Fowler approximation (the step profile of atoms' density in the droplets) [18, 19] . The calculations are performed for the cases in which the atom is located outside, inside, and on the surface of the droplet. For the geometry dispositions of the atom and droplet, which require accounting for the paired interatomic correlations, pair distribution functions within the framework of thermodynamic perturbation theory were used.",

The numerical calculations were performed for the normal 4 H e at a temperature T = 2.2K and a density \u03c1 = 147 kg/m 3 , which corresponds to the density of the number of particles n = 22.1266 nm \u22123 . Parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential were chosen to be \u03c3 = 2.576\u00c5, \u03b5 = 10.22K [13] . The pair distribution function was modeled by means of the distribution function obtained within the framework of the Barker-Henderson thermodynamic perturbation theory [10, 16] . Figure 2 shows the results of calculations in continual approximation using Formula (13) for the interaction energy of an atom with a droplet of liquid helium for different values of droplet radius (curves 1-3) and a semi-bounded liquid (curve 4). The interaction energy of the pair of atoms, which is described by the Lennard-Jones potential (curve 5), is also shown. The calculations show that the position of the minimum of the interaction energy of an atom with droplets and semi-bounded liquids is significantly shifted to the shorter distances in comparison to the interatomic potential \u03a6(R). The depth of the potential well increases with the growth of the droplet radius and reaches saturation for the flat interface of the liquid. At a given density of the liquid, the depth of the potential well, even in the case of atom interaction with the flat interface, is less than in the case of atom-atom interaction. In the case of continual approximation, the interaction energy of the atom with its surroundings approaches infinity when an atom approaches a surface, i.e., the atom cannot reach the surface of the liquid. This result is not satisfactory for a liquid; however, to a certain level, it is acceptable for the modeling of atom interaction with a solid body, and it is used in absorption problems. The main disadvantage of the continuum approximation is complete neglect of the discrete surrounding structure effects and correlations between separate atoms with the surrounding atoms. tion energy of the atom with its surroundings approaches infinity when an atom approaches a surface, i.e., the atom cannot reach the surface of the liquid.

The main disadvantage of the continuum approximation is complete neglect of the discrete surrounding structure effects and correlations between separate atoms with the surrounding atoms. The calculation results of the interaction energy of an atom with a droplet in the framework of correlation theory in the case when the atom is located on the surface of the droplet are shown in Figure 3 . From Figure 3 , we can see that at droplet radius vales around [20 \u2212 30\u03c3] , the energy E a\u2212d (a, a), as a function of the radius, approaches the asymptotic value. In contrast to the continuum model, accounting for the interatomic correlations of the atom on the surface of the droplet demonstrates finite negative values of the energy, which corresponds to the attraction of the atom to the droplet. Figure 4 shows the calculation results of the interaction energy of an atom with a droplet as a function of the droplet radius E a\u2212d (0, a), for the case when atom is located in the center of the droplet. From the graph in Figure 4 , it is seen that at radius values of the order 10\u03c3, the interaction energy of the atom with droplet E a\u2212d (0, a) reaches its asymptotic values for the unbounded liquid; however, it remains finite. Figure 5 shows the calculation results of the atom interaction energy with a liquid helium droplet, including accounting for the correlation effects at variable radius values and arbitrary distances from the atom to the center of the droplet. As can be seen from the graph, the interaction energy of an atom with a droplet exhibits a saturation effect. This effect can be seen in the following circumstances. (1) The droplet radius values are of the order of 4\u03c3 , and the number of atoms in the droplet is around 101. A one-atom potential is formed, which covers most of the droplet and corresponds to the asymptotic value for the unbounded liquid. (2) The thickness of the near-surface layer, where the interaction energy varies from its value inside the droplet to the asymptotic value outside the droplet, quickly reaches the values of the order 6\u03c3 at radius growth. These results indicate that a majority of atoms inside the droplet with a radius 10 a \u03c3 > are under the influence of self-consistent potential, which is similar to that of the homogeneous unbounded liquid, and the gradient of this potential is located at the near-surface layer of the thickness 6\u03c3 . As a result, at radius growth, the thickness of the atom density profile of the near-surface layer quickly reaches values corresponding to the flat surface.

As a result, at radius growth, the thickness of the atom density profile of the near-surface layer quickly reaches values corresponding to the flat surface. For comparison, Figure 6 shows the dependences of the interaction energies of an atom and 4 He nanodroplet of radius 2\u03c3 in the continual model and taking into account the correlation effects.

This potential corresponds to the Van der Waals potential, and the repulsive intermolecular forces and the interparticle correlations in these calculations are not taken into account. Thus, the obtained results in [11] for the interaction energies of macroscopic bodies correspond to the asymptotic values for large distances.

This approach can be implemented within the framework of the statistical theory of multiparticle systems [10, [13] [14] [15] [16] .

An overview of the existing approaches to the description of the evaporation and condensation phenomena is provided in work [29] .

However, the framework of these approaches does not allow the formulation and establishment of the boundary conditions in the droplet's near-surface area, where the application of the macroscopic equations of thermodynamics, heat transfer, and diffusion is problematic [29] . The microscopic approach developed in the current paper allows, at the molecular level, accounting for the interaction energies of atoms (molecules) with a liquid droplet, and it takes into account paired interparticle interactions and correlations with an arbitrary atom (molecule) disposition relative to the droplet. The derived expressions for E a\u2212d R ij , a j allow research on the intermolecular forces that act on a separate particle at an arbitrary position. They also allow the development of the statistical theory of equilibrium evaporation and condensation processes for arbitrary temperatures and densities of liquid and gas in multicomponent systems with droplets of an arbitrary size.

For nano-objects, due to the large proportion of particles present in the near-surface layer, interatomic correlations can be of great importance for the formation of a self-consistent potential, which ensures the stability of the object in relation to the decay of constituent atoms or molecules. The processes of nucleation, and the mechanisms of growth and evolution of nanostructures under conditions of microscopic instability, are an integral part of the physics of phase transitions of the first kind. From the point of view of kinetics, the processes of nucleation of nano-objects take place with the participation of each individual atom, which evolves in the field of other atoms. The evolution of a single atom depends on the self-consistent field formed by other atoms and correlations with neighboring atoms. Stability of processes and their direction are also important for the growth or decay of nano-objects. The microscopic nature of the mono-atomic mechanisms of growth or decay of nanostructures, when the curvature of the surface of the new nanophase is significant, has been insufficiently studied. The solution of kinetic problems of this type is possible by means of theoretical calculations of the atom's interaction energy with the inhomogeneous environment at a nanometer scale. A proper description of the multiscale processes of nanostructure growth also requires knowledge of the energy balance of the entire nanostructure, which requires energy calculations of highly heterogeneous nanoscale systems.",

The derived formulation is applied for the calculations of the nanodroplets of liquid helium. The developed approach has similarities with the functional density method (FDM) [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] ; however, it additionally takes into account the energies of the paired interparticle correlations, which are problematic in FDM. The analysis of different approaches for the accounting of pair correlation energies in the FDM in application to liquid helium is described in paper [36] . Assembling the expression for the energy of pair correlations only by means of the atom's paired interaction energy and local densities of the number of atoms requires the introduction of the non-physical \"screening\" concept of Lennard-Jones potential at small distances, to avoid the divergence problem of the corresponding integrals [36] . In fact, it is necessary to introduce additional parameters that cannot be determined within the density functional method itself. As a result, extra designations for Lennard-Jones potential are introduced in different versions of FDM at short distances in an attempt to converge the integrals corresponding to the indirect accounting for the short-range paired interatomic correlations. The distribution function method used above for groups of particles avoids the necessity of expanding the studied quantities into gradient series.",

The short range of interatomic interactions results in the rapid achievement of the asymptotic value of the atoms' energy at the center of the droplet during the growth of the droplet size. The formation of the bulk properties of helium nanodroplets occurs at radii in the order of 4\u03c3 and the number atoms of around 101. It should be noted that the pair distribution function of atoms in liquids at distances 4\u03c3 is almost equal to one, which corresponds to the absence of correlations in the spatial positions of the pair of atoms. Therefore, it is possible to reach conclusions about the relationship between the radii of liquid nanodroplets, at which the volumetric properties of the liquid are formed, and the characteristic distances at which the paired interatomic correlation in liquids is lost. This conclusion also easy to see in Figure 5 , from which it follows that most atoms in droplets of the specified size have the same one-atomic potential as in a homogeneous liquid. The saturation effect is also observed for the thickness of the near-surface region, in which the monoatomic potential changes its value from its \"bulk\" value to zero outside the droplet. The depth of the potential well, in which the atom moves inside the helium droplet, for the droplets with radii of the order a > 4\u03c3, has a magnitude 5\u03b5 \u2248 50K, which significantly exceeds the thermal energy of the atoms (T = 2.2K).",

In Fowler's approximation, all contributions are expressed in the form of one-time integrals, which significantly simplifies the model calculations of the dimensional dependence. The dimensional dependence of the surface energy of spherical droplets of simple dielectric liquids as a function of the radius in the Fowler approximation is calculated. In the extreme case of large values of the radius of a droplet, its surface energy approaches its value for a flat surface. The strong dimensional dependence of the surface energy of the droplet is observed in the region of nanometer droplet size. The developed approach is applied to the calculation of the surface energy of a two-phase system of liquid nanodroplet-gas phase, taking into account paired interparticle interactions and correlations. The dimensional dependence of the surface energy of a nanodroplet in a gas is similar to the dimensional dependence of a nanodroplet in a vacuum.",

The energy of the interaction of two droplets in the Fowler approximation is written as a double integral. An explicit expression for the interaction energy of two droplets in the continuum approximation is obtained, which allows us to investigate the importance of taking into account the effects of paired intermolecular correlations in comparison with continuum models. As a boundary case, the expression for the energy of interaction of a droplet and a semi-bounded liquid is obtained, taking into account the effects of paired interparticle correlations.",

These issues are all currently unresolved. The important theoretically unresolved issues are the evolution processes of evaporation and condensation on a nanodroplet that is in contact with different media (wood, plastic, metal), and the lifetime of the droplet with a molecular structure inside different surfaces. The answers to these questions are important in the problems related to the spread of viruses. ",
