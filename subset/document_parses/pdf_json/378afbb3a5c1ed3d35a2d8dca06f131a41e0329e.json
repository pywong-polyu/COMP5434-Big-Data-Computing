Five distinct mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiviral properties of ribavirin. These include both indirect mechanisms (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibition, immunomodulatory effects) and direct mechanisms (interference with RNA capping, polymerase inhibition, lethal mutagenesis). Recent concerns about bioterrorism have renewed interest in exploring the antiviral activity of ribavirin against unique viruses. In this paper, we review the proposed mechanisms of action with emphasis on recent discoveries, as well as the implications of ribavirin resistance. Evidence exists to support each of the five proposed mechanisms of action, and distinct virus/host combinations may preferentially favour one or more of these mechanisms during antiviral therapy.",

A number of distinct mechanisms have been suggested depending on the particular virus being studied. Broadly, there are five primary mechanisms of action proposed for ribavirin. Indirect mechanisms include reduction in cellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) pools via inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibition, and an immunomodulatory effect in which a T-helper type 1 (antiviral) immune response is maintained. Direct mechanisms include inhibition of RNA capping activity, direct inhibition of viral polymerases, and increased mutation frequency via incorporation of ribavirin into newly synthesised genomes leading to error catastrophe. Here, we review the proposed mechanisms of action for ribavirin and the evidence for each from a variety of studies with distinct viruses, with an emphasis on recent discoveries.",

            "text": "Ribavirin is clinically administered as the nucleoside. Adenosine kinase is the cellular enzyme responsible for conversion to ribavirin monophosphate (RMP). Cells deficient in adenosine kinase activity accumulate only small amounts of the phosphorylated forms of ribavirin [11, 12] . Subsequent phosphorylation of RMP yields the di-and triphosphorylated nucleotides [12, 13] . Phosphorylation is rapid, with half-maximal levels of metabolites being reached within a few hours of exposure to cultured cells [12] . Although the relative concentration of the mono-, di-and triphosphorylated forms varies by cell type, ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is generally the predominant metabolite [12] . GTP pools are reduced approximately two-fold by ribavirin treatment, with a concurrent increase in cellular CTP and UTP [13, 14] . These changes in nucleotide pools are due to the ability of RMP to act as an inhibitor of IMPDH (see following section). Deoxynucleotide forms of ribavirin have not been detected intracellularly, suggesting that ribavirin diphosphate is not a substrate for cellular ribonucleotide reductase. However, cellular deoxynucleotide pools are generally much smaller than ribonucleotide pools. Thus, ribavirin deoxynucleotides may be present in very low concentrations that have not been detected.",

EICAR is a structural analogue of ribavirin, and the 5 0 -monophosphate is also a potent inhibitor of IMPDH [22] . MPA is a potent uncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH and does not need to be metabolically activated (reviewed in [23] ). The effects of these three IMPDH inhibitors on Vero and HeLa cell GTP pools were analysed. For all three compounds, a linear correlation was noted between GTP pool inhibition and antiviral activity as measured by viral RNA synthesis, as well as antiviral effect measured by reduction in CPE, suggesting that IMPDH inhibition is the primary mechanism of antiviral activity for all three compounds. However, the measured GTP pool reduction in this case was much more dramatic than that previously reported by other researchers.",

In a study of the antiviral effect of ribavirin against influenza virus, it was found that the reduction in intracellu-lar GTP pools was saturated at a relatively low concentration (25 mM) of ribavirin [24] . However, ribavirin had a more potent antiviral effect at higher concentrations, although cellular GTP pools were not diminished further. Studies with poliovirus (PV) have shown that the potent antiviral effect induced by ribavirin was accompanied by only small reductions in translation and RNA synthesis [25] . Furthermore, not all IMPDH inhibitors have antiviral activity [25, 26] . Thus, IMPDH inhibition may not be the primary mechanism of antiviral activity in most cases.",

The T-helper type 1 response is associated with cellular immunity and is associated with expression of IL-2, gamma-interferon, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha [36, 37] . The T-helper 2 response promotes humoural immunity and is associated with expression of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10. It has been suggested that an ineffective host immune response is an important factor in chronic infections. A T-helper 2 response has been associated with the development of chronic disease in HCV infection [38] . Ribavirin has indeed been shown to modulate cytokine expression in human Action of ribavirin against distinct viruses Action of ribavirin against distinct viruses 39 39 T-cells [39] . Low levels (5-10 mM) of ribavirin inhibited a Type-2 response and promoted a Type-1 response in both CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe human T-cells in vitro. Data obtained for the L-enantiomer of ribavirin (ICN 17261, also known as levovirin) support this hypothesis. This compound had similar efficiency in inducing Type-1 cytokine responses and reducing serum ALT levels in a murine model [40] . However, levovirin did not exhibit direct antiviral activity in vitro against viruses sensitive to ribavirin. As stereochemical differences likely preclude intracellular phosphorylation [41] , this molecule should not be able to be converted to the phosphorylated metabolites, which are necessary for the direct antiviral effects of ribavirin. Clinical trials with levovirin in HCV patients were unsuccessful, suggesting that the immunomodulation observed in vitro is insufficient to produce clinical effects [42] . However, the mechanism by which ribavirin stimulates the immune response is not understood. Interestingly, recent results have suggested that ribvavirin monotherapy may indeed have an antiviral effect [43] . Furthermore, monitoring viral load by PCR-based methods may overlook antiviral activities that result in production of non-infectious genomes.",

RTP was found to serve as a substrate for this enzyme, and formation of a covalent RMP-enzyme complex was demonstrated. Transfer of RMP to RNA was also shown biochemically. RNAs capped with ribavirin were more stable to degradation than uncapped RNAs. However, the 7-methyl group found on the normal cap structure is necessary for translation by interaction with eIF4E. The vaccinia virus capping machinery was unable to add 7-methyl group to ribavin; thus, RNAs capped by ribavirin were not efficiently translated.

An X-ray crystal structure of RTP bound to the enzyme revealed that RTP was located in the GTP-binding site but with an unexpected orientation.

An in vitro primer-extension assay was used to measure the kinetics of incorporation of ribavirin triphosphate by the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Ribavirin was incorporated slowly, at approximately the rate of an incorrect nucleotide, which should result in an average of one or two molecules incorporated per 7500-nucleotide RNA genome. Of greater importance was the discovery that ribavirin was templated by either uridine or cytidine with equal efficiency. Furthermore, the presence of ribavirin in the RNA template was able to direct incorporation of either CMP or UMP. Thus, ribavirin is capable of ambiguous basepairing, mimicking either of the natural purines (guanosine normally base-pairs with cytidine while adenosine normally base-pairs with thymidine [or uracil]). This ambiguous basepairing capacity is likely due to rotation of the carboxamide moiety of the pseudobase, generating hydrogen bond acceptor/donor sites favourable for interaction with either of the pyrimidine bases ( Figure 4 ). The fact that ribavirin can act as an ambiguous purine base analogue suggested that it has the potential to be mutagenic to RNAs into which it is incorporated. The in vitro incorporation studies suggested that ribavirin should induce transition mutations (A-to-G and C-to-U). To investigate this possibility, Crotty and colleagues sequenced the capsid-coding regions of poliovirus grown in the presence of varying concentrations of ribavirin. Sequencing revealed an increase in mutations, particularly the predicted transition mutations. Furthermore, ribavirin treatment resulted in only a minimal decrease in the levels of translation and RNA synthesis. Thus, the antiviral effect of ribavirin seemed to be mediated primarily by inducing mutations into the RNA genome.",

The genome variability present in such a population may be beneficial in allowing more rapid adaptation to environmental changes, including tropism, immune response or antiviral therapy. However, quasispecies theory predicts the existence of an upper limit to genome variability, known as the error threshold, beyond which additional mutations would be deleterious to the population.

Although there are no Action of ribavirin against distinct viruses Action of ribavirin against distinct viruses 43 43 FDA-approved therapies for Hantaan virus infection, ribavirin has been shown to reduce the severity of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in experimental use [74] . Severson and colleagues have shown that ribavirin can increase the mutation frequency of Hantaan virus [75] . It was subsequently suggested that ribavirin incorporation might reduce the stability of viral mRNA species as well [76] . Ribavirin also acts as a lethal mutagen against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [77] . BHK-21 cells could be 'cured' of persistent FMDV infection by treatment with ribavirin. Ribavirin had a greater antiviral effect than MPA at concentrations causing an equivalent reduction in GTP pools, suggesting that IMPDH inhibition was not the sole antiviral mechanism. Ribavirin was found to be mutagenic to FMDV based on sequence analysis, and this effect was detectable even in the presence of added guanosine. The IMPDH inhibitor MPA was also found to induce an increase in mutation rate (although less than ribavirin), but this effect was abolished by the addition of exogenous guanosine, suggesting that this mutagenesis was the result of alteration of cellular nucleotide pool balance through IMPDH inhibition.",

Sequence data indicated an increase in transition mutations. G ! A transitions were the most common mutation, followed by C ! U. The authors suggest that the particular observed mutations are due to ribavirin acting primarily as a GTP analogue during replication, and that there is a bias towards incorporation into the genome itself. Ribavirin incorporation as a GTP analogue would be expected to produce G ! A transitions if incorporated into genomic RNA and C ! U if incorporated into the antisense replication intermediate. Preferential incorporation as a GTP analogue could be explained by the reduced intracellular GTP pools caused by RMP inhibition of IMPDH.",

An amino acid substitution in the NS5B RdRp (F415Y in NS5B) was detected in all treated patients. After cessation of treatment, reversion of this residue to phenylalanine was observed in some patients. An HCV replicon containing the 415F variation was more susceptible to ribavirin in cell culture than 415Y. However, this resistance did not emerge in the replicon during cell culture passage. Importantly, while 415F is the consensus residue for genotype 1a, 415Y is found in all other genotypes. This observation suggests that ribavirin treatment may be more effective for patients infected with only genotype 1a. Furthermore, resistance occurring in the polymerase is consistent with ribavirin acting as a lethal mutagen, although sequencing of clinical isolates revealed only a moderate increase in genomic mutation frequency. The biochemical mechanism by which ribavirin resistance is derived should be investigated further, especially in light of recent data suggesting that resistance conferred by 415Y may not be robust [80] . Additionally, mutations in NS5A have been shown to confer resistance to ribavirin in HCV replicons propagated in cell culture [80] .",

Resistance was mediated by increased fidelity of the PV polymerase. Presumably, an increase in replication fidelity would restrict the breadth of the virus quasispecies and distance of the population from the error threshold, thus reducing the possibility of lethal mutagenesis.

Ribavirin can potentially act on numerous steps of the virus life cycle: inhibition of translation due to reduction in cellular GTP pools or incorporation as a cap analogue which inhibits translation; inhibition of genome or transcript capping, by suppression of GTP synthesis or direct competition; inhibition of RNA synthesis directly via active-site binding or reduction of GTP synthesis; ambiguous incorporation into RNA causing increased mutation and production of non-viable genomes; or enhancement of the antiviral immune response, preventing spread and pathogenesis.

Finally, the terminal guanosine is methylated at the N-7 position by an RNA methyltransferase, utilising S-adenosylmethionine.
