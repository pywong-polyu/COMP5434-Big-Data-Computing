            "text": "Our study reported that antibodies elicited after two doses of BTN162b2 vaccine rapidly decline after 15 weeks from the first administration, especially in infection-na\u00efve subjects. These subjects developed weaker immunity than those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, in terms of serological response and functional neutralization. The expected decline relies on the fact that vaccine induced short-lived plasmablasts that do not necessarily differentiate into long-lived plasma cells [9] . Turner et al.reported that S-binding germinal centre B cells and plasmablasts in draining lymphonodes persist at least 12 weeks after the second dose [10] . Our results are in line with the \"hybrid immunity\" concept according to which vaccinated COVID\u02d719 convalescent individuals developed higher immune responses compared to that of na\u00efve or SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects [11] . Similar evidence was reported by the study of Huijskens et al., in which the authors showed that a history of seasonal influenza vaccination has different effects on infection and vaccination response. In vaccinees, the level of antibodies to the homologous strain was reduced in persons with a history of vaccination, whereas the reverse was true for infected persons [12] .",

            "text": "More importantly, our data point out the need to monitor the effectiveness of the BTN162b2 vaccine to protect against possible newly emergent VOCs. The B.1.351 and P.1 lineages were more resistant to sera neutralization compared to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 lineages even after the second boost. The resistance to neutralization of the first two mentioned lineages was also reported for monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, due to the mutations in the NTD and RBD leading to changes in the spike proteins recognized by neutralizing antibodies [13] . [15] . However, we cannot exclude that this discrepancy might rely on the different neutralization assays employed, i.e. live virus-and, in our case, pseudotyped virus-based assays. Perhaps, differences in spike conformations between live and pseudotyped virus could make the neutralizing epitope differently accessible to neutralizing antibodies. Although variants escape from SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity has been reported, S-specific CD4 + T-cell activation is not affected by the mutations, at least in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants [16] . Taken together, our findings suggest that the administration of a third vaccine dose is expected to boost both humoral and cellular response and acquire high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies as observed in subjects with pre-existing immunity. Therefore, immunological na\u00efve subjects should be prioritised for an additional vaccine administration. Studies reviewed in [17] indicated that one vaccine dose administration may sufficiently protect people who have recovered from COVID-19. However, few epidemiologic studies provided evidence of the benefit of vaccination for previously infected individuals as well. Unvaccinated Kentucky residents who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 had significantly higher likelihood of reinfection during May and June 2021 than those who were vaccinated against COVID-19 [18] . The rapid waning of the response elicited by vaccination suggests the need for a potential seasonal vaccine booster, as with the influenza vaccine, in order to be protected from the risk of reinfection and reduce the burden on the healthy system.",
