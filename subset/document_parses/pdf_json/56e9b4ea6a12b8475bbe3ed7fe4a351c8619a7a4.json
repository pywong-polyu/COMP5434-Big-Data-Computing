            "text": "The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) of vaccine administration are local injection site reactions, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, fevers, and myalgias [2] . Minor adverse events were also reported among placebo groups in clinical trials [3] [4] [5] . Prior studies have reported specific syndromes associated with particular vaccines, such as the thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome with adenovirus-vector vaccines and myocarditis following receipt of mRNA vaccines [6] [7] [8] [9] . Rates of anaphylaxis are estimated at 2-11 cases per million after receipt of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Recent studies reporting on pre-specified vaccine-related adverse events reported no increase following vaccination, and that adverse event rates following vaccination with BNT162b2 were lower than those caused by natural infection, however, patients with a history of infection were excluded, thus it is not clear if these post-surveillance studies generalize to those with existing immunity. [10, 11] Natural infection confers lasting immunity [12] and multiple studies demonstrate robust immune responses to a single dose of mRNA vaccine in previously infected patients [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Critical questions remain about best practices for vaccinating previously infected patients, who might develop more vaccine-related adverse events due to their pre-existing immunity. Thus, the objective of this large, multicenter, retrospective cohort study was to determine whether hospitalization, specific adverse events reported in the literature or listed in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, or death occurred more frequently after vaccination than at the expected rate for the population, and to evaluate the impact of prior SARS-CoV-2 on the relationship.",

The daily incident hospitalization rates for the longitudinal cohort during the period from 56 days prior to vaccination and 56 days after vaccination were calculated, and confidence intervals and changes relative to the vaccination date evaluated using bootstrapping with the percentile method. Findings were calculated for the entire population and stratified by history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary diagnoses (ICD-10 codes) associated with hospitalizations at a VA hospital during the periods 7-14 days before vaccination and 0-7 days after the first dose of vaccine were compared. Analysis before versus after dose 2 was not performed, out of concern that the pre-dose comparator for dose 2 would be close to the time of the post-dose data for dose 1. A random sample of 80 acute-care hospitalizations that occurred the day after vaccine receipt underwent manual review to determine the reason for hospitalization and whether it was associated with vaccine receipt (yes, no, or probable/possible, based on the symptoms leading to hospitalization, timing of onset and resolution, and objective findings and treatment).",

Across the longitudinal cohort, we found no excess mortality and no increase in the specific adverse events reported to VAERS, similar to findings from other recently published post-approval safety studies [10, 11] . There was a small but significant increase in hospitalization rate among patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly after receipt of the second dose of either mRNA vaccine, with an absolute increased risk of 1:1000. Reassuringly, among patients with no history of infection, we found no evidence for any excess mortality associated with vaccine receipt. The sample size of patients with a recent or prior infection who died is too small to allow conclusions, since comparison to patients without infection would require adjustment for multiple confounding variables. These findings strongly support vaccine safety but raise questions about the optimal vaccination schedule in patients with a confirmed infection history. Additional research is needed to inform the best strategy for previously infected patients, who might benefit from a single-dose vaccination regimen, a delayed second-dose strategy, or simple interventions to prevent post-vaccine fever and dehydration if the standard vaccination schedule is used. Trends that deviate from flat lines are worth additional discussion. First, the gradual upward trend in mortality in the uninfected group (Fig. 3 ) undoubtedly reflects the fact that patients not only must be alive to be vaccinated but also received vaccination at times of relatively stable health. The same phenomenon was also observed to a lesser extent for hospitalization after dose 2 (Fig. 1) . This ''healthy vaccinee\" effect probably also explains the downward trend in incident hospitalizations in the previously infected group prior to dose 1 (Fig. 1) . The absolute rate of incident hospitalizations the day after dose 2 was no higher than the absolute rate 21-56 days prior to dose 1. However, we contend that a convincing short-term change in a local trend is the most relevant to the specific research question we addressed.",

Another innovative aspect was the use of each individual as his or her own control, which allows us to make conclusions about the impact of a specific event, in this case vaccination, on an individual patient, although specific time-related trends in health and behaviors are limitations of this approach. Incident hospitalizations and emergency room visits are commonly used adverse event detection triggers that are often included in patient safety monitoring tools, including the outpatient Institute for Healthcare Improvement trigger toolkit [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Combining specific adverse event reporting surveillance with the general trigger tools approach to surveillance, we did not find an increase in the specific adverse events that have been reported to VAERS following a vaccination event, but we did see an increase in general adverse events in the subpopulation of patients with an infection history, as evidenced by 24-hour hospitalization rates following vaccination.",

Our study is consistent with this hypothesis, since the spectrum of related symptoms and objective findings such as weakness, muscle aches, fever, mental status changes, falls, dehydration and acute kidney injury were transiently increased especially after the second dose. No patients in our cohort had received a third dose of the vaccine, but our study raises questions about whether higher adverse event rates will be identified with increasing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in at-risk and frail Table 3 Summary of manual review of all patients who died within 48 h of receiving a dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.",

Additional studies are needed to characterize whether the severity of prior infection impacts post-vaccine adverse event severity. We did not distinguish between laboratory SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia, and responses may differ between these groups. Although the benefit for the population is clear, our results raise the question of whether patients who have a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered for a more personalized vaccination schedule based on frailty, comorbidities, and other factors. Studies of natural immunity suggest that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protection against severe outcomes from future infections, although duration and durability of this immunity is unknown. In a large Israeli study, breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals were more common than reinfections in previously infected individuals, and a single dose of vaccine in a previously infected individual decreased reinfection risk [35] . Antibody titers increase markedly after a single vaccine dose in this population (10-fold to 140-fold) [13, 15, 36] . The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection, timing of vaccination, and adverse events, should also be evaluated, as it is possible that a non-standardized vaccination dosing schedule, for example by increasing the time between the two doses, would minimize adverse events while maximizing prevention of infection. Along these lines, the Norwegian Medicines Agency investigated the deaths of frail elderly patients after vaccination and advised caution in this subpopulation [37] .",

Mortality assessments in VA data, and especially the National Death Index, are highly accurate, maximizing ability to determine cause and location of death. [38] Additionally, a random sample of persons with prior infection who were hospitalized following vaccine receipt and every death within 48 h underwent detailed manual review to validate and enhance database findings with detailed clinical information. This is a major strength of the study, as it focuses on accurately measured, clinically significant outcomes as a means of surveillance, rather than self-reporting of adverse events from clinicians and patients.",

In our study, we calculated the daily baseline risk of hospitalization for the longitudinal cohort and stratified by infection history, which inherently balances potential confounding variables, and used the baseline risk of hospitalization and specific adverse events to examine trends above the expected rate. This strategy of using the expected rates from the cohort and then using the cohort as its own control is a highly robust method for isolating the risk of hospitalization and death following a specific event exposure that is not subject to the limitations of control matching procedures present in other analyses. Additionally, our study was not reliant on self-report of temporally associated adverse events, but rather an evaluation of changes in rates associated with vaccine administration as an isolated event and exposure.",

The study was conducted in the national VA healthcare system, which has a large population of older, male patients, limiting generalizability of conclusions to other populations, particularly women and children. This likely impacted our ability to detect certain adverse events, such as myocarditis following vaccination, which appear to be concentrated among demographic groups (young and adolescent men) with limited or no representation in the VA population [8, 11] . Due to limited distribution within the VA, we were not able to assess the safety profile of the Janssen adenovirus-based vaccine [7] . In addition, VA patients frequently receive care at multiple health systems and we were not able to fully account for the reasons for non-VA admissions, thus it is possible that an increase in specific diagnoses was missed. Some patients may primarily receive care outside of the VA or have received their SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis outside of the VA, or a vaccine outside of the VA, and this missing data may have biased findings in unpredictable ways. However, we attempted to address this limitation through a sensitivity analyses limited to patients identified as regular VA users using criteria used in many previous studies, which revealed similar findings to those from the complete longitudinal cohort.",
