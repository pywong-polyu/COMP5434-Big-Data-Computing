Scientists lack, however, general frameworks to characterize the dynamics of RNA virus evolution directly from empirical data and identify potential physical laws. To fill this gap, we present a theory to characterize the RNA virus evolution as a physical system with absorbing states and avalanche behaviors. This approach maps accessible biological data (e.g., phylogenetic tree and infection) to a general stochastic process of RNA virus infection and evolution, enabling researchers to verify potential self-organized criticality underlying RNA virus evolution. We apply our framework to SARS-CoV-2, the virus accounting for the global epidemic of COVID-19. We find that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits scale-invariant avalanches as mean-field theory predictions. The observed scaling relation, universal collapse, and slowly decaying auto-correlation suggest a self-organized critical dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. arXiv:2204.08627v1 [q-bio.PE] 19 Apr 2022",

            "text": "Despite its apparent significance, the physics underlying RNA virus evolution remains elusive. While important progress has been accomplished in characterizing the dynamics of mutant virus population size (e.g., see Refs. [9, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] ), there remains another non-negligible aspect of evolution for exploration. From the biological perspective, the dynamics accountable for phylogenetic tree formation is informative for the global evolution properties [24, 25, 26, 27] . Compared with the evolution previously considered in the context of population dynamics [9, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] , this unexplored aspect may convey key information about the macroscopic laws of RNA virus evolution [24, 25, 26, 27 ] but yet remains unclear. Moreover, existing models either nontrivially handle multiple time scales with extreme differences in magnitude orders or are simplified by phenomenological parameters [23] . Although phenomenological models are more solvable on empirical data than non-trivial analytic ones, these models are powerful in imitating phenomena but limited in explaining mechanisms. Interpretations of phenomenological parameters with experiments should be prudently considered [23] . In sum, much unknown remains about the general frameworks that are applicable to identify potential physical laws of RNA virus evolution from empirical data.",

We aim at exploring the global properties of RNA virus evolution by developing a physics theory of the dynamics underlying phylogenetic tree formation. The theory is demanded to map fundamental biological factors to general characterizations of system dynamics so as to guarantee its applicability on real data and universality to arbitrary RNA viruses. Applying this theory, we present a systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, the virus accounting for COVID-19 [28] . The global infection of SARS-CoV-2 provides us a unique opportunity with rich data (e.g., a sufficiently large phylogenetic tree) to validate our theory. Moreover, confirming the macroscopic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 evolution may benefit to developing coping strategies of COVID-19.",

In directed percolation (e.g., the contact process [36] ), sites (e.g., people) can be either active (infected) or inactive (healthy). With different balance between infection and recovery, the infection process may propagate over the system or vanish gradually. If infection vanishes, the system is trapped in a completely inactive state, the so-called absorbing state. Directed percolation is a non-equilibrium process since detailed balance breaks in the absorbing state (it can be reached but not be escaped) [37] . We are interested in potential self-organized criticality (SOC) due to its pervasiveness in biological systems (e.g., neural avalanches in the brain [38, 39] ). The self-organization to criticality distinguishes SOC (e.g., Refs. [40, 41] ) from ordinary critical phenomena [37, 42] . At criticality, the system jumps between absorbing configurations by avalanches [37, 42] . From the biological perspective, this property implies an unpredictable and unpreventable evolution of RNA virus. Numerous mean field theories of directed percolation have been proposed to determine avalanche exponents to study the scale-invariance underlying P T and P S , the probability distributions of T and S (e.g., see Ref. [43] ). Note that S is an abbreviation of S (T ). In Appendix B, we re-calculate avalanche exponents following a similar idea of Refs. [44, 32, 45] . Our results show that",

We apply the approach in Ref.

Details of cutoff estimation can be seen in Appendix D. Then, a maximum likelihood estimation of power-law exponent [51] is implemented on the samples above cutoffs to find ideal exponents that maximize the likelihood L (Fig. 1c) [51] . In our results, exponents are estimated as \u03b1 = 1.69 (\u03c5 = 7.13%), \u03b2 = 1.32 (\u03c5 = \u22124.53%), \u03b2 \u2212 = 1.32 (\u03c5 = \u22125.06%), and \u03b2 + = 1.34 (\u03c5 = \u221214.88%), where \u03c5 < 10% is a reasonable standard for the goodness of ideal estimations.

By increasing S, we can simultaneously increase the distribution cutoff of T . Our results suggest that the trend of V (t | T ) is principally independent of S. Meanwhile, we notice that V (t | T ) exhibits a mixture of global increasing trend and parabolic trend. The increasing trends may reflect the intrinsic property of the raw data. Therefore, we recalculate S by multiplying the midpoint of confidence interval [48] with the average total number of worldwide patients in the WHO database [49] for detrending. In Fig. 2a , V (t | T ) plausibly exhibits a parabolic trend in the detrended data. Meanwhile, we show several instances of V (t | T ) vs. t T in Fig. 2a . In Fig. 2b , the parabolic trend of V (t | T ) is verified quantitatively by quadratic polynomial fitting. We show the average quadratic coefficient \u00b5 (averaged across avalanches under each condition of S) as a function of S. Consistent with Fig. 2a , \u00b5 < 0 holds for every S in both original and detrended data, suggesting plausible parabolic trends of V (t | T ) .

Please see Appendix C for details. In Fig. 2d , the corresponding decays of auto-correlation are fitted to derive the decay rate \u03be. In the raw data, we obtain \u03be = \u22120.5407 (averaged R 2 = 0.6301) for t i = 0.3T and \u03be = \u22120.5159 (averaged R 2 = 0.6324) for t i = 0.5T .

The filtered result, referred to as critical phylogenetic tree, is a sub-graph of the original one that includes only critical avalanches. Threatening lineages, such as B.1.167.2 (the Delta virus), B.1.1 (the parent of Alpha, Beta, and Omicron viruses), and B.1 (the parent of Epsilon, Eta, Iota, and Mu viruses), can be found by searching non-isolated lineages with high out-degree \u03b4 (number of offspring lineages) in the critical tree. Note that the out-degree in the original tree does not completely determine the possibility of being isolated in the critical tree. Numerous lineages with high out-degrees in the original tree still become isolated (e.g., 20.83%, Figure 3 : Original and critical phylogenetic trees. Edges are colored according to T of corresponding avalanches. 8.33%, and 9.09% of lineages with \u03b4 \u2265 5, \u03b4 \u2265 15, and \u03b4 \u2265 20 in the original tree become isolated after filtering).",

We discover that P T (\u00b7) does not follow power-law properties for all values of T (see Fig. 1b) . Therefore, distribution cutoff estimation is necessary for T and S. We apply the method introduced in Ref. [51] to estimate T , S , S \u2212 (lower bound), and S + (upper bound), which calculates the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic \u03b7 between the observed cumulative probability distribution above cutoff and the cumulative probability distribution of a standard power-law variable. An ideal cutoff is expected to minimize \u03b7 [51] . To control the reduction of sample size, we relatively relax the restriction and estimate cutoffs when \u03b7 \u2212 0.5 std (\u03b7) is reached at the first time, where std (\u00b7) denotes the standard deviation. Distribution cutoffs are estimated as T = 29, S = 13320, S \u2212 = 12760, and S + = 13980. The distribution tails above cutoffs cover 93.879%, 76.38%, 70.526%, and 91.683% of original samples, supporting robust estimations of power-law exponents.",

To calculate the average KS statistic \u03b7 * between sample distributions and estimated models, we first generate 1000 sample distributions (each sample distribution contains n \u2208 [500, 5000] samples) of estimated power-law models. Then, we define \u03c5 = \u03b7\u2212\u03b7 * \u03b7 * to reflect the goodness of estimation, where \u03b7 is the KS statistic between the cumulative probability distributions of estimated power-law models and empirical distributions above cutoffs.
