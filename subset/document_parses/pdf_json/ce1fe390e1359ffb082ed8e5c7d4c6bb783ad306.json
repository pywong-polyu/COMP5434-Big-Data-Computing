To reduce transmission, a series of behavioural interventions were suggested and implemented [1] . Whilst the introduction of social distancing behaviours can reduce the spread of Covid-19 within the community [2] , people with symptoms of the virus are instructed to remain in the home; potentially with cohabiting families and friends. This has led to clusters of infection within households [3] , and within household transmission being highlighted as a dominant route of infection [4, 5] . In order to avoid within household transmission of Covid-19, excellent infection control measures are needed [4] . This includes introducing hygiene protocols, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (e.g., face mask use when necessary), and within household distancing and segregationor 'selfisolation' -of infected individuals [5] [6] [7] . Although effective for reducing within household transmission [2, 8] , there is substantial variation in the extent to which the public are able and willing to adhere to these behavioural solutions [9] [10] [11] .",

Centralisedas opposed to individual -isolation has been suggested [3] and implemented successfully in locations such as China and Korea [12] . In Wuhan, for example, existing public venues were rapidly converted into what are termed 'Fangcang shelter hospitals'. Individuals with symptoms of Covid-19 would isolate within these shelters, away from friends and family. In addition to providing food and medical care, these locations ensured adherence to self-isolation guidance, keeping the families and household members of the infected individual safe from infection, and provided social engagement, reducing psychological distress associated with selfisolation [13] . Indeed, a key difference between Fangcang shelters and makeshift or emergency hospitals is the social space provided, allowing residents to engage and socialise with others during the isolation period [13] . However, although cost effective and acceptable to residents living in Wuhan, the substantial differences in culture and living conditions mean that Fangcang style accommodation may be less likely to be accepted by individuals in many European countries.",

This strategy has not been widely implemented, and most of Europe and the United States continue to encourage individuals with symptoms to self-isolate within the home. In the United Kingdom, National Health Service (NHS) workers were offered, on a voluntary basis, the option of staying in NHS reimbursed hotel accommodation to enable them to continue to work if they were living with others who may be vulnerable. For those who can afford it, self-funded luxury hotel \"quarantine packages\" are available [15] [16] [17] , but, funded accommodation has not yet been offered in the UK to individuals or communities outside the NHS, who may be at risk.",

Likewise, those living in the most deprived areas are more likely to be diagnosed with Covid-19, and have worse outcomes than those living in the least deprived areas [23] . The reasons underpinning the disproportionate impact of the virus on these populations are multiple and complex, but include increased risk of occupational and geographical exposure [21, [23] [24] [25] paired with reduced opportunities for social distancing and self-isolation [9] . Interested individuals responded to an invitation to take part in research to understand experiences and interpretations of self-isolation and protection during the pandemic. Participants were over the age of 18 years and residing in the UK. We purposely sampled for diversity in key factors, including ethnicity, living arrangements, occupation, and vulnerability.

This work reveals that the offer of accommodation to protect vulnerable households is viewed positively by some people who feel their household is at risk. Data collected from both survey and interview participants highlighted concerns regarding the spread of the virus within the household, and a need for solutions to prevent this. Interviews provided insight into populations who would be likely to accept and benefit from the offer; and it was suggested that those who are vulnerable, are likely to be exposed to the virus, and who are unable to isolate within the home would benefit most. Participants who met one or more of these criteria appeared very willing to accept the offer of accommodation compared with those who consider themselves or their household not to be vulnerable, were not employed in public facing occupations, and/or had capacity to isolate within the home. Crucially, and in line with existing research [20] , those from ethnic minority and low income communities were considered to be more exposed and less able to isolate than those from high income backgrounds.",

In locations in which accommodation has successfully been used to support self-isolation outside the home, it is often the symptomatic persons who are offered accommodation for isolation [13, 14] . In the UK, NHS staff who are living with vulnerable family members have been offered accommodation to protect the family whilst allowing those not at high risk to continue to work [28] . Our study suggests that both approaches could be feasible and acceptable to high risk audiences, but the offer of accommodation must be timely, and appropriate infection control measures must be in place. Different households will have different requirements -there is no 'one size fits all'. However, as lockdown restrictions are lifted, and test, trace and isolate becomes a key strategy in controlling the virus, making support available to allow certain individuals to isolate safely could make a potentially valuable contribution to reducing transmission, morbidity and mortality.",

Indeed, individuals who are informed that they have been in contact with the virus may not be willing to return to their homes to await test results if they are living with vulnerable relatives.

Although this was seen as a viable option, again, there were concerns that it would be too late to make use of temporary accommodation at the stage at which infected persons are showing symptoms. There is however, emerging evidence to suggest that viral load is associated with disease severity [29] , and initial viral load is likely to be a contributing factor [30] . Interventions aiming to reduce exposure to the virus in the home have been successful [31, 32] . However, it is not easy to avoid contact with infected individuals, and more needs to be done to support vulnerable people [33] . In particular, vulnerable individuals living in large households may be at risk of exposure to a high viral load from multiple sources if support is not available. In such situations, offering accommodation to vulnerable individuals, with appropriate care and support, could substantially reduce their exposure to the virus.",

This group are likely to be a group of individuals who are highly motivated to engage in infection control behaviours and their views may not be representative of the wider population. Whilst every effort was made to recruit a diverse sample of participants for interviews, our primary use of social media to recruit participants may still have resulted in individuals with certain characteristics being missed. For example, those from non-English speaking communities, those without internet access, and those without social media are unlikely to have been recruited. Despite attempts to recruit participants though existing networks with community group leaders, engagement through these networks was minimal and could not be pursued further due to the need for timely completion of this initial study.",
