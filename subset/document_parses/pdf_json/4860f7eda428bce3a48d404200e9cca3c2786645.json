Management of this disease has been hampered by difficulties identifying the infection and determining the immunological status of affected cats and by high variability in the clinical, pathological, and immunological characteristics of affected cats. Neurological FIP, which is much more homogeneous than systemic effusive or noneffusive FIP, appears to be a good model for establishing the basic features of FIP immunopathogenesis. Very little information is available about the immunopathogenesis of neurologic FIP, and it is reasonable to use research from the wellcharacterized mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) immune-mediated encephalitis system, as a template for FIP investigation, and to contrast findings from the MHV model with those of FIP. It is expected that the immunopathogenic mechanisms will have important similarities. Such comparative research may lead to better understanding of FIP immunopathogenesis and rational prospects for management of this frustrating disease.",

            "text": "F eline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, immune-mediated disease produced as a result of infection of macrophages by mutant feline coronavirus strains (FIPVs). The severity of FIP is determined by virus strain and by host-specific, partially heritable immune responses. 1 The causative agent, FIP virus (FIPV), is a macrophage-tropic mutant of the ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). [2] [3] [4] These feline coronaviruses are closely related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of pigs and more distantly related to MHV (a coronavirus of rodents), human respiratory coronavirus, and others. As with most RNA viruses, a high rate of point or other small-scale mutations and larger scale recombination events occur. Type II FECVs are viruses that arise as a result of recombinations between type I FECV and canine coronavirus (CCV). Type II FECVs acquired a canine S gene and express a canine S gene product. 5 Mutations are common in the 7b open reading frame (ORF) of both type I and type II FECVs and may be associated with reduced virulence. 4, 6 The 7b ORF arose in the FECV/CCV lineage and encodes a nonstructural secretory glycoprotein of undetermined function, which is not necessary for viral replication. 7 Deletions, point mutations, and frame-shift mutations leading to early truncation of the 3c ORF also are common. 4, 6 Because FIP-defining mutations may occur in the S, 3c, and 7b genes, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with these genes as a target cannot discriminate between benign FECV and fatal FIPV. [2] [3] [4] Murine hepatitis virus shares most genes with the FECVs, including M (membrane glycoprotein), E (small membrane), N (nucleocapsid), and S (spike glycoprotein), which is post-translationally modified to S1 and S2. 8 The MHV genome, however, also codes for an HE protein and does not contain a 7b ORF. Mutations in the E and S proteins lead to attenuation of MHV. 9 A third coronavirus, HCV-229E, has been implicated in neurological disease in people. 10 ",

MHV is relatively labile genetically (a common characteristic of RNA viruses), and mutant strains with recognition sites that can evade CTL-mediated viral killing apparently increase and become the predominant viral strains in response to CTL-mediated natural selection.

TNF-\u2423 and IL-6 are also produced in the brains of acutely infected mice, but the major cell producing these cytokines is the macrophage.

Effects attributed to IL-6 include recruitment and activation of T-cells and macrophages, expansion of CTLs, modulation of plasma cell differentiation, increased vascular permeability, downregulation of acute phase proteins, and contributions to immune-mediated destruction in the CNS.

The authors suggested that the increased cytokines in the nude mice were produced by CNS glial cells and possibly CD4\u03e9 and CD8\u03e9 subsets. IFN-\u2425 treatment of human neuronal cell cultures markedly increased the susceptibility of cells to infection with HCV-OC43 (although cells were susceptible to 229E without IFN-\u2425 treatment). 87 In this study, the hypothesized role of IFN-\u2425 was induction of MHC class I expression. IFN-\u2425 may increase superoxide dismutase and protect against oxygen radicals, kill virus directly, and increase the cytotoxicity of other effector cells.",

The immunopathogenic mechanisms are expected to have important similarities, but the demyelination that occurs in MHV is a more extensive pathological sequela of coronaviral infection (but not more fatal for the patient) than the focal granulomas that occur in FIP. It can be hypothesized that in FIP, upregulation of cytokines IL-1\u2424, IL-6, IFN-\u2425, and TNF-\u2423 may be important in mediation of destructive inflammation, but cytokines IL-6 and IFN-\u2425 may be important in controlling viral infection, despite adverse inflammatory effects. Cytokine and chemokine alterations in the brains of mice and cats with coronavirus infections may provide valuable clues to the immunopathogenesis of these diseases, as well as possible diagnostic markers and targets for immunological treatment of disease.",

In addition to characterizing the concentrations of cytokines in the CNS of cats with FIP, it will be important to describe the timing of upregulated cytokine transcription. In mice with HMV-JHM, treatment with recombinant IFN-\u2425 resulted in reduced virus load in the liver but not in the brain. 86 If specific pro-inflammatory cytokines are found to be consistently high in cats with neurological FIP, use of cytokine antagonists may eventually be of benefit in treatment.",

            "text": "Successful management of FIP may consist of better methods of prevention as well as management of disease once it occurs. A commercial FIP vaccine is available that consists of a mucosally delivered, temperature-sensitive mutant form of FIPV. The vaccine virus is supposed to undergo replication only in outer oronasal cavities at low temperatures, thus triggering protective antibodies but not FIP. A few controversial studies have documented reduction in FIP as a result of vaccination. 91, 92 Many vaccinated cats, however, fail to seroconvert with either IgG or IgA (Foley and Pedersen, unpublished data) , and independent studies failed to identify vaccine efficacy. 93, 94 Other vaccines, including DNA vaccines, have not progressed beyond experimental stages either because of lack of seroconversion, lack of protection, or both. In contrast with FIP vaccines, vaccines against MHV have been shown to protect mice from challenge with virulent virus. A vaccine with purified spike protein 95 and synthetic S2 led to neutralizing antibodies in vivo. 96, 97 Recombinant subunits against S in tobacco mosaic virus were given subcutaneously or intranasally and were protective against MHV-JHM. 98 The current standard of care for immunomodulation of FIP is immunosuppressive doses of prednisone, to sustain an acceptable quality of life for as long as possible. The effects of steroids include lymphocytolysis, inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism, reduction in cytokine RNA transcription, and nitric oxide synthesis inhibition. 99 Other potentially useful antiinflammatory drugs include antileukocyte antibodies and antioxidants. These treatments are only palliative. A better understanding of the fundamental pathogenesis of FIP will be necessary to offer better treatment and, ultimately, cure of this disease.",
