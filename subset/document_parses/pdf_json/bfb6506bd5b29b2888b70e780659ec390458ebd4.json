The doubling time is the best epidemiological tracer of the course of a pandemic [10] , measuring the rate at which viral transmission is increasing or decreasing. Determining the transmission velocity of SARS-CoV-2 is fundamental for evaluating the impact of intervention measures and implemented policies. In regard to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, studies have reported that the doubling time ranged from 7.4 days in the initial phases of the pandemic [11] to 2.5 in the continuous phases of propagation [12] . In a recent study [13] that reported the doubling times of the current pandemic in various countries, it was mentioned that the doubling time in Mexico was low, but at 135 days, the COVID-19 cases and deaths began to accumulate more rapidly. However, we found no published studies on the relationship between doubling time and the implementation of policies and how this might vary among the 32 Mexican states.",

We used weekly measures of new cases and accumulated cases in order to correspond them to the weekly publications of policies in the Official Journal of the Federation (DOF, Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n). The outcome variable was the number of days required for the number of cumulative COVID-19 cases to double in size (doubling time) [11] . The principal independent variable was the policy index (see below), derived from the number and type of policies implemented during each epidemiological week and published online by the DOF.

Data on public health policies issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were compiled from publicly available official sources, such as government web pages and publications of the DOF of each of the Mexican states (Supplementary File S1). A complete survey of all relevant published documents was undertaken, and each of the COVID-19 response policies was classified into one of the three categories: (1) closures and containment, (2) economic measures and (3) health measures (see Table 1 ). We then selected those policies that were in effect during the epidemiological weeks in question (weeks 13 to 36). The policy index takes into consideration the number of policies implemented during each epidemiological week, adjusted for their relative values. In order to assign relative values to each of the policies according to their potential relevance for mitigating viral transmission, each policy was scored on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = not relevant) by a panel of 10 multidisciplinary experts in public health (Supplementary File S2). The mean score for each policy was calculated, and only those policies with an average score greater than 7 (a total of 10 policies; see Table 1 ) were considered in the calculation of the policy index. We then used a common way to create a composite \"policy index\"-a simple multiplicative index, according to the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), which offers a systematic manner for carrying out a rigorous tracking of governmental COVID-19 responses in all countries and times [14] .",

Therefore, this model assumes that there is a difference of intercept for each individual state, and the intercept is a random variable. In the random effects model, there are two residual components. The first is the residual as a whole, where the residual is a combination of cross-section and time series. The second residual is an individual residual, which is a random characteristic of the i-th unit observation and remains at all times. We used a balanced panel that considered a tracking time from epidemiological weeks 13 to 36 for 31 Mexican states. That is, the analyzed sample had 24 observations for each state, obtaining a total of 744 observations.",

Likewise, the policy index was significantly positively associated with lower velocity of viral transmission (doubling time; regression coefficient = 1.378; Table 3 ); in other words, an increase of one percent in the policy index score was associated with a 1.37-day increase in the doubling time. That is, greater prevalence of poverty, higher health index and greater policy index were all associated with an increase in doubling time (slower viral transmission) and a flattening of the epidemic curve.

We observed that all Mexican states established policies aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19, and the principal measures were those centered on public information campaigns and closing of work places, in line with those measures established by the federal government. As expected, our data indicated that infection doubling time increased in association with the implementation of health policies. This relationship can be observed graphically in certain individual states and is further supported by the results of the panel data model analysis. However, the latter analysis revealed that the effect of policy implementation was modest compared to other factors that were examined. The relatively small effect of the policy index might have been due to several factors, including the influence of a number of cultural and sociodemographic factors, discussed below. One important consideration is that the individual states of Mexico are constitutionally autonomous with respect to the implementation of health policy [20], and we found that there was considerable variability in the states' responses in this regard. Due to spread of the contagion through interstate travel, the lack of adequate policies in one state would negatively impact the efficacy of policies that may have otherwise been successful in bordering states.",

There are a number of factors that could influence the population's cooperation with governmental information campaigns, recommendations and mandates. Among these are education, trust in the government [21] , the public's exposure to erroneous information and the extent to which policies are enforced. In the present case of Mexico, close communication has generally been maintained between the federal government and the population during the pandemic, and a large percentage of policies have been focused on public in-formation campaigns. With respect to the enforcement of policy, optimal compliance to social distancing policies may require enforcement, and even then, compliance tends to decrease with time, which necessitates implementing additional measures [22] [23] [24] . In Latin American countries, an analysis showed that policies of obligatory confinement and use of masks in Colombia had a positive impact in controlling the epidemic, whereas in other countries such as Ecuador and Peru, these measures were not obligatory and enforced, and a positive impact was not observed [25] . In the case of Mexico, in general, public cooperation with containment and distancing policies was not obligatory or strictly enforced. Nevertheless, obligatory health control measures are not necessarily perceived as negative if they are preceded by a strong information campaign, such as that which was applied by the Mexican government, as well as confidence in the local government, which generates positive behavior and increases confidence in authorities [26] . Aside from these factors, a number of socioeconomic factors might make it impractical or impossible for some individuals to follow certain containment and closure policies.",

When mobility variables were considered in the panel data model, both of these factors were positively associated with the doubling time. The association of prevalence of poverty (percentage of population below the poverty line) with slower spread of infection could be related to a number of characteristics of this population. This sector of the population tends to be younger, which lowers the vulnerability to severe illness from COVID-19 [27] , as well as generally being associated with rural areas of low population density. With regards to the policies that we documented, it was shown that the majority of states implemented measures of income support directed at this population with limited resources, which could partially explain a lower transmission velocity, although the effects of economic and social conditions on viral transmission velocity have not been established with certainty [28] . On the other hand, per capita income was also independently associated with slower infection rates. This seemingly contradictory result might be explained by considering that individuals earning a higher income tend to have more possibilities for working from the home, while those with lower incomes are more likely to have employment that requires them to work outside of the home and to use public transport [7] . Thus, for those with a lower income, it may not be possible to adhere to stay-at-home and social distancing policies. In Latin American countries, a clear influence of poverty and urban populations on the COVID-19 death rate among confirmed cases has not been observed [25] . However, in other countries, the epidemic tends to maintain a greater growth rate in urban populations with lower rates of poverty.",

The population of Mexico City is also extremely mobile: 22 million people are mobilized daily, which is equivalent to one-sixth of the entire population of the country. Moreover, public transportation in Mexico City is used extensively. Due, at least in part, to the extreme population density and mobility, it was necessary to implement a greater number of policies in Mexico City, including containment measures and, above all, investment in hospital attention and follow-up of cases within the community. Such policies apparently improved response capacity [30, 31] , which was, in turn, reflected in a slower transmission velocity and a greater capacity for medical attention in hospitals, which have not reported occupation rates of more than 75% of total capacity.",

In order to address this problem locally, targeted restrictions on mobility could be implemented, such as limiting access to public parks; at the state and national levels, mobility between regions of high and lower population densities could be discouraged or restricted. Areas such as public transportation hubs could be venues for public information campaigns and vaccination programs, thereby reaching the particularly vulnerable mobile population. The observed association between health index and slower doubling time suggests that a greater investment in general healthcare according to the necessities of the target population will be required in order to improve the responsiveness to future pandemics.
