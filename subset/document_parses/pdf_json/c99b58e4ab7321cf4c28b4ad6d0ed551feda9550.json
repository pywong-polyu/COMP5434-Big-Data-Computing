Indeed, the commercial, non-medical setting applies 20 min of WB-EMS only once a week. However, this setting conflicts with the approved scientific approach of higher training frequencies. Using data from an ongoing study on WB-EMS and golf performance as a vehicle, we evaluate the effect of once weekly WB-EMS on changes of fatty muscle infiltration, as a crucial parameter of muscle quality. Fifty-four moderately physically active male amateur golfers 18-70 years old were randomly allocated to a WB-EMS (n = 27) with a standard setting of once weekly 20 min and a non-WB-EMS control group (CG, n = 27). Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) volume and intrafascial muscle tissue (MT) volume per unit of intrafascial volume as determined by magnetic resonance imaging were used to characterize muscle quality. Intention to treat analysis with multiple imputation was applied. WB-EMS was conducted at the participants' homes; thus, the attendance rate was close to 100%. After 16 weeks of intervention, we observed increases in volume-adjusted IMAT (p = 0.040) and decreases in MT (p = 0.206) in the CG. IMAT decreased in the WB-EMS group (p = 0.215), while MT increased significantly (p = 0.032). Of importance, group difference (i.e., \"effects\") for intra-group changes in volume-adjusted IMAT (effect size: d\u00b4 = 0.66; p = 0.028) and MT (d\u00b4 = 0.70; p = 0.020) was significant for both parameters. Once weekly WB-EMS application significantly affects muscle quality of the mid-thigh in moderately active, healthy men 18-70 years old.",

            "text": "Whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) is promoted as a time-efficient, novel exercise technology for enhancing musculoskeletal parameters in non-athletic adults. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that WB-EMS significantly affects muscle strength and mass in non-athletic cohorts . However, with few exceptions (Kemmler et al., 2016; Micke et al., 2021) , all WB-EMS trials applied higher training frequencies (\u22651.5 vs. 1 sessions/ week) compared to the commercial, non-medical application 1 with its rapidly growing market. Thus, the untested generalization of scientific results to the commercial setting is hardy justified. However, applying the standard setting of commercial WB-EMS in Germany (once weekly 20 min), we observed significant positive effects on maximum trunk and leg-extensor strength in a cohort of amateur golfers 18-70 years old (Zink-R\u00fcckel et al., 2021) . Nevertheless, apart from this proof of principle, it is important to determine underlying mechanisms for strength changes after WB-EMS application. \"Muscle quality\" might be an adequate candidate for this approach. Although there is an ongoing debate as to which parameters characterize muscle quality (MQ), fatty muscle infiltration as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applying enhanced segmentation and automated quantification software may well be a reliable and clinically relevant morphometric predictor of MQ (Chaudry et al., 2020; Engelke et al., 2020) . In the present study, we thus aimed to determine the effect of once weekly 20 min WB-EMS on fatty muscle infiltration at the mid-thigh in moderately active men 18-70 years old. In order to adequately characterize this feature, we analyzed changes in muscle tissue (MT) volume and in intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) volume, both normalized to changes in intrafascial volume. Briefly, IMAT is the combination of larger agglomerations of adipocytes within muscles that are visible in MR images with the perimuscular adipose tissue. Within the fascia, MT is the complement of IMAT but still contains adipocytes not visible in the MR images as well as intracellular lipids. Thus, even muscle tissue contains fat (Figure 1) .",

After group allocation, the principal investigator (CZ-R) enrolled participants and informed them in detail about their duties and corresponding dos and don'ts. Of importance, due to the close personal relationships between many participants, we consider a blinding of participants (e.g., by sham WB-EMS) to be less promising. Since parallel successful blinding of treatment providers (i.e., EMS instructors) was not realistic in our setting (see below), emphasis was placed on blinding research assistants so that they were not aware of the participants' group allocation.",

We applied a once per week 20 min standard protocol with bipolar electric current, an impulse frequency of 85 Hz, an impulse width of 350 \u03bcs with 6 s of EMS stimulation with a direct impulse boost intermitted by 4 s of rest for 16 weeks (mid-January to mid-May 2020). During the impulse phase, two sets with 6-8 reps of 8 slight movements/exercises in a standing position were performed. Exercise/impulse intensity was prescribed using the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) approach. Applying the Borg CR-10 scale, after 4 weeks of WB-EMS conditioning with lower impulse intensity, instructors encouraged participants to exercise at a RPE of \"6-7\" (i.e., \"hard+ to very hard\"). During the sessions, the impulse intensity of each electrode was adjusted every 3 min in close cooperation with participants to maintain the prescribed RPE during the session. All sessions were closely supervised with a ratio of one instructor to one participant. Here, we are strictly following the protocol applied by the vast majority of commercial, non-medical WB-EMS facilities -at least in Europe. However, for logistic reasons and finally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WB-EMS workouts were performed at the participants' home or a location of their choice. Further, WB-EMS was carried out with a strict COVID-19 compliant hygiene concept. This includes strict adherence to the distance rules and wearing of medical masks. Only one instructor and one participant were allowed in the room. The equipment was cleaned and disinfected by the instructor before and after the WB-EMS application.",

The protocol included a T1-weighted turbo spin echo and a 6-point Dixon gradient echo sequence to determine proton density fat fraction (FF; Grimm et al., 2018) . Intensities in the Dixon FF images ranged from 0 to 1,000 corresponding to an FF of 0.0-100.0%. Image analysis was conducted using Medical Image Analysis Framework (FAU). Segmentation masks were generated in the T1 images and registered to the quantitative Dixon FF images as described by (Chaudry et al., 2020) . This method has been successfully applied in other studies (Chaudry et al., 2020; Engelke et al., 2020; Ghasemikaram et al., 2021) . Based on the histogram of the FF values of all voxels of the intra fascia volume, a threshold was determined to separate IMAT from MT. In the same volume, intrafascial fat fraction can easily be determined as the average FF value. The ratio of IMAT volume to intrafascia volume was calculated in order to adjust for changes in volume of the fascia to address elastic deformations between baseline and follow-up measurements (Figure 1) .",

An increase of volume-adjusted IMAT reflects relative muscle tissue atrophy and vice versa, because our analysis approach divided the intrafascia volume into IMAT and muscle tissue. Although non-volumeadjusted parameters were not significant, they show a consistent picture of the training effects. Numerically, IMAT and muscle tissue fat fraction decreased and muscle volume increased in the training group with opposite effects in the control group. The present study confirmed our results of a recent highintensity resistance training (HIT-RT) approach with a cohort of older men with osteosarcopenia (Ghasemikaram et al., 2021) . However, the latter study (Ghasemikaram et al., 2021) observed higher effects in particular on volume-adjusted IMAT 2 (d\u00b4 = 87) as determined by identical methods on the same 3-Tesla MRI scanner.

(1) Although our innovative MRI approach directly targets the quantitative assessment of fat infiltration from Dixon FF images (Chaudry et al., 2020) , other studies used slightly different approaches, which complicates comparison of results across studies and calls for further standardization. (2) Unlike others (Ogawa et al., 2020) , we also did not determine adipose tissue of individual thigh muscles. We justify this approach with the fact that WB-EMS application of the upper leg stimulates all the hamstring and quadriceps muscle groups simultaneously, although one may argue that superficial muscle groups might benefit more (Paillard, 2018) . (3) Due to the high amount of lost-to-FU data that had to be imputed, we observed a high variation of the individual changes at least compared to the PP analysis that consistently revealed more significant effects. (4) We included male 5 amateur golf players, which might not be the most relevant cohort for determining fatty muscle infiltration, however. We agree, but considering age, anthropometric and physical activity, the participants' characteristics ( Table 1) widely meet those of a non-athletic male population, so we feel that our results can be widely generalized. Nevertheless, our male cohort was very heterogeneous with respect to age. Therefore, we compare participants 45 years and younger vs. participants older than 45 years for our main outcomes in order to check for an age-dependent relationship. In summary, we do not observe relevant differences between the groups; however, the statistical power to address this issue was limited. (5) Another minor bias was that our sample size analysis was based on the initial primary outcome 5 We focus on one gender because [although not undisputed (Staron et al., 1994; Roth et al., 2000) ] there is some evidence in humans for gender differences in the muscle mass response to resistance training (Hakkinen et al., 1998; Ivey et al., 2000) . average \"golf score, \" which was lost. However, as expected, the statistical power was high enough to address MRI data successfully. In summary, we provide further evidence for a positive effect of WB-EMS on muscle quality as determined by MRI while assessing means of fatty muscle infiltration. Of importance however, future studies should further verify this result for more vulnerable cohorts with sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, or osteosarcopenia, i.e., people unable or unmotivated to start conventional muscle strengthening exercise.",
