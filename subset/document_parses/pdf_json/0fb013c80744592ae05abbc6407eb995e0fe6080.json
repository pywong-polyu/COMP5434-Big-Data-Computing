Telehealth will likely remain an important model of care delivery given the persistence of social distancing and benefits of telehealthcare, including improved access to care and patient satisfaction. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Four categories of telehealth currently exist: synchronous (e.g., use of telephone or video technology to conduct real-time clinical care), remote patient monitoring (e.g., use of technology to track patients' data outside the healthcare setting such as blood sugar, blood pressure), asynchronous (e.g., use of secure messaging between patient and providers), and mobile health (e.g., use of apps to send messages to patients, promote healthy behaviors such as health coaching and reminders to take medicine). 6 Our paper focuses on synchronous telehealth visits, the most common type of telehealthcare delivery for physicians. 7",

Since each learning community has its own unique goals and barriers, it is important to individualize and integrate formal telehealth curricula into undergraduate medical education (UME), graduate medical education (GME), and continuing medical education (CME). In 2021, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) developed six comprehensive telehealth competencies for medical school graduates, residency graduates, and experienced physicians (Table 1) . 10 The updated 2021 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Milestones 2.0 included only one competency specific to digital health ( Table 2 ), but others are adaptable to telehealth-based assessments. 11 This perspective paper describes unique strategies for the successful integration of the AAMC telehealth competencies and ACGME milestones into medical education, identifies areas for faculty development in telehealth teaching, and offers new direct observation tools to assess telehealth competencies among medical students, residents, and faculty.",

These included, but are not limited to, objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), simulation exercises, and virtual visit skills checklists.

Telehealth-specific direct observations of learners are prime opportunities, yet under-utilized, in the virtual setting to effectively assess telehealth competencies. 18 The discussion below focuses on three particular competency areas for integration between AAMC and ACGME: communication, data collection and assessment, and patient safety with appropriate use of telehealth. These three competency areas are high-impact, easily assessed through direct observation, and represent foundational skills in telehealth delivery for learners. 18",

Trainees must demonstrate the ability to develop effective rapport, assess the patient's environment, and know how to incorporate the patient's social supports. While not explicit to telehealth, two ACGME Milestones 2.0, the Patient and Family-Centered Communication and the Professional Behavior, do overlap with the AAMC telehealth competencies by addressing the therapeutic relationship and communication barriers in unique, complex situations. 11 Both AAMC and ACGME recommendations encompass \"web-side manner\" and focus on creating a professional virtual environment (e.g., lighting, sound, background), ensuring privacy, introducing technology, setting collaborative agendas, and eliciting understanding from patients (e.g., teach-back techniques). 10, 11 Standard UME communication courses teach core interpersonal skills important to digital health; so they are easily modifiable to teach telehealth-specific communication skills and incorporate evidence-based guidelines focused on humanism, professionalism, and web-side manner. 19 Brief didactics can teach these basic communication skills in telehealth encounters; more complex scenarios, such as the management of privacy concerns, patient education, or incorporation of patient social supports, may be best taught through standardized patient (SP) encounters.

Each visit draws learners into patients' homes and supplies real-life data about their living situation. For example, learners can view the types of foods in their patients' pantry or reconcile medication bottles alongside family members.

Digital health access and literacy are increasingly recognized as social determinants of health; thus, trainees need to gauge patients' access to technology and ability to engage in digital platforms. 30 These AAMC expectations align well with ACGME Milestone 2.0 on digital health to safely integrate telehealth into clinical practice. 11 Higher-level concepts and skills related to patient safety and appropriate integration of team members require learners to have some foundational knowledge and prior clinical experience with recognizing high-risk clinical situations and unstable patients. Therefore, these skills may be best reserved for senior students and residents and are most appropriate for Case-based discussions and pre-clinic team huddles can help to highlight high-risk patient safety concerns and teach ways to triage patients for in-person or emergency care. 14, 28, 31, 32 Faculty should direct learners to survey the patient environment for safety, identify cases for interdisciplinary collaborative care, and contextualize patient characteristics and disease presentations during virtual care encounters. 32 Similarly, learners may encounter patients with sensitive issues or limited ability to engage in virtual visits. Faculty should encourage learner self-reflection on patient or practice barriers and coach them through potential solutions. For example, faculty can prompt learners to use closed-captioning for the hearing-impaired, teach-back techniques for patients with low health literacy, or interpreter service for those with limited English proficiency.

Thus, faculty themselves may lack comfort or competence with telemedicine. Various online telemedicine modules and didactics from ACP, American Medical Association (AMA), and Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) offer extensive training to faculty with limited telehealth experiences. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Often faculty telehealth curricula come in bite-sized skills courses with introductory materials and short selfassessments. Adult learning principles are necessary to advance physician competency-based education in telehealth and harness not only physicians' existing skills level but also institutions' technical resources. 42 Interactive educational environments (e.g., targeted workshops, case-based role plays, just-in-time workplace-based sessions) are essential for faculty to practice telehealth skills, increase confidence in appropriate telehealth use, enhance virtual communication skills, and improve data gathering and virtual exam skills. The Telehealth Mini-Residency for Providers by the VHA National Simulation Center is one such exemplar of an interactive telehealth program for faculty learners. 32 Peer observation and feedback are well-cited methods for educators to strengthen clinical skills and teaching techniques in the inpatient and outpatient setting. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] Little guidance exists in peer-reviewed literature on using direct observation for faculty skills development in telehealth settings. Most faculty, like trainees, are telehealth novices and may lack technology savviness. 48, 49 Some faculty training uses videorecorded teaching encounters to facilitate peer feedback. 50 Peer-to-peer direct observation of real-time virtual clinical encounters is another potential strategy to accelerate telehealth skills development in faculty.",

Real-time feedback and faculty role-modeling of telehealth etiquette or virtual exam maneuvers are important methods for learners to develop their own web-side manner, data gathering, and virtual exam skills. Post-visit huddles can provide dedicated space for learners to reflect on their performance, allow faculty to share targeted feedback related to learners' goals, and facilitate co-development of action plans for subsequent virtual visits. The flexible workflow of telehealth allows for these post-visit huddles to occur immediately after a virtual encounter or at the end of the clinic session.",

These assessment tools are based on literature review of telehealth curricula and are anchored in the 2021 AAMC competencies and related ACGME milestones. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] The tools are applicable during standardized patient or real-time clinical encounters, and can be used for the entire encounter or specific portions of the virtual visit. Assessments should be brief, focused, in-the-moment, and frequent, in adherence to best practices in direct observation. 54, 55 ",
