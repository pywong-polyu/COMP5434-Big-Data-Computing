It might contribute to the fast spread of COVID-19. However, there are few scientific reports about quantitative comparison of COVID-19 exposure dose (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) for the susceptible individual when the viruses were released from the larynx or lungs. In this paper, a typical numerical model was built based on a breathing human model with real respiratory tract. By using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, two kinds of virus released sites in the infected individual's respiratory tract (larynx, lungs), seven kinds of particle sizes between 1 and 50 \u03bcm, three kinds of expiratory flow rates: calm (10 L/min), moderate (30 L/min) and intense (90 L/min) were used to compare the particle deposition proportion and escape proportion. The inhalation dose and the adhesion dose of the susceptible individual were quantified. The results showed that COVID-19 virus-containing droplets and aerosols might be released into the environment at higher proportions (39.1%-44.2%) than viruses that replicate in lungs only (15.3%-37.1%). The exposure doses (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) of the susceptible individual in different situations were discussed. The susceptible individual suffered a higher exposure dose when the viruses were released from the larynx rather than lungs (the difference for 1 \u03bcm particles was 1.2-2.2 times). This study provides a possible explanation for the higher transmission risk of COVID-19 virus compared to other viruses and some control advice of COVID-19 in typical indoor environments were also discussed.",

It is reported that COVID-19 virus can replicate and shed independently in the larynx of the infected individual in the early stages of infection (Wolfel et al., 2020) , then enter the environment, which is different from other viruses, e.g. SARS that usually replicates in lungs only. The reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 was generally regarded to be between 2 and 3, similar to SARS (D' Arienzo and Coniglio, 2020; Li et al., 2020) . But the number of people infected with COVID-19 is much higher than that of SARS. For COVID-19, the long incubation period, the absence of symptoms at the initial stage of infection (Slifka and Gao, 2020) , and the infectivity of asymptomatic infected individual (Bai et al., 2020) make the prevention and control difficult.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have provided evidence of airborne transmission about COVID-19 (Jayaweera et al., 2020; Kenarkoohi et al., 2020; Noorimotlagh et al., 2020; Richard et al., 2020) . COVID-19 virus is around 100 nm in diameter , and usually needs to be attached to carriers for airborne transmission (Jayaweera et al., 2020; Maleki et al., 2021) . Droplets and aerosols produced by human respiratory activities (breathing, speaking, coughing, sneezing, etc.) are the typical carriers (Kutter et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017) . They suspend, evaporate and diffuse in the environment. Some may deposit on objects or human surfaces, others may be inhaled into human respiratory tract, creating a potential risk of infection (Kutter et al., 2018) . Tens of thousands of SARS virus-containing particles are exhaled by an infected individual during a single breath activity (Gupta et al., 2009) , and about hundreds of SARS virus-containing particles inhaled by healthy persons may lead to infection (Watanabe et al., 2010) . With a dividing line as 5 \u03bcm, large particles are classified as droplets and small particles as aerosols (Liu et al., 2017) . Droplets have a shorter diffusion distance, while aerosols can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time and cause wide spread. In general, large size droplets are mainly affected by gravity and have a shorter diffusion distance, while aerosols may remain suspended for a long time and cause wide spread of the virus (Feng et al., 2020) . COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in inadequately ventilated environments, and ozone, high temperature and low humidity may reduce the activity of the virus (Yao et al., 2020) . It is reported that particles exhaled from lungs are more likely to be deposited in the larynx (Guo et al., 2020) and fine particles (<5 \u03bcm) contained 8.8-fold (95% CI 4.1-19) more viral copies than large particles (Milton et al., 2013) . These findings reveal a possibility that COVID-19 viruses released from larynx might have a higher proportion exhaled into the environment and cause a higher exposure dose than other viruses that replicate in lungs only. A recent study indicated that the probability of airborne transmission due to respiratory aerosol in outdoor conditions might be much lower than that in indoor environments (Belosi et al., 2020) . The ventilation rate had an obvious effect on in the indoor air environment (Jiang et al., 2009; Sundell et al., 2011; Mousavi and Grosskopf, 2015) . Propagation distance may be different in windy and windless conditions: under windless conditions, droplets deposited fast and the propagation distance was regarded as within 2 m; under windy conditions, droplet propagation can be as far as 6 m (Dbouk and Drikakis, 2020) . But this conclusion is also controversial, for another study showed that the droplets released by a sneeze can spread 8 m even in windless situations (Lok, 2016) . A recent study showed that the large droplet route might only dominate when the subjects are within 0.2 m during talking (Chen et al., 2020) . Artificial ventilation or personalised ventilation systems may be effective to improve air quality (Harbizadeh et al., 2019) .",

To date, some studies focused on the effects of respiratory patterns on the inhalation of viruses or other particulate matter in indoor environments have been done (Li et al., 2013; Shang and Inthavong, 2019; Xu et al., 2020a) . They provided validations of the numerical simulation method by using manikin or respiratory tract model in human inhalation exposure, and suggested that it was necessary for the comprehensive analysis of the particle inhalation within the realistic scenarios. There is an urgent need to better understand the indoor transmission of COVID-19 virus particles released from larynx and quantify the exposure dose and infection risk of the susceptible individual in the environment. This is critical to apply appropriate infection control measures and slow its spread.",

            "text": "ANSYS FLUENT v18.0 was used for simulation. The flow field in the respiratory tract of the infected individual was an important prerequisite for determining the accuracy of particle deposition results. It was found that Shear Stress Transfer (SST) k-\u03c9 turbulence model was in good agreement with the PIV experimental results in the respiratory tract during the exhalation (Xu et al., 2020b) and it predicted the turbulent kinetic energy k more accurately (Guo et al., 2020) . So we took the SST k-\u03c9 turbulence model for calculation. The SIMPLE algorithm was used to decouple the pressure and velocity, and the convective and diffusive convective terms in the second order upwind scheme were adopted. The infected individual was put in the steady-state of exhalation and the susceptible individual was in the steady-state of inspiration. For boundary conditions, G5 bronchi inlet was selected as velocity inlet boundary for the steady-state expiration (the infected individual) and inspiration (the susceptible individual), respectively. Other inner surface of respiratory tract, room walls, and human body surfaces were set as no-slip wall boundary. The main influence of temperature was reflected in the human body's thermal plume and the buoyancy of particles Naseri et al., 2017; Licina et al., 2014) . They were also taken into account. The temperature of human skin was set as 35 \u2022 C, the environment temperature was set as 26 \u2022 C, and the heat transfer coefficient h was simplified as 4-10 W/(m 2 \u22c5K), according to breathing flow rates (Yang et al., 2018) . As for relative humidity (RH), a high RH of 99.5% may lead to higher deposition fractions on human bodies, while a low RH of 40% may lead to a longer suspended time of droplets (Feng et al., 2020) . But the impact was more obvious in long-distance transmission (>1.5 m). Therefore, we chose a medium RH of 60% in this study. Three different flow rates for the infected individual with oral exhalation were designed: calm (10 L/min), moderate (30 L/min) and intense (90 L/min). The area of G5 Bronchi inlet was 189 mm 2 , the velocity for different flow rates and other parameters were shown in Table 1 .",

The Discrete Phase Model (DPM) was selected to simulate virus-containing particles. People infected with COVID-19 have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection, and release virus particles mainly through the act of exhalation (Wolfel et al., 2020) . Surface Injection in DPM was selected to release particles, in which the larynx and G5 bronchi (represented lungs) were chosen to be the release surfaces, respectively. Steady-state flow field was calculated first, and virus-containing particles were added after the flow field converged. The particle trajectory was tracked by Lagrange model. Near-wall modification was also taken into account (Xu et al., 2017) . To simplify the calculation, the particle diameter and volume were regarded as constant, and the shape was considered to be ideal spherical. Previous studies have shown that the sizes of particles released during human exhalation are mostly concentrated between 1-50 \u03bcm (Guo et al., 2020; Han et al., 2014) . Therefore, 7 kinds of virus-containing particles with typical diameters of 1 \u03bcm, 2 \u03bcm, 3 \u03bcm, 5 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm, 20 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm were selected. The particle density was similar to liquid water, with a value of 1000 kg/m 3 . The air density was set as 1.2 kg/m 3 . The trajectory of each droplet or aerosol was calculated by solving the droplet movement equation whose theory is Newton's second law:",

Fig. 2 shows the streamline for different expiratory flow rates: calm (10 L/min), moderate (30 L/min) and intense (90 L/min), and it seems that there is not much difference in the streamline shape. We found a high speed area in the larynx, and the airflow direction will change at oropharynx, which may cause the high deposition proportions of virus particles in oropharynx or larynx and below areas. In addition, there is an angle of ~30 \u2022 between the exhaled air flow and the horizontal direction, which might give the exhaled particles an initial velocity component toward the ground. As for the effectiveness of flow filed, we have used PIV equipment to measure the flow field inside the respiratory tract in previous study (Xu et al., 2020b) , and the results were in good agreement with this numerical simulation. Fig. 3 shows the deposition proportion and escape proportion of virus-containing particles released from larynx and lungs at different breathing intensities, respectively. Here \"deposition\" means that the particles were deposited in infected individual's respiratory tract and not released into the environment. The \"escape\" means the opposite. Totally, COVID-19 virus-containing particles released from larynx were more likely to escape into the environment (39.1%-44.2%) than those released from lungs (15.3%-37.1%), especially for small particles. It indicated that the release site had a significant influence on the proportion of deposition and escape. For example, the escape proportions of 1 \u03bcm virus-containing aerosols in case (Q = 30 L/min, larynx) and case (Q = 90 L/min, larynx) were 56.8% (Figs. 3b) and 71.2% (Fig. 3c) , while the escape proportions in case (Q = 30 L/min, lungs) and case (Q = 90 L/ min, lungs) were 50.3% (Figs. 3e) and 39.3% (Fig. 3f) , respectively.",

Second, the structure of the lower respiratory tract (especially bronchi) is complex and has many bifurcations, and the virus-containing particles are more likely to deposit on the inner surface of the respiratory tract during transport. For small particles, they have good tracking characteristics to the flow field, so that they are more likely to be exhaled with the flow field than to settle on the inner surface of the respiratory tract.",

            "text": "It is worth noting that the majority of particles larger than 10 \u03bcm deposited in the respiratory tract and cannot be exhaled out. However, some previous measurements of the exhaled droplets showed that there were some large droplets (50-100 \u03bcm) in the exhaled air (Xie et al., 2009) . One possible explanation is that the large droplets exhaled by people might be generated above the larynx, e.g. oral cavity. On the other hand, this result may also explain the high concentration of COVID-19 virus in throat swabs and the low concentration of COVID-19 virus in oral swabs. In addition, virus-containing particles were assumed to be captured and deposited once they contacted the inner surface of the respiratory tract. Sometimes the virus-containing particles may fall off again in the breath, or do not deposit and be released into the environment. This assumption may result in a lower escape proportion for virus-containing particles than they actually did. Fig. 4 shows the regional deposition proportion in the infected individual's respiratory tract during different intensity expiratory, for the virus-containing particles released from larynx and lungs respectively. It indicated that the release site of virus-containing particles can also influence the regional deposition in the infected individual's respiratory tract during exhalation. When virus-containing particles were released from the infected individual's larynx, oropharynx was the region with the highest deposition proportion with proportions of 7.0% (1 \u03bcm) and 29.5% (10 \u03bcm) when Q = 30 L/min (Fig. 4b) . When released from the infected individual's lungs, a large proportion of virus-containing particles will be deposited in the larynx and below areas, with proportions of 33.8% (1 \u03bcm) and 64.5% (10 \u03bcm) at Q = 30 L/min (Fig. 4e) . It might explain why the escape proportion of virus-containing particles released from larynx is higher than those released from lungs (in section 3.2).",

In indoor conditions, the respiratory flow rates are usually not too high. 10 L/min and 30 L/min were selected as typical respiration rates for discussion. The diffusion of viral particles was shown in Fig. 6 . Many large droplets might deposit within 0.5 m after being released. It indicated that keeping a social distance is an effective measure to reduce the exposure of large-droplets dose. Ventilation had an effect on the upward and distant movement of particles. Affected by factors such as buoyancy, some particles had obvious upward trends with the indoor airflow, entering the respiratory area of the susceptible individual, finally causing the inhalation dose. There were also many particles that deposit on the body surface of the susceptible individual, and this part of the virus-containing particles contributed to the adhesion dose.",

The results provide evidence that the characteristic of independent replication and release in the larynx of COVID-19 virus might increase the exposure dose of the susceptible individual and might cause wide dissemination of COVID-19. COVID-19 virus released from larynx can escape into the surrounding environment at a higher proportion (39.1%-44.2%) compared with viruses that replicate in the lungs only (15.3%-37.1%), e.g. SARS.

For the exposure dose analysis of susceptible individuals in the environment, variables such as ventilation should be taken into account based on the design of actual indoor scenes, so as to reduce the risk of indoor environment to an acceptable range (balance economy and safety) as far as possible. These results are also expected to be combined with biological experimental data in the future to verify the validity of the results. We will also try to use the segmented respiratory tract model to conduct experiments of particle deposition during respiration, so as to further verify the results.",
