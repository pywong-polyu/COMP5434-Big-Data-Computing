The possible risk factors of severe or critical illness were investigated with Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression models for univariate and multivariate analyses to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For the prediction indicators, optimum cut-off points were determined by calculating Youden's index. The efficacy of risk prediction of severe or critical illness was examined through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: A total of 110 older adults with COVID-19 were included, in which 21 (19.1%) patients had severe or critical illness of COVID-19. Multivariable regression analysis showed that CD4 cells and D-dimer were independent risk factors. D-dimer, CD4 cells, and CD cells/ D-dimer ratio with cut-off values of 0.65 (mg/L), 268 (cell/\u00b5L) and 431 were in the prediction of severe or critical illness of older adults with COVID-19. The AUC value of D-dimer, CD4 cells, CD4 cells/D-dimer ratio, the tandem combination and the parallel combination to predict severe or critical illness of the older adults with COVID-19 were 0.703, 0.804, 0.794, 0.812 and 0.694, respectively. Conclusion: D-dimer and CD4 cells either by themselves or in combination have demonstrated predictive value in risk stratification as well as established the prognosis of severe or critical illness in older adults with COVID-19.",

Advance age has been reported as a significant predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. 2 The mortality of older adult patients with COVID-19 is higher than that of young and middle-aged patients and older adult patients with COVID-19 are more likely to progress to severe disease. 2 A recent meta-analysis found that the case-fatality rate (CFR), proportion of severe cases and incidents of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were significantly higher in studies with a high proportion of older adult patients. 3 Furthermore, previous studies showed that older adult patients with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. 4, 5 Given a large aging population worldwide, it is important to understand the characteristics and the susceptibility on older adult patients with COVID-19. Up to now, there has been few reports on risk assessment of severe or critical illness of COVID-19 in older adults. 2, 5, 6 This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of clinical characteristics of older adult patients with COVID-19 and the determinants of prognosis.",

Immune dysregulation and inflammatory response can increase the level of D-dimer and decrease CD4 cells. In the early stage of the disease, when the number of CD4 cells count decreases to a certain number and the D-dimer increase to a certain level, the risk event trend of COVID-19 will be continuously affected. To eliminate the bias, we exclude patients who have other infectious complications, which might greatly influence the CD4 cell count and D-dimer level. Therefore, the immune dysregulation, cytokine disorder and multi-organ damage can be continuously induced in the state of low cellular immunity and high coagulation to a certain extent, leading to the severe or critical events of COVID-19.",
