Using data from Twitter, YouTube, and an archive of debunked misinformation stories, we found two important patterns. First, that retweet rates on Twitter clearly suggest that commentators benefited from talking about the case, which got higher engagement than other topics. Second, that politicians, in particular, were instrumental in changing the course of the discourse by referring to the case as 'murder', rather than 'suicide'. In conclusion, we consider the effects of Rajput's outsider status as a small-town implant in the film industry within the broader narrative of systemic injustice, as well as the gendered aspects of mob justice that have taken aim at his former partner in the months since.",

The timing of the suicide, in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown with many urban middle-class Indians stuck at home, probably had a role in driving up purchase for the story. The Sushant Singh Rajput case came at a point when the prime time for a while had been saturated simply with news of the virus. The story offered a diversion. While the massive win for the actor's posthumously released film offered a silver lining, the creation of villains gave people an object for vengeance.",

BJP uses 'Bollywood' a lot more than the INC.

In contrast, BJP very sparsely discusses Arnab Goswami. Mostly, INC leaders refer to Arnab Goswami in a negative context using hashtags like #ArnabTheNewsProstitute.\u2022 'Kangana Ranaut' is a frequently used hashtag by both parties, but the messaging is generally pro-Kangana on the BJP side with hashtags like #NationStandsWithKangana, but negative on the INC side, which uses hashtags like #CastesistKangana to refer to her.\u2022 The top hashtags of BJP are around invoking the CBI such as #CBIForSSR, but also a significant number are direct attacks at the Maharashtra government such as #BabyPenguin and #MahaGovtExposed \u2022 The top mentions on the BJP side are for Twitter accounts with major online social media following including Subramanian Swamy, Kangana Ranaut and Republic TV.

The head of the police in Bihar went on a widely covered television interview, on which he spoke disparagingly of Rajput's partner. He had more media coverage when the officer sent to Mumbai was unable to do his investigations due to COVID quarantine rule.
