Although it is one of the first discovered ISGs, the antiviral activities of human interferon-inducible transmembrane [IFITM (huIFITM)] protein against pathogenic viruses had not been well characterized until 2009 (1) . Using the siRNA screening strategy in osteosarcoma cells, it was found that knockdown of huIFITM proteins strongly promoted the replication of influenza virus in vitro. Further study found that huIFITM proteins have a broad antiviral activity against several other pathogenic viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, flaviviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses, and alphaviruses (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . In addition, one study discovered that mice homozygous for IFITM3 deletion are more susceptible to influenza virus infection and exhibit more weight loss compared with the wild-type littermates (6) . It was also reported that a synonymous rs12252 SNP in huIFITM gene alters a predicted splice acceptor site and is associated with the hospitalization in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (7) .",

IFITM5 is involved in bone mineralization and maturation (8) . The function of IFITM10 remains unclear. IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 are associated with germ cell homing and maturation, tumor suppression, cell adhesion, and virus inhibition in innate immunity, among other functions (9) . IFITMs are a family of small transmembrane proteins and contain five domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a Cterminal domain (CTD), two intramembrane domains (IMD) of IM1 and IM2, and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL) (5) . IFITMs share a highly conserved CD225 domain. A study on huIFITM3 shows that the CD225 domain is critical for the cellular localization (2) . Three posttranslational modification patterns of palmitoylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation are associated with huIFITM3, and all contribute to its antiviral activity (10) (11) (12) . In addition, the YXXF sorting motif at the Nterminus of huIFITM3 enables it to undergo endocytosis, thereby controlling both its endocytic trafficking and antiviral action (13) .",

In addition to huIFITMs, IFITMs from mouse, swine, chicken, and duck have also been investigated and are found to potently block influenza virus replication (4, 6, 14, 15) . It is interesting that two swine IFITM1 proteins (IFITM1a, IFITM1b) are identified in swine cells, and all the studied five swine IFITM proteins (IFITM1a, IFITM1b, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5) have antiviral activity (14) .

As a host of emerging influenza virus, how canine uses its innate immunity to restrict CIV replication is seldomly investigated. Although IFITMs from many different species have been well characterized as potent antiviral factors, whether canine encodes IFITM and whether canine IFITM (caIFITM) protein has antiviral activity against CIV remains unclear.

In addition, one control cell line generated by infection with lentivirus vector stocks produced by pMD.2G, psPAX2, and one empty pWPI-EGFP plasmid.

A549 cells stably expressing caIFITMs were infected with H3N2 CIV (GD/2014) (A, B) and H5N1 CIV (GD/2013) (C, D) at 0.1 and 1 MOI. At 24 hpi, the cell culture supernatant was collected and used for RNA extraction. The expression level of CIV M gene was determined by RT-qPCR and was used for estimating the virus titer in cell culture supernatant. The virus titer of CIV harvested in A549 cells stably expressing caIFITMs was compared with the uninfected cell group. All data represent the means and SD for experiments (each repeated in triplicate) and were analyzed by Student's t-test. (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01).",
