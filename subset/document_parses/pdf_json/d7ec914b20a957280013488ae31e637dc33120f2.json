An important feature of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the heterogeneity of epidemic dynamics and the resulting mortality across different regions, age classes and population categories. The importance of these heterogeneities suggests that homogeneous models-often invoked in discussions on reproduction number and herd immunity-may provide misleading insights, and points to the need for more granular modelling to take into account geographical, demographic and social factors which may influence epidemic dynamics.",

We use the estimates of social contact rates provided by Mossong et al. [34] for the 16 age groups defined in table 2. Using the PyRoss methodology [40] , we further decompose the contact matrix, as in (2.4), into four components representing contacts at home (\u03c3 H ), work (\u03c3 W ), school (\u03c3 S ) and other locations (\u03c3 O ). Estimation methods and parameter values for these matrices are discussed in appendix B. Contact rates may vary across different regions due to the heterogeneity in socio-economic composition structure and specific regional characteristics, such as population density, level of urbanization and the level of use of public transport. To account for this heterogeneity, we parametrize the ( pre-lockdown) contact matrix in region r as \u03c3 r (0) = d r \u03c3 where the regional adjustment factors {d r : r = 1, \u2026, 133} are estimated to reproduce the regional growth rate of reported cases before the lockdown period.

Soc. Open Sci. 8: 201535 Figure 7 shows an example of scenario in our model where, for 60 consecutive days, although a small number of (symptomatic and asymptomatic) cases appear, due to the low detection probability (p \u00bc 4:5%), none of them is reported. Nevertheless, after a run of 60 days without any reported cases (blue shaded area in figure 7) , which may prompt public health authorities to lower their guard, the epidemic takes off again. Figure 7 displays in fact two sample paths with the same initial conditions, which differ only through the stochasticity of the dynamics. The fact that the breakout occurs only in one of the two scenarios (in blue) but not in the other illustrates how random flare-ups may originate from a small group of undetected cases. Figure 8a shows the probability of observing a second peak in infections when social distancing measures are lifted after no reported cases for L consecutive days. This probability is estimated using 500 simulated paths from (2.3). It is striking to observe that, even after 60 days with no reported cases, the probability of observing a resurgence of the epidemic is around 40%.

Table 9 shows the impact of school closures and social distancing at schools on projected fatalities and social contacts. Reopening of schools, while reducing significantly the social cost, does not seem to lead to a significant increase in fatalities. We compare two post-confinement policies, one (labelled as 'schools') consisting in leaving schools open while social gatherings are restricted (u S = 1, u O = 0.2), and the other (labelled as 'pubs') consisting in closing schools while not restricting social gatherings (u S = 0, u O = 1). The social cost for the 'pubs' policy is 2.3, while the cost for the 'schools' policy is 3.0. However, as shown in figure 14 , the 'open school' policy leads to 35% fewer fatalities compared to the 'open pubs' policy.",

Figure 26 compares regional fatalities per 100 000 habitants for these policies. For more than 90% of the regions, decentralized measures lead to fewer fatalities. The most effective reductions are in Dorset, South West England (UKK22) with 23% fewer fatalities and in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly (UKK30) with 21% fewer fatalities. There are a few exceptions (see regions in light blue in figure 26c ). These regions are already under control before adaptive policies are applied. Therefore, the improvement of moving from centralized policy to decentralized policy is limited. On 29 June 2020, Leicester became the first city in Britain to be placed in a local lockdown, after public health officials voiced concern at the city's alarming rise in COVID-19 cases. Earlier in June, the Government announced that parts of the city would be released from lockdown, while a 'targeted' approach will see pockets remain under tighter restrictions. Our simulations indicate a 60% reduction of the second-peak value in Leicester when a decentralized policy is implemented ( figure 27b) . Figure 28 shows an example of such a decentralized triggering policy, with the same triggering thresholds as in the centralized example in figure 21. At regional level, we see in figure 28a that this policy is more successful than the centralized policy in taming the local outbreaks in Leicester, substantially reducing the second peak through 4 one-week regional lockdowns. At the national level, this results in a strong damping of 'second wave' infections, as shown in figure 28b (compare with figure 21a). royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R. Soc.

Regional outcomes Comparing the regional outcomes of the centralized, decentralized and pre-planned policies displayed in table 10 shows that the decentralized triggering policies are able in many cases to considerably damp the 'second wave' of infections. Figure 30 illustrates this in the case of Mid Lancashire, York, Leicester and Birmingham: the decentralized triggering policy reduces the second peak amplitude by around one half compared to the pre-planned policy.",

Table 11 details the used mapping between Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA) region codes and the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics at level 3 (NUTS-3) codes. 7 If more than one UTLA region falls within the boundary of a single NUTS-3 region, the data is then aggregated. On the other hand, if a single UTLA region lies within more than one NUTS-3 region, the data are distributed among NUTS-3 regions in proportion to the total number of people living in each region. royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R.
