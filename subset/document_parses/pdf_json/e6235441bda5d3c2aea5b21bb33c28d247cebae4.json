In addition to reviewing the literature, we used an action-research methodology and conducted semistructured interviews in Spain and in the U.S. to approach the complexity and challenges of fostering a culture in which ethical considerations are a regular part of business discussions and decision making. The consistency of findings suggests patterns of organizational conditions, cultural elements, and opportunities that influence the management of organizational cultures centered on core ethical values. The ethical competencies of leaders and of the workforce also emerged as key factors. We identify three conditionsda sense of responsibility to society, conditions for ethical deliberation, and respect for moral autonomydcoupled with a diverse set of cultural elements that cause ethics to take root in culture when the opportunity arises. Leaders can use this knowledge of the mechanisms by which organizational factors influence ethical pervasiveness to better manage organizational ethics.",

Technology amplifies the influence of a broad group of social and political actors that have no financial stakes in companies (Kennedy, 2013) . Managers have to deal with this complex and dynamic framework of social, organizational, and individual drivers of socially responsible performance. Instances of these drivers include policies, laws, and regulations (social factors); organizational ethics and tone at the top (organizational factors); and individual preferences of customers, employees, and investors. Moreover, these drivers are evolving dynamically at all three levels in response to the consequences of globalization (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012) . Environmental degradation, growing inequality, the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and the global COVID-19 pandemic have revived the debate on ethics in the business realm.",

            "text": "As a result, researchers and managers have shown renewed interest in managing organizational ethics. Companies began incorporating new values and goals beyond economic profit in their organizational cultures as a strategy to deal with the dynamic and uncertain context in which they are operating (Garriga & Mel\u00e9, 2004) . Thus companies' social roles and ways of doing business have evolved (Freeman, 2017) . In August 2019, the Business Roundtable redefined the purpose of a corporation as promoting an economy for the benefit of all stakeholders; not just shareholders but also customers, employees, suppliers, and communities (Business Roundtable, 2019). They did not, however, explain how companies would achieve this new purpose. Many companies are adopting culture management, including ethics, as a strategy for meeting social demands (Trevi\u00f1o et al., 2014) . But neither the traditional triple bottom line nor the culture underpinning decisions have fully encompassed ethics (Burford et al., 2016) . One of the main causes of the 2007e09 financial crisis was the lack of ethics in management. Ethics has received more attention since then owing to high-profile ethical dilemmas in the technology sector, long considered an economic bellwether. Governance is also now focused on ethical culture. In 2017, the NACD Blue Ribbon Commission recommended that boards should monitor their organizations' culture and integrate it into ongoing discussions with management about strategy, risk, and performance (NACD, 2017) . Although companies linked to the financial crisis and companies in the technology industry had strong reputations for corporate social responsibility and appeared to embrace ethics, the behavior of some managers in these companies was clearly unethical (Sims & Brinkmann, 2009) .",

When inconsistencies or conflicts are perceived to threaten cognitive frameworks, individuals (Lord & Brown, 2001; Watson et al., 2004) and groups (List & Pettit, 2011) adjust their values to preserve integrity, affirm a positive self-image, or support contextual pressures that orient their behaviors. Therefore, behaviors may be most effectively influenced if management shifts its focus from defining values to creating a learning process that builds and activates a shared ethical culture (Appelbaum et al., 2007; Watson et al., 2004) . Caterina Bulgarella used the appealing metaphor of an \"architect of culture\" to describe this new paradigm, offering fresh insights for facing the complexity of managing culture and ethics (Ethical Systems, 2018) .",

Participants mentioned specific examples of ethical deliberation in decisionmaking situations entailing individual accountability and involving people in the creation of certain standards for which they were going to be held responsible. Participants, especially in the U.S., mentioned a sense of responsibility to the society in which the company operates when making decisions related to policies or procedures affecting stakeholders in diverse cultural or social contexts. Moreover, in the absence of either a sense of responsibility to society or of conditions conducive to moral deliberation, companies were less likely to use ethics when making decisions. In one example, the company was more interested in appearing neutral, in terms of its impact on society, than in making any value judgment about what the right thing to do would be in certain circumstances. The company did not expect to be held accountable for the downstream implications of its decisions.",
