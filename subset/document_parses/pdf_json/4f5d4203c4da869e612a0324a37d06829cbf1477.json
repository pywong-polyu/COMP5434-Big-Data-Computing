We developed a Syrian hamster model in which intranasal inoculation of just 100 TCID 50 virus caused viral pneumonia. Aged hamsters developed more severe disease and even succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, representing the first lethal model using genetically unmodified laboratory animals. After initial viral clearance, the hamsters were re-challenged with 10 5 TCID 50 SARS-CoV-2 and displayed more than 4 log reduction in median viral loads in both nasal washes and lungs in comparison to primary infections. Most importantly, re-challenged hamsters were unable to transmit virus to na\u00efve hamsters, and this was accompanied by the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, these results show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces protective immunity that not only prevents re-exposure but also limits transmission in hamsters. These findings may help guide public health policies and vaccine development and aid evaluation of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

SARS-CoV-2 is described to have an R 0 value of 2-5 (2) and is well adapted to transmission among humans (3 Preprint) through aerosol and possibly the fecal-oral route (4) . Infectious virus has been isolated from oro-or naso-pharyngeal swabs (5) , sputum (5) , and stool samples (6) of individuals with severe coronavirus disease 2019 . Limited evidence suggests that recovered individuals are likely to be protected from reinfection (7) , which has also been experimentally demonstrated in animal models (8, 9, 10) . However, it remains unclear whether postinfection immunity will prevent a recovered individual from becoming an active transmitter if reexposed. Such information is critical needed for decision-making of public health policies and evaluating efficacy of vaccine candidates. To address this important question, we used a Syrian hamster model to evaluate the protective efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 infection against secondary challenge and transmission.",

            "text": "Syrian hamsters of 7-9 wk old that were intranasally inoculated with 10 5 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) SARS-CoV-2 had weight loss for up to 7 d (Fig 1A) . Lower inocula (from 10 4 to 10 TCID 50 ) caused lesser or no weight loss (Fig 1A) . To accurately describe active viral replication, we measured levels of subgenomic viral mRNA (sgmRNA) by real-time PCR (11) in nasal washes (NW) of hamsters inoculated with 10 5 TCID 50 at 2, 3, 5, and 7 days postinoculation (d.p.i.). We also assessed viral RNA (vRNA) and sgmRNA in lung tissue and organs at 3 and 5 d.p.i. Interestingly, high levels of sgmRNA were observed in NW with a median peak of 4.87 (range 3.73-5.38) log 10 sgmRNA copies/5 \u03bcl on 2 d.p.i, but the median quickly subsided to below detection limit on 5 d.p.i. (Fig 1B) . On 3 d.p.i., high levels of sgmRNA and vRNA could be detected in both NW and in the lungs (Fig 1C and D) . On Day 5 p.i., although high vRNA levels were primarily detected in the upper and lower respiratory tract (Fig 1E) , the sgmRNA level in respiratory tract (nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung) declined to just above the detection limit, whereas it remained substantial in intestine, spleen and kidney ( Fig  1F) . Viral pneumonia was also confirmed by HE staining of lung tissues at 2-7 d.p.i (Figs 1G-N and S1). The infected lung was characterized as many multifocal consolidations composed of foamy macrophages, atypical pneumocytes hyperplasia, interstitial lymphocytic, and neutrophilic infiltrates. Scattered areas of airway proteinaceous fluid were seen ( Fig S1) . Notably, the percentage of consolidated areas in the lung directly correlated with the amount of the initial inoculum. Shown in Fig 1M , a viral inoculum of as low as 100 TCID 50 was able to cause 10-15% consolidated areas in the lung. By contrast, inoculation of 10 TCID 50 did not result in observable viral pneumonia in one out of two hamsters. Serum-neutralizing antibody (nAB) titers rose from Day 2 to 5 dpi with mean nAB titers of 160 to 320 at days 5 and 7, respectively ( Fig 1O) .",

To explore whether this phenomenon is recapitulated in hamsters, we first intranasally inoculated four aged female hamsters (10, 13, and 20 mo old) with 10 5 TCID 50 SARS-CoV-2. Two 10-mo-old female hamsters were intranasally inoculated with plain medium as negative controls. Aged hamsters showed marked weight loss (around 20%) within 7 d (Fig 2A) and outward signs of sickness such as sneezing, shortness of breath, shivering, and lethargy ( Fig 2B and C) . The illness was especially obvious when breathing rates were analyzed, in which the infected aged hamsters were breathing two to three times faster than uninfected animals ( Fig 2C) . Sustainable levels of subgenomic viral mRNA (sgmRNA) were detected from NW up to 7 d postinfection, indicating a prolongated period of active virus replication in the nose ( Fig  2D) . The oldest hamster (20 mo old) died on Day 6 p.i. Postmortem histopathology examination indicated that the animal had severe, diffuse bronchointerstitial pneumonia along with myocardial disease and thrombus formation in the left atrium leading to death ( Fig 2E) . Worth mentioning is that there were airway infiltrates of macrophages and neutrophils, and necrosis of terminal bronchiolar epithelial cells ( Fig 2F) . Massive amount of viral genomic RNA was detected in the lung of the deceased hamster (Fig 2G and H) . Last, infection of aged male hamsters (13 mo old) resulted in 100% death (n = 4) between day 5 and 8 postchallenge ( Fig 2J) . Notably, a full panel necropsy did not find lesions in other vital organs (pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, brain, and kidney). Examination of the infected hamster brains did not show the presence of virus genomic RNA (Fig 2I) . This finding contrasts with the reported lethal encephalitis seen in a subset of infected K18-hACE2 mice (14 Preprint, 15, 16, 17) . In general, the pathology in aged hamsters resembles what has been observed in patients with severe COVID-19 who usually have pneumonitis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome with increased pulmonary inflammation, thick mucus secretions in the airways, elevated levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, extensive lung damage, and microthrombosis. Neutrophilia predicts poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (18) , and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an independent risk factor for severe disease (19) . It is unclear whether the deceased hamster also developed cytokine storm, which is frequently seen in severe human COVID-19 patients (20) . Post-mortem examination of COVID-19 patients has revealed signs of vascular dysfunction (21) , which was also seen in hamsters.",

Although we have demonstrated that a hamster inoculated with 10 4 TCID 50 virus was able to transmit virus to a na\u00efve hamster, we chose a higher inoculum of 10 5 TCID 50 to mimic a more extreme situation. The circulating neutralizing antibody titers of these 10 hamsters range from 80 to 320 (Fig 3B) . Reinoculation of these hamsters did not result in any weight loss (Fig 3C) . NWs were collected from at 1, 2, 3, and 7 d after reinfection. For most NW samples, the median levels of sgmRNA in NWs collected at all time points except 1 dpi were below the detection limit and the median sgmRNA level on 1 dpi was about four logs lower than that seen during primary infections (Fig 3D) , suggesting a significant reduction in active virus replication in the nose. In consistent with this finding, comparison of the amount of infectious virus in the NW also showed a 3-4 log reduction in the secondary infection ( Fig 3E) . The sgmRNA in the lungs was also undetectable on both Day 3 and 7 postinfection, although a very low level of vRNA could be detected in the lungs (Fig 3F) . Pathology examination of the lungs also showed no viral pneumonia, confirming protection of these hamsters from virus-induced disease (Fig 3G) .",

Over a period of 7 d, the contact hamsters showed no signs of sickness, no weight loss, and no detectable viral sgmRNA or RNA in the nose or in the lungs, and no pathology in the lung (Fig 4A-E) . By contrast, high amount of vRNA was detected from two control contact hamsters that were exposed to hamsters which had no prior infection and subsequently challenged with 10 5 TCID 50 SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4C) . At the end of the study, none of the contact hamsters exposed to re-inoculated hamsters developed neutralizing antibodies, implying that they have never been infected (Fig 4F) .

            "text": "While several studies showing the promise of hamsters, nonhuman primates, and ferrets to study SARS-CoV-2, disease manifestation in laboratory animals ranges from mild to moderate. Here, we report that aged hamsters develop much more pronounced disease and even fatality upon challenge, recapitulating the disease manifestation in the older human population. In our study, infected hamsters only occasionally recorded increases in body temperature. Young hamsters, even when losing 15-20% body weight, did not show outward signs of sickness. Aged hamsters, by contrast, exhibited sneezing, shortness of breath, and noticeable lethargy upon infection. Aged hamsters in our study succumbed to infection between Day 5 and 8 p.i. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lethal model of SARS-CoV-2 using genetically unmodified laboratory animals. The cause of death of aged hamsters is most likely due to severe pneumonia plus thrombus formation in the left atrium. At this time, we are uncertain whether the thrombus formation in the left atrium was directly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future investigation using additional aged hamsters are warranted. Notably, all infected hamsters showed recruitment of both macrophages and neutrophils to the infected lungs. Around 10-15% of COVID-19 patients progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome triggered by a cytokine storm. It would be interesting to measure other immune correlates in infected aged hamsters, but the relative lack of reagents for conducting immunological assays in hamsters prevented us from measuring cytokine profiles. Nevertheless, aged hamsters offer a superior immunocompetent animal model to study severe form of COVID-19 and will be valuable experimental tools in developing vaccine and public health strategies aimed at ending the global COVID-19.",

            "text": "The most important finding of this study is that prior infection of hamsters induced protective immunity, accompanied by the presence of neutralizing antibodies, in the lung with significantly reduced active virus replication in the nose upon re-exposure and hence restricted transmission. This finding provides important new insights into our understanding of postinfection immunity against SARS-CoV-2. To date, no human reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have been confirmed; there is also no evidence that clinically recovered individuals continue transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to others. However, it is possible that the virus may replicate in the nose of recovered individuals upon re-exposure such that these persons may facilitate transmission of the virus to the rest of the population. In this scenario, prior infection may have little impact to stop the continuous transmission of the virus. In our study, although active virus replication was sporadically detected from NW of a few reinoculated hamsters, the overall level of active replication was four logs lower than those in primary infection. We hypothesize the amount of virus shed from these hamsters was so low that the probability of transmitting and infecting another na\u00efve hamster becomes finite. It will be highly desirable for a vaccine to achieve similar effects, that is, to protect against both lower respiratory tract disease and upper respiratory tract disease. In fact, a recent SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine conferred protection with significant reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs in immunized rhesus macaques compared with sham controls (11) . Obviously, our study was carried out in hamsters and hence did not address the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 may replicate more efficiently in humans. Nonetheless, our findings support assessing virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, particularly in the nose, in preclinical studies to help with the evaluation of potential vaccine efficacy before clinical trials.",

On the day of the experiment, serial dilutions of virus were made in media and a total of six to eight wells were infected with each serial dilution of the virus. After 48 h incubation, cells were fixed in 4% PFA followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet. The TCID 50 was then calculated using the formula: log (TCID 50 ) = log(do) + log (R) (f + 1). Where do represents the dilution giving a positive well, f is a number derived from the number of positive wells calculated by a moving average, and R is the dilution factor.",

The supernatants were harvested at 48 and 72 h posttransfection and filtered through 0.45-mm membranes. For the serum neutralization assay, 50 \u03bcl of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions were preincubated with an equal volume of medium containing serum at varying dilutions at room temperature for 1 h, then virusantibody mixtures were added to 293T-hACE2 cells in a 96-well plate. After a 3 h incubation, the inoculum was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were lysed 48 h later, and luciferase activity was measured using luciferin-containing substrate. Controls included cell only control, virus without any antibody control and positive control sera. The end point titers were calculated as the last serum dilution resulting in at least 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The amount of pseudovirions used in this assay has been determined to give rise to a target input 5 \u00d7 10 5 -10 7 RLU/ ml, under which condition the neutralization law is observed.",
