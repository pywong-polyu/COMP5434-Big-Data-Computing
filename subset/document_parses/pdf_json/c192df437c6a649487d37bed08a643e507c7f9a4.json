Evidence-based public health measures to reduce viral spread include-personal isolation, physical distancing, wearing facial masks, frequent hand washing with soap and running water, not touching the face, vaccination, etc. However once infected, recovery relies on host immunity to eradicate the foreign invaders, with symptomatic management, which is the core management strategy in COVID-19 management guidelines. Researchers have observed that severe COVID-19 prevalence and mortality is highest in people with preexisting conditions. Eighty percent of these preexisting diseases are lifestyle related. Also,",

The data so far would suggest that about 85% of patients will make full recovery from COVID-19 without significant symptoms. 7 A major strategy in the present clinical management of COVID-19 is to prevent the progression of the disease from stage I to III. 7 Even though researchers and clinicians are still studying all the factors that may contribute to the progression of COVID-19 from one stage to another, helpful insights obtained from emerging genetic and clinical evidence suggest a similar clinical path to fairly well-studied coronaviruses like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. 8 Information from the study of these other coronaviruses suggest that the host immune system plays a major and critical role in the disease progression and outcome of these viruses. 8 Therefore, an effective immune response might also be critical to the successful contraction and progression of COVID-19. A poor immune response has been postulated as one of the reasons why the disease seems to be more severe in the elderly, the immunocompromised, or in people with comorbid chronic diseases. It therefore can be argued that any supportive care that has the potential of strengthening the innate and adaptive immunity of the host will likely have significant positive influence on the disease progression and prognosis of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The body responds to almost all viral infections by the recruitment and activation of certain inflammatory cell types like macrophages and in some cases neutrophils. This in turn leads to the release of a range of proinflammatory and tissue-damaging molecules like cytotoxic cytokines, cationic proteins, lipid mediators, metalloproteinases, and components of the oxygen burst. 9 The extent and severity of the resulting tissue damage is usually modified by the innate and adaptive immune system; a critical process that eventually determines the clinical outcome of the infection. 9 Specifically, the host innate immune system counters the negative effect of viral infections by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2) and mediators (such as resolvins and galectins). These primarily block proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine production, Major Histocompatibility Complex class II expression, also interfere with many signaling pathways that result in proinflammatory cytokine production. 9 Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b1) is also produced to activate macrophages and natural killer/cytotoxic cells (NK cells), which destroy the virus and the infected cells, respectively. 10 The adaptive immunity against viral antigens is set in motion with the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes-CD8+ cells that exert cytotoxicity by lysing the infected cells and viruses. The adaptive immune system also activates CD4+ cells, which collaborate with B cells to produce antibodies. 10 The antibodies assist by binding to the viruses and prevent them from penetrating a noninfected cell. The antibodies play a fundamental protective role against the reinfection of some viruses in a previously sensitized host (whether by a prior infection or immunization), by intercepting the process of viral-host cell binding. 10 Although other factors-like viral dose, route of infection, age of the host, host genetic susceptibility, concurrent infection with other agents, or past exposure to cross-reactive agents-also play important roles in hostvirus interplay, the effective immune response of the host is particularly critical in determining the susceptibility, duration, severity, and ultimately the clinical outcome of a viral infection. 9,10",

What is known for now is that the virulence and pathogenicity associated with SARS Studies on infected patients also support the claims that the host immune response to COVID-19 is similar to that of other coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (see Figure 1 ). 8 showed that preinfection well-being is a critical factor in determining host susceptibility to severe cases of COVID- 19. 12 Other studies on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which are both coronaviruses of similar genetic composition as SARS-CoV-2, suggested that delayed and weak adaptive antibody response are associated with severe clinical outcome. 8 Yet another study that was done in an in vitro plaque assay demonstrated that the sera (containing antibodies) of COVID-19 patients were effective in neutralizing all the SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the assay. 8 Some other data also suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in patients with severe COVID-19, which is also an important cause of death. 13 Studies have also demonstrated that the plasma level of C-CRP positively correlated with extent of lung lesions and reflect severity of COVID-19. 14, 15 Apart from the direct role that adverse immune response plays in COVID-19, research has shown that the immune system plays a central role as well, in many of the underlying chronic diseases. 16 Inflammation resulting from immunologic maladaptation appears to be the central driving force in the pathologic processes in most of these chronic degenerative diseases. 16 This inflammatory process tends to affect nearly all organ systems of the body including the skin, endocrine glands, gut, lungs, kidneys, and musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system. 16 In the long term such immunologic maladaptation may lead to chronic disease states like atherosclerosis, hypertension, cancer, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and liver cirrhosis. 16 Consequently, the proinflammatory process that characterizes COVID-19 may worsen the underlying inflammatory process of most of these comorbid chronic diseases.",

Evidence also exists which suggest that some components of unhealthy lifestyle (like poor diet, physical inactivity, stress, smoking, alcohol, loneliness, and poor sleep) may significantly impair the immune system and predispose people to greater susceptibility to infectious diseases. 18 Furthermore, the practice of healthy lifestyle is regarded by many clinicians as an important first-line measure to strengthen the immune system either in the prevention of, or treatment of, a particular infectious disease. 18 Healthy lifestyle has also been identified as the single most important step that an individual can adopt in order to naturally keep the immunity strong and healthy. 18 This is so because the systems of the human body, including the immune system, function more effectively when they work in harmony and balance, protected from environmental assaults and bolstered by healthy lifestyle choices. 18, 19 For instance, early research reports suggest that obesity (a condition that places a lot of strain on the immune system as well as other systems of the body) could double the chances of admission in hospital and worsen the outcome for COVID-19. 20,21 Prime Minister Boris Johnson was reported to have attributed his serious disease, requiring inten-sive care treatment, to his weight and higher body mass index (BMI). 20 Evidence from COVID-19 studies so far shows that unhealthy lifestyle practices, such as poor nutrition, smoking, obesity and associated diseases, are linked to poor outcomes. 18 Aside the immune strengthening potential, available information also suggests that healthy lifestyle practices may also play a significant role in the overall well-being of the patients. Taking a cue from preceding epidemics from diseases of genetic similarity to COVID-19, mainly the SARS and MERS, in addition to the primary dysfunction of the respiratory system, there may also exist extrapulmonary manifestations from the coronavidae family. 22 For instance, acute and chronic cardiovascular presentations and complications are possible clinical outcomes of most coronaviruses. 22 Preexisting cardiovascular disease may also worsen, contributing to adverse clinical outcomes. 22 Other comorbid diseases, like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancers, may also be indirectly negatively affected by coronaviruses. 21, 23 For these reasons, the ideal clinical management guideline of coronaviruses, like COVID-19, should comprise comprehensive lifestyle changes that seek to optimize not only the immune system but also the overall health and well-being of the patients. Some of the scientifically agreed lifestyle measures that may strengthen the immunity and ensure better general well-being either singly or in combination are presented below.",

Fourth, availability of adequate amounts of minerals (like iron, zinc, and magnesium) is essential for the synthesis of nucleotide and nucleic acid of the immune cells, while vitamins (like vitamins C and E) are also needed in adequate quantity to support the antioxidant defense mechanism, which is needed to limit tissue damage in viral infection. 24 A single micronutrient can exert multiple diverse immunological effects, such as in the case of vitamin E, where it has a multiple role as an antioxidant, inhibitor of protein kinase C activity, and potentially interacting with enzymes and transport proteins for effective immune response during an infection. 25 The antioxidative effects of some vitamins (like vitamin C) may be particularly important during heavy viral infection when oxidative stress is likely to increase. 24 29 Therefore, in the management of COVID-19 cases, it is essential to maintain the balance of the intestinal microecology as much as possible, primarily by adequate healthy nutritional support. 29 Furthermore, unhealthy diets deplete prebiotics and probiotics, modify the gut microbiota and create a distortion in balance between both. This is another way that poor nutrition may affect immunity and modify the severity of infection.",

Furthermore, adequate sleep also ensures sufficient secretion of melatonin-a molecule which has shown antiinflammatory properties and may play a role in reducing coronavirus virulence by reducing oxidative lung injury and inflammatory cell recruitment during the viral infection. 11 Sleep deprivation is indirectly associated with poor immune response by its tendency to increase higher caloric food craving, 39 decreased energy stored for physical activity, 40 and increase substance misuse. 41",

In particular, it affects the immune function of the nasal cavity by compromising the mucociliary clearance of foreign bodies (like viruses) out of the upper airways. 48, 49 Exposure to tobacco products may also broadly suppress important capacities of the innate immune system, resulting in an ineffective immune response to infections from all sources. 49 A study involving nasal scrape biopsies from nonsmokers and tobacco users showed extensive immunosuppression at the gene level among the tobacco users. In particular, the expression of more than 60 genes was altered in e-cigarette users' alveolar macrophages 2 h after just 20 puffs, including genes involved in inflammation. 49 Indirectly, tobacco use can increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 because the users of the tobacco products are more likely to touch their mouth with the fingers. 49 ",

We therefore recommend that everyone, susceptible, suspected, and confirmed COVID-19 cases should be encouraged to adopt healthy lifestyle practices in their daily living. Such measures if practiced consistently should significantly reduce the susceptibility of at-risk cases, severity, complications, the recovery period, and the fatality rate of the disease. However, it is worth noting that due to some factors like socioeconomic status and environmental conditions, not everybody has the privilege to consistently implement certain lifestyle factors and therefore significant systemic and governmental changes may be required to help those at greatest risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Since in-person consultation may be unsafe in this era of COVID-19, we will also recommend the adoption of virtual group consultations in the management of the asymptomatic and early clinical stages (stages I and II) of COVID-19. 55 This method of consultation is also highly recommended for the continued and coordinated care of other patients, especially those with chronic underlying conditions, who are not only at increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 disease but also have a higher risk of severe disease, with worse outcomes and higher fatality rates. Their normal care may also suffer with healthcare systems all over the world, stretched to their limit in a pandemic such as this. Evidence is also emerging of an association between ethnicity and increased mortality amongst patients with COVID-19, with the Black, Asian and Ethnic Minorities (BAME)",

Alcohol use, especially heavy use, tends to weaken the immune system, increase the susceptibility to viral infections, and increase the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a possible complication of COVID-19.50 Indirectly, alcohol consumption can increase the risk of suicide in self-isolating COVID-19 patients and can also alter peoples' thoughts, judgment, decision-making, and behavior-some of which might be critical in COVID-19 case management.50 Alcohol may also affect ability to adhere to the infection prevention and control guidelines on physical distancing, lock down, and self-isolation. For these reasons, alcohol consumption should be within the recommended safe limit of not more than 14 standard units a week for men and women and drinks spread over 3 days or more if as many as 14 units a week is consumed.51 Tobacco products and other harmful substances are best avoided in everyone, but especially in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases.",

Studies have further elucidated that the direct viral infection of the intestinal mucosa in COVID-19 patients may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Researchers from the Hubrecht Institute in Utrecht, Rotterdam, Maastricht, the Netherlands, have found that the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells of the intestine and multiply there. 28 The use of antiviral and anti-infective drugs may also lead to gastrointestinal symptoms. This may result in distortion of the microecological balance of the intestine, manifesting as a significant reduction of the intestinal probiotics (such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium). Intestinal microecological imbalance in these COVID-19 patients may further lead to bacterial translocation and secondary infection.",
