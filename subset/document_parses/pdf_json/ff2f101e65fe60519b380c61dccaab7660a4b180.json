One has to look at its application and learn from that.\" -Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations [1] Words are seldom constrained by their intended meanings and prescribed roles, especially names. Systems of classification and specialized language have been with us since Aristotle and continue more than two millennia later. Unsurprisingly, in our present age, names and titles are still ascribed to the rapid discoveries and movements of our lives. Questions surrounding the naming of an \"X\" -whether it be a zoonotic disease, a physical phenomenon, or a philosophical concept -are far from novel. It is essential for various shareholders to engage with sociopolitical forces and multifaceted questions surrounding a novel entity's name. The process of naming pathogens and their associated syndromes is one such enterprise that calls for serious consideration.",

A recent example is the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) statement titled World Health Organization Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases [4] . Its principal aim was \"to minimize unnecessary negative impact of disease names on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare, and avoid causing offence to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.\" The WHO encouraged the use of descriptors related to a pathogen's syndrome, spatiotemporal distribution, or severity while leaving out people's names, cultural references, and specific geographic locations.",
