In 2017-2018, H&S revitalized its approach to organizational planning and priority-setting for the breadth of its mission activities (e.g. education, awareness, policy, health systems change, best practice and research), with the goal of generating prompt impact from the research it funds to improve the health of Canadians. The H&S created six Mission Critical Area (MCA) councils, based on a taxonomy of diseases/conditions in the areas of heart and brain health that represent the greatest burden on Canadians' health, the economy and society ( Table 1 ). The MCA councils gathered clinician scientists, researchers, health system leaders and people with lived experience (PWLE) as members. Each council was co-chaired by a researcher or clinician scientist and a person with lived experience. Specifically, the MCA councils were tasked with providing advice to H&S on the prioritization of the most important emerging issues, trends and focus areas with the most potential for impact as related to the three pillars of H&S's mission: Promote health. Save lives. Enhance recovery.",

Governments, research funders, universities and other stakeholders are also concerned about waste in healthcare research given the billions of dollars spent, with findings often not being used in health policy or practice [1] . When they are, a significant time lag exists between the availability of findings and their subsequent uptake in practice or policy, highlighting missed opportunities to improve people's health [2] . One proposed solution is knowledge co-creation. According to Greenhalgh and colleagues (2016) , \"co-creation-collaborative knowledge generation by academics working alongside other stakeholder-reflects a 'Mode 2' relationship (knowledge production rather than knowledge translation) between universities and society\u2026. [and] is widely believed to increase research impact\" [3] . The authors list three key principles to its success, which include \"(1) a systems perspective (assuming emergence, local adaptation, and nonlinearity); (2) the framing of research as a creative enterprise with human experience at its core; and (3) an emphasis on process (the framing of the program, the nature of relationships, and governance and facilitation arrangements, especially the style of leadership and how conflict is managed)\" [3] .

Historically a function of senior leadership, organizational strategic planning and priority-setting processes are increasingly including a wide range of stakeholders as equal partners on teams [6] . The goal of engaging a diverse group of stakeholders is to create change that is meaningful and aligns with the broader community's values, whether by setting new priorities or improving health services, for example [7] . This type of engagement has become increasingly preferred over passive feedback from community members where they do not have a say in setting the agenda, how their contributions are interpreted, and whether even integrated into health services. The use of engagement models promotes the avoidance of tokenistic inclusion, and ensures that the community voice is actively, fairly and continuously represented in the most meaningful phases of the process [8] . These inclusive practices lead to priorities, programmes and research that are more inclusive, robust and strategic [9] . H&S deliberately involved multiple stakeholder groups, including PWLE, in their organizational strategic planning and in setting mission priorities. Given that PWLE's engagement in organizational strategic planning and priority-setting is in its infancy, there is a need for evidence to enhance our understanding about what works (and what does not) in achieving and sustaining productive PWLE engagement with others from multidisciplinary scientific and clinical communities [10] .",

H&S reached out to members of our team, university-based researchers (AK, IDG), to suggest the MCA councils initiative as an interesting case to study given our interest in studying the process of integrated knowledge translation (IKT) and co-creation. Our research team consisted of four university-based researchers interested in understanding how community members, including PWLE, and caregivers, clinician scientists, researchers and health system leaders, jointly co-create and mobilize various types of knowledge (e.g. current evidence and data trends, knowledge from the lived experience of heart and stroke conditions, contextual knowledge of the organization and sociopolitical influences, and prioritization of research priorities).",

Many were conducted by telephone, with others conducted face to face during H&S's annual meeting of its most senior advisory body, the Council on Mission: Priorities, Advice, Science and Strategy (CoMPASS). A survey based on the participant version of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool [17] was distributed in early 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey was not administered and was ultimately cancelled.

The emphasis of the analysis was on revealing a holistic account of the MCA councils from various perspectives. We illustrate this global perspective by sharing quotations drawn from individual MCA council members, co-chairs, H&S staff and key informants, without referencing their specific role. We analysed participant responses through thematic analysis to identify, analyse, organize, describe and report core themes based on our research questions. Using a process of inductive analysis, we noted meaningful segments of data and documented patterns and themes [18] . These were then clustered into emergent thematic areas. Documents were analysed for contextual background. As per an IKT approach, we discussed our perspectives and understandings of the data during team meetings and engaged in discussions to interpret findings with the H&S team. All recordings from interviews and focus groups were professionally transcribed, cleaned and de-identified. Transcripts and documents were stored in NVivo, a qualitative data management software.",

About half of each council were community members. Each council was co-chaired by a researcher or clinician scientist and a community member. The MCA councils were each tasked with examining the current science and gaps in their topic area, and providing advice to the H&S on emerging issues, trends and focus areas within the MCAs with the greatest potential for impact. The initiation of the MCA councils in 2017-2018 occurred in a context of strategy renewal. This permitted the MCAs to inform and help shape a broader organizational planning and priority-setting process. Historically, H&S convened CoMPASS, the mission team's most senior advisory body composed of approximately 35 Canadian researchers, clinicians and PWLE of heart disease and stroke, to inform its strategy. With a change in leadership at both the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief mission & research officer level during the first 6 months of the creation of the MCA councils, H&S evaluated and then renewed the vision of the MCA councils to find them a purpose anchored in a new strategy. H&S determined that the MCA councils would advise H&S on the \"big priorities of our time\". From here, the MCA councils would, through structured discussion, identify condition-or disease-specific priorities as well as crosscutting priorities for the organization and the research it funds. The organization believed that the engagement of community member voices in this process could expand the richness and type of wisdom in discussions and saw the new structures as an innovative approach to prioritysetting. The six MCA co-chairs were also integrated into CoMPASS.",

One member noted, \"By year 2 there was no division, it was just coming together as a group, and so we saw a lot of engagement. \" The MCA council structure and process was an awakening to the fact that these hierarchical power structures can be dissolved, resulting in richer conversations and processes, all working towards common goals.

Formally involving PWLE as co-leaders and members of the MCA councils left a decisive effect on the culture at H&S. Within this co-leadership model, lived experience, empirical evidence and clinical expertise intersected. This intersection resulted in an unprecedented elevation and recognition of the legitimacy of the PWLE voice in H&S's organizational strategic planning and mission priority-setting. In the end, this approach impacted organizational values, practices and the incorporation of the PWLE voice in other committees across H&S. This has increased the relevancy of H&S's work to Canadians, and as a result, enhanced H&S's ability to move the organization into the future. These findings are particularly relevant in light of calls for a culture change [20] [21] [22] , or paradigmatic shift [23] , to authentically engage patients and members of the public in research, development and organizational activities. The work and reignition of a focus on community members achieved by the MCA councils reveals two opportunities for H&S to leverage. First, a window has opened in terms of improving the public's awareness of H&S activities. Some work has already begun through their public awareness campaigns and the building of infrastructure to connect those with lived experience with each other. Second, H&S can demonstrate leadership by creating more spaces within the organization for the authentic inclusion of PWLE voices in advising or decision-making.",

            "text": "H&S developed a successful, time-limited, innovative, interactive process and structure that can be adopted by other organizations seeking to include and partner with patients, caregivers and community members in guiding their strategic directions. The key differences between existing, highly structured patient and public engagement approaches, such as the James Lind Alliance (JLA) Priority Setting Partnerships [24] , is that the H&S process (1) included diverse representation from leading researchers, clinician scientists, health system leaders, and community members including PWLE, over and above the patients, carers and clinicians' perspectives required of the JLA approach [24] and (2) engaged PWLE as partners and co-leaders, which is the highest level of engagement on the continuum of engagement [25] . There is limited literature examining partnership with PWLE on advisory boards, councils or committees. More commonly studied is the engagement of patient, family and/or communityonly advisory councils (PFACs) [26, 27] , which are different from the MCA councils, as they are composed exclusively of PWLE. Hence, what is known from existing studies reporting on the power dynamics, interactions between members, and decision-making structures occurred under different conditions from those of the MCA councils. While our findings reflect many aspects reported in these studies (e.g. power dynamics, participant fatigue, co-creation training for members, and organizational commitment) [28] [29] [30] , the existing patient engagement literature is heavily focused on the barriers, facilitators and outcomes of this approach [28, [31] [32] [33] . Rarely has it focused on the execution or followed the evolution of the partnership over time as our investigation has. Our study further demonstrates how the process can evolve under shifting organizational priorities and how these can be managed. Interested organizations ought to consider a number of investments. First, the success of this initiative was greatly attributed to the organizational and leadership commitment of the H&S team, including the required resources and a steadfast commitment to managing stakeholder relationships. Second, ensuring a diversity of perspectives was a pillar to the process. Having co-chairs representing two different perspectives facilitated openness, shared power and mutual respect. A variety of clinical expertise (medicine, nursing, rehabilitation) and diversity of ethnicity, geography, career stage and context (e.g. system and community leaders) brought varied points of view to the discussions. Although MCA council members felt they were in a safe space, bringing together diverse perspectives led to moments of discomfort and disagreement. Hence, a third investment to consider is an expert facilitator who may help mitigate such discomfort by preparing members to the possibility of personal stories not aligning with the research evidence and ensuring that knowledge from research and community members are equally informative throughout the process. Four, it may be valuable to equip teams and individuals leading and working within PWLE engagement initiatives with skills and competencies to enhance readiness and productive engagement. Training and mentorship opportunities may be useful to enhance lay person communication skills to communicate with the group in a language, tone and manner that is accessible to everyone, including messaging that is personalized, in digestible pieces, and with visual components. For example, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research [22] and the Ontario SPOR [Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research] SUPPORT Unit [34] offer training and resources, many of which are tailored to researchers, patients, clinician scientists or policy-makers. Finally, considerations need to be made for PWLE with physical and cognitive limitations, such as fatigue, and communication disorders such as aphasia, with the understanding that health status and complications could affect ongoing participation [23, 35] . It is imperative that appropriate accommodations and supports are provided to PWLE according to their needs.",

            "text": "Researchers adopting an IKT approach, like we did by working with H&S in this research project, may be interested in our general observations related to the practice of IKT. Our research team grappled with three main tensions throughout the life cycle of this study which are worth noting. First, what we intended to do at the outset of this study differed from what ultimately was achieved. Flexibility and revisions to the original plan were required due to changing leadership at H&S, the evolving nature of the MCA councils, modifications to the MCA councils' knowledge exchange activities, and COVID-19. We remained in close discussion with the H&S team throughout, staying true to our IKT commitment, and together adapting research activities to the evolving and dynamic context of the H&S and the MCA councils. The adaptations were well supported by the developmental evaluation approach [14] , yet impeding them were research ethics board structures and requirements that are not yet fully aligned with IKT approaches. For example, based on the changing context at H&S and how the MCA councils had evolved, we had discussions about modifying data collection tools to better capture the evolution that was taking place. Yet with any significant changes, research ethics boards require amendments delaying study progress until approved, further lengthening an already time-consuming endeavour [36] . Also, in ethics protocols, it can also be difficult to make the distinction between IKT teams that consist of non-researchers contributing to the conduct of the study and who are also study participants from whom data is being collected, and IKT teams that consist of non-researchers contributing to the conduct of the study but who are not study participants. In terms of authorship on products resulting from this work, the research team recognized the knowledge users (in this case, H&S) as coauthors. It was the knowledge users' preference that the organization, H&S, be listed as a coauthor, recognizing the equally important contributions of all H&S team members involved in the project. Second, the modifications to the study protocol brought forth some discussion on the impact of these deviations to the original research plan on scientific rigour, not unlike Nguyen et al. 's observation that collaborative research orientations are the norm for studies using an IKT approach rather than fixed research methods [37] . We maintain that rigour was not impacted by this, as the H&S team was not involved in the recruitment of participants for data collection, was unaware of who participated, with the entirety of the data analysis left to the research team. Had the research been conducted retrospectively, this would have been avoided, as we would have known what data were available for use, yet the value of being able to capture participants' experiences in real time cannot be underestimated [38] . We remained sensitive to the potential for participant fatigue, carefully considering the timing and integration of research activities alongside MCA councils' activities.",

We triangulated data sources and had at least four research team members involved in data collection, analysis and interpretation. We presented year 1 findings to MCA council members and the H&S team as a form of member-checking. The participatory approach to the research meant that the H&S team was involved in every step of the research process. There was a proportionally modest representation of MCA council members and co-chairs which may have led to some perspectives not being captured.
