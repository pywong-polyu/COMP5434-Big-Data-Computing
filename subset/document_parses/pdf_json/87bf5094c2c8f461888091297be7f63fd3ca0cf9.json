            "text": "The high incidence of chronic lung diseases generates a substantial health problem worldwide (ERS White Book, https://www.erswhitebook.org/). Recently, increasing recognition of the importance of the disease's phenotypes was noted. Most lung diseases are regarded as a whole. In the epidemiological reports, the attention is focused on age and race rather than sex, although there is evidence that sex influences the expression of respiratory disease as well. The epidemiology of lung diseases, the susceptibility to risk factors, and the clinical course of the disease all differ in males and females. The aim of separate consideration of lung diseases in the female population is possibly a subsequent modification of diagnostic procedures and establishing additional specific criteria in the treatment approach, which might result in specific prophylactic programs and targeted therapies. It would be in line with modern personalized and precision medicine. Recent recognition of the specific and different course of lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) in the female population represents a good example (1, 2) .",

The authors present their results compared with the existing literature, meta-analyses on the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization, disease severity, mortality, and prevention in the context of biological sex. With one exception, cigarette smoking has been found to increase the severity of the COVID-19 disease and worsen prognosis in males.",

The authors present different risk factors for female lung cancer apart from well-known active smoking, which is still popular among young women, including the following: second-hand (passive) smoking, wood smoke exposure, inhalation of cookingderived products, and ambient air pollutants. The role of estrogens, estrogens receptors, and the enzymatic pathway of estrogen production by aromatase in the lung and carcinogenesis was described in detail and illustrated comprehensively. In spite of the role of estrogens in carcinogenesis, there is no direct impact on relation of hormonal status and lung cancer course and treatment outcomes. However, aromatase inhibitors and inhibitors of estrogens receptors were effective in experimental studies and clinical trials.",

The authors use the term \"microgenderome, \" showing, on the basis of many observations and animal models, that the airways (in connection with the gut) are characterized by the steady-state microbiome. The gut-lung axis is capable of modifying the immune system. Thanks to new genetic techniques, the knowledge on lung microflora has developed, showing that the lung is not sterile. It was shown by the authors that the distribution of lung diseases differs between the male and female populations, with the prevalence of chronic entities being shown among females. There is a different distribution of pathogens in cystic fibrosis: the most serious are observed in the female sex, but the acute communityacquired infections are most often noted among males. The role of estrogens in the modification of anti-inflammatory host defense is well-established: these hormones enhance the immune response, change mucus properties and thus providing a more protective function, and modify the bacterial-host interaction.",

Interestingly the authors present confirmation of endometriosis-related pleural effusion by cytological examination. The endometrial origin of the clusters of glandular cells could be confirmed by a positive reaction to estrogen and progesterone receptors. The results of the literature search showed that endometriosis-related PE is observed in young women aged 35+/\u22128 years old, the main symptoms being catamenial chest pain, dyspnea, and cough (50.7,74.6, and 26.9% respectively). The chest CT findings include pleural effusion (79.1% unilateral), pleural thickening (8.6%), and often pneumothorax.",

This is a model of intracrinology, e.g., \"production of active sex steroids in situ within the cells where the action takes place\". In these experimental models, androgen receptors were found with similar distribution in males and females, and the local activity of steroids and sex hormones in lung development as well as causes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia are presented. These results correspond well to the opinion that inappropriate lung development might be responsible for obstructive lung diseases in adults 1 .",
