The average length of video visit was 34.0 minutes (22.7) in admitted residents compared to 30.0 min (15.9) in non-admitted residents. After full adjustment, there was no difference in video visit duration between admitted and non-admitted residents (OR 1.01 with 95% CI of 0.99-1.03). The number of subsequent provider video visits was 2.26 (1.9) in admitted residents versus 1.58 (1.6), which was significant after adjustment (OR 1.17 with 95% CI of 1.02-1.34). Conclusions: There was no difference in the length of video visit for hospitalized SNF residents versus those who were not within 30 days of a video visit. There were more visits in residents with hospital readmission. This may reflect the acuity of care for patients requiring hospital stay.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have suggested that recurrent medical visits (including emergency department visits) 12 was associated with increased hospital readmission rates-many of which could have been avoided. 13 Given the need to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study sought to evaluate if time of telemedicine visit could predict hospital readmission at 30 days.

We are encouraged that providers used telemedicine to provide care to those complicated residents or residents most at risk for hospitalization. The patients in the hospitalized group were younger, prescribed more medications and had a higher rate of diabetes mellitus when compared to the referent group. Thus this group may require more visits and care. Our group has previously studied the ERA index and found that diabetes, along with other comorbid conditions, raised the risk of both nursing home admission and 2year mortality rate. 19 Additionally, scoring tools, such as the Probability of Repeat Admissions questionnaire (Pra), utilize diabetes as one of the major risks for recurrent hospitalization. 19, 21 Therefore, our finding that more of the patients that requested hospitalization suffered from diabetes mellitus is consistent with prior studies. Our findings are also consistent with multiple studies that have identified polypharmacy as a risk factor for hospitalization, longer length of hospital stay and mortality risk in older patients. [22] [23] [24] The lower readmission rate of 10.2% overall likely reflects the dramatic change in hospitalization and rehospitalization during COVID 19. The patterns of hospital readmission changed after COVID 19 became an important cause of hospitalization. 25 We had numerous learning experiences implementing telemedicine in a short time during COVID-19 that are not captured in our study. Commonly identified challenges in video-based J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f telemedicine include issues with connectivity, privacy, use of equipment, payment and performing the visit itself. We certainly experienced many of those challenges including getting equipment, connectivity and tele-presenting the visit. The guarantee of patient privacy and security of information when utilizing video telehealth modalities is an issue of high priority and we used an iPad with InTouch program which ensured privacy standards and provided an encrypted network for video telehealth visits. HIPAA-based standardized privacy protocols for telehealth use has been recommended 26, 27 to ensure patient privacy standards, though there are currently no unified federally mandated guidelines for telehealth use in skilled nursing facilities, with considerable state-wide variation. We adhered to the privacy protocols for telehealth to ensure privacy of protected health information.",

            "text": "There are several important limitations in our study. Firstly, our sample size was smaller than anticipated due to patients either not giving consent for research purposes or because they did not receive a video visit during the specified time frame (for example, those who were evaluated by an inperson provider). The results of this study were determined by hand abstraction, and, though careful efforts were made to keep the abstraction consistent (i.e., how to indicate missing information, decision to include a video visit if it fell on the last day of data collection, etc), human error is always a possibility. This information was not directly abstracted from EPIC, as billing time was not reviewed in the completed encounter. We relied upon provider estimation of time during the encounter which could present some potential recall issues. In terms of bias, it is possible that information bias played a role in the results of this study, as there were instances in which there was no indication for the length of video visit. Selection bias was unlikely to be a significant source of bias in this study, as all individuals who met the criteria for inclusion were analyzed. From the perspective of generalizability, this is also a limitation of this study, as the population was overwhelmingly white (96.1%). Though approximately 84% of Minnesota's population is white by the 2019 census, 32 our study consisted of more white individuals than the state average. This may limit generalizability to areas in which there is more diversity in nursing home settings. Other limitations included that we J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f were only able to evaluate at the duration of the visit and the scope of this study did not include reviewing the content clinical review and information exchange during the visit as additional quality metrics. Overall, this study demonstrates the ongoing need for further evaluation of the use of telehealth in PALTC to further assess many of these remaining questions.",
