            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the coronavirus family and is characterized by its high transmission competence. Elderly COVID-19 patients are at significantly higher risk of severe course of disease and death. Therefore, outbreaks in nursing homes are particularly challenging for facility managers and health authorities. Here, we report three outbreaks of COVID-19 related to nursing homes (NH01.a, NH02 and NH03) with almost 1000 affected individuals during the first COVID-19 wave in Berlin, Germany. The occurrence of cases and the measures taken were analyzed retrospectively. In all three outbreaks, the index persons were nursing home employees or volunteers. Measures taken were quarantine of contacts, close-meshed tests, separation of the affected housing unit, suspension of admission, ban on visiting, and equipping staff with personal protective equipment, of which there was a shortage in Germany at the beginning of the pandemic. A court-ordered quarantine became necessary for three residents of NH01.a due to cognitive disabilities. In total, 61 persons were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in NH01.a, ten persons in NH02, and sixteen persons in NH03. Seventeen patients (27.9%) of NH01.a and three patients (18.8%) of NH03 were referred to hospital. Of all confirmed cases, thirteen (21.3%) related to NH01.a and four (25.0%) related to NH03 died as a result of the infection. Besides one 82 year old volunteer, all deceased persons were residents aged between 66 and 98. Our results emphasize the importance of a previously developed containment and cluster strategy for nursing homes. Due to the particular vulnerability of the residents, immediate action, close cooperation and communication between the facility management, residents, visitors and the health authorities are essential in the case of confirmed COVID-19 cases in healthcare facilities.",

This was particularly true in the early stages of the pandemic, when knowledge of the spread and treatment options of the disease was still poor, testing capacity limited, and vaccination unavailable. For example, for the first 5 months of the pandemic, Abrams et al. calculated that 42% of all COVID-19 deaths across 38 U.S. states were reported by nursing homes and other long-term care facilities 4 . In Germany, 681 outbreaks in nursing homes resulting in 12,681 cases were reported during the first wave. This corresponds to 14% of all outbreaks and 10% of all cases during this period 5 . Prior to the start of the second wave in fall 2020, 86% of patients in Germany and 82% of patients in Neuk\u00f6lln who had died of COVID-19, were 70 years of age or older 6 . The median age of deceased COVID-19 patients in Germany was 82 years, and in Neuk\u00f6lln 80 years; while the median age of infected persons in Germany was 45 years, and in Neuk\u00f6lln 35 years 7 . Germany is one of the countries with the oldest age structure in the world, putting a large proportion of the population at particular risk 8 . The age group of 70 and above represents approximately 16% in Germany and 13% in Neuk\u00f6lln 3, 9 . Accordingly, it is essential to investigate outbreaks in nursing homes in detail in order to develop and implement appropriate protective measures.",

At that time, the pandemic in Germany was still in the early stages of the first wave. The initial situation of the outbreak in NH01.a was a bowling event for residents, organized by an 82 year old volunteer in March 2020, shortly before the first measures to contain the pandemic were ordered by the German government. Nine days later, the volunteer employee was hospitalized for a different reason than COVID-19. On admission, a routine test detected a SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the following days, the person developed a cough and pneumonia and died 12 days after admission ( Fig. 1 ; Table 1 ). The day after the admission, the positive test result was reported to the Department of Public Health Neuk\u00f6lln. Immediate measures taken by the pandemic squad were the tracing of the infected person's contacts of the past 2 weeks and interventions in close cooperation with the management of the nursing home: the three floors of the nursing home were separated from each other. For the first and third floors, a temporary ban on admission and on visiting was imposed. Staff members who had contact with the index person in the previous 14 days were quarantined. Moreover, staff was equipped with PPE. RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 of residents and employees were carried out on site by a mobile swab team operated by the pandemic squad. Ninety residents and 79 staff members underwent testing over the span of 1 week. Of these, eighteen residents and four staff members received positive PCR test results. During that week, two residents died of COVID-19. Four further diseased residents and one employee had to be referred to hospital due to the symptoms they developed, such as cough, fever, general feeling of illness, and pneumonia. Since the residents living on the second floor were then also affected, the measures described above were extended to the second floor ( Fig. 1) .",

The infected male residents, in particular, showed a high mortality rate, in NH01.a their mortality rate was at 80.0% and in NH03 at 50%; both higher than that of infected female residents. In regard to all residents and all staff of the three homes, men had a lower risk of infection (RR 0.64, not significant), but their risk of death in case of infection was twice as high as that of women (RR 2.01, not significant) (Fig. 8) . Due to the small number of cases no conclusion can be drawn from our analysis for a generally higher mortality. Nevertheless, since Graham et al. also report a significantly higher mortality risk in men in their analysis of three hundred and ninety-four SARS-CoV-2 positive nursing home residents, these data can be interpreted as indicating greater vulnerability among older men 18 .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to contain because, among other reasons, asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infected persons can already spread the virus 21 . When investigating an outbreak in a nursing home in King County, USA, Kimball et al. identified 23 residents with positive RT-PCR tests 22 . Of these, only ten (43%) had symptoms: eight had symptoms typical of COVID-19 and two had atypical symptoms. However, 13 (57%) of the residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic at the time of the swab. Of these, ten residents developed symptoms in the following 7 days 22 . In another nursing home in the same county, the situation appeared similar: of the residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 35% had specific symptoms, 8% had non-specific symptoms, and 56% were asymptomatic 19 . In the UK, 65.2% of 126 nursing home residents who tested positive developed no symptoms, while a further 19.8% showed atypical symptoms such as confusion, anorexia and gastrointestinal complaints 18 . According to Stall et al. 17 , frail people are more likely to show atypical symptoms such as delirium, falls, and function decline. Based on the knowledge that symptoms can be absent or atypical despite contagiousness, the aforementioned outbreaks were handled in such a way that all residents with direct contact to diseased or positively tested persons were quarantined by the public health department until a negative PCR test result was obtained. In addition, new admissions and visits by relatives were temporarily www.nature.com/scientificreports/ suspended when the first infection became known. Residents and staff members were tested weekly for SARS-CoV-2. Due to the spatial and organizational interdependence with NH01.a, residents and staff members of NH01.b were also tested three times at intervals of about 10 days. The immediate separation of NH01.a and NH01.b proved to be a successful strategy to protect NH01.b from the introduction of the virus. The separation of the two nursing homes was accompanied by spatial and organizational measures. On the spatial level, a hygiene lock was installed in the kitchen in NH01.a, which is used for the preparation of food in both (and two additional) facilities. It is of great importance to train not only the nursing staff sufficiently, but also the service personnel, and to make sure that employees with other first languages get the essential information according to their language skills. Therefore, like the nursing staff, the service staff was also trained in extended hygiene measures and informed by corresponding information material. The latter included brief videos in order to inform international employees who did not speak the German language sufficiently. Directed actions and stakeholder compliance. All these measures, especially testing, physical distance and quarantine, require compliance from all parties involved. Compliance was good for most residents and staff members. The training and information materials for the staff members, as well as transparent communication with the residents and their families by the facility managements were important. However, in the case of the outbreak in NH01.a it was problematic to enforce contact restrictions with the neighboring nursing home for those residents who could hardly be swayed by reason due to cognitive limitations. This was the case for three residents of NH01.a with positive test results and one resident of NH01.b who had direct contact to infected residents of NH01.b. Although restrictions on freedom are a fundamental encroachment on personal rights, which are anchored in the German constitution, a court order based on the Infection Protection Act was issued to protect the residents of NH01.b 11, 23 . This provided that the three persons concerned, were allowed to be detained in their living quarters against their free will. In the case of such coercive measures, it is of great importance that adequate care is provided for the detained persons. This is especially true for people with cognitive disabilities such as dementia, for whom isolation in a room can be incomprehensible and very stressful 22 . In the case described here, the persons concerned received intensive care from additional nursing staff during the quarantine. Due to the duration of the judicial assessment of the situation, 8 days elapsed from the time of positive test results, in which the persons concerned did not comply with the quarantine regulations. Even if in this particular case the virus was not introduced into NH01.b as a result of this delay, the lesson learned of this experience is that it is important to draw up a plan in advance of an outbreak, defining and outlining measures to be taken in such cases, in order not to lose valuable time in case of an emergency.",

In exceptional cases, however, quarantine was imposed on asymptomic nurses until a negative PCR test result was obtained. These nurses lived in other districts than Neuk\u00f6lln. Since the federal structures in Germany mean that other public health departments are responsible for these districts, measures are not consistent. In order to compensate for the lack of staff due to quarantined and diseased nurses, leased employees were hired.

Immediate measures such as isolation of the infected, quarantining of contacts among the residents, equipping the staff with PPE and close-meshed testing instead of quarantining nursing staff proved to be effective in fighting www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the virus while maintaining services. Particularly in the case of pathogens which, like SARS-CoV-2, are unknown or little researched to this date, it is important that the scientific findings are continuously observed, especially by the health authorities, and that measures are adapted flexibly to the current state of knowledge. However, in order not to waste valuable time, pandemic plans should be drawn up in advance by the nursing homes in cooperation with the local health authorities, which also take into account how to deal with cognitively impaired residents. In addition, a structured documentation system is needed in the health authorities in which all data relevant for containing the outbreak, such as test results and measures taken, are systematically stored and accessible to the staff of the pandemic team. The described outbreak took place at an early stage in the first wave of the pandemic in Germany 2020, so that pandemic teams had to be newly formed and new structures had to be established. As a result, the many people initially involved used different systems for storing data before systematizing it, which can lead to incomplete or incorrect documentation. A faster reporting system that allows coordination with neighboring districts is also lacking in Berlin to date. A backlog demand can be observed here, which is due in particular to the fact that health authorities in Germany have been poorly equipped financially and in terms of personnel in recent years. This has had a negative impact on the degree of digitization, among other things 24 . The same applies to nursing homes, which are often understaffed because many vacancies cannot be staffed due to skills shortages. Hygienic work in nursing requires time, as Stahmeyer et al. have demonstrated, using the example of a German intensive care unit 25 . For this reason, a health care system must ensure that care and health facilities can be adequately staffed. These are overarching measures that cannot be solved in the short term, but whose importance become obvious during the pandemic. In Neuk\u00f6lln, during the pandemic, an impending shortage of personnel in facilities is recorded at 2-week intervals by the public health department in order to be able to intervene in time. Through a platform initiated by the Berlin government, nursing staff can be found in situations of bottlenecks 26 . This aims to reduce the risk of nosocomial infections caused by overworked healthcare workers. In order to avoid shortages in supply, it can also be useful to pursue previously uncommon approaches. In Toronto, Canada, a partnership between an affected nursing home and a nearby hospital has proven successful. The hospital has agreed in advance to provide personnel, equipment and clinical expertise in case of an outbreak 17 . Furthermore, nursing homes and health authorities should decide on temporary restrictions for visits and community activities depending on the local infection situation. Kimball et al. also recommend the wearing of face masks by nursing home residents and regular cohort testing among residents and caregivers 22 . However, the latter should be discussed in the context of testing capacity and regional infection rates, as low prevalence increases the percentage of false positives 27 . This has to be considered especially in cases where the rapid antigen point-of-care tests are in use. As of September 2020, 47.1% of COVID-19 cases in Neuk\u00f6lln, are connected to outbreaks in nursing homes. However, there is an observable trend that fewer nursing homes are affected by outbreaks during the ongoing pandemic. This can be interpreted as a sign that lessons have been quickly learned from the experience of the first outbreaks and that preventive measures as well as the vaccination program are successful.",
