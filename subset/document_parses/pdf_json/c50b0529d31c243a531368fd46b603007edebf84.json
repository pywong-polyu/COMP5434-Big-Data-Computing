However, preliminary research suggests that prolonged mandates of quarantine and social distancing are associated with a negative physical health experiences (including disruptive sleep) and negative mental health outcomes (including a sense of loneliness, and an increased worldwide suicide rate) (Lewis, 2020; Nikolaidis et al., 2020; , 2020b . As policies are adjusted throughout the pandemic to balance multipleand at times, conflictingaspects of health, there is a need for continuous observation of public sentiment and deliberation in order for officials to respond according to public needs so as to encourage adherence and address negative mental health outcomes of the pandemic such as heightened anxiety and perceptions of risk. Twitter data provides a forum for observation that is instantaneous, freely available and does not require logistic planning, unlike public opinion polls. These characteristics are critical during a crisis to provide instantaneous evidence to draw from when officials need to make rapid-response policy. Additionally, Twitter has the capacity to provide an avenue to improve care quality and safety, communication efficiency, cost-effectiveness and convenience of access to interventions (including education and advertising health care services) (Zhou et al., 2018) .",

Natural language processing (NLP) models including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (VADER) have been validated as a quick and accurate sentiment analysis method in many contexts (Pennebaker et al., 2001; Pennebaker et al., 2017; Hutto, Gilbert, 2014) including within social media (Kramer et al., 2014) . VADER is geared specifically toward sentiment polarity of social media text and has been employed to demonstrate how social media can be used as powerful cues for health outcomes (Tamesrsoy et al., 2015) and as a way to quantify mental health (Loveys, 2017) . VADER uses a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis that is specifically attuned to Table 1 Description of variables kept for analysis. Variable definitions are procured from an NLP model's publication, website and/or operator's manual (vaderSentiment 3.3.1 | The Python Package Index (PyPI), n.d.; LIWC | Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, n.d.; Interpreting LIWC Output, n.d.; . sentiments expressed in social media (Elbagir & Yang, 2019) . LIWC is a model developed to study a text's \"various emotional, cognitive, and structural components\" and has successfully been employed to encode topical discussion (e.g., health) and sentiment (e.g., anger, sadness and anxiety) in short, limited and open-ended text (Tov et al., 2013) and blog posts (Gill et al., 2008) , suggesting it can also be successfully applied to social media. The LIWC2007 Dictionary is composed of 2290 words and word stems. Each word or word-stem defines one or more word categories or subdictionaries and if it is found in the target text, each of these subdictionary scale scores will be incremented (Kovach Computing Services, n.d.; LIWC | Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, n.d.).",

While there was a statistical significance for the Massachusetts's State of Emergency's Analytic score linear model's weekly progression coefficient, it is the exception rather than the rule for our three models and we suspect that it may be unrelated to the intervention effect. The general insignificance among linear models regarding sentiment may indicate the need to separate the sentiment scores into positive and negative scores rather than relying on polarity scores. We discuss this in our limitations section.",

It is possible that there is no significant difference in anxiety scores after the latest intervention because the public felt more secure as time went on and more interventions went into place while discussion in health and risk remained heightened as conversations about the virus continued.",

The CDC states it may take up to 2 weeks after viral exposure for infected individuals to show symptoms (Symptoms of Coronavirus, n.d.) that may prompt testing; thus, it makes sense that the lag time between the intervention and concurrent associated shift in discussion and the decrease in Massachusetts newly infected cases to be about the two weeks between mid-to late-March.
