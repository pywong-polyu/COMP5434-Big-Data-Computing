This virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] belongs to the coronavirus (CoV) family, which is thought to have given rise to zoonotic introductions on multiple occasions during the past centuries. Coronaviruses are abundantly present in mammalian reservoir species, including bats [2] , and should now be recognized definitively as a continuous zoonotic threat with the ability to cause severe human disease and explosive pandemic transmission.",

            "text": "To date, seven CoVs that can infect humans have been identified, which segregate into two classes. On the one hand, there are four endemic human CoVs (HCoVs), the first of which were identified in the 1960s, annually causing a substantial number of common colds [3, 4] . On the other hand, we now know of (at least) three zoonotic CoVs that recently have caused outbreaks in the human population: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5, 6] in [2002] [2003] , Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [7, 8] since 2012 (and probably earlier) and the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10] . The latter agent emerged near Wuhan (PR China) in the fall of 2019 and its animal source is currently under investigation [11] [12] [13] . Transmission to humans of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was attributed to civet cats [14] and dromedary camels [15] , respectively, although both species may have served merely as an intermediate host due to their close contact with humans. All three zoonotic CoVs belong to the genus betacoronavirus (beta-CoV), which is abundantly represented among the CoVs that circulate in the many bat species on this planet [2, [16] [17] [18] [19] . The genetic diversity of bat CoVs and their phylogenetic relationships with the four known endemic HCoVs (OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63; the latter two being alpha-CoVs) suggests that also these may have their evolutionary origins in bat hosts, for most of them probably centuries ago [20] . The potential of multiple CoVs from different genera to cross species barriers had been predicted and documented previously [2, 16-19, 21, 22] , but regrettably was not taken seriously enough to invest more extensively in prophylactic and therapeutic solutions that could have contributed to rapidly containing an outbreak of the current magnitude.",

            "text": "Compared to other RNA viruses, CoVs possess an unusually large positive-sense RNA genome with a size ranging from 26 to 34 kilobases [23] . The CoV genome is single-stranded and its 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds encode for the large and partially overlapping replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (4000-4500 and 6700-7200 amino acids long, respectively), with the latter being a C-terminally extended version of the former that results from ribosomal frameshifting. The replicase polyproteins are processed into 16 cleavage products (non-structural proteins, nsps) by two internal proteases, the papain-like protease (PL pro ) in nsp3 and the 3C-like or 'main' protease (M pro ) in nsp5 [24] . Specific transmembrane nsps (nsp3, 4 and 6) then cooperate to transform intracellular membranes into a viral replication organelle (RO) [25] that serves to organize and execute CoV RNA synthesis, which entails genome replication and the synthesis of an extensive nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The latter are used to express the genes present in the 3\u2032-proximal third of the genome, which encode the four common CoV structural proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein] and the 'so-called' accessory protein genes, most of which are thought to be involved in the modulation of host responses to CoV infection [26] . The CoV proteome includes a variety of potential targets for drug repurposing or de novo development of specific inhibitors of, e.g. viral entry (S protein) or RNA synthesis [27] . The latter process depends on a set of enzymatic activities [24] including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; in nsp12), RNA helicase (in nsp13), two methyltransferases involved in mRNA capping (a guanine-N7-methyltransferase in nsp14 and a nucleoside-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase in nsp16) and a unique exoribonuclease (ExoN, in nsp14) that promotes the fidelity of the replication of the large CoV genome [28] . Other potential drug targets are the transmembrane proteins that direct the formation of the viral RO, several less well characterized enzymatic activities and a set of smaller nsps (nsp7-10) that mainly appear to serve as cofactors/modulators of other nsps.",

The two genome sequences are about ~80 % identical and the organization of ORFs is essentially the same. The overall level of amino acid sequence identity of viral proteins ranges from about 65 % in the least conserved parts of the S protein to about 95 % in the most conserved replicative enzyme domains, prompting the coronavirus study group of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses to classify the new agent within the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, which also includes the 2003 SARS-CoV [1] . The close phylogenetic relationship also implies that much of our knowledge of SARS-CoV molecular biology, accumulated over the past 17 years, can probably be translated to SARS-CoV-2. Many reports posted over the past months have described such similarities, including the common affinity of the two viruses for the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [9, 31] . This receptor is abundantly expressed in Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells). Since 2003, Vero cells have been used extensively for SARS-CoV research in cell-culture-based infection models by many laboratories, including our own.",

From a biological and evolutionary point of view, this would seem a strangely anthropocentric consideration, but it ultimately forced us to reach out across the globe to Australian colleagues in Melbourne. After checking our credentials and completing a basic material transfer agreement, they provided us (within 1 week) with their first SARS-CoV-2 isolate (originally named 2019-nCoV/Victoria/1/2020 and subsequently renamed BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 [34] , which will be used throughout this study.

Additionally, we analysed infected cells by light and electron microscopy, and demonstrated cross-reactivity of 13 available SARS-CoV-specific antisera (recognizing ten different viral proteins) with their SARS-CoV-2 counterparts. Finally, we established the conditions for a mediumthroughput assay to evaluate basic antiviral activity and assessed the impact of some known CoV inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to many anticipated similarities, our results also established some remarkable differences between the two viruses that warrant further investigation. One of them is the rapid evolution -during virus passaging in Vero cells -of a specific region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that contains the so-called furin-like cleavage site.",

The remaining number of reads were 3860 (p2 stock), 1924 (S5p1), 2263 (S5p2), 4049 (S5p3) and 3323 (L8p1). These reads were translated in the S protein ORF and the resulting amino acid sequences were aligned, grouped on the basis of containing the same mutations/deletions in the S1/S2 region and ranked by frequency of occurrence (Fig. 1b) .",

As this ratio approximated the observed relative proportions between large and small plaques, we performed a plaque assay on the p1 virus stock (Fig. 1a, leftmost well) and picked multiple plaques of each size, which were passaged three times in Vero E6 cells while monitoring their plaque phenotype. Interestingly, for several of the small-plaque virus clones (like S5; Fig. 1a ) we observed rapid conversion to a mixed or large-plaque phenotype during these three passages, while large-plaque virus clones (like L8) stably retained their plaque phenotype (Fig. 1a) . NGS analysis of the genome of a large-plaque p1 virus (L8p1) revealed that >99 % of the reads in the S1/S2 cleavage site region contained the G23607 to A mutation described above.

This virus clone retained its small-plaque phenotype during the first passage ( Fig. 1a; S5p1 ), but began to yield an increasing proportion of large(r) plaques during subsequent passages. Sequencing of S5p2 (Fig. 1b) revealed a variety of lowfrequency reads with mutations near the S1/S2 cleavage site motif (aa 681-687; PRRAR\u2193SV), with G23607 to A (specifying the Arg682 to Gln substitution) again being the dominant one (in ~2.1 % of the reads covering nt 23 576 to 23 665 of the genome). At lower frequencies single-nucleotide changes specifying Arg682 to Trp and Arg683 to Leu substitutions were also detected. Furthermore, a 10 aa deletion (residues 679-688) that erases the S1/S2 cleavage site region was discovered, as well as a 5 aa deletion (residues 675-679) immediately preceding that region. The amount of large plaques increased substantially upon the next passage, with NGS revealing the prominent emergence of the mutants containing the 10 aa deletion or the Arg682 to Gln point mutation (~22 and~12 % of the reads, respectively), and yet other minor variants with mutations in the PRRAR\u2193SV sequence being discovered. Taken together these data clearly link the large-plaque phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 to the acquisition of mutations in this particular region of the S protein, which apparently provides a strong selective advantage during passaging in Vero E6 cells.",

Likewise, both a polyclonal rabbit antiserum and mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the N protein cross-reacted strongly (Fig. 4b , Table 1 ). The same was true for a rabbit antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide of the SARS-CoV M protein (Fig. 4e) . Labelling patterns were essentially identical to those previously documented for SARS-CoV [45, 46] , with nsps accumulating in the perinuclear region of infected cells, where the elaborate membrane structures of the viral ROs are formed (Fig. 4a,  c and d) . Punctate structures in the same area of the cell were labelled using an antibody recognizing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which presumably recognizes replicative intermediates of viral RNA synthesis [46, 47] . The N protein signal was diffusely cytosolic (Fig. 4b) , whereas the M protein labelling predominantly showed the expected localization to the Golgi complex (Fig. 4e) , where the protein is known to accumulate [48] .",

Compared to mock-infected control cells (Fig. 5a-b) , various distinct membrane alterations were observed in cells infected with either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 5c-j) . At 6 h p.i., larger regions with membrane alterations were found particularly in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (data not shown), which may align with the somewhat faster onset of intracellular RNA synthesis in SARS-CoV2-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3a) . From 8 h p.i. onwards, SARS-CoV-and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells appeared more similar (Fig. 5c-j) . Double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) were the most prominent membrane alteration up to this stage (Fig. 5d -e, h-i). In addition, convoluted membranes [46] were readily detected in SARS-CoV-infected cells, while zippered ER [25, 49, 50] appeared to be the predominant structure in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Fig. 5e , i, white arrowheads). As previously described for SARS-CoV [46] , SARS-CoV-2-induced DMVs also appeared to fuse through their outer membrane, giving rise to vesicle packets that increased in numbers as infection progressed (Fig. 5f , k, white asterisks). Virus budding near the Golgi apparatus, presumably into smooth membranes of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [45, 51, 52] , was frequently observed at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 5k-l, o-p) . This step is followed by transport to the plasma membrane and release of virus particles into extracellular space. By 10 h p.i., released progeny virions were abundantly detected around all infected cells (Fig. 5m -n, q-r). Interestingly, whereas spikes were clearly present on SARS-CoV progeny virions, a relatively large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 particles seemed to carry few or no visible spike projections on their surface, perhaps suggesting a relatively inefficient incorporation of spike proteins into SARS-CoV-2 virions. This could potentially reduce the yield of infectious particles and may contribute to the lower progeny titres obtained for this virus (Fig. 2a) .",

Based on the obtained half maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) values of >100 \u00b5M, a selectivity index >22.5 was calculated. Chloroquine potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentrations, with an EC 50 value of 2.3\u00b11.1 \u00b5M for both viruses (CC 50 >100 \u00b5M, SI>45.5; Fig. 6b ). Alisporivir, a known inhibitor of different groups of RNA viruses, was previously found to effectively reduce the production of CoV progeny. In this study, we measured EC 50 values of 4.9\u00b11.3 and 4.3\u00b11.0 \u00b5M for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, respectively ( Fig. 6c ; CC 50 >100 \u00b5M, SI>20). Treatment with PEG-IFN-\u03b1 completely inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2, even at the lowest dose of 7.8 ng ml \u22121 (Fig. 6d ). In line with previous results [35, 59] , SARS-CoV was much less sensitive to PEG-IFN-\u03b1 treatment, yielding only partial inhibition at all concentrations tested (from 7.8 to 1000 ng ml \u22121 ). Overall, we conclude that Vero E6 cells provide a suitable basis to perform antiviral compound screening and select the most promising hits for in-depth mechanistic studies and further development.",

            "text": "In this report, we describe a comparative analysis of the replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, one of the most commonly used cell lines for studying these two viruses. In contrast to the stable phenotype exhibited by SARS-CoV during our 17 years of working with this virus in these cells, SARS-CoV-2 began to exhibit remarkable phenotypic variation in plaque assays within a few passages after its isolation from clinical samples (Fig. 1a) . In addition to the BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 isolate used in this study, similar observations were made for a variety of other clinical isolates (data not shown). To establish the genetic basis for the observed plaque size heterogeneity, small and large plaques were picked and the resulting virus clones were passaged repeatedly and analysed using NGS. The consensus sequences obtained for S5p1 and L8p1, which differed by a single nucleotide substitution in the S protein gene, clearly established that a single S protein mutation (Arg682 to Gln) was responsible for the observed plaque size difference. This mutation is localized near the so-called furin-like S1/S2 cleavage site (Fig. 1b) [61] in the S protein [62] . This sequence constitutes a (potential) processing site that is present in a subset of CoVs (including SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV) but is lacking in others, like SARS-CoV and certain bat CoVs [61, 63] . This polybasic motif (PRRAR\u2193SV, in SARS-CoV-2) can be recognized by intracellular furin-like proteases during viral egress and its cleavage is thought to prime the S protein for fusion and entry [64] , which also requires a second cleavage event to occur at the downstream S2' cleavage site [61] . In general, the presence of the furin-like cleavage site does not appear to be critical for successful CoV infection. Using pseudotyped virions carrying mutant S proteins of SARS-CoV [65] or SARS-CoV-2 [66] , it was shown that its presence minimally impacts S protein functionality. In the SARS-CoV S protein, an adjacent sequence that is conserved across CoVs can be cleaved by other host proteases like cathepsin L or TMPRSS2 [67] [68] [69] , thus providing an alternative pathway to trigger viral entry. Possibly, this pathway is also employed by our Vero E6-cell adapted SARS-CoV-2 mutants that have lost the furin-like cleavage site, like clone L8p1 and multiple variants encountered in S5p3 (Fig. 1a) . These variants contain either single point mutations or deletions of 5 to 10 aa (Fig. 1b) , resembling variants recently reported by other laboratories [30, 70, 71] . Interestingly similar changes were also observed in some clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates that had not been passaged in cell culture [70] . It is currently being investigated why mutations that inactivate the furin-like cleavage site provide such a major selective advantage during SARS-CoV-2 passaging in Vero E6 cells and how this translates into the striking large-plaque phenotype documented in this paper.",

Screening of other available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences indicated that the presence of this deletion apparently is unique for this particular isolate, and likely represents an additional adaptation acquired during cell-culture passaging. This deletion maps to a previously described 'hypervariable region' in the otherwise conserved 3\u2032 UTR, and in particular to the so-called s2m motif [72] that is conserved among CoVs and also found in several other virus groups [73, 74] . The s2m element has been implicated in the binding of host factors to viral RNAs, but its exact function has remained enigmatic thus far. Strikingly, for the mouse hepatitis coronavirus the entire hypervariable region (including s2m) was found to be dispensable for replication in cell culture, but highly relevant for viral pathogenesis in mice [72] . Although the impact of this deletion for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be studied in more detail, these previous data suggest that this mutation need not have a major impact on SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. This notion is also supported by the fact that the results of our antiviral screening assays (Fig. 6) correlate well with similar studies performed with other SARS-CoV-2 isolates [54, 75, 76] . Clearly, this could be different for in vivo studies, for which it would probably be better to rely on SARS-CoV-2 isolates not carrying this deletion in their 3\u2032 UTR.",

This may be due to a high expression level of the ACE-2 receptor [82] that is used by both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [9] and/or the fact that they lack the ability to produce interferon [83, 84] . It will be interesting to evaluate whether there is a similarly strong selection pressure to adapt the S1/S2 region of the S protein when SARS-CoV-2 is passaged in other cell types. Such studies are currently in progress in our laboratory and already established that HuH7 cells may be a poor choice, despite the fact that they were used for virus propagation [9, 85] and antiviral screening in other studies [54, 86] . Immunolabelling of infected HuH7 cells (data not shown) revealed non-productive infection of only a small fraction of the cells and a general lack of cytopathology. While other cell lines are being evaluated, the monitoring of the plaque phenotype (plaque size and homogeneity) as illustrated above may provide a quick and convenient method to assess the composition of SARS-CoV-2 stocks propagated in Vero E6 cells, at least where it concerns the evolution of the S1/S2 region of the S protein.",

The cross-reacting antisera described in this study (Table 1) will be a useful tool during such studies. In general, the subcellular localization of viral nsps and structural proteins (Fig. 4 ) and the ultrastructural changes associated with RO formation (Fig. 5) were very similar for the two viruses. We also observed comparable replication kinetics for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, although clearly lower final infectivity titres were measured for SARS-CoV-2 (~50-fold lower; Fig. 2 ). Nevertheless, RNA synthesis could be detected somewhat earlier for SARS-CoV-2 and the overall amount of viral RNA produced exceeded that produced by SARS-CoV (Fig. 3) . This may be indicative of certain assembly or maturation problems or of virus-host interactions that are different in the case of SARS-CoV-2. These possibilities merit further investigation, in particular since our preliminary EM studies suggested intriguing differences with SARS-CoV regarding the abundance of spikes on the surface of freshly released SARS-CoV-2 particles (Fig. 5n, r) .",

Mechanistically, these differences do not appear to be caused by extended base-pairing possibilities of the transcription regulatory sequences that direct the synthesis of these two mRNAs [24] . As in SARS-CoV, mRNA7 of SARS-CoV-2 encodes for two proteins, the ORF7a and ORF7b proteins, with the latter presumably being expressed following leaky ribosomal scanning [32] . Upon ectopic expression, the ORF7a protein has been reported to induce apoptosis via a caspasedependent pathway [87] and/or to be involved in cell-cycle arrest [88] . The ORF7b product is a poorly studied integral membrane protein that has (also) been detected in virions [89] . When ORF7a/b or ORF7a were deleted from the SARS-CoV genome, there was a minimal impact on the kinetics of virus replication in vitro in different cell lines, including Vero cells, and in vivo using mice. In another study, however, partial deletion of SARS-CoV ORF7b was reported to provide a replicative advantage in CaCo-2 and HuH7 cells, but not in Vero cells [90] .",

Soon after the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003, a conspicuous 29 nt (out-offrame) deletion in ORF8 was noticed in late(r) human isolates, but not in early human isolates and SARS-like viruses obtained from animal sources [93] [94] [95] . Consequently, loss of ORF8 function was postulated to reflect an adaptation to the human host. The re-engineering of an intact ORF8, using a reverse genetics system for the SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 isolate, yielded a virus with strikingly enhanced (up to 23-fold) replication properties in multiple systems [96] . Clearly, it remains to be established whether the increased synthesis of mRNAs 7 and 8 is a general feature of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and this indeed also translates into higher expression levels of the accessory proteins encoded by ORFs 7a, 7b and 8. If confirmed, these differences definitely warrant an in-depth follow-up analysis as CoV accessory proteins in general have been shown to be important determinants of virulence. They may thus be relevant for our understanding of the wide spectrum of respiratory disease symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients [97] .",

These compounds inhibited replication at similar low-micromolar concentrations and in a similar dose-dependent manner as observed for SARS-CoV (Fig. 6 ). Remdesivir is a prodrug of an adenosine analogue developed by Gilead Sciences. It was demonstrated to target the CoV RNA polymerase and act as a chain terminator [100] [101] [102] . The clinical efficacy of remdesivir is still being evaluated and, after some first encouraging results [103] , worldwide compassionate use trials are now being conducted. Likewise, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been labelled as potential 'game changers' and are being evaluated for treatment of severe COVID-19 patients [104] . Both compounds have been used to treat malaria and amebiasis [105] , until drug-resistant Plasmodium strains emerged [106] . These compounds can be incorporated into endosomes and lysosomes, raising the pH inside these intracellular compartments, which in turn may lead to defects in protein degradation and intracellular trafficking [68, 107] . An alternative hypothesis to explain their anti-SARS-CoV activity is based on their impact on glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor that is used by SARS-CoV [56] . Finally, as expected, the non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin A analogue alisporivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, as demonstrated previously for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [58] . Although the exact mode of action of this inhibitor is unclear, it is thought to modulate CoV interactions with members of the cyclophilin family [108] . Unfortunately, all of these in vitro antiviral activities should probably be classified as modest, emphasizing the urgency of large-scale drug repurposing and discovery programmes that target SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses at large.",

Sections (100 nm thick) were collected on mesh-100 copper EM grids covered with a carbon-coated Pioloform layer and post-stained with 7 % (wt/ vol) uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate. The samples were examined in a Twin transmission electron microscope [Thermo Fisher Scientific (formerly FEI)] operated at 120 kV and images were collected with a OneView 4 k high-frame rate CMOS camera (Gatan). and antiviral screening assay A 10 mM stock of Remdesivir (HY-104077; MedChemexpress) was dissolved in DMSO and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C in aliquots for single use. Alisporivir was kindly provided by DebioPharm (Dr Gr\u00e9goire Vuagniaux, Lausanne, Switzerland[44]) and a 20 mM stock was dissolved in 96 % ethanol and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in aliquots for single use. A 20 mM chloroquine stock (C6628; Sigma) was dissolved in PBS and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in aliquots for single use. Pegylated interferon alpha-2a (PEG-IFN-\u03b1; Pegasys, 90 mcg, Roche) was aliquoted and stored at room temperature until further use. Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well flat bottom plates in 100 \u00b5l at a density of 10 000 cells/well and grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Twofold serial dilutions of compounds were prepared in EMEM with 2 % FCS and 50 \u00b5l was added to the cells 30 min prior to infection. Subsequently, half of the wells were infected with 300 p.f.u. each of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in order to evaluate inhibition of infection, while the other wells were used to in parallel monitor the (potential) cytotoxicity of compound treatment. Each compound concentration was tested in quadruplicate and each assay plate contained the following controls: no cells (background control), cells only treated with medium (mock infection for normalization), infected/untreated cells and infected/solvent-treated cells (infection control). At 3 days p.i., 20 \u00b5l/well of CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation reagent (Promega) was added and plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Reactions were stopped and virus inactivated by adding 30 \u00b5l of 37 % formaldehyde. Absorbance was measured using a monochromatic filter in a multimode plate reader (Envision; Perkin Elmer). Data was normalized to the mock-infected control, after which EC 50 and CC 50 values were calculated with Graph-Pad Prism 7.",
