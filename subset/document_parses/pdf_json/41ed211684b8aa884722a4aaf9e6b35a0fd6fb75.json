The vast majority of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays use nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or oropharyngeal swab (OPS) specimens collected from suspected individuals. However, using NPS or OPS as specimens has apparent drawbacks, e.g. the collection procedures for NPS or OPS specimens can be uncomfortable to some people and may cause sneezing and coughing which in turn generate droplets and/or aerosol particles that are of risk to healthcare workers, requiring heavy use of personal protective equipment. There have been recent studies indicating that self-collected saliva specimens can be used for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 and provides more comfort and ease of use for the patients. Here we report the performance of QuantiVirus\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 test using saliva as the testing specimens with or without pooling.",

For clinical evaluation, 85 known positive and 90 known negative clinical NPS samples were tested. Additionally, twenty paired NPS and saliva samples collected from recovering COVID-19 patients were tested and the results were further compared to that of the Abbott m2000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay.

No cross-reactivity was observed for the QuantiVirus\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 test with common respiratory pathogens. Testing of clinical samples showed a positive percentage agreement (PPA) of 100% (95% CI: 94.6% to 100%) and a negative percentage agreement (NPA) of 98.9% (95% CI: 93.1% to 99.9%). QuantiVirus\u2122 SARS CoV-2 test had 80% concordance rate and no significant difference (p = 0.13) between paired saliva and NPS specimens by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Positive test rate was 1.79% for 389 saliva specimens collected from local communities for COVID-19 screening.

The disease was named the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization in February 2020. It has been determined that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from person-to-person (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and is more transmissible than SARS-CoV [3] [4] [5] .",

However, the collection procedures for NPS and OPS specimens may cause discomfort and, in some people, sneezing and coughing. The latter in turn can generate droplets or aerosol particles that place healthcare workers collecting these specimens at risk [6] , requiring heavy use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Poor tolerability of NPS and OPS sampling can result in false-negative tests due to inadequate or poor quality of specimen collection [7] [8] [9] [10] . Recent investigations by Wyllie et al. [11] and Hanson et al. [12] suggested that saliva is a viable and even more sensitive alternative to NPS specimens, and could also enable at-home self-administered sample collection for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Other researchers [13] also reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 91.7% (n = 11) of the initial saliva specimens from confirmed COVID-19 patients. All saliva specimens (n = 33) collected from patients whose NPS specimens tested negative for COVID-19 also tested negative. It is apparent that detection of SARS CoV-2 in saliva can be used as a more appealing and cost-effective alternative for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Indeed, a molecular test using saliva samples was first approved for FDA under EUA on May 8, 2020 [14] .",

The multiplex RT-qPCR test can simultaneously detect three viral gene targets, which can minimize false negative results as chances of simultaneous mutations in all three target genes in the viral genome are highly unlikely.

Our data showed 80% concordance and no significant differences between NP and saliva, which is consistent with Leung's & Vogels's reports.

Accordingly, the reason for the observation that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in three patient samples by the QuantiVirus\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 test but not by Abbott RealTime SARS-COV-2 assay was likely due to the higher sensitivity of the QuantiVirus\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 assay.

Therefore, in order to detect weakly positive patient in pooled samples, a RT-PCR test with LOD at 100-200 copies/mL or higher is required.

Cycle threshold (Ct) values for target gene and RP gene of NPS and saliva specimens were compared by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for viral E gene, N gene, O gene (ORF1ab), and human RNase P gene (RP) for NP and saliva specimens. A) E, N, and O Ct values for paired NP and saliva samples. Pairs are connected by a line. The Ct was set to 42 for samples in which signal was not detected. Ct values of E, N, and O were comparable between the two types of samples by Wilcoxon signed rank test. NPS and saliva concordance is about 80% with no significant differences (p = 0.13). B) RP Ct values for NP and saliva specimens were similar between the two types of samples by Wilcoxon signed rank test.",
