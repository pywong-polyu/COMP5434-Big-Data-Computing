Its rapid transmission is most probably caused by the fact that the virus entered a grossly naive, thus highly susceptible, human population, combined with the capacity of the virus to transmit during the asymptomatic phase of infection. Since no pharmaceutical interventions are universally available or applied, current policies to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 revolve around containment, social distancing, and the assumption that recovered patients develop protective immunity. It is still unclear whether protective immunity is indeed induced after infection, and for how long. The duration of protection will impact not only the overall course of the current pandemic, but also the post-pandemic period. To date, no concrete evidence of reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 is available, nor is any example of reinfection by SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, yet this is likely influenced by the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the limited scale of the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV epidemics. The limited available data on potential protective immunity against coronavirus reinfection is derived from one experimental infection study in volunteers (1), from which it is generally assumed that reinfection by coronaviruses can occur. Natural coronavirus infections and susceptibility to reinfection have not been investigated thus far. If they occur, reinfections will probably be dictated by two variables: exposure to the virus, and the quality of sustained immunity (2) . Even though it is not possible to investigate SARS-CoV-2 reinfections yet, the seasonal coronaviruses may serve as a reliable model. There are four species of seasonal coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. All are associated with mostly mild respiratory tract infections. However, aside from being etiological agents of common cold, the four viruses are biologically dissimilar. Two belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus, and two to the genus Betacoronavirus. The viruses use characteristic receptor molecules to enter a target cell, and based on receptor distribution they do not all enter the same epithelial cell type in the lungs (3) . Given this variability, the seasonal coronaviruses are the most representative virus group from which to conclude general coronavirus characteristics, particularly common denominators like host protective immunity and susceptibility to reinfection. Since most people experience their first seasonal coronavirus infection during early childhood (4-6), reinfections later in life can be investigated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1524, "end": 1527, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2188, "end": 2191, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MAIN TEXT"}, {"text": "The aim of this study was to investigate the time period between coronavirus reinfections and the dynamics of antibody decline following infection.

We observed no significant simultaneous infections for Alphacoronavirus (HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-229E) alongside Betacoronavirus (HCoV-HKU1 or HCoV-OC43), however, we did see that infections by the betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 often coincided (38.5%, Table 2 ). Likewise, for alphacoronaviruses, HCoV-229E infections coincided with HCoV-NL63 infections in 59.5% of the cases, and vice versa in 44.9% of the cases. Hence, there is a risk that we overestimated the number infections and thus reinfections. We therefore re-analyzed the data with a more stringent definition of infection, including only the strongest antibody rise induced by a Betacoronavirus or Alphacoronavirus at a given time point.

In fact, based on the minimum infection intervals and the dynamics of antibody waning that we observed, the protective immunity may last as little as 6 to 12 months.

Herd immunity occurs when a threshold proportion of a population is immune to a certain pathogen, and protects even non-immune individuals against the infection by limiting overall spread.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, achieving herd immunity may be challenging due to rapid loss of protective immunity. It was recently suggested that recovered individuals should receive a so-called \"immunity passport\" (17) which would allow them to relax social distancing measures and provide governments with data on herd immunity levels in the population.
