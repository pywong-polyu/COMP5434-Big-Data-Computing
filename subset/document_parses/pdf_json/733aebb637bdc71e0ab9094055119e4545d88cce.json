To understand and study the effect of these changes on animal microbial communities' dynamics, the most appropriate sampling design tools must be applied, and mathematical and computational methods must also be developed to deal with this challenging subject.

Chen Y. et al. conducted a confined experiment in which healthy individuals were enclosed together in a space capsule on the ground for 180 days, which revealed that both the structure and diversity of the nasal and oropharyngeal microbiota changed over time and were shared between the participants, during the study. A work by Fu et al. shows that domestication is also a modulator of gut microbiome diversity in yak which paves the way for the development of new commercial strains in livestock based on the biotechnology of gut microbiota.",

Furthermore, gut microbes develop catabolic activity to circumvent the antimicrobial activity of certain food additives such as vanillin. Gene clusters specific for the vanillin metabolism and intermediary metabolic pathways have been identified by metagenomic analysis in several gut microbial populations (Yadav et al.) . The metabolomic analysis brings forth the functionality of the vanillin catabolic pathway. These results highlight the human gut microbial features and metabolic bioprocess involved in vanillin catabolism to overcome its antimicrobial activity.",

In contrast, the non-treated vaginal microbiome is enriched with anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria, namely, Gardnerella, Prevotella, Escherichia, Shigella, Streptococcus, Atopobium, Aerococcus, Anaerotruncus, and Anaerococcus, apart from Chlamydia and Streptococcus.

However physiological conditions and interventions of critical respiratory tract patients, such as mechanical ventilation and antibiotics administration, dramatically alter the respiratory tract microbiome, leading to dysbiosis and favoring the colonization by opportunistic and resistant pathogens (P\u00e9rez-Cobas et al.) . Therefore, this microbial imbalance is linked with various diseases and significantly reduces the quality of one's life. Varying inflammatory profiles are associated with specific microbial compositions, while the same is true for many disease conditions and environmental exposures. A shift in the microbial composition is also detected upon the administration of numerous therapeutics, highlighting other beneficial and adverse side effects (Elgamal et al., 2021) .",
