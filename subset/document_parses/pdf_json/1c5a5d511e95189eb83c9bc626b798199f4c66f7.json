Several studies have noted that the majority of people in sub-Saharan African are noncompliant with proposed health and safety measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and respective country health departments. In most sub-Saharan African countries, noncompliance is attributable to ignorance and misinformation, thereby raising questions about people's knowledge, attitudes, perception, and practices towards COVID-19 in these settings. This situation is particularly of concern for governments and public health experts. Thus, this scoping review is aimed at mapping evidence on the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and preventive practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that the main mode of transmission of COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets of an infected person when they sneeze or cough [6] [7] [8] [9] . Even though the spread of COVID-19 is at its peak in most European and American countries, it is still accelerating in most African countries [9, 10] . The high infection rate in sub-Saharan Africa can present a much difficult situation because of different comorbidities combined with poverty, poor healthcare services and limited access to health facilities [9, 11] . To control and prevent contracting and spreading COVID-19, people need to possess appropriate knowledge regarding the disease, have correct attitude and follow correct practices against the virus. A study conducted in Jimma town, Ethiopia in 2020, showed that a larger percentage of the participants knew the key clinical symptoms and mode of transmission of COVID-19 and that older people who have chronic illnesses were at high risk of developing a severe form of coronavirus-19 [12] . Another study in Africa noted a huge disparity in knowledge, attitude and practice towards the virus [13] . Further studies conducted in SSA reported that residents were noncompliant with proposed health and safety measures recommended by the WHO and respective country health departments. This was due to ignorance and misinformation [9, 10] . A scoping review of literature on KAP studies conducted in SSA towards COVID-19 is critical in order to develop tailored interventions. Therefore, it is anticipated that the results of this study will reveal research gaps to guide health experts in decision-making in SSA, as well as develop policies and interventions tailored towards bridging the gap.",

This is in contrast with some studies where the participants had reported not using masks in crowded areas and when leaving home [29, 52] . Two studies showed that females had more negative attitude towards COVD-19 prevention than males [38, 48] . A study conducted in Ethiopia among traditional healers and religious clerics showed that most respondents believed that COVID-19 was due to God's punishment (n = 356, 86.8%) and traditional healers/religious clerics (n = 278, 67.8%) were better in managing COVID-19 compared to physicians [31] . There is a need for further education to convey the importance of forming a positive attitude to reduce the contraction and transmission of COVID-19.",

Majority of respondents from included studies reported practice towards COVID-19 as wearing a face mask, avoiding crowded areas, observing physical/social distancing, washing hands and using sanitizers [9, 10, 12, 29-33, 35-37, 39, 42-46, 48, 50, 52, 53] .

Two studies conducted in Ethiopia found a high prevalence of poor knowledge of COVID-19, negative attitude, and poor practice among participants [10, 29] . This might be due to the similarities in access to information, socio-demographic characteristics, and awareness [29] . This study found that majority of the participants from the western region had very good knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice towards COVID-19 [37, 38, 41-43, 50, 53] , as compared to the eastern region where most participants had low knowledge, negative attitude, and poor practice towards COVID-19 [10, 29, 31, 33] . A possible explanation for the participants' good KAP in the western region could be attributed to the unlimited access to information about COVID-19, disseminated on various media [38] , which was different from the eastern region, where most participants had no access to internet and electricity, thereby resulting in limited access to COVID-19 related updates and information [29] . Participants from few studies believe that the governments are not doing enough to prevent and control COVID-19 outbreaks in their countries [9, 33, 34, 40, 43] . Importantly, good knowledge about COVID-19 did not always appear to be a precursor of positive attitude or preventative practices and vice versa. In other words, in some instances, knowledge score was high, but attitude and/ or preventative practice was poor [9, 31, 38, [43] [44] [45] 49] . A number of pharmacists in Ethiopia had confidence in healthcare facilities' capacity to properly handle potential COVID-19 outbreak in the country [36] . Health authorities in SSA countries need to prioritize the safety of healthcare workers from COVID-19 infection at the healthcare facilities.",

However, few studies showed the wearing of face masks and hand hygiene as a priority, hence these were rarely purchased and few wore face masks when leaving home, despite possessing relatively good knowledge [10, 33, 47, 52] . The practice of physical/social distancing was not adhered to in some studies [10, 12, 31, 51] . In this study, we found that more than half (51.7%) of the study participants perceived practicing a physical distance as a difficult COVID-19 health protocol [10] . Nonetheless, implementing these preventative measures will likely help to slow down the spread of the virus in the communities.",

Therefore, it is important to strengthen health education, information broadcasting, and awareness on the knowledge, attitude, and practice of COVID-19 to slow down this pandemic. There is also a need to make available enough personal protective equipment to health care workers, raise their awareness of infection prevention and control in health facilities in SSA and interventions that improve the community's knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 prevention are needed.",
