The present experimental study evaluated the effect of exposure to messages targeting cognitive attitude plus anticipated positive (pride) or negative (regret) affective reactions on intention to get vaccinated. Participants included 484 Italian adults randomly allocated to one of four conditions: 1) cognitive attitude message; 2) cognitive attitude plus positive anticipated affect message; 3) cognitive attitude plus negative anticipated affect message; 4) no message. Results showed that participants in the second condition reported greater intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with those in the control condition.",

            "text": "December 2020 marked, in much of the world, the start of the vaccination campaign against COVID-19. Mass vaccination represents an essential weapon to control the pandemic. However, its success depends not only on how safe and effective the approved vaccines are but also on the intention to vaccinate and their actual uptake among the general population. Among the population not yet vaccinated, a recent survey found the majority of Italians (79%) willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 (Ipsos, 2021) . Several studies conducted before the approval of any vaccine against COVID-19 showed similar results. For example, Caserotti et al. (2021) reported that Italians had strong intentions to get vaccinated in the early stages of the pandemic (February-June 2020), particularly during the lockdown phase, with 86% of the participants saying they were willing to pay to receive the vaccine when available. However, in another study (Graffigna et al., 2020) conducted during the early days of the reopening after the first lockdown, only 59% of the respondents declared that they would accept the vaccine, whereas 15% said that they would refuse it, and the remaining 26% were hesitant. Later in the pandemic, with the approval of the first COVID vaccines (i.e., Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines), the percentage of people who reported being uncertain about the vaccine appears to have increased. For J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f example, in a study on a representative sample of one Italian region (Emilia Romagna), 31% of participants declared themselves COVID vaccine hesitant (Reno et al., 2021) .",

This is in line with previous literature demonstrating that attitude is the strongest predictor of intention to get vaccinated (e.g., Britt & Englebert, 2018; Cha & Kim, 2019; Hofman et al., 2013; Lehmann et al., 2014; Ratanasiripong et al., 2018) . In particular, cognitive evaluations about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine in question represent important determinants of vaccination intention and behaviour (Xiao, 2019) . The role of attitude has been widely emphasised in the context of social cognitive models of health behaviour, such as Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) . Although these models have proved effective in predicting several health behaviours, including vaccination (e.g., Caso et al., 2019), they are predominantly cognitive theories that ignore the role of affective processes that may affect intention and behaviour (Williams et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, in recent years, a growing literature has explored and demonstrated the usefulness of including an affective component, especially in the TPB model (e.g., Conner et al., 2013; Stevens et al., 2019) . In particular, it has been widely shown that adding the component of anticipated affective reactions (e.g., anticipated regret) to the TPB increases the proportion of the explained variance in intention and behaviour (Sandberg & Conner, 2008) .",

Anticipated regret has proven to be a key factor both in influencing the decision to get personally vaccinated (Christy et al., 2016; Weinstein et al., 2007) and vaccinate someone else (e.g., in the case of mandatory or recommended vaccinations for children and adolescents; Caso et al., 2019; 2021a; Ziarnowski et al., 2009) . For example, in a recent study on the HPV and influenza vaccinations, Pen\u0163a et al. (2020) found that inaction anticipated regret was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the strongest predictor of intention for both types of vaccinations, over and above cognitive variables (knowledge, perceived susceptibility and severity in relation to the disease, perceived vaccine effectiveness and safety). A very similar result was also found in a study by Christy et al. (2016) , who reported that inaction anticipated regret was associated with intention to receive the HPV vaccine, beyond a series of cognitive variables (e.g., perceived risk of developing genital warts or cancer), but only among male participants. Generally, inaction anticipated regret appears to be more relevant than action anticipated regret in the context of vaccination (Brewer et al., 2016) .",

Although the study investigated a particular type of intention, the results highlighted that anticipated feelings of pride influenced the personal norm concerning vaccination (i.e., the sense of moral obligation to get vaccinated), which in turn affected intention. It must be noted that the results of these studies are insufficient to draw strong conclusions regarding Abhyankar et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2019; Nan, 2012) . In particular, numerous intervention and experimental studies successfully targeted anticipated affects to promote different health behaviours (see Conner et al., 2020) . For example, Martinez (2014) found that persuasive messages focused on attitude plus anticipated regret, compared with messages focused on attitude only, significantly increased participants' intention to consume folic acid. Similarly, manipulating anticipated negative affects proved effective in increasing intention to drink at least 2L of water a day (Carfora et al., 2018) , willingness to become an organ donor (O'Carroll et al., 2011) , and cancer screening attendance (O'Carroll et al., 2015; Sandberg & Conner, 2009 ). Regarding vaccination behaviour, Kim (2020) demonstrated that the effect of health promotion messages on attitude and intention to receive the HPV vaccine was fully mediated by changes in inaction anticipated regret. In addition, another relevant result emerged from the study conducted by Cox et al. (2014) . These authors demonstrated that simply asking anticipated regret questions increased mothers' intention to vaccinate their daughters against human papillomavirus (HPV). Despite the fact that, in this study, the effect of the anticipated regret questions only worked in mothers who had been exposed to a graphic message about the possible consequences of HPV vaccination (compared with those exposed to a text-only message), such results emphasise the potential of targeting anticipated affects in promoting vaccination intention.",

In response to RQ1, the results showed that only participants in the cognitive attitude J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f plus positive affect message condition reported significantly higher intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with participants in the control group. This highlights that cognitive attitude and anticipated pride could play a crucial role in the decision-making process related to COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, in contrast with studies (e.g., Cox et al., 2014; Ziarnowski et al., 2009 ) that showed the effectiveness of manipulating anticipated regret to increase vaccination intention, participants exposed to the message focused on cognitive attitude plus anticipated negative affect (regret) did not report higher levels of intention compared with those in the control condition. These findings can have more than one explanation. As Chou and Budenz (2020) people's attitudes toward the vaccine, with particular emphasis on its safety and efficacy aspects, and appealing to affects could represent that extra step that makes the persuasive message really effective. Promoting a more positive approach with respect to vaccination behaviour should take into consideration the process that leads to the intention to vaccinate in its complexity, which includes, without doubt, the role of affective variables. (they intend to get vaccinated or not), are both aspects that could have a substantial impact on the decision-making process that leads to vaccination, especially in consideration of the context uncertainty (e.g., doubts about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines) in which this decision is taken. Furthermore, considering that many countries are starting to vaccinate or consider vaccinating children and young people, studying the impact of social influences appears even more relevant. Indeed, younger people's attitudes towards vaccines appear to be heavily influenced by social norms (Rambout et al., 2014) ; in this perspective, learning that most people significant to them (e.g., parents or friends) get vaccinated can represent, for the youngest, an important motivational factor.",

This is especially true when it comes to vaccination, since increasing the intentions to get vaccinated of even a few people can have huge practical consequences, as vaccinated people protect not J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f only themselves but also people around them. Also, the result that the exposure to a single persuasive message has produced a small but significant effect on intentions appears to us somewhat encouraging, as it suggests that a more structured intervention (e.g., daily exposure to persuasive messages) in larger populations could have a stronger effect.",

Surprisingly, most studies that have tested the effectiveness of persuasive messages in the context of vaccination behaviour focused only on the classic distinction between gain-framed and loss-framed messages (e.g., Abhyankar et al., 2008) , leaving aside the possible role of the affective components. As far as we know, our is the first study in which the combined effect of affective and cognitive variables is examined. Even though further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of persuasive messages targeting cognitive attitude plus anticipated positive affective reactions, our results emphasise the need for future COVID-19 (and not only) vaccination promotion campaigns to take into account the role of affective processes in the design and implementation of more effective communication strategies to promote vaccination intention and behaviour.

In addition, all posters featured the logo of the Italian Ministry of Health in order to strengthen the persuasive impact of the message through the use of an expert source (Hopfer, 2012). Finally, since past research showed that prosocial motives could reinforce the decision to get vaccinated (Betsch et al., 2013; Quadri-Sheriff et al., 2012), we also included a prosocial component in the messages (i.e., \"... protect yourself and others\"). After being exposed to the posters, participants in all conditions completed the postmanipulation measures (intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19, cognitive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination, anticipated positive and negative affective reactions). At the end of the questionnaire, the participants were informed that the poster was not real but built for research purposes only.

However, complete post-hoc comparisons on all post-manipulation measures are presented in Appendix A (Section 3). 6.4 Mediation analysis J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The results of the analysis described above showed that participants in the cognitive attitude plus positive affect message condition (condition 2) reported higher intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with those in the control group. Accordingly, we evaluated whether the effect of condition 2 versus control on intention was mediated by changes in cognitive attitude and anticipated positive affective reactions. Results of the parallel mediation analysis indicated that the effect of condition 2 versus control on intention (Direct effect = .10; 95% CI [-.04, .25]; Total effect = .51; 95% CI [.19, .82]) was totally mediated by cognitive attitude (Indirect effect = .26; 95% bootstrapped CI [.07, .50]) and anticipated positive affective reactions (Indirect effect = .14; 95% bootstrapped CI [.02, .29]). In addition, indirect effect contrasts showed no significant difference between the indirect effects of cognitive attitude and anticipated positive affective reactions (Effect = .12; 95% bootstrapped CI [-.08, .37]). Unstandardised path coefficients are displayed in Figure 2. Additional mediation analyses contrasting conditions 1 or 3 and the control condition are reported in Appendix A (Section 3).

In such a context, activating positive affects in relation to the possibility of being vaccinated could be a good strategy to increase intention and counterbalance the possible negative affects aroused by the pandemic and fear of vaccines. Another possible explanation for this result is that anticipated positive affects can represent a drive for action to the extent they are experienced immediately after putting in place the behaviour(Stevens et al., 2019). In the case of COVID-19 vaccination, targeting regret about a future negative outcome (e.g., getting sick or infecting loved ones) that is not necessarily going to occur may not be enough to increase the intention to get vaccinated. Conversely, emphasising pride that one might experience immediately after engaging in the recommended behaviour may be a more salient factor in influencing vaccination-related decision-making.Moreover, in response to RQ2, our results showed that both cognitive attitude and anticipated positive affective reactions fully mediated the effect of the experimental condition (targeting cognitive attitude and anticipated positive affect) on intention to get vaccinated. Although the messages targeting only cognitive attitude did not prove sufficient in modifying intention, these findings instead show the usefulness of working jointly on cognitive and positive affective aspects J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in promoting vaccination intention.

As specified above, the data on the time course of the vaccination campaign in Italy is in line with those of the neighbouring countries of the EU (around 60% of fully vaccinated people). However, the percentage of people still hesitant about the vaccine should not be underestimated, particularly in the older age groups (e.g., over 60s and 70s), where there is currently the lowest adhesion to vaccines (Italian Ministry of Health, 2021b).For this reason, further studies are needed to verify whether the type of persuasive messages that we have identified as the most effective in promoting intention to receive the future COVID-19 vaccine also works in increasing intention to get the currently approved vaccines and the consequent behaviour and their impact on different socio-demographic groups. Secondly, since we used a convenience sample recruited by advertising the study through various online channels (e.g., Facebook groups), we cannot conclude that our results are generalisable to the general population and, above all, participants that did not already have high levels of vaccination intention. However, the heterogeneity of participants in terms of socio-demographic characteristics may have partially reduced this bias. Thirdly, although in the literature there is no convincing evidence that affective J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f attitudeunlike anticipated affective reactionscan predict vaccination intention, future studies with larger samples could simultaneously manipulate both components of the attitude (cognitive vs affective) plus anticipated affective reactions to clarify better if and how these processes are mutually exclusive in the context of the decision-making process related to COVID-19 vaccination.In addition, it should be noted that we have not focused on all the variables of the TPB model but only on attitude and intention. Future studies should also consider, for example, the possible effect of subjective norms on the intention to get vaccinated against COVID, since the literature shows that subjective norms, after attitude, are the strongest predictors of vaccination intentions (e.g.,Askelson et al., 2010). Injunctive norms, i.e. what significant others (family, friends) think the person should do (to get vaccinated or not), and descriptive norms, i.e. what they do themselves",
