            "text": "Directed evolution is a powerful tool for the selection of functional ligands from molecular libraries. Extracellular domains (ECDs) of cell surface receptors are common selection targets for therapeutic and imaging agent development. Unfortunately, these proteins are often post-translationally modified and are therefore unsuitable for expression in bacterial systems. Directional immobilization of these targets is further hampered by the absence of biorthogonal groups for site-specific chemical conjugation. We have developed a nonadherent mammalian expression system for rapid, high-yield expression of biotinylated ECDs. ECDs from EGFR, HER2, and HER3 were site-specifically biotinylated in situ and recovered from the cell culture supernatant with yields of up to 10 mg/L at >90% purity. Biotinylated ECDs also contained a protease cleavage site for rapid and selective release of the ECD after immobilization on avidin/streptavidin resins and library binding. A model mRNA display selection round was carried out against the HER2 ECD with the HER2 affibody expressed as an mRNA\u2212protein fusion. HER2 affibody\u2212mRNA fusions were selectively released by thrombin and quantitative PCR revealed substantial improvements in the enrichment of functional affibody\u2212 mRNA fusions relative to direct PCR amplification of the resin-bound target. This methodology allows rapid purification of highquality targets for directed evolution and selective elution of functional sequences at the conclusion of each selection round.",

            "text": "Efficient directed evolution screens and selections are critical for the development of novel peptide-and protein-based affinity ligands, therapeutics, and imaging agents. 1,2 Directed evolution of peptide, peptidomimetics, and protein libraries can be carried out using phage display, 3 bacterial display, 4 yeast display, 5 ribosome display, 6 and mRNA display. 7 These display technologies are based on the creation of a library of compounds directly linked to the genetic information used to encode them. In a typical selection experiment, libraries are panned against an immobilized target, subjected to washing to remove nonfunctional sequences, enriched for functional sequences in an elution step, and amplified to generate an enriched library for the next selection round. 8\u221212 This iterative screening strategy has been used to select high-affinity ligands for the development of novel imaging agents and therapeutics. 13 \u221218 The success of a selection experiment is dependent upon many parameters including library design, selection pressure stringency, and target presentation. In the latter case, failure to present the protein target in its folded state with correct posttranslational modifications may result in a final pool of ligands with poor affinity and selectivity for the biologically relevant form of the protein. Many directed evolution screens or selections have been carried out against the extracellular domains (ECDs) of cancer-associated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 11, 19 or immune checkpoint receptors. 20, 21 Unfortunately, many ECD targets are prohibitively expensive, are of unknown quality even if an ECD is commercially available, or challenging to express in quantities sufficient for selection and downstream validation experiments. Moreover, mammalian cell expression is preferred for ECD targets because they are chaperone-dependent, 22 disulfide-rich, 23 and often decorated with N-and O-glycosylation. 24, 25 These features make it very challenging to produce biologically relevant mammalian ECDs in bacterial expression systems. 26 Unfortunately, ECD expression in adherent mammalian cells requires transfection, stable clone selection, and cost-prohibitive cell factory production. 25 In addition to expression and purification, site-specific immobilization of ECD proteins remains challenging. Common nonspecific immobilization strategies include direct chemical immobilization on reactive resins by NHS, maleimide, and other conjugation chemistries. 27, 28 Alternatively, nonselective biotinylation can be similarly performed, followed by immobilization on avidin/streptavidin resins. Although this strategy is often the most facile and straightforward, nonspecific biotinylation may occlude potential binding surfaces and result in nonbiologically relevant target presentation.",

            "text": "A third challenge in directed evolution experiments is the selective recovery of high-affinity library members that remain bound to the immobilized target protein. A variety of solutions have been proposed to address this problem including competitive elution with a known ligand, 29 the use of an \"acid bump\" elution, 30 the use of detergents (e.g., SDS 31 ), passive adsorption and recovery from immuno tubes, 32 and onresin amplification of the genetic component of the bound library. Although highly selective, elution with a competitor ligand biases selected sequences to those that share a common epitope with the competitor and may not efficiently elute the highest affinity library members. Moreover, in the case of a novel or poorly characterized target, a high-affinity competitor ligand may be unavailable. Elution with acid or detergent is a nonspecific process and may result in amplification of lowaffinity/selectivity sequences, sequences that bind the capture resin, and/or loss of library members that are not acid-elutable. Detergent-based elution also typically requires downstream processing to remove the detergent in order to perform genetic amplification. Failure to remove the detergent may dramatically reduce the efficiency of the subsequent amplification step. Protein conformation may also be altered via surface unfolding using passive adsorption, which may create unnatural epitopes and occlude desired targeting interfaces. 33 Similar to nonspecific elution, direct amplification of the resin-bound library is also likely to result in amplification of nonfunctional sequences, particularly if the library contains a significant amount of unfused genetic material or there is significant binding to the solid-phase resin itself. In contrast, selective elution of the immobilized target could result in the recovery of target-specific library members and eliminate the need for downstream cleanup procedures.",

Several in situ biotinylation technologies have been reported, 34\u221236 and the expression system described in this manuscript adapts them to a nonadherent, commercially available, high-density mammalian cell culture. This technology allows production of properly folded and post-translationally modified ECDs of epidermal growth factor receptor family members (EGFR, HER2, and HER3) 37 in the cell culture supernatant. These proteins are enzymatically biotinylated at the C-terminus in situ during expression for directional immobilization on avidin/streptavidin resins. In contrast to other in situ biotinylation systems, 35 ECD and BirA biotinylation expression is split between two vectors allowing production of nonbiotinylated protein, if necessary. To enable selective elution of the resin-bound target, a protease cleavage site was installed immediately N-terminal to the biotinylation site. Biotinylated ECDs were found to be properly folded and could be expressed and purified in multimilligram quantities in less than 2 weeks. Mock selection with an affibody\u2212mRNA fusion followed by protease elution demonstrated significant signal-to-noise enhancement relative to direct on-resin amplification and specific enrichment of the affibody over the scrambled counterpart.",

These are common cancer-associated RTKs that are exploited in multiple diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. 45 The DNA constructs included an SP derived from G. princeps luciferase 46 to direct the ECDs into the secretory system where they are posttranslationally modified (e.g., disulfide shuffling, glycosylation). This sequence was previously found to increase the secretion of mammalian extracellular proteins. 46 The C-terminus of each ECD contained a BirA tag for sitespecific biotinylation followed by a 6x His-tag for Ni 2+ -NTA purification. A protease site (thrombin or TEV) was included immediately N-terminal to the biotinylation site allowing the release of immobilized ECD by digestion with the appropriate protease. The expression system uses commercially available, high-density, nonadherent 293-F cells grown on a cell incubator shaker platform in flasks. The cells are transiently transfected with the ECD expression plasmid either alone or in tandem with a construct that expresses and secretes BirA. Cotransfection allows for the biotinylation of the ECD Cterminal BirA tag in the secretory route and/or cell culture media (in situ biotinylation). 38 Validation and Characterization of ECD Purification and Biotinylation.

A time-course analysis of HER2 ECD expression in CM showed peak expression at 5 days post-transfection (Figure 2A) . Expression of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) was carried out as a positive control and showed high levels of protein in the CM at day 6. We note that IgG appears in the anti-HER2 western blot as a result of reactivity with the HRPconjugated secondary antibody. As expected, the negative control (no transfection, lane 5) shows no signal at 75\u2212100 kDa.",

No exogenous d-biotin added (lane 3) and no transfection controls (lane 4) were also included. The addition of exogenous d-biotin did not significantly increase the amount of biotinylated HER2, indicating that biotin is present in sufficient levels in CM to support biotinylation during expression. To determine the effect of free biotin on purification by SA-agarose, we purified in situ biotinylated EGFR ECD with SA-agarose with and without prior dialysis of the CM ( Figure 3D ). The undialyzed EGFR-biotin shows no resin binding (lane 4), while the dialyzed EGFR-biotin protein is efficiently bound (lane 7). This assay demonstrates that dialysis of the CM is essential if streptavidin/avidin-mediated capture of biotinylated ECD is performed prior to subsequent purification steps. The approximate efficiency of in situ biotinylation for HER3 and EGFR was found to be 72 and 80%, respectively, in these samples ( Figure 3E ). Over multiple independent experiments with different ERBB constructs, the mean in situ biotinylation efficiency was found to be 75% \u00b1 3.9% (n = 5), which was lower than the efficiency observed for in vitro biotinylation.

For each assay, we tested the binding of a ligand that requires proper ECD post-translational folding and orientation. Each ELISA schematic can be found under the associated binding curve in Figure 4 . To assess HER2, the anti-HER2 affibody was used, which binds only to properly folded HER2. 48 In this assay ( Figure 4A ), the HER2 ECD was found to bind the HER2 affibody with a dissociation constant (K D ) of 2.00 nM (+/\u2212 0.16 nM), which is in-line with published accounts of the bivalent affibody (3 nM). 49 Hrg\u03b21 is the natural growth factor for HER3 and requires a properly folded HER3 (domains I and II) for maximum affinity. 50 We found that biotinylated HER3 ECD binds Hrg\u03b21 with a K D of 12.6 nM (+/\u22120.82 nM) ( Figure 4B ), which is also consistent with literature values (9.1 to 68 nM). 50, 51 Similarly, EGFR ECD bound to immobilized EGF with a K D of 125 nM (+/\u2212 6.7 nM), a value in-line with previously published values (177 nM) 52 ( Figure 4C ). We note that the Hill slopes for all three ligand\u2212receptor interactions were greater than 1. This may be explained by the dependence of ERBB receptor affinity on the oligomerization state with evidence for multiple ligand binding sites in the dimeric state. 53\u221256 This effect may also arise from the assay setup where a high local concentration of ligand is present on the surface. This may perturb the free diffusion of receptor when it is in close proximity to the surface yielding apparent binding cooperativity. This phenomenon has been well documented in the biosensor literature. 57, 58 These assays provide strong evidence that our expression and in situ biotinylation methodology leads to the production of properly folded and biologically active ECDs that can be used in downstream biochemical assays and selection experiments.",

Nonbiotinylated HER2/3 with TEV or thrombin cleavage sites were incubated with their respective proteases in solution and analyzed by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 5A ) and western blotting ( Figure 5B ). After Coomassie staining, a slight band downshift is observed after TEV and thrombin cleavage, indicating proteolysis of the C-terminal fragment containing the His-tag. To confirm C-terminal His-tag removal, we performed a western blot with an anti-His-tag antibody. Without protease, a strong band (\u223c90 kDa) is detected, indicating that the His-tag is intact. Following protease incubation, the C-terminal His-tag is lost, resulting in dramatically reduced band intensity. The TEV protease itself contains a His-tag and therefore is detected in the western blot at \u223c25 kDa. Thrombin is \u223c35 kDa but does not have a His-tag and is barely visible after Coomassie staining. To determine if the proteases are also active in the context of a resin, biotinylated HER3 with a thrombin or TEV cleavage site was bound to SA resin and incubated with or with a thrombin/TEV cleavage site was bound to streptavidin (SA) resin and incubated with or without thrombin/TEV. Densitometry indicates 90% release by thrombin and 71.5% release by TEV. To the right is a schematic of the proteolytic release from the SA resin. These data confirm that thrombin and TEV can release the ECD from the resin without ECD proteolysis. without TEV or thrombin ( Figure 5C ). In fractions analyzed by Coomassie, both proteases release the ECD (lane 2, \u223c90 kDa), leaving very little bound to the resin (lane 4). Without protease, the ECD remains with the resin (lane 7). In both solution and on-resin reactions, thrombin is more effective than TEV in releasing the ECD from immobilized streptavidin. Over multiple independent experiments with multiple ERBB constructs, the mean release efficiency with thrombin was 91% \u00b1 6.4% (n = 9) while the mean release efficiency of TEV was 77% \u00b1 5.3% (n = 3).

Next, we determined if the addition of a specific elution step via site-specific protease digestion could be incorporated into an mRNA display selection (Figure 7) . mRNA display is a powerful biological display technology where translated peptides and proteins are covalently fused to their encoding mRNAs via a puromycin linker effectively linking the genotype (RNA) with its phenotype (peptide). 12 In order to track mRNA\u2212protein fusions through purification and selection steps, translation is carried out in the presence of [ 35 S]-methionine resulting in incorporation of the 35 S radionuclide at all methionine positions in the fused protein. The process of mRNA display is shown in Figure 8A and described in more detail in the Experimental Procedures section. After panning the fusion library against an immobilized target, functional sequences can be recovered by PCR of the reverse-transcribed DNA. The recovered DNA is then transcribed and translated to generate an enriched protein library for the next round of selection. After multiple rounds of selection, the diversity of the mRNA display library is dramatically reduced, allowing identification of functional peptide/protein sequences through DNA sequencing. One of the challenges unique to mRNA display is unwanted amplification of mRNA that failed to fuse with a translated peptide/protein. Unfortunately, fusion efficiency is around 10%, 43 leaving greater than 90% of mRNA linker free to bind nonspecifically to the solid support. This is highly likely to increase noise during the selection experiment and accumulation of false-positive sequences in the final pool. In the following experiments, we generated mRNA\u2212protein fusions consisting of a HER2-binding affibody and a nonfunctional scrambled affibody to test the specific release of HER2 ECD with thrombin treatment. This strategy allowed us to compare the target binding and elution of functional (mRNA\u2212 affibody) and nonfunctional (mRNA\u2212scrambled) fusions and to compare the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of proteasemediated elution relative to direct on-bead amplification.",

Addition of thrombin results in nearly quantitative cleavage and release of the resin-bound affibody, with minimal activity remaining on the resin ( Figure 9A ). In contrast, merely washing the resin with buffer (no thrombin) fails to release the affibody fusion and results in retention of affibody on the resin.

We performed qPCR on the eluent and resuspended resin, with or without thrombin treatment, and converted to input picograms (pg) DNA by extrapolation from a standard curve ( Figure 9C ).

Addition of thrombin has no effect on the efficiency of the PCR reaction ( Figure S3 ). Taken together, these data indicate that selective, protease-mediated elution of target results in considerably higher yields and lower nonspecific background compared to direct PCR amplification of the solidphase resin.",

            "text": "Specific Affibody Enrichment in Mixed Screen. To assess if the functional affibody is enriched in HER2 selections, we performed the experiment described in Figure 10 . Translated fusions were mixed in a ratio of 100:1 (scrambled/affibody), allowed to bind to HER2, and washed. The resin was split for resin-bound control or thrombin elution. After PCR amplification, fractions were subjected to digestion by HaeIII where the affibody DNA is left intact but the scrambled DNA is digested at a single cut site ( Figure  10A ). This digestion eliminates the 240 bp scrambled DNA, leaving only the 240 bp affibody DNA product. Figure 10B ,C displays the agarose gels of each fraction along with input controls. The affibody DNA remains intact on the gel in the presence of HaeIII but the scrambled affibody DNA is quantitatively digested (Figure 10B ), indicating that HaeIII digest works to completion. The mixed input (100:1) is mostly scrambled DNA as is the flow-through fraction. Figure 10C supports strong enrichment of the affibody over scrambled in the thrombin elution and resin control. In contrast, the DNA remaining on the thrombin-treated resin is derived almost entirely from the scrambled population. The band intensity (top band of 240 bp) was quantified by densitometry, allowing a simple calculation of affibody fraction (240 bp band intensity in the digested lane/240 bp band intensity in the nondigested lane) for each digest replicate (n = 3, Figure 10D ). DNA from affibody fusion PCR has a value close to 1, indicating that it is not digested and therefore is pure affibody DNA. Conversely, this value approaches 0 for the scrambled fusions. Interestingly, the value decreases in the unbound flow-through versus the mixed input, indicating that the small amount of affibody fusions in the input mix bound the HER2 resin (p = 0.012). The fraction affibody is high in thrombin-eluted samples (0.70) and control resin (0.37) but low in the resin after thrombin treatment (0.087). The fraction of affibody DNA after thrombin elution was nearly twice that of the on-resin sample and this difference was statistically significant (p value < 0.001). This 2-fold enhancement in SNR following thrombin elution is very much in-line with the results shown in Figure 9 . These data also confirm that our purified HER2 is properly folded, binds selectively to affibody fusions, and can be efficiently released by thrombin.",

Indeed, the experiment described in Figure 9 required preclearing with a blocked resin to eliminate the high background of largely unfused genetic material. This observation also highlights the challenges associated with unfused genetic material, which binds nonspecifically to the solid-phase support during mRNA Display selections. If this material is amplified at the end of each round, it will introduce significant noise in the selection process, which may increase the number of false-positive (nonfunctional) sequences in the final pool. Aside from the time-consuming and costly process of identifying and discarding these sequences in the validation stage, increased noise also decreases specific enrichment of target binding sequences and extends the number of selection rounds required for library convergence. Fortunately, the data in Figure 10D suggest that the nonspecific fusion material bound to the streptavidin or the agarose matrix can be eliminated from the final eluent, providing a pathway to noise reduction throughout the selection. Given the SNR values in Figure 9D , a starting diversity of 10 13 unique sequences, and a final goal of 10 3 functional sequences, protease-mediated target release could potentially decrease the selection process by two rounds relative to on-resin PCR.",

Reducing noise in directed evolution screens is critical to a successful selection. This can be accomplished, in part, by generating high-quality protein targets and selectively immobilizing them on inert, biologically compatible resins. Our purification scheme is designed to decrease upfront time costs associated with each screen, allowing researchers to rapidly and inexpensively generate folded, site-specifically biotinylated targets for downstream selection applications. Indeed, target purification and immobilization can be carried out in a single step. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of in vitro biotinylation of proteins expressed in E. coli 29 and in situ biotinylation in adherent mammalian cell systems. 38 Although these methods work well for the largescale production of unmodified proteins or small-scale production of post-translationally modified proteins, they are unsuitable for the rapid production of multimilligram quantities of site-specifically biotinylated, post-translationally modified mammalian targets for directed evolution. Further, methods involving adherent cells require dual stable transfection, which is costly in upfront clonal selection time. The nonadherent system described here allows for rapid production of targets and control targets (i.e., mutations, domain deletions) to enhance selections without months of prior work. The selection system also can be easily adapted to multiwell formats by using streptavidin-coated plates. Specific protease release will simplify library recovery and decrease noise arising from nonspecific adsorption to hydrophobic passive adsorption surfaces.",

Although this experiment illustrates the potential gains in SNR for each round, it likely represents the upper bound of noise reduction as many sequences, unlike the scrambled affibody fusion, will show some affinity for the target. Nevertheless, the SNR improvements obtained by protease-mediated target release are significant and are likely to reduce the time required to achieve library convergence and eliminate confounding false positives in the final pool.

The HER2 affibody fusion binds HER2 and is released by the protease but remains on the bead in the absence of thrombin. The scrambled affibody\u2212mRNA fusion does not bind to the immobilized HER2 ECD.

Eluting with thrombin releases the largest amount of affibody\u2212mRNA fusion with limited scrambled affibody fusion release.
