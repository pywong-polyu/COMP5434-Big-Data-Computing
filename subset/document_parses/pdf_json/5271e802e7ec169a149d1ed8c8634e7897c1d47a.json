However, an automatic and contactless method is required for accurate classification of IARI. Here, we present a deep ensemble learning model that integrates five different convolutional neural networks into a single model for IARI classification. A dataset, including 1628 IARI images and corresponding labels of IARI categories ((-), (1 +), (2 +), (3 +), and (4 +)), was used. We trained our model using 1302 IARIs and validated its performance using 326 IARIs. The proposed model achieved 100%, 99.4%, 99.4%, 100%, and 100% accuracies in the ( \u2212), (1 +), (2 +), (3 +), and (4 +) categories, respectively. The results were compared with those of manual classification by immunologists (average accuracy: 99.8% vs. 88.3%, p < 0.01). Following model assistance, all three immunologists achieved increased accuracy (average accuracy: + 6.1%), with the average accuracy of junior immunologists maximum increasing by 11.3%. The time required for model classification was 0.094 s\u00b7image -1 , whereas that required manually was 5.528 s\u00b7image -1 . The proposed model can thus substantially improve the accuracy and efficiency of IARI classification and facilitate the automation of haemolytic disease screening equipment.",

Improper blood transfusion or incompatible transfusion increases the risk of haemolytic diseases (e.g., haemolytic disease in new-borns, autoimmune haemolytic disease, drug immune haemolytic diseases), renal failure, and even death [3] [4] [5] . The incomplete antibody reaction intensity (IARI) is the main factor responsible for incompatible transfusion. IARI is divided into five categories ((-), (1 +), (2 +), (3 +), (4 +)), with the higher intensity category causing more serious incompatible transfusion [6] .

            "text": "Currently, the haemolytic IARI multi-classification test mainly uses the micro-column gel immune-assay Coombs test (MGIA-Coombs test) as it has high sensitivity and strong interpretability [10] . However, fibrin in the plasma can erroneously trap red blood cells (RBCs) at the top of the gel column, leading to high false-positives with the MGIA-Coombs test [11] [12] [13] [14] . The solid-phase red cell adherence Coombs test (SPRCA Coombs test) was then proposed, involving pre-coating of anti-human globulin (AHG) on U-bottom microwells to prevent RBCs from binding to fibrin, which reduces false-positive results [15] . However, the SPRCA Coombs test requires a tedious and error-prone washing process for RBC suspensions to separate sensitised * HongMei Wang wanghm@sibet.ac.cn * Xin Gao xingaosam@163.com RBCs from free fibrin, in turn causing false-negative results [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Recently, the hydrogel chromatography medium high density medium solid-phase Coombs test (HCM-HDMS Coombs test) was proposed. It involves hydrogel chromatography medium (HCM) as the separation solution in the reaction-and-separation chamber for separating sensitised RBCs from free fibrin, thus eliminating the washing process and effectively reducing the false-negative results [21] . However, this chamber obstructs the view during the process of observing incompatible IARI in the HCM-HDMS Coombs test, thus affecting accurate visual classification, whereas moving the chamber away results in reagent contamination and leakage. Further, the observation process by immunologists is subjective and diverse [22] . Therefore, contactless, automatic, and intelligent multi-classification methods are needed to enhance the practical value of the HCM-HDMS Coombs test. Deep learning has led to the achievement of remarkable success in medical image classification [23, 24] . In particular, with the advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), high-level semantic features of images can be automatically and effectively extracted to reduce the necessity of handcrafted feature processes. Recently, Liu, et al. applied a CNN model to the multi-classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, other common pneumonia, and normal controls using CT images and achieved an accuracy of 92.49% [25] . In another study, CNN models were utilized in the automated multi-classification of cells in the epithelial tissue of oral squamous cell carcinoma, with an accuracy of 97.5% [26] . Tessema et al. demonstrated the potential of integrating the deep learning-based automatic model into the quantitative multi-classification of blood cells with an average accuracy of 80.6% [27] . Thus, we hypothesized that CNN methods have the potential to achieve automatic and intelligent IARI multi-classification, and this will assist immunologists and clinicians to improve clinical efficiency and accuracy.",

In the spatial dimension, average pooling and maximum pooling were concatenated to generate an efficient feature descriptor for extracting valid feature location information.

The classification performances for each category and the average of the proposed model, three immunologists (Immunologist-1 and Immunologist-2 with about 2 years of experience each, and Immunologist-3 with 5 years of experience), and that of immunologists with model assistance are shown in In particular, the time taken for model classification was 0.094s\u00b7image -1 , which was approximately 60 times faster than that taken by the immunologists (Immunologist avg =5.528s\u00b7image -1 ). Further, to reflect the results intuitively, confusion matrices [46] were generated for the classification results of the ensemble model, immunologists, and immunologists with model assistance as shown in Fig. 3 .

It is an endto-end hybrid processing method combining the ensemble model with the CBAM and RPV modules that can accurately divide the intensity of IARI into five categories. This decision-level fusion design dramatically improved the classification efficiency and precisely fitted the IARI dataset compared with the independent model. More importantly, the proposed model achieved better classification performance than the immunologists and effectively improved the classification accuracy of the immunologists. Table 2 shows the results of the macro-averaged metrics of the single and ensemble models for IARI multi-classification. In the IARI classification, all the models achieve an Accuracy avg of more than 90% in the overall categories because the deep learning models can automatically mine the subtle and deep features related to the IARI, which cannot be perceived manually. However, there are differences in the performance of the single models in different category classifications, as shown in the Supplementary Material Table S1 , the accuracy of the ResNet model in the (-) and (3 +) categories were 77.6% and 84.7%, respectively, and the accuracy of the DenseNet model in the (-) category was only 79.2%. Additionally, compared with the single model, the ensemble model substantially improves the accuracy of classification both in single categories and overall. As shown in Table 3 , the accuracies of all categories were above 99%, and the maximum improvement in the overall accuracy was up to 8.3% (Accuracy avg : ResNet 91.3% vs. ensemble model 99.6%). The ensemble model is efficient for the improvement of the model fit; however, it is not sensitive to outliers for reducing the decision boundary shift [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . In addition, the ensemble model, by collective decision mechanism, focuses on synthesizing information from several sub-models with different structures and has been shown to reduce average error and combine the strengths of models in the exploration of diverse data patterns [52] [53] [54] . However, the addition of a poorly performing model will not reduce the overall model classification skill, because the ensemble model has a net gain compared to the single models [55, 56] . Given the above, the ensemble model can reduce the risk of relying on a single prediction distribution and extract richer semantic feature information than the single CNN models (such as each sub-model in the training process has a different probability for boundary regions in pixel-level), which are beneficial in classification tasks to or the achievement of better performance to improve classification accuracy [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . As shown in Table 2 , CBAM has a limited effect on overall model performance improvement in that it slightly increases the accuracy of the models except that of the VGG and Inception models. But CBAM reduces the cross-adjacent category errors, especially those of the CBAM-CNN Table 3 Comparison between the ensemble models and three immunologists in each sub-category Notes: Imm-n denotes Immunologist-1, Immunologist-2, Immunologist-3, and Immunologist-avg; w/o represents the immunologist without model assistance; w represents the immunologist with model assistance; \"\u2191\" indicates that the result of the immunologist with model assistance is better than that of the immunologists Table S1 and reducing the error rate of blood artefacts being mistaken as (4 +) category. CBAM flexibly introduced into various models, partially reserves the channel interaction information and spatial location information while gathering clues about actual class object features and giving a meaningful focus for the input images by element-wise operations [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . Thus, the CBAM-CNN models bring more robust and plausible classification decision-making. Table 3 shows that the ensemble model with CBAM, which we proposed, gives the best performance among all models both in the single categories and in the overall.",

For the immunologists, (-) and (4 +) categories were relatively easier to classify, whereas (1 +), (2 +), and (3 +) classification were more prone to errors. The results show that the more experienced immunologist had a classification of higher accuracy. The immunologists also conducted reclassification with the assistance of our proposed model to verify the clinical utility of the model. In the (1 +), (2 +), and (3 +) categories, the performance of immunologists was greatly improved; especially for immunologists with relatively low experience, the auxiliary effect is more obvious. Further, analysis of the time required for classification using the model and by the immunologists showed that the calculation time of the proposed model is at the millisecond level and is 60 times faster than the time needed manually. Thus, the model holds great potential for real-time assistance, especially for junior immunologists.",

Higher accuracy rates generally indicate better results, but FP and FN are also important and should not be ignored in clinical medicine. Reducing the ratio of FP to FN can significantly reduce the possibility of medical errors. There were no serious errors in the IARI classification using the ensemble models: no strongly positive IARI ((4 +) category) was identified as poorly positive ((1 +), (2 +), (3 +) categories) or negative category ((-) category), and no negative IARI was identified as a positive category. The model also did not show acrossadjacent category errors within the poorly positive categories. However, immunologists usually misclassified these samples as (-) and (1 +), (3 +), and (4 +), and the internal categories of poor positive samples, resulting in unsatisfactory classification results. Our analyses revealed that automatic classification is feasible and reliable and can significantly outperform the immunologists. We observed that the performance of the immunologists was highly improved with assistance of the proposed model: the main diagonal became deeper, indicating that the accuracy of each category increased; the other areas became lighter indicating that the errors in the across-adjacent categories were reduced; the green area became deeper, indicating an improvement in Accuracy total , Precision, and Recall. These results demonstrate that our proposed model may be used as a reference for assisting immunologists.",

The learning rate of 5e-4 with the fixed batch size can keep the generalization performance from being degraded and makes CNN models achieve the best performance because of small batch sizes requiring small learning rate [79] [80] [81] .

Second, the model could only differentiate the negative reaction, poor positive reaction, and strongly positive reaction. In clinical reality, there is a suspected category, ( \u00b1), which is indistinguishable from negative and poor positive reactions by immunologists that have insufficient images to build the CNN model. Thus, in future, extending the dataset to multivendor and multi-centre platforms may further improve the performance of the model.

This model can aid immunologists in differentiating distinct clinical patients by providing an objective and accurate evaluation of IARI categories, which could reduce the risk of haemolytic diseases. The model holds great potential in the field of fully automatic machinery and holds promise for promoting intelligent AHG test classification.",
