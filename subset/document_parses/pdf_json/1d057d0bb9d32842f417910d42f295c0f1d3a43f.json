This paper explores the performance of the various type of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to predict mid-price movement for Bitcoin futures prices. We use high-frequency intraday data to evaluate the relative forecasting performances across various time frequencies, ranging between 5 and 60-min. Our findings show that the average classification accuracy for five out of the six MLAs is consistently above the 50% threshold, indicating that MLAs outperform benchmark models such as ARIMA and random walk in forecasting Bitcoin futures prices. This highlights the importance and relevance of MLAs to produce accurate forecasts for bitcoin futures prices during the COVID-19 turmoil.",

            "text": "In this research, we use high-frequency Bitcoin pricing data together with machine learning algorithms to predict mid-price movement for bitcoin futures price series across a variety of time frequencies, ranging between 5 and 60-min. The novelty of our research surrounds the use of all available Bitcoin futures series from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The CME had offered the product as a mechanism to hedge Bitcoin exposure or harness its performance with futures and options on futures, both of which have been markets presenting tremendous growth since their introduction Corbet et al. 2018a, b) . While liquidity proved to be a substantial issue for some long-ranged futures such as those 6-months and 7-months into the future, after several specification tests, we present results based on the first 5-month futures products. 1 The contract is found to be quite substantial in size, representing the ownership of 5 bitcoin, as defined by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), quoted in U.S. dollars and cents per bitcoin. This exposure to Bitcoin is based on a leverage rate of 43%, therefore the investment outlay is below that of the face-value of 5 BTC. The minimum price fluctuation is $5.00 per bitcoin, where calendar spreads are $1.00 per bitcoin. Monthly contracts are listed for six consecutive months and two additional December contract months. 2 The decision for the CME to provide Bitcoin futures on 10 December 2017 was viewed as a significant milestone in the development of such a relatively young financial product, where to this point, few major exchanges, underpinning with such reputation and historic experience had considered similar responses. The launch of CME Bitcoin futures was viewed as the first step in the new cryptocurrency's path toward legitimacy, hoping to entice institutional investors who had been, until late 2017, had been unwilling to enter the market for a variety of issues. In late 2020, CME futures possessed over $1 billion in open interest, representing the significant growth of the market over a very short amount of time. The use of settlement pricing from multiple sources was initially identified as a strong beneficial characteristic, particularly with the many problems pertaining to cyber-criminality and illicit behaviour across exchanges and directly through product development and creation.",

            "text": "We contribute to the literature by evaluating the application of high-frequency bitcoin futures prices using six machine learning algorithms during the outbreak of COVID-19. We attempt to forecast the mid-point movement of CME Bitcoin futures pricing across multiple futures products during COVID-19 where we use the sign prediction rate or accuracy rate which is calculated as the proportion of times the related methodology correctly predicts the next time mid-price return direction. If the underlying process were fully random then the correct sign prediction ratio would be 50%, where any accuracy rate greater than 50% would indicate the ability of the algorithm to beat the market, further supported with the use of optimal profit ratios to measure the performance of the related classification algorithm. Furthermore, we report most of the methods to provide close results to each other, the best performing model which is the support vector machine yields on average out-sample success rates of around 56%. Another important point to note is that while the maximum value of accuracy one can obtain with the ARIMA model is only 56% among all cases considered, this number even increases up to 71% for the support vector machine algorithm. Further evidence suggests that such predictability increases in magnitude as we focus on futures with larger maturities, particularly those of 4-and 5-month duration. Such evidence indicates that Bitcoin futures products present evidence of sign predictability using machine learning.",

The authors found that machine learning classification algorithms reach about 55-65% predictive accuracy on average at the daily or minute level frequencies, while the support vector machines demonstrate the best and consistent results in terms of predictive accuracy compared to the logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest classification algorithms. Saad et al. (2020) provided evidence of prediction accuracy of up to 99% for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Whereas Hub\u00e1\u010dek et al.

            "text": "Previous research on cryptocurrency futures has been quite extensive to date. An extensive overview of the key areas of research was presented by Corbet et al. (2019) , through which areas surrounding market efficiency, the development of futures exchanges and illicit behaviour are outlined. utilised a high-frequency analysis to show significant pricing effects sourced from both fraudulent and regulatory unease within the industry, verifying that CME Bitcoin futures dominate price discovery relative to spot markets. Alexander et al. (2020) found similar evidence when considering the role that BitMEX derivatives played when similarly, informationally leading spot markets. found further evidence of Bitcoin market maturity through significant response to macroeconomic news, while Koutmos (2020) found that interest rates and implied stock market and foreign exchange market volatilities are important determinants of Bitcoin returns. de la Horra et al. (2019) analysed the demand for Bitcoin to determine whether it stems from Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange, a speculative asset, or as a safe-haven commodity, finding that the asset is highly speculative in the short run. Giudici and Polinesi (2019) primarily identified that Bitcoin exchange prices are positively related to each other and large exchanges Bitstamp, drive the prices. Such destabilising effects of fraud and regulatory events had also been identified by , , Katsiampa et al. (2019a) , Katsiampa et al. (2019b) and Hu et al. (2020) . Evidence supporting the predictability of Bitcoin futures prices through the use of machine learning would not explicitly be a unique characteristic to cryptocurrency markets, as it has been previously identified across several assets such as foreign exchange markets (Plakandaras et al. 2015) and several other asset markets , it is essential to note that it is contrary to the efficient markets hypotheses, where prices should follow a martingale process. However, such a result could present another evidence supporting the developing growth of operational and technical efficiency that has been observed in such markets in recent years. Such markets have grown to such an international status, that substantial amounts of research have identified the usage of cryptocurrency markets as a hedging mechanism against the significant financial market pressures and contagion effects that were associated with the development and broad confusion associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, with emphasis on contagion effects (Akhtaruzzaman et al. 2020; Corbet et al. , 2021 Mensi et al. 2020) , asset price discovery , safe haven effects (Conlon et al. 2020) , hedge fund performance , sentiment , political risk (Sharif et al. 2020) , and the basis of future research focus (Goodell 2020) . As Bitcoin futures market development was observed to be a significant milestone in the transition of not only Bitcoin in isolation, but cryptocurrency as a broad financial product, it is important to specifically understand whether there exist differentials of behaviour in comparison to traditional financial market assets.",

Similarly, Faghih Mohammadi Jalali and Heidari (2020) found that through the use of a first-order grey model (GM (1,1)), Bitcoin's price could be predicted accurately, to the extent of a confidence level of approximately 98% through the selection of specific periods. Alonso-Monsalve et al. (2020) found that Convolutional LSTM neural networks outperformed all the rest significantly, while CNN neural networks were also able to provide satisfactory results. especially in the Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin cryptocurrency markets. Further, Ma et al. (2020) found that the proposed novel MRS-MIDAS model exhibits statistically significant improvement for forecasting the RV of Bitcoin Between 2011 and 2018, Adcock and Gradojevic (2019) found that backpropagation neural networks dominate various competing models in terms of their forecast accuracy. Further, when attempting to predict Bitcoin bubble crashes, Shu and Zhu (2020) showed that an LPPLS confidence indicator presented superior detection capability to bubbles and accurately forecast the bubble crashes, even if a bubble existed for only a short period of time. Such work built on that of the same structure of Samitas et al. (2020) , who found that the effectiveness of machine learning reached 98.8% as an early warning system to predict the financial crisis. Zoumpekas et al. (2020) found that Convolutional Neural Network and four types of Recurrent Neural Network including the Long Short Term Memory network, the Stacked Long Short Term Memory network, the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network, and the Gated Recurrent Unit network could be utilised to predict the Ethereum closing price in real-time with promising accuracy and experimentally proven profitability. Such results present evidence that pre- diction of cryptocurrency markets was statistically possible in direct opposition to that of the efficient markets hypothesis [previously examined in cryptocurrency markets by Sensoy (2019) and ], but this is not the first market to have presented such evidence as Plakandaras et al.

We obtain the data for 1-month futures up to 9-month futures at a minutely level which have the earliest starting points at different dates. To have enough observations to draw meaningful and robust conclusions we use only 1-month to 5-month futures data with an initial date of 2 January 2020 and an end date of 10 September 2020. Bitcoin futures can be traded at any time during the day at CME after 11:00 PM on Sunday until 10:00 PM on Friday (because of daylight saving time change on March 8, 2020, the trading hours shifted as after 10:00 PM on Sunday till 9:00 PM on Friday). The time interval that we studied corresponds to 217 trading days which we sample at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 60-min frequencies. For each time frequency, we compute the mid-price from the best ask and bid prices using the last observation in that time interval. Then we compute the log-returns for each time scale from these mid-prices. Table 1 shows the total number of observations for the mid-price returns of bitcoin futures at different time scales, while Figure 1 presents a plot of the 1-month futures price at 5-min frequency during 2020. For instance, while there are 4345 observations at the 60-min frequency, this number increases to 51733 at the 5-min frequency. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for mid-price future returns for different maturities and time scales. As it is clear from the table, mean and median values are always around zero independent of time to maturity and time-frequency. As an expected min, max and standard deviation values get larger in absolute value as the time to maturity increases. ",

The kNN is a supervised machine learning model where the model learns from the labelled data how to map the inputs to the desired output so that it can make predictions on test data. It is a non-parametric algorithm as it does not make any assumptions about the data, such as normality. The kNN model picks an entry in the database and then looks at the 'k' entries in the database which are closest to the chosen point. Then, the data point is assigned the label of the majority of the 'k' closest points. For instance, if k = 6 with 4 of points being as 'up' and 2 as 'down', the data point in question would be labelled 'up' since 'up' is the majority class. More generally, the kNN algorithm works as follows: For a given value of k, it computes the distance between the test data and each row of the training data by using a distance metric like Euclidean metric (some of the other metrics that can also be used are cityblock, Chebychev, correlation, and cosine). The distance values are sorted in ascending order and then top k elements are extracted from the sorted array.

It makes the \"naive\" assumption that the input features are conditionally independent of each other given the classification. If this assumption holds then the naive Bayes classifier may perform even better than more complicated models. However, in real life, most of the time it is not possible to get a set of predictors which are completely independent.

An algorithm is called boosting if it works by adding models on top of each other iteratively, the errors of the previous model are corrected by the next predictor until the training data is accurately predicted or reproduced by the model. A method is called gradient boosting if, instead of assigning different weights to the classifiers after every iteration, it fits the new model to new residuals of the previous prediction and then minimizes the loss when adding the latest prediction. Namely, if a model is updated using gradient descent, then it is called gradient boosting. XGBoost improves upon the base gradient boosting framework through systems optimization and algorithmic enhancements. Some of these enhancements can be listed as parallelised tree building, tree pruning using a depth-first approach, cache awareness and out-of-core computing, regularisation for avoiding over-fitting, efficient handling of missing data, and in-built cross-validation capability.",

For the first hold-out, we take 70% of the total sample size rounded to the closest integer value as the training sample size and the remaining 30% as the test sample size. Similarly, we also look at the 0.8/0.2 and 0.9/0.1 divisions as train/test set partitions. The number of observations for the mid-price returns of Bitcoin futures at different time frequencies for different train/test set divisions is reported in Table 1 . For instance, while there are 51,733 mid-price returns in total at the 5-min scale, only 4345 mid-price returns are available at the 60-min scale. 0.7/0.3 hold-out at 5-min frequency corresponds to 36,213-time intervals in the train set and 15,520-time intervals in the test set.

Minimum (maximum) values of the returns are getting smaller (larger) as the time to maturity increases across all the time scales. However, minimum and maximum values do not change significantly from a one-time scale to another within the same Bitcoin futures (except the 1-month futures).

However, in our case, it is essential to note that we use the information contained only in the Bitcoin futures. In other words, we do not use any other information source, which can also be challenging to determine as they are many different parameters affecting Bitcoin prices. Hence, any accuracy rate greater than 50% already indicates the success of the algorithm to beat the market. Second, we also apply the ideal profit ratio to measure the performance of the related classification algorithm. As formalized in Sect. 4, the ideal profit ratio is the ratio of the return generated by a given algorithm to the perfect sign forecast. The numerical results are produced with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 computer utilizing Python 3.7 with the Scikit-learn machine learning package.

Similarly, ideal profit ratios are given in the following column for out of the sample period. Mean value (together with t-stat), standard deviation, maximum, and minimum of each column across different maturities and time frequencies are given below the tables. Table 3 provides results for the kNN algorithm, which are computed by optimizing over neighbourhood numbers from 1 to 20. The kNN methodology yields an average out-of-sample (in-sample) success ratio of 55% (77%) for the first hold-out, 55% (75%) for the second hold-out, and 56% (75%) for the third hold-out. The maximum average ideal profit ratio is computed around 6% for the 0.9/0.1 division of the data set. The kNN methodology yields the highest in-sample accuracy results after a random forest algorithm with a maximum value reaching as high as %94 for 5-month futures at 5-min frequency. Similarly, the maximum value for the out-of-sample success rate (66%) is attained by month futures at 15-min frequency. In most cases, we observe that the accuracy rate increases for the same maturity futures under the kNN method as the time frequency decreases. It is also evident from Table 3 that for most of the cases, we obtain a positive ideal profit ratio with a maximum value of 23 % in the first hold-out (27% for the second hold-out, 31% for the third hold-out) with 3-months futures at 60 min frequency. Table 4 provides the results for the logistic regression algorithm, which is based on a linear classification. We observe that this method yields relatively stable results across different maturities and time scales. For instance, the average success rate for both in the sample and out-sample periods is almost always 54% for three different hold-outs. The same is also true for the min (51%) and max (57%) values for different cases. Again, we obtain a positive ideal profit ratio with this prediction method in most cases. Although the average values of the ideal profit ratios are not quite high, the maximum value of them (29% for 0.7/0.3 division, 32% for 0.8/0.2 division, 35% for 0.9/0.1 division) can be considered satisfactory. Table 5 shows the results for Na\u00efve Bayes classification which is the worst-performing one among the six different methodologies. The in-sample success ratios are almost always indistinguishable from 50% which is nothing but the result coming from a random walk model for which the empirical results are given in Table 9 . Although the max accuracy rate can reach even up to 60% for 1-month futures at 5 min frequency for the first hold-out, the average accuracy rate is only 45% across the different cases. This result also holds for 0.8/0.2 and 0.9/0.1 divisions. Similar results are also obtained for the ideal profit ratios. We receive an average negative ideal profit ratio only for the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm.",

It is also observed that except in a few cases, one can gain positive ideal profit ratios with a maximum value of 36% for 3-month futures at a 60-min time scale. Table 7 shows the best out-of-sample forecasting results across different maturities and frequencies is acquired from the implementation of a nonlinear classification method by choosing a radial kernel in the support vector machine. A maximum value of 61% is obtained for the first division, 64% for the second division, and 71% for the third division. The average out-sample success rate is stable, around 56% for different hold-outs. The results are also similar to the ideal profit ratios. It is evident from the results given in Table 8 that the XGBoost method provides similar results to the kNN algorithm but with a lower level of average insample fits. The average out-sample fit accuracy is around 55% for different hold-outs.",

At first sight, one can argue that most of the methods provide close results to each other and the ARIMA model. For instance, while the average of the out-sample success rates is around 56% for the support vector machine, it is also around 52% for the ARIMA model, as can be seen from the results are presented in Table 9 . For a small-sized sample, 1% of difference may not mean a significant difference in terms of the robustness of the method. However, in our case of a large sample, on average only 1% of increase in the success rate of 5-min frequency (0.7/0.1 hold-out) means 1,552 more correct predictions of the target variable. In our case, 4% of difference corresponds to 6,208 more accurate predictions of the target variable at 5 min level, which is not a substantiative amount when considering the sample size analysed. We also have similar results for the other frequencies. Another critical point to note is that the maximum value of accuracy one can obtain with the ARIMA model is only 56% among all cases considered. However, this number even increases up to 71% for the support vector machine algorithm.",

To this end, we employ machine learning algorithms (MLAs) which are compared with standard ARIMA and random walk models. Sign prediction ratios together with the ideal profit ratios are utilized to measure the forecasting performance of the suggested MLAs. Our findings indicate that the k-nearest neighbour (kNN) approach and the random forest (RF) algorithm yield the highest in-and out-of-sample accuracy rates at varying frequencies. For instance, for the random forest algorithm in-sample success rate can reach up to 87% for the first hold-out (0.7/0.3), 83% for the second hold-out (0.8/0.3), and 87% for the third hold-out (0.9/0.1). However, the highest out-of-sample success rates are obtained by SVM. For instance, an accuracy rate of 71% can be achieved for the third hold-out. On the other hand, the logistic regression, the Na\u00efve Bayes, and the XGBoost algorithm yield relatively stable results across different maturities with an average out-of-sample accuracy rate of 54%, 45%, and 55%, respectively. As a benchmark model, ARIMA model provides an average out-of-sample accuracy rate of around 52%. In general, our findings indicate that most of the MLAs outperform the benchmark model, with both in-and out-of-sample forecasting accuracy. This highlights the importance and relevance of MLAs to forecast bitcoin futures prices during periods of turmoil. From a policy perspective, such research has important implications regarding the monitoring of cryptocurrency market developments, and of course, from a regulatory perspective, signals of market discontinuity could demonstrate the sources of atypical influence. Furthermore, it is a known fact that derivative products complete the market and increases efficiency. Hence, as the cryptocurrency derivatives market enlarges, machine learning algorithms can also be used for the prediction and valuation of the products such as options and swaps in the future.",
