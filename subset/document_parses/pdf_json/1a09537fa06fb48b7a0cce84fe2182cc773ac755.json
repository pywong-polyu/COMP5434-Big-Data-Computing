The ongoing epidemic is of major concern as the Delta variant is more infectious than previous variants that circulated in Australia in 2020. Using a re-calibrated agent-based model, we explored a feasible range of non-pharmaceutical interventions, including case isolation, home quarantine, school closures, and stay-at-home restrictions (i.e., \"social distancing.\") Our modelling indicated that the levels of reduced interactions in workplaces and across communities attained in Sydney and other parts of the nation were inadequate for controlling the outbreak. A counter-factual analysis suggested that if 70% of the population followed tight stay-at-home restrictions, then at least 45 days would have been needed for new daily cases to fall from their peak to below ten per day. Our model predicted that, under a progressive vaccination rollout, if 40-50% of the Australian population follow stay-at-home restrictions, the incidence will peak by mid-October 2021: the peak in incidence across the nation was indeed observed in mid-October. We also quantified an expected burden on the healthcare system and potential fatalities across Australia.",

Because previous pandemic waves were eliminated in Australia, the Delta variant has not been competing with other variants. Secondly, the level of acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the Australian population was low at the onset of the outbreak, given that (a) the pre-existing natural immunity was limited by cumulative confirmed cases of around 0.12%, and (b) immunity acquired due to vaccination did not extend beyond 6% of the adult population. Furthermore, the school winter break in NSW (28 June-9 July) coincided with the period of social distancing restrictions announced on 26 June, with school premises remaining mostly closed beyond 9 July. Thus, the epidemic suppression policy of school closures is not a free variable, further reducing the search space of available control measures.",

Firstly, we investigate a feasible range of key non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs): case isolation, home quarantine, school closures, and social distancing, available to control virus transmission within a population with a low immunity. Social distancing (SD) is interpreted and modelled in a broad sense of comprehensive stay-at-home restrictions, comprising several specific behavioural changes that reduce the intensity of interactions among individuals (and hence the virus transmission probability), including physical distancing, mobility reduction, mask wearing, and so on. Our primary focus is a \"retrodictive\" estimation of the average (unknown) SD level under which the modelled transmission and suppression dynamics can be best matched to the observed incidence data. An identification of the SD level helps to distinguish and evaluate the distinct and time-varying impacts of NPIs and vaccination campaigns.",

The model was cross-validated with genomic surveillance data (6) , and contributed to policy recommendations on social distancing that were broadly adopted by the World Health Organisation (18) . The model separately simulates each individual as an agent within a surrogate population composed of about 23.4 million software agents. These agents are stochastically generated to match attributes of anonymous individuals (in terms of age, residence, gender, workplace, susceptibility, and immunity to diseases), informed by data from the Australian Census and the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority. In addition, the simulation follows the known commuting patterns between the places of residence and work/study (19) (20) (21) . Different contact rates specified within diverse social contexts (e.g., households, neighbourhoods, communities, and work/study environments) explicitly represent heterogeneous demographic and epidemic conditions (see Supplementary Material: Agent-based model). The model has previously been calibrated to produce characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic corresponding to the ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (1, 17), using actual case data from the first and second waves in Australia, and re-calibrated for B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant using incidence data of the Sydney outbreak (see Supplementary Material: Model calibration).",

The match is not exact-with the actual incidence growth rate changing several times during this period-perhaps as a consequence of restrictions being imposed heterogeneously across different local government areas. Importantly, however, the growth in actual incidence during the period of the comprehensive lockdown restrictions (16-25 July) is best matched by a higher compliance level, SD = 0.6.

Again, the control measures were triggered by cumulative incidence exceeding 400 cases (corresponding to a tighter lockdown imposed on July 9). An effective suppression of the outbreak within a reasonable timeframe is demonstrated for macro-distancing at SD \u2265 0.7, coupled with the lowest feasible interaction strengths for most interventions, i.e., NPI c = 0.1 (where NPI is one of CI, HQ, SC, and SD), as shown in Figure 2 and summarised in Table 1 . For SD = 0.8, new cases fall below 10 per day approximately a month (33 days) after the peak in incidence, while for SD = 0.7 this period reaches 45 days 2 . Social distancing at SD = 0.9 is probably infeasible (as this assumes that 90% of the population consistently stays at home), but would reduce the new cases to below 10 a day within four weeks (25 days) following the peak in incidence. 25 July for (A) (log-scale) incidence (crosses), and (B) cumulative incidence (circles); with an exponential fit of the incidence's moving average (black solid: \u03b2 II , and black dotted: \u03b2 III ). Vertical dashed marks align the simulated days with the outbreak start (17 June, day 9), initial restrictions (27 June, day 19) , and tighter lockdown (9 July, day 31). Traces corresponding to each social distancing (SD) compliance level are shown as average over 10 runs (coloured profiles for SD varying in increments of 10%, i.e., between SD = 0.0 and SD = 1.0). 95% confidence intervals for incidence profiles, for SD \u2208 {0.4, 0.5, 0.6}, are shown as shaded areas. Each SD intervention, coupled with school closures, begins with the start of tighter lockdown, when cumulative incidence exceeds 400 cases (B: inset). The alignment between simulated days and actual dates may slightly differ across separate runs. Case isolation and home quarantine are in place from the outset. Supplementary Material (Sensitivity of suppression outcomes for tight restrictions) presents results obtained for the scenarios which assume a limited pre-pandemic vaccination coverage (immunising 6% of the population). A positive impact of the partial progressive rollout which covers up to 40% of the population by mid-September is counterbalanced by a delayed start of the tighter lockdown, with the 12-day delay leading to a higher peak-incidence, as can be seen by comparing Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 4 . For example, for SD = 0.8, a scenario following the limited pre-pandemic vaccination, but imposing control measures earlier, demonstrates a reduction of incidence below 10 daily cases in four weeks after the peak in incidence (Supplementary Figure 4) , rather than 33 days under progressive rollout (Figure 2) . For SD = 0.9 the suppression periods differ by about one week: 17 days (Supplementary Figure 4) against 25 days (Figure 2) . However, this balance is nonlinear, as shown in Table 2 : for SD = 0.7, the suppression period under the pre-pandemic vaccination scenario approaches 55 days (Supplementary Figure 4) , in contrast to the progressive rollout scenario achieving suppression earlier, in 45 days (Figure 2) . This is, of course, explained by the longer suppression period under SD = 0.7, during which a progressive rollout makes a stronger impact.",

The model projection for incidence peaking across the nation in the range between approximately 1,500 and 5,000 daily cases pointed to early to mid-October. This projection is validated by the actual profiles, as shown in Supplementary Figures 8-10 , and summarised in Table 3 and Supplementary Tables 9, 10 . The scenario developing under SD = 0.5 offers the best match with the actual dynamics again. As expected, the unvaccinated cases form a vast majority among the hospitalisations, ICU occupancy and fatalities (cf. Tables 9, 10) . Importantly, a comparison across the three moderate levels of social distancing, SD \u2208 {0.4, 0.5, 0.6} shows that with a 10% increase in the level of social distancing, the hospitalisations and ICU demand reduce approximately 3fold, and the fatalities reduce at least two times. These effects of a 10% increase in the social distancing adherence on the clinical burden and the potential fatalities are robust with respect to changes in the vaccine efficacy against infectiousness, as shown in Supplementary Figure 12 , and Tables 9, 10.",

This study compared several NPIs and identified the minimal SD levels required to control the first wave in Australia. Specifically, a compliance at the 90% level, i.e., SD = 0.9 (with SD w = 0 and SD c = 0.5) was shown to control the disease within 13-14 weeks. This relatively high SD compliance was required in addition to other restrictions (TR, CI, HQ), set at moderate levels of both macro-distancing (CI = 0.7 and HQ = 0.5), and interaction strengths: CI w = HQ w = CI c = HQ c = 0.25, CI h = 1.0, and HQ h = 2.0 (1). The follow-up work (17) quantified possible effects of a mass-vaccination campaign in Australia, by varying the extents of pre-pandemic vaccination coverage with different vaccine efficacy combinations. This analysis considered hybrid vaccination scenarios using two vaccines adopted in Australia: BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca). Herd immunity was shown to be out of reach even when a large proportion (82%) of the Australian population is vaccinated under the hybrid approach, necessitating future partial NPIs for up to 40% of the population. The model was also calibrated to the basic reproduction number of the ancestral lineage (R 0 \u2248 3.0, adjusted R 0 \u2248 2.75), and used the same moderate interaction strengths as the initial study (1) (except SD c = 0.25, reduced to match the second wave in Melbourne in 2020).",

We then explored effects of available NPIs on the outbreak suppression, under a progressive vaccination scenario. The retrodictive modelling identified that the current epidemic curves, which continued to grow (until mid-October 2021), can be closely matched by moderate social distancing coupled with moderate interaction strengths within community (SD in [0.4, 0.5], SD c = 0.25), as well as moderate compliance with case isolation (CI = 0.7, CI w = CI c = 0.25) and home quarantine (HQ = 0.5, HQ w = HQ c = 0.25).

The latter, broad-range, case limits feasible social distancing levels to approximately SD \u2248 0.7. However, even with these inclusions, there is a discrepancy between the level estimated by ABM (SD in [0.4, 0.5]) and the broad-range feasible level (SD \u2248 0.7).

Specifically, our results indicate that an effective suppression within a reasonable timeframe can be demonstrated only for very high compliance with social distancing (SD \u2265 0.7), supported by dramatically reduced, and practically infeasible, interaction strengths within the community and work/study environments (NPI c = NPI w = 0.1). Importantly, a significant fraction of local transmissions during the Sydney outbreak in NSW, as well as during the following outbreak in Melbourne, VIC [which started on 13 July 2021, was initially suppressed, but then resumed its growth on 4 August 2021 (5) ], occurred in the suburbs characterised by socioeconomic disadvantage profiles, as defined by The Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD) (38, 39, 41) . To a large extent, the epidemic spread in these suburbs was driven by structural factors, such as higher concentrations of essential workers, high-density housing, shared and multi-generational households, etc. Thus, even a combination of government actions (e.g., a temporary inclusion of some services previously deemed essential under the lockdown restrictions (28, 29) , while providing appropriate financial support to the affected businesses and employees), and a moderate community engagement with the suppression effort, proved to be insufficient for the outbreaks' suppression.",

This balance indicated that a comprehensive mass-vaccination rollout plays a crucial role over a longer term and should preferably be carried out in a preoutbreak phase (17) . Ultimately, the epidemic peak in NSW during the lockdown period was reached only when about a half of the adults were double vaccinated by mid-September (i.e., 49.6% on 15 September 2021) (16) .

We expect low sensitivity of our results to this discrepancy due to the outbreak size being three orders of magnitude smaller than Sydney population. Finally, the model does not directly represent in-hotel quarantine and in-hospital transmissions. Since the frontline professionals (health care and quarantine workers) were vaccinated in a priority phase carried out in Australia in early 2021, i.e., before the Sydney outbreak, this limitation is expected to have a minor effect.

A moving average of the actual time series for (A) (log scale) incidence (crosses), and (B) cumulative incidence (circles). Traces corresponding to social distancing levels SD \u2208 {0.4, 0.5, 0.6} are shown for the period between 16 June and 13 November, as averages over 10 runs (colored profiles). 95% confidence intervals are shown as shaded areas. For each SD level, minimal and maximal traces, per time point, are shown with dotted lines. Peaks formed during the suppression period for each SD profile are identified with coloured dashed lines. Each SD intervention, coupled with school closures, begins with the start of initial restrictions. The alignment between simulated days and actual dates may slightly differ across separate runs. Case isolation and home quarantine are in place from the outset.",
