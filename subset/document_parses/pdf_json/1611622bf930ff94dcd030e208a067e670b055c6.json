Methods: This prospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19 infection was conducted from 6 June to 26 November 2020 in different wards of a tertiary hospital. MR-proANP, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitive cardiac troponin I levels on admission were collected and tested for their association with disease severity and 28-day mortality. Results: A total of 213 eligible patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analyses of whom 13.2% (n = 28) died within 28 days. Median levels of MR-proANP at admission were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (307 pmol/L IQR, [161 -532] vs 75 pmol/L [IQR,, P < .001) compared to survivors and increased with disease severity and level of hypoxaemia. The area under the ROC curve for MR-proANP predicting 28-day mortality was 0.832 (95% CI 0.753 -0.912, P < .001).",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) originated late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread across the globe causing an international pandemic. The single-stranded enveloped RNA virus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-has been identified as the causative agent for infection. 1 While most patients experienced mild illness without significant respiratory involvement, up to 19% of patients had a more severe course of disease with reported case fatality rates of up to 49% among critically ill patients. 2 Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is high in patients with COVID-19, and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are at considerably higher risk of worse outcome. 3, 4 Several cardiovascular biomarkers-including cardiac troponin and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-have been identified as prognostic markers in COVID-19. [5] [6] [7] Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is primarily expressed in the right atrium following atrial distension and exerts several physiological effects, including natriuresis, diuresis and vasodilation. 8 Hypoxaemia has also been suggested as a trigger of ANP release, which makes it an interesting target in both respiratory and cardiovascular disease. 9 Mid-regional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), the mid-regional fragment of the precursor hormone of ANP, is characterized by excellent ex vivo stability making it the preferred biomarker in clinical practice. 10 Several studies have reported on the prognostic value of MR-proANP in a variety of clinical conditions, including sepsis, inflammation and cardiovascular disease, respectively. [11] [12] [13] Higher levels of MR-proANP were significantly and independently associated with shortterm and long-term mortality of patients with communityacquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. [14] [15] [16] [17] However, there are currently no research data available on MR-proANP in COVID- 19. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the association of MR-proANP with disease severity of COVID-19 and its prognostic impact for prediction of short-term mortality in a well-defined cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while adjusting for established biomarkers of risk in COVID-19, including NT-proBNP and high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI).",

It is primarily synthesized in the right atrium and secreted by atrial myocytes secondary to myocardial atrial stretch, which indicates volume overload through atrial wall distension. 19 Regulation of body fluid homeostasis and arterial blood pressure are essential physiological effects of ANP. Accordingly, higher levels of ANP have been recorded in patients with arterial hypertension and heart failure, and ANP also acted as a predictor of worse outcome in this setting. 20 This is in line with the findings of our study, which showed an increasing prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease in higher MR-proANP quartiles.",

            "text": "A second explanation may be direct cardiovascular effects of SARS-CoV-2 on ANP, particularly since the angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE2) has an important role in virus transmission and has been linked repeatedly to atrial natriuretic peptides in previous studies. 21, 22 Moreover, appropriate management of fluid status is a fundamental concern in the treatment of patients with infectious disease, especially those at risk of developing sepsis. Vascular leakage, secondary to capillary hyperpermeability caused by viral alteration of vessel barrier integrity, with consequent pulmonary oedema has been observed in severe cases of COVID-19. 23 Several international expert panels advise a conservative fluid strategy over a liberal one since worse outcomes have been observed with liberal fluid management in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 24, 25 Given the pathophysiological properties of MR-proANP, an increase of this biomarker may mirror a hypervolaemic state that is associated with worse outcome in COVID-19, as observed in our study population. Significantly increased levels of natriuretic peptides upon admission should prompt increased vigilance of the treating physician to thoroughly assess fluid status and test for the need of diuresis, while also considering undiagnosed heart failure. F I G U R E 2 Association of MR-proANP with 28-day mortality in specified subgroups. Myocardial injury was defined as an increase of high-sensitive troponin I above 31.5 ng/l, which represents the fourth quartile of hs-cTnI in our study population. Renal function is measured by levels of creatinine. Prior to Cox regression analysis, MR-proANP was log-transformed and standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation Basic research and clinical research have linked MR-proANP to hypoxic situations, which may add to the rationale of prognostication in COVID-19. 26 Hypoxaemia has been demonstrated to activate ANP gene promoter activity through induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in ventricular myoblast cells of rats. 27 Another potential mechanism involves anaerobic metabolism in hypoxaemia exposed cardiac myocytes with subsequent secretion of ANP through hyperosmolarity. 9 Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are highly susceptible to hypoxaemia, and an alarming number of cases with silent hypoxaemia have been reported. 28 Our study findings provide evidence that MR-proANP is associated with hypoxaemia in patients with COVID-19. Since hypoxaemia is a valuable predictor of outcome in inflammatory conditions, its association with MR-proANP may also partially explain the prognostic properties of MR-proANP in COVID-19. Finally, another potential pathophysiological link may lie in the association of MR-proANP with inflammation. A highly significant correlation was observed between interleukin-6 and ANP in patients with septic shock, and ANP has been linked to endothelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent inflammation after acute myocardial infarction. 29, 30 In our study, a significant correlation of various magnitude of MR-proANP with surrogate markers of inflammation was observed.",

The box represents the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the whiskers are the upper and lower adjacent values; one outlier of 1211 pmol/L in the PSI V group was removed for visual presentation;This prospective, observational single-centre study shows for the first time the prognostic impact of MR-proANP in a wellcharacterized cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The main findings are (i) the independent prognostic value of MR-proANP for predicting the primary endpoint of 28day mortality even after adjustment for several established biomarkers and clinical risk factors, (ii) an increase of MR-proANP levels with disease severity, as assessed by the pneumonia severity index, and (iii) a numerically superior prediction of the primary endpoint by MR-proANP compared to NT-proBNP.",
