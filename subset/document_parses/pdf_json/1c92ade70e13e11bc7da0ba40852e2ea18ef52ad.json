The use of mRNA to create preventive vaccines has a number of attractive features: simplicity of design, low cost of production, low reactogenicity, intracellular synthesis of the target antigen, induction of both antibodies, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . At the same time, the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines in the form of a naked RNA molecule is low due to their degradation by RNases and the inefficiency of their delivery to the cells of the immune system. One of the ways to increase the immune response to an mRNA vaccine is to encapsulate it in nanoparticles. Packaging mRNA in biocompatible and biodegradable materials protects it from degradation and facilitates uptake by antigen-presenting cells [6] .",

Different modifications of liposomes components may be a possible solution [5] ; however, this increases the cost of production of lipid nanoparticles and complicates their composition, which can lead to undesirable consequences. Another problem with lipid nanoparticles is that they are sensitive to freezing and thawing during lyophilization, which makes them difficult to use for mass vaccination [19, 20] .",

To construct the plasmid, a fragment of the S gene corresponding to RBD (320-542 aa) was used (GenBank MN908947). Optimization of the codon composition of the sequence was carried out using the GeneOptimizer program (https://www.thermofisher.com/ru/en/home/lifescience/cloning/gene-synthesis/geneart-gene-synthesis/geneoptimizer.html). To ensure efficient transport of the synthesized protein from the cell, a fragment encoding the signal sequence MMRTLILAVLLVYFCATVHC was added to the 5'-end of the gene. It is a hybrid of two signal sequences: luciferase and fibroin proteins. The synthesis of the projected nucleotide sequence as part of the pVAX vector was carried out at OOO DNAsynthesis (Russia). The second construct was the commercial plasmid phMGFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which encodes the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. This plasmid was used as a template for the synthesis of mRNA-GFP to control the correctness of the procedure for capping and polyadenylation of RNA, as well as a negative control for immunization of animals.",

Based on the charge of RNA, which corresponds to its length and nucleotide composition, the molar mass of the polymer required to neutralize the negative charge of the nucleic acid was calculated, considering that there are 45 cations per PGS molecule. To select the optimal ratio of mRNA: PGS for the formation of complexes, a series of samples with different charge ratios (N:P) of RNA to polymer were obtained, where (N) is the negative charge of RNA, and (P) is the positive charge of the cationic polymer.

So, for example, in a 1: 1 charge ratio, 1 \u00b5g of RNA was taken and mixed with 3 \u00b5g of cationic polymer in equal volumes. The initial assessment of mRNA coverage with PGS was the mobility of mRNA-PGS in an electric field during electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel, the degree of which depended on the degree of coverage.

One of the ways to increase the immune response to an mRNA vaccine is to encapsulate it in nanoparticles consisting of biodegradable cationic polymers and/or liposomes or lipid nanoparticles (LNP) which protect mRNA from degradation and ensure its delivery to antigen-presenting cells.",

There are many liposomal formulations, but they all have a number of disadvantages associated, primarily with the lipids nature. Thus, positively charged liposome particles can bind to negatively charged proteins and nucleic acids and adhere to cell surfaces, which can destabilize the plasma membrane and cause toxic reactions in vaccinated individuals [27] [28] [29] . To solve this problem, ionizable lipids can be used [5] . However, this complicates the composition of lipid nanoparticles and increases the cost of their production. Another problem with lipid nanoparticles is that they need to be transported and stored in a continuous cold chain process, which is a difficult logistical challenge [19] . Therefore, the development of new delivery systems providing thermal stability of mRNA vaccines is gaining more and more interest [30] . Work is underway to obtain thermostable LNPs. For example, Dolgin reported that the Chinese company whose COVID-19 RNA vaccine is currently in human trials has focused on the quality and purity of LNP. Their vaccine remains effective for up to one week at room temperature [31] . However, it should be noted that LNP is a multicomponent structure, its stabilization requires the use of additional components, and such liposomes can cause additional undesirable reactions to the administration of the developed vaccine.",

Their mobility in agarose gel, sizes, and surface charge were determined ( Figure 1E ). It was shown that the most monodisperse suspension of nanoparticles was formed at the mRNA:PGS charge ratio equal to 1:5. The average hydrodynamic particle diameter was 164 \u00b1 20 nm ( Figure 1G2 ), which was confirmed by electron microscopy. The evaluation of the zeta potential of the investigated complexes showed that its value was close to the zero point. The weak charge of the complexes may indicate that the positively charged PGS conjugate has completely packed the negatively charged mRNA molecules. In addition, a weak charge may further indicate the complexes safety, since there is evidence that cationic and anionic nanoparticles are generally more cytotoxic than neutral ones [47] . Cytotoxicity analysis of our preparation on HEK293 cell culture showed that mRNA-RBD-PGS is 30 times less toxic than mRNA-RBD coated with Lipofectamine 3000 (Figure 2A,B) .",

This may be due to the physicochemical properties of the complexes, and in particular, due to the low surface charge of the mRNA-GFP-PGS particles as demonstrated by experiments on evaluating the zeta potential. At the same time, liposomes from phospholipids more efficiently penetrate cells, in particular, due to the fact that they have a high surface charge, which, however, is one of the reasons for the toxicity of liposomes (Figure 2 ) [27] . By adhering to cell surfaces, liposomes can destabilize the cell membrane and cause toxic reactions in vaccinated people [18] . Despite the weak transfecting activity, mRNA-RBD-PGS induces strong humoral immune response in laboratory animals. Apparently, in the case of in vivo mice immunization, the mRNA-RBD-PGS complex penetrates into antigen-presenting cells by endocytosis due to its size, which is comparable to the average size of viral particles (100-200 nm). Most likely this was the main reason for the increase in the immunogenicity of mRNA-RBD-PGS versus naked mRNA (mRNA-RBD) in our experiments. Indeed, particle size was known to be an important parameter influencing the recognition and endocytosis of vaccine constructions by APCs [48] .",
