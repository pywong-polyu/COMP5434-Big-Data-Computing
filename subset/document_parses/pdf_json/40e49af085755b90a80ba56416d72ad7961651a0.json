In this study, protein contact atlas data and molecular dynamics simulations were used to locate interaction hotspots on the secondary structure elements \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, \u03b23, and \u03b24 of ACE2. We designed a library of discontinuous peptides based upon a combination of the hotspot interactions, which were synthesized and screened in a bioluminescence-based assay. The peptides demonstrated high efficacy in antagonizing the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD:ACE2 interaction and were validated by microscale thermophoresis which demonstrated strong binding affinity (\u223c10 nM) of these peptides to S-RBD. We anticipate that such discontinuous peptides may hold the potential for an efficient therapeutic treatment for COVID-19.",

            "text": "To date, more than 100 coronaviruses have been discovered (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/situation-reports/) and no targeted therapy yet exists for the current emergency of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) infections. Scientists have applied many strategies against COVID-19, including assessing existing available antiviral drugs, 1 computationally screening for molecules, 2,3 designing compounds to block viral RNA synthesis/replication, 4\u22126 recognizing hotspot loops and residues to ligate the active axes of the virus by blocking binding to cognate human cell receptors, 7, 8 using peptidomimetic reporters and identifying host specific receptors or enzymes to design specific drugs or vaccines, 9,10 targeting downstream host innate immune signaling pathways, 11 and performing computational genomic and pathological studies on different kinds of coronaviruses to design new drugs. 12\u221215 There is a continuously evolving global effort to develop COVID-19 treatments or vaccines. Testing multiple approaches will improve the chance that a treatment is discovered. According to a WHO analysis of candidate COVID-19 vaccines, 64 are in clinical assessment (with 13 at phase 3) and 173 are in preclinical analyses. Phase 3 vaccine candidates include a variety of vaccine platforms: vector vaccines, mRNA-based vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and adjuvanted recombinant protein nanoparticles. 16\u221227 The initial and critical route of entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses is the interaction between the viral S protein and ACE2 receptor. Therefore, impairing S-RBD binding to ACE2 has the potential to inhibit viral entry into human cells, presenting an opportunity for therapeutic intervention as a complement to vaccination strategies. While small molecules could disrupt the S-protein and ACE2 receptor interaction, they are suboptimal to target large protein\u2212protein interactions (PPIs). 28\u221233 Antagonistic peptide drugs represent the best tool to inhibit the S-RBD:ACE2 interaction, as such peptides combine the best features of antibody approaches (ability to address a large and relatively featureless surface) and small-molecule approaches (improved pharmacokinetics, reduced immune response, ease of production, and cost of goods). 34\u221254 The interface between S-RBD and ACE2 has been recognized as a potential area for antagonism to inhibit viral propagation, and peptides derived from ACE2 have been used successfully to block SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. 48 The concept of utilizing discontinued peptides in drug discovery, and especially to combat SARS-CoV cell entry, was initiated decades ago with the discovery of the P6 peptide (EEQAKT-FLDKFNHEAEDLFYQSS-G-LGKGDFR). 48 This peptide is derived from a library of peptides based on the \u03b11 helix of ACE2. The P6 peptide is artificially linked by glycine that keeps two separate segments of ACE2 in close proximity and shows antiviral activity (IC 50 = 0.1 mM). 48 This finding indicated that a core of S-RBD interacts with same \u03b11 helix of ACE2. This approach is supported by recent publications that have suggested ACE2-based peptides as strong candidates for optimization into therapeutics 34\u221237 and is a complementary approach to vaccine development as well as the identification of small-molecule-based therapies (novel or repurposed). The strength of the interaction between ACE2 and S-RBD has been determined by a number of authors, indicating binding affinities of 94 and 44 nM by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), respectively. 49, 50 These figures provide an estimate for the required strength of interaction between any peptides and their target molecules that could reasonably be expected to antagonize the ACE2\u2212S-RBD interaction, and ACE2-based peptide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 34\u221237 have recently been described. While this early stage of peptide inhibitor development showed great promise, only a few ACE-2-based peptides were proposed and screened, including SBP, a peptide that specifically binds S-RBD with micromolar affinity (1.3 \u03bcM) as assessed by biolayer interferometry. 34 A series of biosimilar peptides has recently been generated based on the N-terminal helix of human ACE2, which contains the majority of the residues at the binding interface, which displayed a high helical propensity. One of their most promising peptide-mimics (P10) blocked SARS-CoV-2 human pulmonary cell infection with an IC 50 of 42 nM and 0.03 nM binding affinity (K d ), as assessed by biolayer interferometry. 36 A recent publication also reported that four stapled peptides show antiviral activity in HT1080/ACE2 cells (IC 50 of 1.9 to 4.1 \u03bcM) and A549/ACE2 (IC 50 of 2.2 to 2.8 \u03bcM). 37 The most promising of these peptides binds SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with a K d of 2.2 \u03bcM, as determined by SPR.",

            "text": "Additionally, a recent report describes the therapeutic effect of a tandem, lipidated peptide (1168-DISGINASWNIQKEID-RLNEVAKNLNESLIDLQEL-1203) from the heptad repeat (HRC) domain of SARS-CoV-2 in a ferret model. 39 This peptide has IC 50 values of 303.1 nM in viral infection assays. However, the direct strength of interaction to the target S-RBD is unreported. 38 Further, a recently reported multiepitope peptide-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine demonstrated high immunogenic response (IC 50 of 2.4 \u03bcM and 9.0 \u03bcM for peptides 1 and 2, respectively). Finally, a defensin-like peptide P9R (NGAICWGPCPTAFRQIGNCGRFRVRCCRIR) displayed excellent activity against pH dependent viruses (IC 50 of 0.26 nM). 40 The availability of high-resolution structural information has facilitated this approach, by identifying the key interaction points between the two molecules of ACE2 and S-RBD (PDB: 6MOJ and 6M17). 51 However, the interaction strength of a single linear epitope of ACE2 is likely to be significantly inferior to that displayed by a composite peptide that is composed of disparate interaction epitopes. We have previously shown similar behavior in the design of a composite VEGF:VEGFR antagonistic peptide, that was shown to be competitive with an antibody-based approach in vitro and in vivo. 52\u221254 Similarly, the concatenation of disparate binding elements resulted in improved binding properties. This leads to the concept of a peptide-based therapeutic for the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, which would complement antibodybased approaches, but with the additional advantages of peptides over antibodies in terms of reduced cost-of-goods, immune response, ease of production, and improved pharmacokinetics. All of these issues are clearly of immense importance in developing therapeutics for the current outbreak.",

Analyzing the S-RBD/ACE2 crystal structure (PDB ID: 6M0J and 6M17), and modeling the key interacting motifs of S-RBD with ACE2, we identified a number of hotspot loops distributed on the surface and thereby implicated as critical for virus entry into human cells. Analysis of this data resulted in a library of six peptides that we predicted would efficiently antagonize SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD:ACE2 interaction. This library was synthesized and assayed against an in vitro bioluminescence assay 60 to determine their inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD:ACE2 interaction. Our data below demonstrates that all six peptides were able to strongly compete for this interaction. While this approach clearly shows the efficacy of our peptides, we also performed microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments to validate our proposed mode of inhibition, as well as to determine in vitro peptide binding affinities to purified SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. The MST data indicates that a number of the peptides have binding affinities in the low nanomolar range with peptides 5 and 6 displaying affinities of 13 and 45 nM, respectively, which is Theoretical and experimental molecular weight, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) using a luciferase assay and binding affinities of SARS-CoV-2:ACE2-antagonist peptides (determined using) MST are also shown. Peptides were synthesized on solid phase using the F-moc strategy, have a free N-terminus, and are amidated at the C-terminus.",

These residues are clearly located in the crystal structure and include Q24, T27, D30, K31, H34, E35, E37, D38, Y41, and Q42 from helix \u03b11, one residue (M82) from helix \u03b12, and residues K353, G354, D355, and R357 from the \u03b23-\u03b24 linker. Most of the interacting residues are located in \u03b11 (Figures 1 and 2 ). Using the results from protein\u2212protein molecular docking and the structural analysis, we assembled peptide 1, peptide 3, and peptide 4 from helix \u03b11 alone (Table 1 ). The design strategy of peptide 2 is as a discontinuous peptide that includes some critical interacting amino acids from \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 (330, 419, 430, and 431) and some key amino acids from residues between \u03b23 and \u03b24 (353 to 355), as shown in Figures 1, 2b and S1. However, a number of amino acids were identified as passenger residues and replaced with appropriate amino acids to preserve the binding energy (Figures 1, 2 , and S1). Peptide 5 was again designed around helix \u03b11, but to additionally include main interacting amino acids from helix \u03b12 (V59, N63, D67, A71, E75, L79, and Y83). Finally, we designed a highly discontinuous peptide (peptide 6) including residues from \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 helices and \u03b24 that are known to bind to S-RBD (Figures 1, 2b , and S1b; Table S2 ).",

All docking experiments showed that the peptides bind at the S-RBD surface in a manner similar to that of the \u03b11 helix of ACE2. Furthermore, the analysis of binding by explicit solvent MD indicates that all peptides remained bound to S-RDB over the whole simulation. Importantly, the pairwise backbone RMSD analysis of four of the peptides showed a distinct profile to that generated by apo-S-RBD (Figure 3a ). Binding of peptides 1, 2, 5, and 6 decreases the RMSD of the S-RBD backbone when compared with the The simulation corresponding to apo-RBD displays a higher RMSD in comparison with the matrices originated for peptides 1, 2, 5, and 6. Indicating a less flexible conformation of S-RBD. (b) The unliganded protein (ACE2:S-RBD) is included for comparison apo structure ( Figure 3 ). This induced transition might lead to a less flexible conformation of the protein, modulating the active state of the S-RBD protein and thus improving the affinity and the residence time of the peptides. The thermodynamic and kinetics of this conformational transition of ligand\u2212receptor systems has been described previously. 65, 66 Additionally, a carbon alpha RMSF analysis of S-RBD ( Figure 4 ) showed that most of peptides modified the fluctuations occurring in apo-S-RBD ( Figure 4a ). In particular, peptides 1\u22125 decreased the fluctuations among most of the residues. Notably, a considerable increase in RMSF values was observed on residues 469\u2212488, comprising a flexible loop in proximity to the binding site of the peptides (Figure 4 ). This same loop has been described as containing key contacts for the interaction with the human ACE2 protein. 35, 48 Moreover, we observed an overall RMSF change distribution on the S-RBD structure (Figure 4b and c) . Although all peptides remain bound to S-RBD, peptide 6 displayed a nonunique binding mode. In the simulations, this peptide leaves the initial binding site and binds into different regions of S-RBD, causing a notable increment in S-RBD fluctuation (Figure 4c ). Conversely, peptides 1, 4, and 5 are suggested to be the most stable binders, since they maintained a similar binding mode throughout the MD simulation ( Figure 4c) . Moreover, the molecular interactions profiles from MD indicated that peptides 1, 2, 4, and 5 formed high frequency interactions with the same residues where the helices \u03b11 and \u03b12 of ACE2 bind ( Figure S1 ). On the other hand, peptide 3 showed lower frequency of interactions ( Figure S1 ). Moreover, peptide 3 also showed a more variable binding mode (Figure 4c ). Finally, peptide 6 showed a nonunique binding mode by exploring other regions of S-RBD ( Figure 4c ) as a consequence, the molecular interaction profile indicated the formation of interactions with several residues of the S-RBD protein ( Figure  S1a ) including those of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD:ACE2 interface ( Figure S1) .",

Peptides 2, 5, and 6 have higher binding strength than the \u03b1-1 helix alone, in which the van der Waals and electrostatic interactions make a significant contribution (Table 2 and Figure S2 ). Taken together, these data suggest that the six designed peptides could bind SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and induce a conformational change. Additionally, the MD interaction analysis suggested that the designed peptides would bind with a high affinity to S-RBD, with the exception of peptide 3. As a consequence, we decided to synthesize and evaluate their ability to antagonize the S-RBD:ACE2 interaction and their binding to a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD ( Figure S3 ).",

Preliminary binding experiments between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD protein domain and ACE2antagonist peptides dissolved in PBS did not provide reproducible results (data not shown). We hypothesized that this is a result of poor aqueous solubility and/or aggregation phenomena of peptides in our experimental conditions. In line with this hypothesis, sequence analysis using the AGGRES-CAN server (http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/A3D/) 67 suggested that all peptides, apart from peptides 4 and 6, show a propensity for self-aggregation ( Figure S4) . Therefore, to identify experimental conditions for further assays, we performed a biophysical characterization of peptides. First, we comparatively assessed the solubility of peptides in PBS with and without additives such as Tween 20 and 1% (w/v) PEG8000, starting from the same stock solutions prepared in DMSO. We determined the difference between the experimental and the theoretical values as percentage of the theoretical values (% Error), for each solution tested. As reported in Table S3 , a significant discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values was observed in peptides dissolved in PBS compared to those Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article dissolved in PBST, 1% (w/v) PEG8000. As long as the analyzed solutions in PBS and PBST, 1% (w/v) PEG8000 were prepared from the same stocks, Tween and PEG8000 in PBS significantly increase the solubility of the peptides in solution. In our attempt to compare the solubility of peptides in PBST, 1% (w/v) PEG8000 used in this study, with respect to the PBS in the working concentrations (low micromolar range), we performed intrinsic fluorescence analysis following aromatic residues ( Figure S5 ). Accordingly, we scanned the fluorescence emission spectra from 300 to 500 nm for peptides containing aromatic residues ( Table 1) . As shown in Figure S5 , the fluorescence emission increases linearly with peptide concentration for most peptides dissolved in PBST, 1% (w/v) PEG8000 and in PBS, indicating that peptides are soluble in the range of concentration tested. Differently, peptide 2 did not show a dose-dependent increase of fluorescence emission when dissolved in PBS compared to that dissolved in PBST, 1% (w/v) PEG8000. Indeed, a significant quenching of fluorescence emission is observed at the highest concentration tested (12.5 and 25 \u03bcM), suggesting that precipitation/aggregation phenomena or conformational changes occur in PBS. Of note, in all peptides tested, a quenching of fluorescence emission, primarily at the highest concentrations tested, has been observed in peptides dissolved in PBS compared to those dissolved in PBST, 1% (w/v) PEG8000 ( Figure S6 ), suggesting different conformational behaviors of peptides in the two buffers used.",

Conversely, peptide 1 showed a more open conformation in PBS with respect to that in PBST 1% (w/v) PEG8000.

            "text": "Synthetic Peptides Efficiently Block the Interaction of ACE2 with S-RBD. The various ACE2 antagonist peptides identified above were synthesized and assessed for their ability to inhibit the S-RBD interaction with ACE2 using a luciferase assay (Figure 5a) . Taha et al. 60 provides a novel bioluminescence-based sensor reporter system, the reassembly Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article of SmBiT and LgBiT into NanoBiT when S-RBD and ACE2 interact, to probe antagonism of the protein\u2212protein interaction. This sensitive yet robust assay, developed for the discovery of neutralizing antibodies, allowed us to rapidly test peptide-based antagonism of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD:ACE2 interaction. Initially, we measured toxicity and inhibition of infection at nine concentrations (0\u221225 \u03bcM) of peptides, performed in triplicate (Figure 5a ). We then used ACE2antagonistic peptides to determine whether these peptides could disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD:ACE2 interaction in a cell-based system. The reported half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of our peptides against the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD:ACE2 interaction demonstrates dose-dependent inhibition, with measured IC 50 s of 11 \u00b1 5, 18 \u00b1 2, 6 \u00b1 3, 32 \u00b1 2, 9 \u00b1 4, and 10 \u00b1 3 nM against peptides 1\u22126, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 5a ). At the highest concentrations used (25 \u03bcM), all peptides completely inhibited S-RBD binding to ACE2. At a concentration of 0.39 \u03bcM, peptides 2 and 4 exhibited up to \u223c95% inhibition, and peptides 1, 3, 5, and 6 exhibited statistically significant inhibition of S-RBD binding at concentrations as low as 0.09 \u03bcM (Figure 5a ). Synthetic Peptides Bind to Purified S-RBD with Nanomolar Affinity. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) of the interaction of purified S-RBD with the six designed peptides was performed on a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 (Nano Temper Technologies, Germany) and the results are shown in Figure 5b . To perform these experiments, pure S-RBD protein was labeled and incubated with a peptide concentration series (12.5\u22120.00019 \u03bcM) in PBS-Tween (0.01%) + 1% (w/v) PEG8000 (w/v). The addition of Tween and PEG8000 was necessary, as previous experiments in the absence of these reagents resulted in a high degree of aggregation of the peptide in the MST experiments. Triplicates of the thermophoretic progress curves are reported as the median of K d posterior distribution for peptide 1 to peptide 6, showing values of 106 \u00b1 1, 102 \u00b1 6, 245 \u00b1 3, 542 \u00b1 5, 13 \u00b1 1 and 46 \u00b1 5 nM, respectively. Overall, all six peptides showed a sigmoid binding curve with K d in the low nanomolar range, which indicate a strong binding of these peptides to the protein in a short incubation time (5 min). Results shown are mean \u00b1 SD of 3 measurements and are in close correlation with those of the luciferase assay (Figure 5b ), in which peptides 5 and 6 also demonstrated the strongest antagonism (Figure 5b) . Given the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2 has been reported as 44.2 49 and 94 nM 50 by SPR and ITC, respectively, these peptides clearly offer an opportunity to effectively inhibit viral cell entry in an in vivo settling.",

            "text": "During an outbreak, conventional small molecule drug discovery 68\u221270 is perhaps not the most efficient option, as it cannot easily provide a sufficiently rapid solution. Several advantages over conventional small molecule drugs have been presented with peptide-based therapeutics, including elevated specificity and synthesis savings in both cost and time. 69, 70 While this increased specificity is also accomplished by monoclonal antibodies, 45,60 they are expensive and laborintensive to synthesize. There has also been some controversy over antibody mediated viral entry, which may lead to acute disease. Several approaches, such as drug repurposing, vaccination, and immunotherapy, represent reasonable alternatives. However, immunotherapy and vaccination approaches utilize peptide targets, and molecular dynamic simulations on the available X-ray crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2/ S-RBD complex provided a straightforward way to identify potential peptide-based therapeutics. 69 Several groups have reported peptides that recognize either ACE2 or SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and inhibit virus from entering human cells in vitro and in vivo. Four SARS-BLOCK synthetic peptides were shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike proteinmediated infection of human ACE2-expressing cells LPDP-LKPTKRSFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGFMKQYG (K d = 2 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM), ASANLAATKMSECVLGQSKRVDFCGKGYH (K d = 5 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM), QILPDPSKPSKRSFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGFIK, ASANLAATKMSECVLGQSKRVDFCGKGY (K d = 4 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM), and ASANLAATKMSECVLGQSKRVDFCGKGY (K d = 2 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM). 44 To date, the most promising candidates of Nterminal ACE2 \u03b11 helix-based peptides have been reported by a 27-mer peptide (aa 19\u221245) 36 and a 23-mer peptide (aa 21\u2212 43), 34 termed P10 and SBP1, respectively, which were shown to bind to S-RBD with a K d of 0.03 nM and 1.3 \u03bcM, respectively, as assessed by biolayer interferometry. However, SBP1 binds to S-RBD which was expressed in insect cells, and the results were not reproduced with human and other insectderived RBDs (provided from commercial sources). 34 This suggests that either the \u03b11 helix of ACE2 is not sufficient to bind S-RBD or it loses its helical structure, and thereby its ability to bind S-RBD, in solution. This finding is in good agreement with recent reports, 34\u221237 and our luciferase and MST results for peptides 1\u22124 ( Figure 5 ) have demonstrated that \u03b11 alone might not be sufficiently stable to provide a sufficiently strong interaction. In accordance with this finding, Yanxiao et al. 35 reported initial computational findings that indicated an interaction between \u03b11 and \u03b12-helices may help retain their bent shape to match to the binding surface of SARS-COV-2 S-RBD, providing a more complete coverage of the S-RBD surface than the \u03b11 helix alone. To provide additional confidence in the design of our peptide candidates, we compared the results of peptide 5 with peptide 1 ( Figure  5 ). This follow-up comparison demonstrated that a candidate containing contributions from both \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices showed a more than 7-fold improvement in binding affinity to S-RBD, compared with other \u03b11-helix-based peptides (peptide 1). Peptide 6 additionally comprises residues from three helices and \u03b24 and shows similar levels of activity in the competition assay. It also demonstrated an \u223c2-fold improvement in affinity over peptide 1 in binding affinity (Figure 5b ). In summary, this indicates that helices \u03b11 and \u03b12 are likely closely packed together in the interaction of peptide 6 with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD (Figures 1b and 2b) , stabilizing each other to preserve structure as well as function.",

However, our peptides derived from ACE2 are currently physiologically inactive as initial experiments on viral inhibition assays were unsuccessful (Table S3) . Due to this lack of activity and the need to use surfactants Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article (PEG8000 and Tween20), which are known to be cytotoxic in cell-based assays, we have also not performed cytotoxicity assays. Analysis of the solution properties of the peptides in this study clearly demonstrates a variation in peptide solubility and overall conformation in the absence or presence of these surfactants (Supporting Information), and modifications will need to be made to our peptides to translate the measured in vitro activity and binding affinity into activity in cell-based assays. However, similar difficulties have been previously reported in the design of S-RBD:ACE2 antagonistic peptides, 71\u221273 which were addressed by creating a tandem peptide, linked by a cholesterol moiety. 39 These experiments are currently underway and the results will be reported in a subsequent manuscript. We believe that our data provides the first direct proof that, while the ACE2 \u03b11 helix is an essential component for binding S-RBD, other loop regions such as helices \u03b12, \u03b13 and sheets \u03b23, \u03b24 of ACE2 also contribute significantly to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. We utilized a library of discontinues peptides to target S-RBD specifically and inhibit interaction of ACE2 with ACE2-S-RBD. Our study also further highlights the potential of a discontinuous peptide-based strategy in identifying antiviral drugs to target new mutations of S-RBD interactions which will undoubtedly offer an approach against future pandemics.",

The crystal structure of the S-RBD-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M0J) complex was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/) and used as the starting point for the docking studies. Molecular docking was performed using the HADDOCK 2.4 61 server. The docking results were analyzed using the Chimera 74 and DS Visualizer programs. The results obtained were analyzed for binding energies and peptide conformations in the S-RBD binding interface. To identify hot-spot residues, we used Protein Contact Atlas (https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/rajini/index.html). 59 Briefly, we used a Chord Plot which shows the interactions between pairs of secondary structural elements (Figures 1 and 2) , the adjacency matrix which reveals specific residue\u2212residue interactions and represents the number of atomic contacts between them, an Asteroid Plot which shows the neighborhood of a particular residue or ligand, network statistics (Scatter Plot Matrix) which shows the network metrics corresponding to each residue (Closeness), statistics table that provides the degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality measures and solvated area of the selected residues), and the network view, in which interactions are represented as edges, with the edge thickness signifying the number of atoms that form contacts between the two residues). Molecular Dynamics. MD simulations were performed using Gromacs 5.0.4. 55 The six designed peptides and S-RBD protein (6M0J) were parametrized using the CHARMM36 force field through the CHARMM-GUI (http://www.charmm-gui.org/). 56 For each peptide:S-RBD complex, the system was constructed by adding TIP3P water molecules, neutralizing ions, and establishing periodic boundary conditions (PBC) by using the multicomponent assembler of the CHARMM-GUI. Before production, the systems were minimized and then equilibrated under an NVT assembly. During the production phase, an NPT assembly was performed at 310.15 K for 50 ns saving velocities, and positions every 10 ps, and energy every 2 ps. Analysis of peptide-target interactions was computed by a python tailor-made script (https://github.com/AngelRuizMoreno/ Scripts_Notebooks/blob/master/Scripts/plipMD_peptide_V1.1.py) using MDAnalysis 65 and PLIP. 66 Free Energy Calculations. Full-length trajectories were employed for free energy calculations using the molecular mechanics energies combined with the Poisson\u2212Boltzmann surface area continuum solvation (MM/PBSA) 68 by the g_mmpbsa v1.6 pack-age. 69 Computation of the potential energy in vacuum, polar solvation energy, and nonpolar solvation energy were performed to calculate the average binding energy.",

All binding reactions were incubated for 5 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 20 000g before loading into capillaries. Then, samples were loaded into standard glass capillaries (Monolith NTCapillaries, Nano Temper Technologies) and the MST analysis was performed (settings for the light-emitting diode and infrared laser were 80%). All measurements were performed in triplicate using automatically assigned 20% LED and 50% MST power; Laser On-time was 30 s and Laser Off time was 5 s.",
