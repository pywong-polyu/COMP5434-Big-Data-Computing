Before the pandemic, China was already the world's biggest outbound tourist market in terms of visitor number and spending power. According to the China Tourism Academy (2019), China recorded 149.7 million outbound tourism departures in 2018, with a total of US$ 120 billion outbound tourist expenditure. In 2018, domestic tourist trips in China reached 5.54 billion, generating 5.13 trillion RMB tourism income (Luo, 2019) . The scale of tourism involving Chinese nationals and the contribution of Chinese national tourism (including domestic and outbound tourism) to world tourism before the COVID-19 pandemic were immense. Therefore, understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic affected Chinese nationals' tourism behaviours and preferences appears to be extremely important for the recovery of world tourism after the pandemic.",

In general, how the pandemic will affect Chinese nationals' perceptions of tourism, especially their tourism preferences, seems to be an important concern regarding the post-COVID-19 international tourism development. Therefore, this research focuses on the impacts of COVID-19 on Chinese nationals' tourism preferences. Employing a mixed-method multi-study design, this research is intended to achieve the following objectives: 1) to examine the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic changes Chinese nationals' preferences of outbound travel destinations; and, 2) to examine the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic changes Chinese nationals' preferences of travel mode, tourism forms and products. The study contributes to the literature of tourism behaviour and psychology in the context of COVID-19. Practically, as Chinese tourists constituted a significant international travel market before the pandemic, the study's focus on Chinese tourists will offer empirical evidence and insights for governments, industry organisations, and tourism operators to better recover the Chinese tourist market and related tourism businesses. This paper is structured as follows. After this introduction section (Section 1), a literature review (Section 2) is offered to examine the impacts of pandemics on tourism in general and tourist psychology in particular. Section 3 elaborates on the methods used in the study. Section 4 provides the study results while Section 5 discusses the findings and offer conclusions. Section 6 briefly acknowledges the study limitations and shows some future research directions.",

The world has seen that tourism, both at global and regional levels, was affected significantly by major crisis events such as the 9/11 terrorist attack, the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Virus-caused contagious diseases can cause public health crisis and thus be more detrimental to regional and international tourism, as travellers can transmit the virus in their travel and can also be victims to get infected by other virus carriers during the travel (Pine & McKercher, 2004) . The scale of the current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in human history; therefore, it is prudent to say while we can learn from the past epidemics/pandemics for their impact on tourism, our existing knowledge on the relationship between pandemic and tourism may be very limited in the current context of COVID-19.",

After the SARS outbreak, tourism scholars have examined the impact of SARS on tourism and tourism industries/sectors from different perspectives (e.g., Au, Ramasamy, & Yeung, 2005; Chen, Jang, & Kim, 2007; Cooper, 2005; Kuo, Chen, Tseng, Ju, & Huang, 2008; Pine & McKercher, 2004) . Au et al. (2005) examined the impact of SARS on tourist arrivals in Hong Kong. Their study identified SARS as an exogenous shock factor that can have a permanent impact on the number of tourist arrivals. However, the authors suggested that measures specific to source countries should be considered by tourism authorities in managing the negative effect of SARS. In another study, Kuo et al. (2008) compared the impacts of SARS and Avian Flu on international tourism demand in Asia. They found that while the number of affected cases had a significant impact on the SARS affected countries, such influence on the Avian Flu affected countries was not significant.",

However, most of the published articles around the impact of COVID-19 on tourism seem to be either conceptual or commentaries. Among the few empirical investigations, Yang et al. (2020) constructed the COVID19tourism index to show the impact of COVID-19 on tourism in general and on different tourism-related sectors such as aviation and hotel sectors. Researchers also resorted to secondary online data to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on global tourism. For instance, Ugur and Akb\u0131y\u0131k (2020) employed text mining techniques on TripAdvisor comments and delineated travellers' concerns due to the pandemic in different geographic regions. Polyzos, Samitas, and Spyridou (2020) applied the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural network methods and used data from the 2003 SARS to simulate the impact of Chinese tourists' arrivals to the USA and Australia due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that it may take 6 to 12 months for the market to recover to the prepandemic levels. Similarly, Fotiadis, Polyzos, and Huan (2021) employed both LSTM and the Generalized Additive Model to simulate the impact of COVID-19 on tourism. Their results indicated that international tourist arrivals could drop between 30.8% to 76.3% and the decline would not stop before June 2021.",

However, understanding the micro-level psychological impact of an epidemic in tourism is important and can provide a key to understanding the macro-level impact on the whole sector and industry. Once again, since the COVID-19 pandemic is unhistorical and may be creating a new normal mega-context for human life, the issue of its impact on tourist psychology remains to be novel; therefore, very limited references in the literature can be resorted to understand the issue. Nevertheless, there have been some relevant studies lightly touching the issue. For instance, Wen, Huimin, and Kavanaugh (2005) investigated the impacts of SARS on the consumer behaviour of Chinese domestic tourists. They concluded that the impacts of SARS on tourist behaviour bear the nature of paroxysm and are subject to the time period; tourists' internal motivation and the external compulsory measures and travel bans collectively worked toward the reduced travel and tourism. It is believed perceived travel risk would be a determining factor to tourist behaviour when tourists are facing terrorism and diseases like SARS and bird flu (Rittichainuwat & Chakraborty, 2009 ). Rittichainuwat and Chakraborty (2009) found that when people perceive the high risk of either terrorism or disease, they do not discontinue traveling completely but choose to have compromised or alternative travel options.",

In addition, independent t-test was applied to compare whether the Study 1 sample (n = 1082) and the Study 2 sample (n = 609) differ in their pre-COVID-19 preferences and post-COVID-19 preferences on the key variables. As our study focused on the impact of COVID-19 on tourist psychology taking Chinese nationals as a sample, it is reasonable to apply the concept of \"psychic distance\" in the examination of Chinese nationals' preferences to different foreign countries. In this regard, we adopted the 4-dimension psychic distance framework (Berry, Guill\u00e9n, & Zhou, 2010; Dinner, Kushwaha, & Steenkamp, 2019) on the basis of Ghemawat (2001) , secondary data were collected from different data sources to construct 4 psychic distance dimensions, namely cultural distance, administrative distance, geographic distance, and economic distance, and these distance scores were then correlated with the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 outbound destination preferences to see whether psychic distance plays a role in the preference changes due to COVID-19. For the Pan et al. (2021) interview data, we applied thematic analysis on the interview transcripts in Chinese and the findings are summarised, translated and reported in English.",

While some countries that dropped their ranks like Italy, US, France, UK happened to be those countries badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, there are other countries that managed well in combating the COVID-19 pandemic but still saw a significant drop in the preference ranking. Australia had been performing relatively well in controlling COVID-19 virus infection cases in its borders by the time of the survey. However, its preference rank dropped from 5th to 10th in this survey. In the survey result in Study 1, Australia, together with New Zealand, was among those countries who moved up on the ranking ladder. On the other hand, Germany, almost equally hit by the pandemic as France in terms of confirmed cases, gained 2 places on the ranking ladder from 10th to 8th. This suggests that the ranking drop in a specific country case may not be solely determined by the severity of damage caused by the pandemic in the country. In the case of Australia, comparing to New Zealand, it is speculated that the deteriorating Australia-China bilateral relationship may have contributed to this ranking drop. Similarly, the tension between US and China may have caused the particularities with the US as an outbound tourist destination to Chinese nationals. While political relations between countries may be one reason to explain the preference drop, there may be other confounding factors in association with the pandemic that may cause the preference changes.",

In terms of the impact of COVID-19 on Chinese outbound destination preferences, our research found the outbound destination preferences changed from the time of COVID-19's early outbreak and development stage (February-March 2020) in China to the time when COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic (June 2020). In the early stage when the COVID-19 outbreak only happened in China, those hotspot Chinese outbound destinations such as Japan, Singapore, US, South Korea, and Thailand seemed to be the most affected by COVID-19, as their ranks based on the preference rating dropped significantly. In the later stage of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, those countries badly struck by COVID-19, namely Italy, US, France, UK, were among those countries which had a significant ranking drop. However, our findings suggest that the severity of COVID-19 infection in a destination is not the only reason for preference drop. Australia also had a significant ranking drop from 5th to 10th in Study 2 although its containment measures on COVID-19 were most effective and exemplary across the globe. It seems COVID-19 has caused repercussions in many fields including international relations and politics. The rapidly deteriorating Australia-China relationship after April 2020 may have contributed to this preference drop. The findings suggest the impact of COVID-19 on tourist psychology may not be direct. Somehow, the COVID-19 pandemic may be the main cause of many interconnected changes in our world (e.g., political mistrust between countries, social unrest due to the COVID-19), and these changes can further cause changes in tourist preferences.",

The additional layer of interpretation our study added on here is, since these correlations are found with post-COVID-19 outbound travel preferences, it was suggested that the perceived insecurity of traveling under the COVID-19 threat may have moderated the relationship between cultural distance and travel preference. Bi and Lehto (2018) found a nonlinear relationship between cultural distance and Chinese tourists' outbound travel demand. And it is not unusual to see studies identified a positive correlation between cultural distance and outbound travel (Yang, Liu, Li, & Harrill, 2018) .

So far, very few studies have attended to examining the impact of the pandemic on tourist psychology. An exceptional study is Kock et al. (2020) , which empirically testified that perceived COVID-19 infectability significant affected many of tourist behavioural tendencies, including tourism xenophobia, crowding perceptions, preference of group travel, and destination loyalty. Our study offers further empirical evidence to show the impact of COVID-19 on tourist psychology, thus contributing to this line of research on COVID-19 impact on tourist psychology.",

The interview findings cautioned us not to overestimate the changes of travel preferences due to the pandemic. Most of our interviewees expressed that COVID-19 will not change their travel preferences significantly; but most of them would pay more attention to hygiene issues, food and wildlife in their future travels. It is clear that due to COVID-19, people will prefer short-distance and short duration trips. Therefore, we foresee that after the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic tourism may recover more quickly than outbound tourism in China. On the global scale, COVID-19 may have shocked tourism flows to retract significantly. Countries targeting Chinese tourists as a significant inbound market are advised that in the short term, long-haul international travel may not be preferred by a majority of Chinese nationals.",

Results show that Chinese nationals' preferences of travel to outbound tourist destinations drop significantly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact does not seem to be symmetrical to the COVID-19 infection severity in the destination countries. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic created derived issues pertaining to international tourism, which function together with the perceived health risks due to the pandemic, to change Chinese nationals' tourism preferences. Chinese nationals reduced their preferences to geographically faraway, culturally and administratively distant destination countries due to COVID-19. In addition, they reduced their preferences in all travel modes and most of the tourism forms. On the other hand, Chinese nationals exhibited a preference for nature-based, rural and cultural destinations after the pandemic is passed; they also preferred shortened trips in short travel distance after the pandemic.",

Asking respondents to answer their pre-COVID-19 travel preferences in the time of COVID-19 may present the bias of self-hinting and social favouritism. And there does not seem to be an effective method to divest such design-related bias. The interview findings also suggest the surveys may bear some common method limitations. We would also like to note that our samples, despite their national coverage, are not geographically representative to the population distribution in China. As such, the survey results may not be representative of all Chinese nationals. Readers are advised to interpret the results with caution. Nevertheless, altogether with the two survey studies and the interviews, our research has revealed multi-faceted and insightful findings around the issues we examined. Future studies could focus on issues like how changed international relationships due to COVID-19 influence Chinese nationals' outbound travel to specific destination countries, assuming that Chinese tourists may still be a relatively strong international travel market.",
