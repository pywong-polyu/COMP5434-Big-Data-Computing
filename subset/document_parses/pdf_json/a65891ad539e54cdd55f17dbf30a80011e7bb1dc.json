Most studies have focused on inpatients from a single hospital or a single health system [2-4, 6, 7] . However, many patients with COVID-19 are not hospitalized, and instead receive emergency department care without following hospitalization or are treated in ambulatory settings only. There is also significant variation in clinical characteristics and outcomes across health systems and findings from a single health system may not be generalizable. Most studies have not followed patients after hospital discharge, as data on post-discharge outcomes and utilization are often unavailable [3, 4, 6, 7] . Finally, although some studies have examined racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , there is less data on how disadvantaged social conditions are associated with COVID-19 outcomes.",

Hospital readmission and other health care utilization are common after acute COVID-19 [55, 56] . We found that socially disadvantaged patients were more likely to experience healthcare utilization after an ED visit or hospital admission, indicating that socially disadvantaged patients may be disproportionately affected by the medium-and long-term sequelae of COVID-19. This may be due to higher pre-existing levels of chronic conditions, vulnerable social conditions (e.g., food insecurity), or the interaction between medical and social conditions.

This may be due to limited vaccination supply, difficulty taking time off from work, or higher rates of mistrust of the medical system and vaccine hesitancy [59] . More research is warranted to understand the social barriers to improve the vaccination coverage.",

First, although we draw on the largest COVID-19 patient cohort from five health systems in NYC, findings may not be generalizable to other patients in the NYC area or patients in other parts of the country. Second, our analysis was limited to outcomes and utilization occurring within these health systems; clinical encounters at other health systems that were not included. Therefore, it is possible that healthcare utilization after acute COVID-19 was underestimated. Third, we were not able to extract details of presenting symptoms, as these measures are generally coded in a non-standardized way. Similarly, we were not able to examine some risk factors, such as Vitamin D deficiency, as they were not routinely tested in early in the pandemic. In addition, we may have underestimated ICU admissions because during the pandemic, non-ICU nursing units were converted to ICUs to accommodate the larger volume of critically ill patients. Finally, we examined social conditions at the zip code level; using more granular data, such as data at the US census block group level, could further characterize patient social conditions. Similarly, detailed social condition data at individual patient level, such as health literacy, food access, and living environment, could elucidate the impact of these factors on socioeconomic disparities related to COVID-19.",

Individuals affected by COVID-19 were disproportionately from neighborhoods with disadvantaged social conditions. These patients were at higher risk for hospitalization and mortality, after adjusting for other patient characteristics, including race and ethnicity. In addition, patients with disadvantaged social conditions received more intensive treatment during hospitalization and were more likely to require medical care after treatment for acute COVID-19. Health care leaders, policymakers, and public health practitioners should consider prioritizing socially disadvantaged areas when designing interventions or allocating resources to reduce health disparities related to COVID-19.",
