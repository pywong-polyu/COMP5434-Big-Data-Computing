Methods: Per capita trends in total cases and per capita fatalities were analysed and difference-in-difference statistical tests undertaken to assess whether differences in stringency of mandated social distancing (SD) measures, testing rates and border closures explain cross-country differences. Results: Sweden is a statistical outlier, relative to its Nordic neighbours, for both per capita cases and per capita fatalities associated with COVID-19 but not in terms of the reduction in economic growth. Sweden's public health differences, compared to its Nordic neigbours, are partially explained by differences in terms of international border closures and the level of stringency of SD measures (including testing) implemented from early March to June 2020. Conclusions: We find that: one, early imposition of full international travel restrictions combined with high levels of governmentmandated stringency of SD reduced the per capita cases and per capita fatalities associated with COVID-19 in 2020 in the selected countries and, two, in Nordic countries, less stringent government-mandated SD is not associated with higher quarterly economic growth.",

Dummy variables were included for each country (Norway is the reference country) to account for unaccounted cross-country differences, with monthly dummies from the start of the pandemic in March 2020 until the end of October 2020.

From early September 2020 to the end of October 2020, Denmark has had the highest new cases per capita of all countries since the start of the pandemic, at 0.012%. Per capita new cases in Sweden also increased in September and October 2020 and were a similar level to Denmark at the end of October 2020. A key public health response to the pandemic is testing and contact tracing of confirmed cases. Figure   3a and 3b provide, respectively, cumulative tests per confirmed cases and additional tests (seven-day average) per additional confirmed cases. Sweden has had much lower testing (in total and additional), at about one hundredth of the rate of any of its Nordic neighbours and New Zealand. Since July 2020 the testing rate (total and additional) increased substantially in Sweden but it remains a small fraction of the level in the four other countries. All rights reserved.

Another plausible factor for the difference among the selected countries is that Sweden has had a much lower rate of testing for COVID-19 compared to its peers. A lower testing rate reduces the efficacy of contact tracing that, in turn, contributes to higher number of infections [16] for any given level of SD (mandated or voluntary).",

A second limitation is that because we have adopted a 'like-with-like comparison' to control for cross-country differences we have only five observations at a country level. In turn, this limits our ability to undertake statistical tests for differences in means among the selected 12 countries. A third limitation is that the data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 are likely to be less than actual cases [18] and this is likely to more pronounced in countries that have had a low testing rate, such as Sweden. A downward bias may also apply, at least in some countries, in relation to COVID-19 fatalities [12] . Another data limitation is that our stringency measure of SD only accounts for government-related measures and does not account for the voluntary behaviours of individuals themselves to avoid becoming infected, or infecting others, with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

Sweden's per capita additional fatalities peaked in mid-April 2020 at 0.001% at about 5 times of the next highest country, Denmark. For all countries, additional per capita fatalities fell from their April peaks to August 2020, with a very slight upward trend exhibited in Denmark in September/October 2020.",

New Zealand had the highest level of stringency in its first outbreak in March and May at levels approaching 100. By contrast, Sweden had the lowest stringency level over the March-May period of between 40 and 50, Norway had stringency levels as high as 80, and Denmark and Finland had levels, respectively, of around 70 and 60. Stringency levels declined for all countries from May 2020 onwards and fell the most for New Zealand that had the lowest stringency levels of all at around 20 by June 2020 following its elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. New Zealand's stringency levels rose quickly and approached 80in August with a second outbreak but fell again in September after the outbreak was successfully contained and community transmission eliminated.",
