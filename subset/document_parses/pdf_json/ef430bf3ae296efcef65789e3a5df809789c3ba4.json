If the inspected items are fraudulent, the officers can levy extra duties. Th formed logs are then used as additional training data for successive iterations. Choosing to inspect suspicious items first leads to an immediate gain in customs revenue, yet such inspections may not bring new insights for learning dynamic traffic patterns. On the other hand, inspecting uncertain items can help acquire new knowledge, which will be used as a supplementary training resource to update the selection systems. Based on multiyear customs datasets obtained from three countries, we demonstrate that some degree of exploration is necessary to cope with domain shifts in trade data. The results show that a hybrid strategy of selecting likely fraudulent and uncertain items will eventually outperform the exploitation-only strategy.",

For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Customs Organization reported increased numbers of attempted fraud and tax evasion incidents [1] . A detection algorithm that is tailored to past logs will inevitably degrade over time. However, relearning the algorithm entirely may waste domain knowledge that has been accumulated over decades. How should the system balance between exploiting existing knowledge and exploring new trends?",

            "text": "To mitigate this problem, active learning techniques can help users decide how to query and interactively annotate data points in light of unknown concepts [3] . In the recent active learning setting, the model encourages querying un-certain samples while ensuring sample diversity. However, in customs risk management systems, queried data are often subject to evaluation. The system needs to be profitable while securing knowledge for the future. Therefore, the learning model cannot fully follow the exploration principles of active learning. To describe the problem, we introduce a case study in which customs administrations maintain an AIbased selection model to support officers' collecting duties. 1 depicts a customs clearance process. Importers need to specify the trade items' information in import declaration forms to trade goods across borders. We hypothesize that a trade selection model plays a role in prioritizing items for inspection. Officers follow the recommendation to manually inspect the authenticity of the chosen items and levy additional tariffs if there is fraud. In most customs offices, only a small subset of the import goods (say, 1-5%) are inspected due to the large trade volume. Once items are inspected, whether there is fraud or not, the performance of the customs offices is evaluated; at this time, the selection model's parameters can be updated with new knowledge. Many customs offices worldwide set aside a small set of random samples to be inspected to learn new fraud patterns [4] . This paper aims to innovate the sample selection strategy, together with the existing inspection process.",

By lever-aging the concept of exploration, our model remains up to date against concept drifts. In contrast, the concept of exploitation maintains high-quality precision for current fraudulent transactions. As an alternative to the random exploration used by customs, we propose the gATE exploration methodology, built upon a state-of-the-art active learning approach [5] . gATE is designed to select the most informative samples in a diverse way to capture the dynamically changing traits of trade flows. Tested on actual multiyear actual trade data from three African countries, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms state-of-the-art models in detecting fraud and securing revenue. Our key contributions are as follows: 1) We define the problem of concept drifts in the context of customs fraud detection, i.e., a dynamic trade selection setting that adaptively acknowledges new trends in data while securing revenue collected from fraud detection. 2) We propose a novel hybrid sampling strategy based on active learning that combines exploration and exploitation strategies.",

DATE is opensource 1 and is being studied widely to advance data analytics capabilities in customs organizations. However, in the process of piloting DATE in a live environment, we found that concept drift could be fatal to the model performance. Considering that various fraud detection algorithms were tested in an offline setting [4] , [6] , [7] , [8] , it is very likely that the model will suffer from confirmation bias in a live setting. We also show that our DATE model suffers from confirmation bias in Figure 4 (c). Avoiding bias in the model is the primary motivation for extending the research.",

For effective exploration, we inspect items that bring large changes and diverse views to the model. Taking diversity into account, we can avoid a situation where similar items are inspected redundantly. We suggest a batch construction method by selecting the most representative samples through the k-means++ algorithm [31] , which produces a good initial clustering situation. K-means++ obtains a set B s t of k centroids sampled in proportion to the nearest set's centroids. Samples with small gradients are also unlikely to be chosen, as the distances between them are small. Gradient embedding with k-means++ seeding tends to result in the selection of a batch of large and diverse gradient samples.

For categorical variables, we quantified the risk indicators of the importers, declarants, HS code, and countries of origin from their non-compliance records. For example, importers were ranked by their past fraud rates. The importers, whose ranks were above the 90th percentile, were regarded as high-risk importers, and their risk indicators were given values of 1; otherwise, the values are set to 0. This is called risk profiling, and it is more efficient than one-hot encoding those variables.

The naive hybrid strategy uses DATE and random exploration at a ratio of nine to one. The data reveal that a pure exploitation strategy can lead to a substantial degree of malfunctioning. Figure 4 (c) shows that for country T, the performance of the state-of-the-art DATE exploitation strategy drops unexpectedly from time to time, yet the hybrid strategy remains stable. The degradation continues despite the increasing size of the training data, confirming that items chosen for inspection are uninformative and indicating a concept drift in the country's trade pattern. Hence, we conclude that the exploration strategy items significantly boost the performance of the exploitation strategy. Considering that the randomly selected items may affect only 1% of the total revenue on average, the performance boost arises from inspecting unknown items. The longitudinal data also allow us to examine how frequently concept drifts occurred in the trading pattern of country T. Figure 5 shows the ratio of each import country for an item with a commodity code starting with 620 in 2015, 2017, and 2019, indicating a significant level of concept drifts in trade rates for the top imported items.

The number of unique importers is 8,653, and the average illicit rate is 7.6%. Figure 12 depicts the weekly statistics of the dataset. Figure 13 shows the experimental results on synthetic data. We confirm that the synthetic data we introduce can help simulate customs selection. According to Figure 13 , the advanced model showed higher performances, supporting our statement that 'Synthetic data also has its fraudulent patterns'. Looking into the details further, we can re-establish our findings from Section 5.4-5.5 with the synthetic data. We run all the experiments five times and report their averages. Figure 13 (a)-(b) compares the performance between exploration strategies and exploitation strategies. Among the exploration strategies, the state-of-the-art active learning approaches-BADGE and bATE-outperform random learning by a large margin. Additionally, gATE performs nearly randomly because its default hyperparameter \u03b8 = 0.3 (Algorithm 3) is set too high for synthetic data.",

We hypothesize that a trade selection model plays a role in prioritizing items for inspection. Officers follow the recommendation to manually inspect the authenticity of the chosen items and levy additional tariffs if there is fraud. In most customs offices, only a small subset of the import goods (say, 1-5%) are inspected due to the large trade volume. Once items are inspected, whether there is fraud or not, the performance of the customs offices is evaluated; at this time, the selection model's parameters can be updated with new knowledge. Many customs offices worldwide set aside a small set of random samples to be inspected to learn new fraud patterns [4]. This paper aims to innovate the sample selection strategy, together with the existing inspection process. We propose a hybrid selection strategy to maximize long-term revenue from fraud detection while maintaining a high income during a short-term inspection. By lever-",
