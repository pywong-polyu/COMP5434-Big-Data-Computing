During this period, the research on the relevant topics of COVID-19 and emotional expressions published on social media can provide decision support for the management and control of large-scale public health events. The research assisted the analysis of microblog text topics with the help of the LDA model, and obtained 8 topics (\"origin\", \"host\", \"organization\", \"quarantine measures\", \"role models\", \"education\", \"economic\", \"rumor\") and 28 interactive topics. Obtain data through crawler tools, with the help of big data technology, social media topics and emotional change characteristics are analyzed from spatiotemporal perspectives. The results show that: (1) \"Double peaks\" feature appears in the epidemic topic search curve. Weibo on the topic of the epidemic gradually reduced after January 24. However, the proportion of epidemic topic searches has gradually increased, and a \"double peaks\" phenomenon appeared within a week; (2) The topic changes with time and the fluctuation of the topic discussion rate gradually weakens. The number of texts on different topics and interactive topics changes with time. At the same time, the discussion rate of epidemic topics gradually weakens; (3) The political and economic center is an area where social media is highly concerned. The areas formed by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan and Hubei have published more microblog texts. The spatial division of the number of Weibo social media texts has a high correlation with the economic zone division; (4) The existence of the topic of \"rumor\" will enable people to have more communication and discussion. The interactive topics of \"rumors\" always have higher topic popularity and low emotion text expressions. Through the analysis of media information, it helps relevant decision makers to grasp social media topics from spatiotemporal characteristics, so that relevant departments can accurately grasp the public's subjective ideas and emotional expressions, and provide decision support for macro-control response strategies and measures and risk communication.",

The LDA topic model has been widely applied, including semantic analysis of social media, topic extraction of articles, unordered text mining, etc. [17] . Research shows that LDA has obvious advantages in topics extraction and semantic mining [ 18 , 19 ] . For example, the subjective expression of customers to the hotel was extracted to analyze the key factors affecting customer satisfaction [20] . Combined with the LDA model, a case studied on the New York Times report on nuclear technology, which proved that LDA has the characteristics of fast speed in analyzing large-scale texts [21] . Analysis of microblog dynamic information of China's dengue fever based on LDA. Meanwhile, the spatial aggregation characteristics and temporal evolution of dengue fever cases were explored in combination with spatial analysis [18] .

The purpose of the LDA algorithm is to infer potential topics and build a comprehensive corpus [23] . In LDA, a document is a set of words, and there is no order between words. A document can contain multiple topics, and each word in the document is generated by one of the topics.

In addition to expressing thoughts and needs directly by publishing the Weibo text, people will also express their attention to topics through likes and comments. We also calculated the rate of discussion for each topic by summing the total number of comments and likes per topic divided by the sum of the total number of posts per topic. The topic of \"host\" had the highest discussion rate (19.70) . Judging from the rate of topic discussion, there are three main areas of concern: (1) The appeal of intermediate host for the spread of the epidemic and the prohibition of the use of wildlife; (2) Wide spread of the epidemic; (3) The situation in the place where the outbreak occurred.

Beijing, as the capital and political center of China, is geographically far from the outbreak area (Wuhan), but still has more topics to participate in and discuss. First of all, Beijing, as the transportation hub of the country, the impact of the changing epidemic on people may be clearly reflected on social media. Second, Beijing was greatly affected by SARS in 2002. There are still some microblogs about SARS in the topic (3.50%), and the mood was very low (0.2837). Third, the economic, political, and cultural background has created people who can obtain information in time and participate in discussions [31] . The low-mood areas are not necessarily adjacent to Hubei Province. Beijing, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Guangdong and other regions are far away from Hubei, but the mood for the epidemic is not high. This phenomenon may be related to the unique culture of China.",

This shows that the government's scientific report on the origin of the epidemic will help to stabilize public opinion in the early stages of the epidemic. The discussion of \"economic and rumor\" is more intensive. Relevant departments should focus on controlling the spread of rumors and the economy in social media, and timely contain them to prevent further proliferation. (2) The \"double peaks\" appeared in the epidemic topic curve. Several hot topics and Chinese New Year topics have led to two peaks in the search volume curve of popular topics within one week. After that, the epidemic topic search volume showed a significant downward trend, but the epidemic topic search volume accounted for more than 30% of the total topic search volume. (3) The topic gradually shifted from the epidemic itself to the potential impact of the epidemic over time, and continued to receive attention for a long time. People gradually shifting the topic from \"origin\" to potential topics such as \"economic\". Potential topics have been concerned for a long time since the beginning of the New Year. This shows that the prevention and control of the epidemic situation should be done well in a long period of time. (4) The political and economic center is a high-profile area of the epidemic network. With Hubei Province as the center, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing posted more microblogs. This is highly relevant to the division of economic regions. It is suggested that the government should strengthen public opinion response and prevention in and control of cities with better economic conditions. (5) \"Rumor\" would enable people to have more communication and discussion. \"rumor\" will attract more attention. There are more exchanges on the topic of \"rumor\", which makes it spread faster than other topics. At the same time, \"rumor\" can also cause people to experience low emotions.",

Secondly, the data of this study does not collect statistical data on the gender and age of microblog users, therefore, when analyzing microblogs, some significant effects of gender and age are not reflected. Finally, we only obtained data from Sina Weibo, but for people who did not use Sina Weibo to express their opinions, we could not collect their topic focus and topic emotions, so we should be more cautious about the generalization of results. With the popularization of COVID-19, we should expand our data volume to provide more comprehensive public opinion prevention and control responses for relevant departments.",
