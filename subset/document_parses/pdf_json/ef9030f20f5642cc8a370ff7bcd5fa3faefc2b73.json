In August 2021, the difference is even more striking: 16.6% versus 64.5% [3, 4] .",

In January-March 2021, the first results of a survey on vaccine hesitancy in HCWs in French Guiana showed that 65.6% of them intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or were already vaccinated against COVID-19, with a higher proportion among physicians, then nurses, followed by other paramedical professions [5] . This raised two issues. First, HCWs are in frequent contact with infected patients and are therefore at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 which can lead to substantial morbidity and absenteeism from work at a time when the healthcare system is already overwhelmed by a deficit in infrastructures and human resources [6, 7] . Furthermore, if positive, these HCWs can transmit the disease to other patients. Second, willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for oneself correlated with recommendation of the vaccine to relatives and patients. In the initial results of the HCWs study, 93.0% of the vaccinated or those intending to do so were willing to recommend the vaccine to their relatives and 91.2% to their patients, whereas these percentages were 21.5 and 35.3% for the unsure [5] .",

For many respondents, vaccination reduced the number of cases and therefore the impact on the health care system, the number of serious cases, and therefore the burden on intensive care units and the deaths. Vaccination also reduced the long-term consequences of COVID-19 (so-called \"long COVID-19\"). For these professionals, the reduction of the burden on the health care system would allow them to resume better management of all other patients, particularly those with chronic conditions. Being vaccinated as a professional allows them to \"set an example\", not to contaminate their patients or their vulnerable relatives or colleagues, and to participate in a collective immunity. Many HCWs hoped that large-scale vaccination would allow a \"return to normal life\", to \"get out of the health and economic crisis\". This would be materialized by the lifting travel restrictions locally, but also outside French Guiana, by restarting leisure activities, by reducing the psychological impact of the lock-down, and even for some being able \"not to wear the mask\". Some felt personally at risk (having risk factors) or had been struck by patients in intensive care and therefore wished to be vaccinated to protect themselves from a severe form.

Staff (HCWs, coordinators, and logisticians) have been dedicated to organize vaccination in isolated areas. Health mediators have been hired to build trust with the population and disseminate correct information. The intervention of health mediators has repeatedly proven to be useful in public health programs in French Guiana [22] . After more than six months of work, COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates are similar in the coastal center (18% complete vaccination schedule for all ages as of August 5, 2021) , in the coastal region called \"Savanes\" (19%) and in the east, including the villages along the Oiapoque River (18%) [3] .

However, for the western region, including the city of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni and the villages located on the Maroni River, coverage is much lower, estimated at 7% [3] .

Much misinformation circulates, which is difficult to counterbalance by the prevention messages disseminated by the medical community, despite efforts to translate them into 19 local languages [19] . The role of trained health mediators and the partnership with community associations are therefore essential, in an \"outreach\" approach, starting from people's knowledge and representations to provide accurate and appropriate information. The high level of vaccine mistrust observed in the field among community and traditional leaders is also an important challenge. Most of the actors come from the health system. The support of community and political leaders is still insufficient and would improve confidence in the prevention proposals of the health system. The involvement of traditional practitioners in the prevention of COVID-19, including vaccination, could also be beneficial as some respondents mentioned the importance of herbal medicine as a means of preventing the disease [24] [25] [26] .",

This proportion is much more lower than in mainland France (52.9% for the 12 years and older) [4] . Health care workers are exhausted after nearly 18 months of COVID-19 circulation resulting in overtime, cancelled vacations, and a diminished private life. However, the vaccination coverage of health care workers remains low: as of 13 August 2021, only 35% of staff in health and medical-social facilities in French Guiana have received at least one dose of COVID- 19 [28] . This leads to increased contamination of health care workers (and therefore morbidity and absenteeism) and a risk of contaminating patients. A new law was voted in France at the beginning of August 2021, imposing com-pulsory vaccination to all health care workers from 15 September 2021. Reactions are likely to be contradictory in French Guiana given the existing defiance (several demonstrations and the mobilization of unions and associations have already taken place), but this decision is also likely to facilitate the choice of some of those who are hesitant. The penalty of losing salaries will be difficult to implement in French Guiana due to the lack of human resources in this isolated territory and the absence of possible reinforcement due to the overload of the health care system everywhere in France. The initial reassuring curve of COVID-19 incidence in French Guiana [29] , and the argument put forward by some participants in this study that French Guiana would be \"less at risk\" due to the youth of its population no longer seems to hold up in the face of the more transmissible Gamma and Delta variants, which affect young patients more severely [30, 31] . It is important to explain this new measure, with arguments to avoid deepening the existing divide with some caregivers. Thus, strategies to improve acceptability of this now mandatory vaccine should be adapted to the specific political, social, cultural, and economic context. Several initiatives along these lines are currently underway.",

The results of this study have made it possible to adapt informative messages to increase vaccination coverage, but also to adapt the vaccination campaign in this French Amazonian territory. Efforts to explain and convince HCWs must be continued in French Guiana using the levers identified to improve the acceptability of vaccination. Given the resentment of health workers, listening, dialogue, and improving working conditions seem to be important prerequisites. Particular attention must be paid to avoid a drift towards community fractures. Funding: This study received logistical support from the Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne (Centre d'investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, CIC Inserm 1424). This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",
