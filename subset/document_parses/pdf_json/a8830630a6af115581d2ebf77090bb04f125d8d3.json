In March 2020, WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. On March 30, 2020, Mexico's General Health Council declared a sanitary emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic (World Health Organization [WHO] , 2020b). The following day, March 31, the Ministry of Health published an Administrative Ruling establishing the extraordinary actions to face the sanitary emergency generated by COVID-19, suspending all \"nonessential activities, \" and urging people in Mexico to stay at home until April 30 (Gobierno de M\u00e9xico, 2020) . In this context, the general population became vulnerable to the emotional impact of COVID-19 infection due to both the pandemic and its consequences worldwide.",

Fear and anxiety about a new disease and what could happen can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Public health actions, such as social physical distancing, can make people feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. However, COVID-19 pandemic, although instinctively may be considered undesirable, can also promote personal and spiritual growth (Wong, 2020) . In recent years, new proposals by the existential positive psychology (PP 2.0; Wong, 2011) or second wave of positive psychology Lomas and Ivtzan, 2016) , declare that in life, suffering is inevitable, but also potentially beneficial. This new paradigm of well-being claims that a meaning-centered coping style aimed to transform adversity into personal growth is crucial to transcend suffering (Wong, 2020) .",

PP 2.0 represents a development of the first wave of positive psychology (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) , a paradigm criticized for being overly focused on positivity (e.g., Held, 2004; Wong and Roy, 2017) . In addition to the positive qualities of human functioning proposed in the research of the first wave, PP 2.0 states that to get the best out of people it is necessary to accept the negative side of life. In life suffering is inevitable, but also potentially beneficial. According to this view, heartbreaking moments, trauma, death, illness, existential abyss, among others, although instinctively may be considered undesirable, can also promote personal and spiritual growth (Wong, 2011) . As recently proposed by Wong (2020) , the challenge of existential positive psychology is to catalyze a new science of well-being based on balance and wholeness by transcending the worse things in life and pursuing the best qualities in life. By learning how to achieve a dynamic balance between the positive and negative life forces in each context mature happiness and deep joy can be developed (Wong and Bowers, 2018) .",

Personal growth or \"post-traumatic growth\" is the result of greater personal strength, openness to new possibilities in life, greater connection with others, appreciation of life, and spiritual change (Calhoun and Tedeschi, 2006; Khanna and Greyson, 2015) . Nevertheless, adversity does not guarantee growth. Post-traumatic growth depends on the coexistence of constructive functionality based on openness and acceptance; and illusory dysfunctionality based on selfdeception or cognitive avoidance (Dempsey et al., 2000; Maercker and Z\u00f6llner, 2004; Zoellner and Maercker, 2006) . Constructive coping and the severity of trauma-derived stress predict posttraumatic growth. As the acceptance of experience is greater potential to grow (G\u00f6rg et al., 2017; Shipherd and Salters-Pedneault, 2018) and even the temporary illusory component can counteract emotional distress and promote self-consolidation (Zoellner and Maercker, 2006) .",

Coping abilities represent the individual set of mental and behavioral strategies adopted when facing traumatic experiences (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984) . Coping abilities can determine the development of psychiatric diseases and maintaining of physical health, by reducing the risk of distress (Mikulincer and Solomon, 1989) . Therefore, to cope well is to respond to the threat in ways that minimize its damaging impact, creating a sense of control (Bazrafshan and Delam, 2020) . Most of the research literature indicates that people usually use two types of coping strategies to combat most stressful events: problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies. Problem-focused coping involves efforts to do something active to alleviate stressful circumstances (e.g., making action plans or seeking further information about the virus; Main et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2020; Gerhold, 2020) . Emotion-focused coping strategies involve efforts to regulate the emotional consequences of stressful events (e.g., humor and reappraising difficulties to find benefits; Lazarus and Folkman, 1984) , appraising the situations as controllable (Chee et al., 2020) . The predominance of one type of strategy over another is determined, in part, by personal style and also by the type of stressful event. Maladaptive coping strategies, such as avoidance and minimization, have been associated with higher levels of distress (Theleritis et al., 2020 ) and significant number of psychological problems such as depression and anxiety (Blalock and Joiner, 2000) , lower subjective well-being (Elliot et al., 2011) , drug use (Carreno and P\u00e9rez-Escobar, 2019) , and post-traumatic stress (Dempsey et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Acceptance of painful emotions and thoughts is one of the major areas in Existential Positive Psychology (Wong, 2011) . However, this coping mechanism would be limited in terms of adaptability without an additional element: the use of meaning in life (Wong et al., 2006) . Wong (1989) defines meaning in life as a socially and individually constructed system, which endows life with personal significance. The former reflects a status when individuals clearly identify the connection between themselves and the world, as well as a sense of realization, order, coherence, and purpose in the search and achievement of valuable goals in their lives (Reker and Wong, 1988; Steger et al., 2006) . According to Folkman (2008) meaning-focused coping is in its essence, an appraisal-based coping in which the person draws on his or her beliefs (e.g., religious or spiritual), values (e.g., \"mattering\"), and existential goals (e.g., purpose in life) to motivate and sustain coping and well-being during a difficult time. However, the conceptualization of meaning-centered coping adopted in this work is based on Frankl's (2014) approach to meaning and its ulterior development by Wong (2020) and Wong et al. (2006) . Under this perspective, meaning-centered coping is understood as a set of attitudinal and behavioral strategies such as positive reframing, maintaining an attitude of hope and courage, life appreciation (also termed as \"existential gratitude\", Jans-Beken and Wong, 2021), prosociality (self-transcendent values and actions), and engagement in other meaningful activities (see Wong, 2020) .",

Overall, psychological distress had a negative association with the perceived physical health of the study participants, while meaning-centered coping and wellbeing seem to buffer the negative influence of psychological distress on perceived physical health. Faced with the current landscape in Mexico where the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic keeps vulnerable people confined at home, the findings of this study are encouraging. The current study is among the first to corroborate the critical role of coping strategies centered around meaning in life rather than around problem-solving within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic among Mexican-based respondents. It has been proposed that when individuals face uncontrollable situations such as this pandemic, meaning can contribute to individuals' adjustment maintaining some level of well-being (Frankl, 1984; Wong, 2010 Wong, , 2011 . Thus, our findings are consistent with this theory on meaning-centered coping mediating the negative influence of psychological distress on perceived physical health. Our results are also in accordance with other studies, which indicate that during adverse life events meaning-centered coping can integrate cognitive, emotional, behavioral, personal and interpersonal elements that could influence subjective well-being with a sequential positive impact on the perception of physical health despite the presence of psychological distress (Wong, 2012; Van Tongeren et al., 2016; Eisenbeck et al., 2021; Jans-Beken and Wong, 2021) .

The protective effect of meaning-centered coping on maintaining perceived physical health, may moderate genetic and environmental vulnerabilities and confer resilience to psychological distress. Recent research has found that chronic social adversity activates a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), characterized by up-regulated expression of proinflammatory genes and decreased expression of antiviral-and antibody-related genes (Cole et al., 2015) . Instead, eudaimonic well-being, which is centered on meaning in life, may act as a buffer against the adverse impact of social adversity on the CTRA gene expression (Cole et al., 2015; Fredrickson et al., 2015; Boyle et al., 2019) . It has been proposed that meaning making can help to prevent a potential negative cycle in which intrusions both provoke and are triggered by chronic physiological arousal and emotional distress (McFarlane, 1992) . There is a need for the discovery of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of this pandemic. Future research could explore if meaning-centered coping could moderate the potential negative physiological distress via its effects on the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenocortical system, the noradrenergic system, and central oxytocin pathways.",

A large body of research has examined the relationship between problemfocused coping and its psychological outcomes; however, the findings are mixed. In health workers (Cai et al., 2020) , older adults (Gerhold, 2020) and in the general population (Guo et al., 2020) problem-focused coping has proven to lessen depression, while other studies on health professionals in China (Huang et al., 2020) and Italy (Vagni et al., 2020) have found increased anxiety, anger and fear that could be associated with limited understanding of the task that hinders effective decision-making. Moreover, problem-focused coping was found to be predominantly helpful in high controllability situations, while emotion-focused coping was more effective under low controllability conditions (Baker and Berenbaum, 2011) . COVID-19 is an unpredictable situation, with high levels of uncertainty where problem-focused strategies might have limited utility. The end of the COVID-19 crisis feels remote, as promised treatments or vaccines will not be available for months at least, strategies that allow restructuring the emotional response, such as meaning-centered coping, can mediate the impact of distress, similar to what happens when dealing with cancer diagnosis (Jim and Andersen, 2007) .",

These finding adds to a growing body of evidence that shows how COVID-19 pandemic is having monumental effects on the mental health and well-being of populations worldwide (Holmes et al., 2020) . The changes to daily life as a result of lockdown restrictions has added stress to many individuals' lives (e.g., increased physical isolation and loneliness, closure of schools forcing parents to homeschool their children while working from home themselves and widespread job losses). Such disruption to normal routine, activities and livelihoods is having monumental effects on the mental health and well-being of populations worldwide (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). Our results are similar to a study perform among Mexican-base respondents during the similar period of time. In that study 50.3% of the respondents rated the psychological distress of COVID-19 outbreak as moderate to severe (Cort\u00e9s-\u00c1lvarez et al., 2020) . However, it is noteworthy that the prevalence of psychological distress reported here is greater than that reported in China . The later could be explain by the fact that information on how the virus spreads and how it was affecting people around the world (infectability and lethality) preceded its arrival to Mexico. A recent survey performed by the WHO in 130 Member States revealed that 89% (116) of the countries had mental health and psychological support as part of their national COVID-19 response plans, however, only 17% said they had committed additional funding for this (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). It is unclear how we will deal with this looming mental health crisis, especially in low-income and middle-income countries like Mexico.",

Our study is also limited by incidental sampling and by not achieving balanced participation, e.g., by perceived socioeconomic status or by geographical region. A further limitation is the use of self-report measures which are prone to socially desirable answers. Also, the cross-sectional design of this study cannot establish a cause-effect relationship between lockdown measures the development of psychological distress, physical well-being and the different types of coping strategies. Any generalization to other populations should be made with caution. Finally, problem-focused and emotion-focused coping were measured as a two general sets composed of different coping strategies. Several of these strategies are clearly maladaptive (e.g., use of substances, denial, self-blame), which can explain the negative relation of these coping styles with well-being. Future studies should explore which specific problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies are maladaptive or adaptive in the present pandemic.",

Meaningcentered coping may help individuals learn how to cope in the face of an extremely traumatic and uncontrollable events. Future experimental interventions are needed to clearly demonstrate how various sources of meaning contribute to well-being. Finally, more research is needed to further understand the critical role of meaning in life in promoting well-being as a protective factor against severe distress especially during traumatic events.",
