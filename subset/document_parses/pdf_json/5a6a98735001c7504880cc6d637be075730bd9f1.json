The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses called this novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the diseases caused by the virus named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on a World Health Organization (WHO) statement. [1] [2] [3] Based on the epidemiologic data, SARS-CoV-2 has a lower rate of mortality with a higher rate of infectivity than the previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. 4, 5 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of the infected cases experience similar symptoms, including fever; cough; sore throat; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; fatigue; muscle, joint, or body pain; headache; nausea or vomiting; congestion or runny nose; the recent loss of taste or smell; and diarrhea. Of note, it mainly affects the lower respiratory tract. It can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe conditions that lead to respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and even death. [6] [7] [8] Currently, there are several potential therapeutic agents used for the management of patients with COVID-19 with different levels of evidence. In this review, we aimed to categorize the potential medications and vaccines reported in the literature for the management of COVID-19 on the basis of evidencebased medicine (EBM) to guide clinicians for better management of the disease.",

The nucleocapsid protein is the other structural protein that surrounds the RNA. 10 The S protein is the most known surface protein of the coronavirus, which can bind to the host cell receptors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD147. ACE2 presents in the lower respiratory tract of humans and accelerates both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions. Also, CD147 (Basigin/Emmprin) relates to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed in several tissues and cells, including neuronal and epithelial cells. [11] [12] [13] [14] Besides the structural proteins, several nonstructural proteins, like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), are responsible for duplicating genetic information and making the virus with high mutation ability. 15 These properties cause a high diversity of coronaviruses, which can infect different hosts. The infections of a wide variety of animal species with coronaviruses supported the idea that these types of viruses are zoonotic and are transmitted to humans from animals, particularly bats. This idea supports the hypothesis that these pathogens are bat viruses that infect intermediate animals and, finally, humans. In the 1960s, the first human coronavirus was detected with mild upper and lower respiratory tract diseases. It was estimated that approximately onethird of the common colds of humans were related to coronaviruses. However, this condition entirely changed with the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012 due to their high hospitalization and mortality rate. Recently, in December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was detected in China. This novel coronavirus genome has high similarity with previous coronaviruses in bats and shares 79.5% identity to SARS-CoV. Thus, it can be concluded that SARS-CoV-2 originally came from bats and then infected humans. Like former coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 as a cellular receptor for infecting humans. 9, 16 ",

In the advanced stages of COVID-19, hyperinflammation causes ARDS, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and multiple organ failure. In this stage, alveolar infiltration of T cells, activated macrophages, and neutrophils results in cytokine secretion such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. These cytokines trigger further inflammatory pathways through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway and T-helper cell activation. The virus envelope protein was also contributing to the IL-1\u03b2 secretion, which leads to lung injury. Moreover, IL-6 also plays a pivotal role in the recruitment of macrophages, progression of inflammation, CRS, and ARDS. This excessive inflammatory response enhances vascular permeability and lung epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis, which leads to ARDS and ventilation requirement. 17 Furthermore, this hyperinflammatory situation associates with coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thromboembolisms in a small fraction of patients with critical COVID-19.",

It is hypothesized that downregulation of ACE2 receptors on monocytes and macrophages after viral binding leads to angiotensin II accumulation, IL-6 elevation, and TF production. Unlike normal conditions, in hyperinflammatory states TF contacts with coagulation factor VII, which leads to activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. The activation of toll-like receptors, which are expressed in the various innate immune cells, was also indicated to be responsible in COVID-19induced coagulopathy. It is noteworthy that increased levels of inflammatory factors, including IL-6, Creactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin, along with the procoagulant biomarkers such as fibrinogen and d-dimers, are interrelated with a higher mortality rate.

It exerts antiviral activity through premature termination of nascent RNA and results in decreased replication and RNA synthesis of the virus. Of note, it can improve pulmonary function and reduce the load of the virus, unlike lopinavir-ritonavir and IFN-\u03b2 in MERS-CoV infection. 22, 23 Previously, its benefits in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were evaluated in in vitro and animal models, making it a potential agent for the treatment of COVID-19. 24, 25 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial in China, 237 patients with r Moderate-quality evidence from \u22651 RCT r Meta-analyses of moderate-quality RCTs (Continued) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized to 2 groups in a 2:1 ratio. After randomization, 233 patients were analyzed; 155 were assigned to the remdesivir group and 78 to the placebo group. Remdesivir was given 200 mg intravenously on day 1 and 100 mg on days 2 through 10 subsequently. According to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), patients aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia based on imaging, oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) of \u226494%, or partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO 2 ):fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio of \u2264300 mm Hg within 12 days of symptom onset underwent randomization. (CT) scan, were mechanically ventilated or had an SaO 2 <94% on room air, or a National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) of \u22654. 28 Also, patients with GFR <30 mL/min, and ALT or AST >5 times the ULN level were not enrolled in the study. Most of the analyzed patients were men (74.3%), with a median age of 63.0 years. As the primary end point, this study evaluated the improvement of patients' clinical status on the 10th and 28th days of the intervention using a 7category ordinal scale. Assessment of the adverse events was the secondary end point of the study. The results showed that 22.2% and 38.9% of ICU patients achieved improvement in hospitalization status on days 10 and 28 of follow-up, respectively. The clinical improvement on days 10 and 28 of the intervention was 35.3% and 88.2%, respectively, among patients in the infectious disease ward. As a secondary outcome, 42.8% of patients experienced hepatotoxicity. The second most common adverse event was acute kidney injury (22.8%), which led to remdesivir discontinuation. Consequently, this study showed that non-ICU patients can benefit more from remdesivir than ICU patients. 27 However, larger-scale studies are required to confirm findings. In a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 (confirmed by RT-PCR or SaO 2 <94% or 94% while breathing ambient air or requiring oxygen support), the use of remdesivir was investigated. All patients in this study had a GFR >30 mL/min and ALT and AST <5 times the ULN. Also, they agreed not to use other potential treatments of COVID-19 for investigation. A total of 53 patients were treated with intravenous remdesivir with a loading dose of 200 mg for the first day and 100 mg per day for days 2 through 10. The clinical improvement of patients was evaluated on the basis of a reduction of 2 points on the ordinal scale category according to the WHO Research and Development Blueprint Group or discharge live from the hospital. In this regard, 36 of 53 patients (68%) were improved, and the clinical status of 8 patients (15%) deteriorated. Also, on day 28 of the follow-up period, the cumulative incidence of clinical improvement was 84%. 29 However, for interpretation of these data, placebo-controlled randomized trials are needed.",

The comparison of the remdesivir groups with the standardcare group showed a significantly higher rate of improvements in clinical status (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-2.56; P < .001; and OR, 1.38; 95%CI, 1.15-1.66; P < .001, for 5-day and 10-day remdesivir groups, respectively). Also, patients who received remdesivir for 5 days showed a better clinical improvement than the 10-day remdesivir group (OR, 1.37; 95%CI, 1.01-1.85; P = .041). 31 However, this study could not consider further outcomes such as mortality and safety concerns. Conversely, the results of the WHO Solidarity trial could not support the beneficial effects of remdesivir on COVID-19. From 30 countries of the WHO regions, 2750 patients were assigned to the remdesivir group and treated with standard care and 200 mg of intravenous remdesivir on the first day and 100 mg for 9 days. A total of 2725 patients were also assigned to the control group and received only standard care. The results of in-hospital mortality as a primary outcome showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. The ratios for death (number of patients dead to the randomized patients) were 301 of 2743 for remdesivir and 303 of 2708 for the control group (risk ratio [RR], 0.95; 95%CI, 0.81-1.11; P = 0.50). As secondary end points, the duration of hospitalization and initiation of ventilation showed similarities between the groups. 32 However, it should be noted that the contrary results of this trial may be a result of significant heterogeneity in the study population and the quality of patients' care, lack of placebo use, and sample size calculation.",

Also, serious adverse events were observed in 24.6% of patients in the remdesivir group and 31.6% in the placebo group. Given the strength points of the trial design, including large sample size, placebo use, and blinded protocol, it can be considered as a study with high evidence. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remdesivir for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 for patients aged >12 years weighing \u226540 kg.

Consequently, it can prevent the activation of STAT. The JAK/STAT pathway involves in the signaling of several cytokines. Thus, blocking this pathway may be a rational way to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-induced immunopathology. Moreover, several medications with this mechanism showed an antiviral effect by interfering with virus cell entry. 35 In the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial-2, a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, the effectiveness of the baricitinib plus remdesivir combination has been evaluated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Of the 1033 patients who underwent randomization, 515 were received 4 mg of oral baricitinib for up to 14 days, and 518 received placebo. Besides the standard supportive care, all patients were treated with intravenous remdesivir with a loading dose of 200 mg on the first day and 100 mg for the remaining 9 days.

According to the phase 1 to 3, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, combined doses of REGN-COV2 improved the viral clearance between days 1 and 7 (95%CI, \u22121.02 to \u22120.11). It also reported that medical visits were reduced by using combined doses of REGN-COV-2 (3% vs 6%; 95%CI, \u221216 to 9). In the patients with negative serum antibody at baseline, better results were achieved by using combined REGN-COV-2 doses considering both viral load reduction (95%CI, \u22120.71 to \u22120.10) and medical visits (6% vs 15%; 95%CI, \u221229 to 11).

The median age of patients was 44.0 years, and 51% were female. The median time from symptom onset to the randomization was 3 days. It should be noted that beneficial effects of REGN-COV-2 were seen particularly in the patients whose immune response was not yet initiated.

Blocking the inflammation pathways involved in the severe forms of COVID-19 can be considered a way to improve outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 41 Glucocorticoids may reduce the inflammation-induced lung damage and, as a result, inhibit the progression to respiratory failure and death. In this regard, the effects of dexamethasone on COVID-19 have been evaluated in hospitalized patients by The RECOVERY Collaborative Group. In this controlled, open-label trial patients were randomized into the groups of 6-mg once-daily dexamethasone for 10 days plus standard care (n = 2104) and standard care (n = 4321). The standard care of this trial consisted of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, or azithromycin. The primary end point was mortality within 28 days after randomization. The mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of the patients' age was 66.1 \u00b1 15.7 years, and 36% of the patients were women. Mortality at 28 days was significantly lower in the dexamethasone group compared to the standard-care group, with deaths reported in 482 of 2104 patients (22.9%) and 1110 of 4321 patients (25.7%), respectively (rate ratio, 0.83; 95%CI, 0.75-0.93; P < .001). This study's critical point was inclusion of patients receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone. Thus, the results cannot be generalized to patients with no or other levels of respiratory support. Moreover, remdesivir was not used as a part of the standard care within the study time. Another limitation of this study was the small number of pregnant and pediatric patients, which limits the interpretation of findings in this population. Adverse effects of dexamethasone, particularly hyperglycemia and infection risk, may limit its use in all patients with COVID-19. Possible drug interactions should also be monitored due to the moderate induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by dexamethasone. 42 The other multicenter, randomized trial has assessed the effects of dexamethasone in moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS (PaO 2 : FiO 2 of \u2264200 mm Hg and FiO 2 of \u22650.5 at 24 hours after ARDS onset). Patients were randomly assigned to dexamethasone (n = 139) and control (n = 138) groups. The dose of dexamethasone was 20 mg per day from days 1 to 5, followed by 10 mg per day from day 6 to day 10. Both groups were supported by mechanical ventilation and continued standard care. The mean ages of patients were 56 and 58 years in the dexamethasone and control groups, respectively. Also, 69% of patients were men in both groups. Regarding the clinical status, the number of patients with the moderate form of the disease (PaO 2 :FiO 2 , 100-200 mm Hg) was higher than the patients with severe type (PaO 2 :FiO 2 , \u2264100 mm Hg).

Also, overall mortality of patients during 14 days (1.7% and 1.6% in the tocilizumab and standard-care groups, respectively; rate ratio, 1.05; 95%CI, 0.07-16.4) and 30 days (3.3% and 1.6% in the tocilizumab and standard-care groups, respectively; rate ratio, 2.10; 95%CI, 0.20-22.6) between the 2 groups showed similarity. Given the fact that this study was not blinded and the sample was small, the potential risk of bias limits the interpretation of results. Furthermore, 14 patients in the standard-care group received tocilizumab after deterioration of their clinical status, which might affect the overall mortality results.",

IFN\u03b1 combat coronaviruses by blocking the replication of the virus. 58 As well, IFN-\u03b2 could block the SARS-CoV replication based on the in vitro studies. 59 Conversely, the investigation of INF-\u03b3 on SARS-CoV did not show beneficial effects. 60 Haagmans et al 61 also indicated that pretreatment with PEGylated recombinant IFN\u03b1-2b, an approved medication for chronic hepatitis C, attenuates lung damage in SARS-CoV infection by decreasing the replication of the virus and protecting pneumocytes. The beneficial effects of IFN-\u03b1 were also demonstrated in a clinical trial on patients with SARS. 62 Moreover, IFNs have also been found to be potent inhibitors of MERS-CoV replication. 63 In a noncontrolled trial by Dastan et al, 64 20 patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 were treated with IFN-\u03b2-1a, hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily) and lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets 4 times daily).

Of note, early use of IFN-\u03b2-1a significantly improved the mortality rate (OR, 13.5; 95%CI, 1.5 -118). Also, no significant differences were observed regarding adverse events, mostly including gastrointestinal symptoms. Of 42 patients in the IFN\u03b2-1a group, 8 patients (19%) experienced INF-induced injection reactions. Some details should be taken into account during the interpretation of the results. Not all of the patients in this study had confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Imaging results, signs, and symptoms were also used for the diagnosis. Also, at the end of the study, further PCR tests or imaging should be conducted for better judgment. 65 In the WHO Solidarity trial, 4100 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 into 2 groups of IFN-\u03b2-1a and control groups. In the intervention group, patients received subcutaneous IFN-\u03b2-1a at a dose of 44 \u03bcg 3 times over 6 days. Furthermore, intravenous IFN, in conditions like high-flow oxygen ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was given at a dose of 10 \u03bcg once per day for 6 days. Death rate ratios were 243 of 2050 and 216 of 2050 for the IFN and control groups, respectively (RR, 1.16; 95%CI, 0.96-1.39; P = .11). The duration of hospitalization and initiation of ventilation as secondary end points showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. 32 A retrospective cohort study was carried out on 446 patients to evaluate the use and time of administration of IFN-\u03b1-2b. The median age of patients was 50 years, and most were men. Of these, 216 patients received early administration (\u22645 days after admission) of IFN\u03b1-2b alone or in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir or umifenovir. Also, 26 patients received late administration of IFN-\u03b1-2b. Of the 204 remaining patients, 122 received only lopinavir/ritonavir, and 82 received only umifenovir. According to the results, the mortality rate was significantly different between the early (0.9%), late (15.4%), and no-IFN (4.9%) groups. Compared to the group with no IFN administration, the early administration of IFN-\u03b1-2b led to a lower mortality (OR, 0.1; P = .02), and the late administration resulted in a higher mortality rate (OR, 3.53; P = .046). The improvements in CT scan or hospital discharge were not observed in early IFN-\u03b1-2b administration. However, the late use of IFN-\u03b1-2b resulted in delayed recovery. Regarding a better combination therapy choice in this study, the combination of early IFN-\u03b12b and umifenovir or each of these alone led to decreased mortality and improved recovery compared with lopinavir/ritonavir therapy alone. 66 It should be considered that the retrospective design and selection bias could affect the results. Also, presence of some other supportive therapies that may affect the mortality rate was not controlled in this study.",

            "text": "The other noncontrolled trial was conducted in China and evaluated the effects of IFN-\u03b1-2b against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on RT-PCR. The patients were given nebulized IFN-\u03b1-2b (7 patients) or arbidol (24 patients) or a combination of nebulized IFN-\u03b1-2b and arbidol (46 patients). The outcome analysis revealed that viral clearance was significantly faster with IFN-\u03b1-2b (P = .002), either alone (21.1 days) or combined with arbidol (20.3 days) compared to the arbidol alone group (27.9 days). Furthermore, the significant reduction of inflammatory cytokines and markers, including IL-6 and CRP, was achieved among patients who received IFN-\u03b1-2b. Due to the small sample size, lack of control group, and unbalanced baseline characteristics including comorbidities between the treatment groups, further studies are needed for justification of beneficial effects of IFN-\u03b1-2b. 67 Colchicine (IIb B-R) Colchicine is a cheap medication with a good safety profile that has been approved for the management of gout and familial Mediterranean fever. The beneficial effects of colchicine have been indicated in several inflammatory conditions, including pericarditis, Behcet disease, and osteoarthritis. The well-known mechanism of colchicine is blocking the polymerization of \u03b2tubulin into microtubules, leading to tubulin and cytoskeletal disruption. This mechanism results in the prevention of various inflammatory pathways, including inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and cytokine release. In addition, colchicine exerts its antiinflammatory effects by interfering with inflammasome signaling, leading to a reduction in active IL-1\u03b2 production. 68 In another study on patients with acute coronary syndrome, it has been indicated that colchicine can significantly reduce the local cardiac output of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and IL-6 cytokines. 69 It has been revealed that the intense inflammatory response leads to overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and CRS, which has a direct relation with lung injury and ARDS in patients with COVID-19. 70 Thus, considering this pathophysiologic pathway, colchicine may have potential benefits due to its anti-inflammatory activity with fewer adverse effects than steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 71 Recently, a randomized clinical trial by Deftereos et al 72 evaluated the effects of colchicine on hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, fever, and at least 2 of the following criteria: PaO 2 <95 mm Hg, sustained sore throat, sustained cough, and loss of sense of smell and/or taste were included in the study. A total of 105 patients with a median age of 64 years (range, 54-76 years) and male majority (58.1%) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 55) and control (n = 50) groups. Along with standard treatment protocols, the intervention group was also treated with a 1.5-mg loading dose of colchicine followed by 0.5 mg after 1 hour and maintenance doses of 0.5 mg 2 times per day for 3 weeks. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, and anticoagulants were used as standard-care medications. The clinical status score for the most of the patients in both groups (\u226560%) was 5. Also, PaO 2 <95 mm Hg was observed in 66% and 74.5% of the patients in the control and colchicine groups, respectively. The clinical end point of the study was the time from baseline to the elevation of 2 grades on an ordinal clinical scale according to the WHO Research and Development Blueprint Ordinal Clinical Scale within 3 weeks after randomization or until hospital discharge. The biochemical end points were the evaluation of the differences between groups regarding the levels of maximal high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the time for the elevation of CRP levels up to 3 times the ULN. The clinical end point rate was 14.0% and 1.8% in the control and colchicine groups, respectively (P = .02). This result showed that the time to clinical deterioration was significantly improved in the colchicine group. In contrast, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups considering the end points in the biochemical phase. The comparison of adverse events also showed similarities in the 2 groups. It should be noted that most of the medications used as standard care in this trial are not recommended against COVID-19. Thus, by using new standard-care treatments including remdesivir, the finding might be different. Furthermore, the open-label design and lack of placebo use are the other limitations for this study. Also, the reason for using colchicine was its anti-inflammatory effects, while the levels of inflammatory markers were not assessed.",

In addition, negative trends for most outcomes in patients with severe disease were observed. 106 Anakinra (IIb C-LD) Some of the patients with COVID-19 develop a hyperinflammatory situation that resembles CRS. IL-1 is one of the cytokines that attributes to this condition. Blocking the excessive release of cytokines might be the rational way for preventing the complications induced by CRS, including lung damage and ARDS. Anakinra is an IL-1 receptor antagonist used in several inflammatory disorders, including familial Mediterranean fever and systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Thus, considering the CRS attributed to COVID-19, the idea of using the cytokine-blocking agent anakinra can be investigated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, a meta-analysis by Putman et al 107 assessed the use of antirheumatic agents in COVID-19. In this review, 1 case series and 2 cohort studies were included to evaluate anakinra use in patients with COVID-19. In a cohort study by Huet et al, 108 the effects of anakinra on severe COVID-19 were evaluated. It included a prospective cohort of patients in the intervention group (n = 52) and a retrospective cohort of the control group (n = 44). Both groups' inclusion criteria were severe laboratory-or imaging-confirmed COVID-19, SaO 2 \u226493% while breathing ambient air, and age of \u226518 years. The intervention group received subcutaneous anakinra (100 mg twice daily for 72 hours and then 100 mg per day for 7 days) and the standard treatments. In contrast, the control group was only managed with standard care including hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily for 10 days, azithromycin 250 mg daily for 5 days, and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g daily or intravenous amoxicillin 3 g daily) for 7 days. The mean age of patients was 71 years in both groups, and most were men. It is concluded that the use of anakinra was associated with a decreased rate of death or requirement for mechanical ventilation (25% vs 73%; HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11-0.41; P < .0001) in severe COVID-19 with no severe adverse events. It is noteworthy that imbalanced baseline characteristics between the groups, particularly the higher rate of obesity in the control group, could affect the findings. Also, due to the observational design of this study, the results should be interpreted with caution.",

The definition of moderate to severe ARDS was explained by respiratory failure PaO 2 :FiO 2 \u2264200 mm Hg and positive endexpiratory pressure >5 cm H 2 O without cardiogenic edema. In addition to the standard care, 29 patients were treated with high-dose anakinra (5 mg/kg twice a day intravenously), and 7 patients received low-dose anakinra (100 mg twice a day subcutaneously). Also, 16 patients were managed with only standard care. All patients were managed with noninvasive ventilation outside of the ICU. The outcomes were analyzed after 21 days, and results showed that 72% of patients on high-dose anakinra safely experience improvements in clinical status compared with 50% in the control group.

Thus, statins may be considered an adjunctive treatment for reducing endothelial dysfunction and imbalanced inflammation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. According to the previous literature, other possible favorable effects of statins in patients with COVID-19 were interfering with virus entry and affecting the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, including ACE2 and CD147. Moreover, statins could exert protective effects by regulating virus replication or degradation through inducing autophagy activation. The anti-inflammatory properties of statins, including blocking several molecular mechanisms such as nuclear factor kappa-lightchain enhancer of activated B cells, NLRP3 inflammasome, and myeloid differentiation primary response 88, could prevent the cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19 and lead to decreased mortality. 110, 111 In a retrospective study on 13 981 patients admitted to the hospital, the effects of statin therapy on COVID-19 mortality was evaluated. Among them, 1219 patients were on statins. The analysis of risk for all-cause mortality after 28 days revealed 5.2% in the statin group and 9.4% in the patients without statin treatment (adjusted HR, 0.58). Thus, it showed the possible beneficial effects of statin therapy on patients with COVID-19. 112 In the other retrospective study, a total of 2626 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. Among them, 951 patients were previous statin users. The demographic and clinical data of 648 statin users were matched with 648 patients not using statins. The propensity-matched analysis results showed that inpatient mortality during the 30 days of the follow-up period was significantly lower in statin users (OR, 0.48; 95%CI, 0.36-0.64; P < .001). 113 However, the results of these studies should be confirmed by randomized clinical trials due to the limitations in the design of retrospective studies including high risk of bias and effect of cofounding factors.",

First, it interferes with the fusion of the virus to the cell membrane by increasing endosomal pH. Second, it inhibits ACE2, which is one of the binding sites for the S protein of COVID-19. Third, it affects the replication of nucleic acid, glycosylation of receptors, and transportation of new virus particles. [124] [125] [126] Hydroxychloroquine, an analog of chloroquine, is more tolerable and has fewer interactions in comparison with chloroquine. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also exert vigorous anti-inflammatory activity, which makes them effective for rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. [127] [128] [129] One study revealed that in comparison with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine has better in vitro antiviral activity against COVID-19, which makes it a better candidate for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 130 The association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death was evaluated in an observational study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Of the total of 1446 consecutive patients admitted to the hospital, 1376 patients were included in the study. Seventy patients were excluded from analysis since they were already intubated or dead. They were discharged after inpatient admission or were directly admitted to alternative facilities within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department. Of the 1376 patients, 811 patients received 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine twice daily on the first day, followed by 400 mg per day for a median of 5 days. The study baseline to intubation or death showed no significant relationship between administration of hydroxychloroquine and intubation or death (HR, 1.04; 95%CI, 0.82-1.32). Of note, patients who received hydroxychloroquine had more severe clinical status with a lower PaO 2 :FiO 2 at baseline than the non-hydroxychloroquine group (median of 233 vs 360 mm Hg). Furthermore, given the observational design of the study, ignored confounding factors, and possible risk of bias, the results need precise evaluation. 131 In a multicenter randomized clinical trial by Tang et al, 132 150 patients (148 patients with mild to moderate and 2 patients with severe COVID-19) were entered. Mild disease was defined by mild symptoms without pneumonia signs on imaging. Moderate disease was defined by respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum production, fever, and pneumonia signs on imaging without severe pneumonia manifestations including SaO 2 :SpO 2 <94% while breathing room air or a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of \u2264300 mm Hg.",

            "text": "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is complicated with inflammation and coagulopathy, which can lead to the deterioration of the clinical condition and high rates of mortality. In comparison with healthy individuals, the levels of fibrinogen, d-dimer, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were considerably higher in patients with COVID-19. 140, 141 In a prospective cohort study of 150 ICU patients, it has been shown that the incidence of pulmonary embolism was substantially higher in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS than in patients without COVID-19 ARDS. 142 In another study on 184 ICU patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the incidence of thrombotic complications was reported to be 31%, which is substantially high. 143 Thus, it can be reasonable to use antithrombotic agents as adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. Of note, the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism was better achieved with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin than direct oral anticoagulants. They have less drug-drug interaction with the COVID-19 investigational drugs due to their noncytochrome P450-mediated metabolism. Furthermore, heparin (both LMWH and unfractionated) exerts antiinflammatory effects, which makes it a medication with potential benefits during SARS-CoV-2 infection. 144, 145 In a study by Tang et al, 499 patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 were evaluated retrospectively. Among these, 94 patients were treated with LMWH (40-60 mg of enoxaparin daily), and 5 patients were treated with unfractionated heparin (10 000-15 000 units daily) for at least 7 days. All patients received standard supportive care after admission. Severe COVID-19 was defined as a respiratory rate of \u226530 breaths per minute, SaO 2 \u226493%, or PaO 2 :FiO 2 \u2264300 mm Hg. Most of the enrolled patients were men, and the mean \u00b1 SD of the age of patients was 65.1 \u00b1 12.0 years. The comparison of 28-day mortality showed no significant difference between heparin users and nonusers, at 30.3% and 29.7%, respectively (P = .910). However, a significant reduction in 28-day mortality was observed among heparin users compared to nonusers in patients with a sepsis-induced coagulopathy score \u22654 (40.0% compared with 64.2%; P = .029) or d-dimer >6-fold of the ULN (32.8% compared with 52.4%; P = .017). The limitations of this study, including potential bias in selecting patients, ignoring the effects of other therapies, and changing the management guidelines during the study period, limit the interpretation. Also, the selection between LMWH and unfractionated heparin and the doses were not explained in the study; thus, the choice should be judged by a clinician. 146 Lately, a retrospective cohort study evaluated the role of LMWH in cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19. Among enrolled patients (n = 42), half of them received LMWH. The results showed a significant reduction in IL-6 levels among heparin users compared with nonusers (15.76 \u00b1 25.71 and 78.24 \u00b1 142.41, respectively; P = .00039), which can indicate the anti-inflammatory effect of LMWH. 147 Other multicenter retrospective cohort study showed a reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19 who received heparin, even when the model was adjusted for age and sex (OR, 0.55; 95%CI, 0.37-0.82; P = .003), SaO 2 <90%, and temperature >37\u00b0C (OR, 0.54; 95%CI, 0.36-0.82; P = .003), and consumption of concomitant therapies (OR, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.26-0.66; P < .001). 148 A retrospective single-center study by Paranjpe et al 149 evaluated the role of anticoagulation on the survival of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Of 2773 patients with COVID-19, 786 (28%) were treated with systemic therapeutic-dose anticoagulants during their hospitalization for a median duration of 3 days. Generally, the comparison of in-hospital mortality between anticoagulant users and nonusers showed no significant difference, at 22.5% and 22.8%, respectively. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation was higher among anticoagulant users compared to nonusers (29.8% vs 8.1%; P < .001). Also, in patients who were mechanically ventilated, in-hospital mortality decreased significantly by using anticoagulants 29% in the anticoagulant group vs 63% in no anticoagulant group; P < .01). Similarly, this study has some limitations. First, confounding variables were not taken into account. Second, particular anticoagulant medication and their indication were not indicated for the evaluation. Third, it is no indicated whether nonusers of anticoagulants managed with a prophylactic dose of anticoagulants.",

The comparison of 2 groups showed that the use of aspirin reduced the mechanical ventilation rate (35.7% vs 48.4%; P = .03), admission to the ICU (38.8% vs 51.0%; P = .04) significantly.

Similar results were achieved between the 2 groups regarding the bleeding or thrombosis. 150 It should be considered that these findings are extracted from the observational study with an insufficient sample size.

It has been assumed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) could inhibit or increase the replication of SARS-CoV-2 by altering ACE2. 151 In this regard, a retrospective cohort study analyzed 4480 patients with COVID-19. Of them, 895 patients were ACEI/ARB users, and 3585 were nonusers. The comparison of mortality revealed that there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (adjusted HR, 0.83; 95%CI, 0.67-1.03). Also, in a case-control study, a comparison of ACEIs/ARBs with other antihypertensive agents was conducted among 494 170 hypertensive patients. The results showed that prior use of ACEIs/ARBs did not increase the incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted HR, 1.05; 95%CI, 0.80-1.36). Of note, this study was an observational study with potential bias in selecting patients, and not all patients were confirmed COVID-19 cases. 152 In a retrospective single-center study by Lam et al, 153 614 patients with prior hypertension history and COVID-19 were evaluated. Among them, 279 patients did not use ACEIs/ARBs. Of 335 ACEI/ARB users, 171 patients discontinued ACEIs/ARBs in the hospital, and the rest continued their medications. The comparison between ACEI/ARB users and nonusers showed similarity in both mortality and admission to the ICU. Among ACEI/ARB users patients who continued their medication showed decreased rate of mortality rate (6% compared to 28%; OR, 0.215; 95%CI, 0.101-0.455; P = .001) and admission to ICU (12% compared to 26%; OR, 0.347; 95%CI, 0.187-0.643; P = .001).

Consequently, similar to real SARS-CoV-2 infection, the host's immune system makes neutralizing antibodies. Thus, in cases of future infections, the immune system of vaccinated persons learns to combat SARS-CoV-2. According to the results from investigations on healthy individuals, 30 \u03bcg of BNT162b2 produced powerful antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, based on an observer-blinded, placebocontrolled trial on 43 548 individuals aged >16 years from 152 countries, administration of 2 doses of BNT162b2 (30 \u03bcg per dose, given 21 days apart) is associated with 95% efficacy.

In patients on high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation baricitinib can be beneficial in combination with remdesivir. Also, outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 can benefit from the casirivimab plus imdevimab and bamlanivimab in circumstances in which the patient's condition progresses to severe. The usefulness of tocilizumab, IFN-\u03b2-1a, colchicine, ruxolitinib, convalescent plasma, ivermectin, and anti-HCV medications including sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin is unclear according to the clinical trials and needs more studies. Because of the limited clinical trials regarding the use of anakinra, favipiravir, IFN-\u03b1-2b, and methylprednisolone, their effectiveness on COVID-19 should be evaluated by further studies.
