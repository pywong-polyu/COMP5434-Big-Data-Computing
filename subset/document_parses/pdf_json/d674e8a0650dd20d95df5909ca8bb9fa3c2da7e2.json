            "text": "Recently, a highly contagious novel coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by SARS-CoV-2, has emerged, posing a global threat to public health. Identifying a potential target and developing vaccines or antiviral drugs is an urgent demand in the absence of approved therapeutic agents. The 5 \u2032 -capping mechanism of eukaryotic mRNA and some viruses such as coronaviruses (CoVs) are essential for maintaining the RNA stability and protein translation in the virus. SARS-CoV-2 encodes S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase (MTase) enzyme characterized by nsp16 (2 \u2032 -O-MTase) for generating the capped structure. The present study highlights the binding mechanism of nsp16 and nsp10 to identify the role of nsp10 in MTase activity. Furthermore, we investigated the conformational dynamics and energetics behind the binding of SAM to nsp16 and nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer by employing molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method. We observed from our simulations that the presence of nsp10 increases the favorable van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between SAM and nsp16. Thus, nsp10 acts as a stimulator for the strong binding of SAM to nsp16. The hydrophobic interactions were predominately identified for the nsp16-nsp10 interactions. Also, the stable hydrogen bonds between Ala83 (nsp16) and Tyr96 (nsp10), and between Gln87 (nsp16) and Leu45 (nsp10) play a vital role in the dimerization of nsp16 and nsp10. Besides, Computational Alanine Scanning (CAS) mutagenesis was performed, which revealed hotspot mutants, namely I40A, V104A, and R86A for the dimer association. Hence, the dimer interface of nsp16/nsp10 could also be a potential target in retarding the 2 \u2032 -O-MTase activity in SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic process of binding nsp16 and nsp10 that will contribute to the novel design of peptide inhibitors based on nsp16.",

The capping of the 5 \u2032 -end occurs through a sequential enzymatic process. This involves three enzymes, such as RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase), RNA triphosphatase (TPase), and RNA guanine-N7methyltransferase (N7-MTase). This generates a cap-0 structure (m7GpppN). It is further methylated at the 2 \u2032 -O position of mRNA by 2 \u2032 -O-methyltransferase (2 \u2032 -O-MTase) and generates the cap-1 (m7GpppNm) and cap-2 (m7GpppNmNm) structures. This mimicking of the eukaryotic mRNA capping mechanism ultimately helps the virus evade the host innate immune system (Furuichi and Shatkin, 2000; Wang et al., 2015) .

The recently solved crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer bound to SAM (PDB: 6W4H) is used in the current study. The three-dimensional structure of the complex is shown in Figure 1 . Here, we have used the standard molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in conjunction with the molecular-mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method to identify the critical residues involved in the complex formation. Further, we conducted MD simulations of nsp16/SAM, elucidating the importance of nsp10 in the binding of SAM to nsp16. The detailed structural analysis and inter-molecular interactions reveal the interface of nsp16/ns10, which provides a distinctive feature for coronaviruses, can be exploited as an attractive target in developing specific antiviral drugs for controlling COVID-19. MD simulations were conducted to elucidate the role of nsp10 in the interaction of SAM to nsp16. Also, the conformational changes in nsp10 and nsp16 due to their association were investigated.",

After the minimization, each system was gradually heated from 0 to 300 K in the NVT ensemble, and the solute atoms were restrained with force constant of 2.0 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 . The temperature was maintained using a Langevin thermostat (Pastor et al., 1988; Loncharich et al., 1992) . Subsequently, each system was simulated for 50 ps at 300 K at a constant pressure of 1 atm using the Berendsen barostat (Berendsen et al., 1984) . In this stage also, the same restraint force was applied to the solute atoms. Before the production run, we equilibrated each system by conducting 1 ns MD simulation in the NPT ensemble without restraining the system. Finally, the production simulation was carried out for 1 \u00b5s using the pmemd.cuda module of AMBER18.

The RMSD plots indicated that all the studied systems reached equilibrium after \u223c100 ns. The average RMSD value varies between 2.8 and 4.0 \u00c5 for all systems (see Table 1 ). The highest and lowest deviations were obtained for nsp10 apo and complex, respectively. An intermediate RMSD value of 3.1 \u00c5 was obtained for nsp16 SAM .

It is evident from Supplementary Figure 1B that the RMSD values of SAM and the binding pocket for the complex were stable up to 850 ns of the simulation. After that, in the last 150 ns, a sudden increase in RMSD was observed. Overall, the average RMSD value was 0.7 \u00c5 and 0.8 \u00c5 for SAM and the binding pocket, respectively (see Supplementary Table 1 ). It indicates that SAM binds strongly onto the cofactor binding cavity of the heterodimer nsp16/nsp10. However, in the case of nsp16 SAM , the RMSD values of SAM and the binding cavity were relatively stable up to 100 ns. After that, the RMSD value increased by \u223c3 times compared to the complex system (see Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1) . These high values of RMSDs suggest that SAM does not bind to nsp16 monomer (nsp16 SAM ), which is in agreement with the experimental study by Chen and coworkers for SARS-CoV (Chen et al., 2011) . Additionally, three loops, namely 71-79, 100-108, and 130-148, which comprises the SAM binding pocket as shown in the crystal structure, were also analyzed and found to be stable for both complex and nsp16 SAM (see Supplementary Figures 2A-C) . However, the cap-binding groove of nsp16 in SARS-CoV, as well as SARS-CoV-2, is mainly composed of two flexible loops, comprised of residues 26-38 and 130-148, while in the case of flavivirus, the NS5 MTase was relatively stable with \u03b1-helices (A1, A2, and half of \u03b1D) along the cap-binding groove (Egloff et al., 2002) . Among the two loops involved in the cap-binding, only the loop 26-38 exhibited differences in the complex and nsp16 SAM system, as revealed from our simulations. The 26-38 loop is located near the interface of nsp16 and nsp10. On the other hand, the 130-148 loop is found near the SAM binding pocket, away from the nsp16/nsp10 interface. As shown in Supplementary Table 1 , the average RMSD value of this loop was higher in nsp16 SAM (3.1 \u00c5) compared to the complex (1.4 \u00c5). The time evolution of RMSD of the 26-38 loop and the corresponding potential mean force (PMF) were displayed in Supplementary Figures 3A,B . From Supplementary Figure 3A , it was observed that in the case of nsp16 SAM , the RMSD value of the loop 26-38 increased during the initial 300 ns and remained stable thereafter. On the other hand, in the complex case, the RMSD of the loop was found to increase during the initial 300 ns and gradually decreased up to 600 ns of the simulation and finally reached equilibrium. We computed the potential of mean force (PMF), taking the loop's RMSD as a reaction coordinate and shown in Supplementary Figure 3B . The primary low energy structure of the loop was observed at \u223c3.2 \u00c5 for nsp16 SAM . However, for the complex system, the global energy minimum was found at a relatively lower RMSD (1.4 \u00c5). Besides, we detected two secondary minima (\u223c1.9 \u00c5, and \u223c2.8 \u00c5) for the 26-38 loop in the complex system, and the energy barriers of the adjacent states were \u223c1.1 and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the dimerization resulted in the loop rearrangement near the interface.",

A relatively large fluctuation was observed for various loop regions located at residues 26-38, 74-80, 104-115, and 130-148 . The loop regions 26-38 and 104-115, which contribute to the interface of the heterodimer, showed higher fluctuations in complex compared to nsp16SAM, which suggests that the dimerization leads to the loop rearrangements. In contrast, the 74-80 loop region, located near SAM binding pocket, stabilized after the heterodimerization. However, the cap-binding groove of the 130-148 loop region exhibited no differences in both complex and apo forms, which agrees with the RMSD analysis (Supplementary Figure 2C) . Overall, it depicts the binding of nsp10 to nsp16 favors and stabilizes the binding pocket of SAM, leading to its high activity.",

The 2-dimensional free energy landscape (FEL) was generated for the complex and nsp16 SAM systems to explore the strong and weakly bound states of the SAM molecule. The RMSD of heavy atoms of SAM and the center of mass (CoM) distance between SAM and nsp16, which characterizes the displacement of SAM from the substrate-binding pocket of nsp16, were used as reaction coordinates for the construction of FEL. The value of a CoM distance < 14.5 \u00c5 denotes the strong binding of SAM toward nsp16. The two-dimensional FEL of the complex (nsp16/nsp10/SAM) and monomer (nsp16 SAM ) systems were shown in Figures 3A,B , and the corresponding positions of SAM in the binding cavity were depicted in Figures 3C,D. FEL of the complex and monomer systems suggested that the conformational state of SAM in two systems prefer disparate configurations. In the case of the heterodimeric complex system, the underlying FEL was characterized by a single global minimum (see Figure 3A) , which corresponds to the strongly bound state of SAM. On the other hand, in the case of nsp16 SAM , the global free energy minimum was obtained at a CoM distance of \u223c17.5 \u00c5, which corresponds to a weakly or unbound state of SAM. The secondary minimum was detected at a CoM distance of \u223c13.5 \u00c5, which corresponds to a strongly bound state of SAM to nsp16 SAM . Overall, our results suggested that although nsp16 monomer (nsp16 SAM ) favored two binding states, the weakly bound or unbound state is energetically more favorable than the strongly bound state. These results illustrated a stronger binding of SAM with the nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer than nsp16 alone (nsp16 SAM ), which agrees with the experimental results obtained for SARS-CoV (Chen et al., 2011) .",

The MM-PBSA scheme provides various components contributing to the total binding energy ( G bind ), such as van der Waals interactions ( E vdW ), electrostatic interactions ( E ele ), polar solvation energy ( G pol ), non-polar solvation free energy ( G np ), and configurational entropy (T S). All these components of the binding free energy of SAM to nsp16 SAM or nsp16/nsp10 (complex) were shown in Table 2 . The binding free energy of SAM to the heterodimer nsp16/nsp10 was estimated as \u22126.8 (\u00b1 0.9) kcal/mol, which agrees with the experimental result (\u22127.4 \u00b1 0.1 kcal/mol) (Lin S. et al., 2020) . On the other hand, SAM was found to bind very weakly ( G bind = \u22120.6 \u00b1 0.8 kcal/mol) to nsp16 monomer (nsp16 SAM ), as evident from Table 2 . This is consistent with Figures 3A,B . A similar mode of SAM binding was observed for SARS-CoV nsp16/nsp10 or nsp16 alone. For both cases, the intermolecular van der Waals interactions ( E vdW ), electrostatic interactions ( E ele ), and non-polar solvation free energy ( G np ) favored the binding of SAM. In contrast, polar solvation energy ( G pol ) and entropy (T S) disfavored the complexation. The electrostatic interaction energy was more favorable than the van der Waals interactions for both cases. In nsp16 SAM , although E ele was much more favorable (\u221276.8 kcal/mol) than E vdW (\u221228.6 kcal/mol). However, the disfavorable polar solvation energy ( G pol = 84.7 kcal/mol) overcompensated the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energy. Hence, the overall polar contribution ( E ele + G pol ) was found to be unfavorable (7.9 kcal/mol) to the SAM binding. In contrast, the overall non-polar contribution ( E vdW + G np ) was found to be \u221232.1 kcal/mol. It implies that hydrophobic interactions drive the binding. In the case of the complex system (nsp16/nsp10/SAM), the binding affinity of SAM to nsp16 increases, as evident from Table 2 . Here, the electrostatic interactions energy ( E ele = \u2212181.1 kcal/mol) was more favorable than the van der Waals energy ( E vdW = \u221240.4 kcal/mol). The total polar contributions ( E ele + G pol ) value was found to be favorable (\u22122.1 kcal/mol) to the binding of SAM, which is in contrast to what had been observed for nsp16 SAM . Further, the overall polar energy was less favorable than the net non-polar contribution ( E vdW + G np = \u221244.5 kcal/mol). Hence, in the complex, the main force behind the binding of SAM to nsp16 is hydrophobic interactions. Overall, the binding free energy analysis showed that the binding affinity of the SAM molecule to nsp16 increases with the presence of nsp10. This implies that nsp10 acts as a stimulator to bind SAM to nsp16/nsp10 of SARS-CoV-2, which agrees with the experiment (Viswanathan et al., 2020) . Wang and coworkers obtained a similar result for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Wang et al., 2015) .",

All the residues having > 1.5 kcal/mol of energetic contributions were considered important and shown in Figure 6 . As seen in Table 3 , the number of amino acids contributing to binding with SAM is high in the complex as compared to nsp16 SAM . Residues such as Leu100, Asp99, Cys115, Met131, Phe149, and Asp114 are common in cases of complex and nsp16 SAM . Apart from these residues, additional residues, such as Asn43, Tyr47, Gly71, Tyr132, and Ser74, also played a significant role in the binding of SAM to the complex heterodimer. These results are consistent with the higher binding affinity of SAM in the complex than the nsp16 monomer. All these residues were also considered as SAMengaging in an experimental study by Lin S. et al. (2020) . It is worth noting here that all these SAM-interacting residues are conserved both in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, suggesting a conserved binding mode of SAM in these viruses. The conserved SAM-binding mechanism to nsp16/nsp10 also opens the possibility of developing a pan-CoV inhibitor by targeting this SAM-binding pocket.",

From Table 5 , the binding free energy ( G bind ) between nsp16 and nsp10 was found to be \u221247.4 kcal/mol. The various components of the total binding free energy indicate that the intermolecular van der Waals interactions ( E vdW ), electrostatic interactions ( E ele ), and nonpolar solvation free energy ( G np ) favors the binding of nsp10 and nsp16. While polar solvation free energy ( G pol ) disfavor the binding. The electrostatic interactions ( E ele ) energy is higher (\u2212429.4 kcal/mol) than the van der Waal interactions ( E vdW ) (\u221290.4 kcal/mol) (see Supplementary Figure 7) . However, the disfavouring components of polar solvation energy ( G pol ) compensate for the E ele being a value of 481.7 kcal/mol. Hence, the total polar interactions ( E ele + G pol ) disfavor the binding between nsp10 and nsp16 with a value of 52.3 kcal/mol. In contrast, the total non-polar contributions ( E vdW + G np ) favor the binding between nsp16 and nsp10 (\u2212100.0 kcal/mol). Therefore, the binding between nsp10 and nsp16 is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions. Overall, the binding free energy analysis depicts, the binding affinity of the SAM in the complex nsp16/nsp10 ( G bind = \u221246.6 kcal/mol) is similar to that between nsp10 and nsp16 ( G bind = \u221247.4 kcal/mol) of SARS-CoV-2. These observations were in agreement with its similar homology virus, SARS-CoV (2002) .

The impact of a single mutation in the proteinprotein interaction is mainly reflected by the more positive value of the G bind . In our study, we have conducted CAS for nsp16 by considering those residues with the decomposition free energy > 1.5 kcal/mol, as given in Supplementary Table 3 . The binding free energy components calculated from the CAS mutagenesis for residues I40A, V104A, R86A, V78A, V44A, M247A, and Q87A of nsp16 are listed in Table 5 and compared with the WT. As seen in Supplementary Table 3 , although the G bind of WT is higher than mutants, different energy components of mutants follow the same trend as WT. The E ele is higher than E vdW, but disfavouring polar solvation energy G pol compensates E ele . As shown in Figure 9A , for all the systems, the binding free energy is mainly coming from the hydrophobic interactions, where the total non-polar energy ( E vdW + G np ) is higher than the total polar energy ( E ele + G pol ). Figure 9B reflects significant residues in the protein interface calculated from CAS mutagenesis. It shows that G bind for mutants, I40A, V104A, and R86A are comparatively high, suggesting that primarily these residues play a significant role in the heterodimer formation, which is in accordance with the decomposition of energy. The CAS mutagenesis results depict that in addition to hydrophobic residues I40 and V104, the hydrophilic residue R86 also plays a vital role in the binding of nsp10-nsp16.",

As shown in Table 5 , the predicted binding free energies between nsp10 and nsp16 ( G bind ) was found to be \u221247.7 kcal/mol, and \u221252.2 kcal/mol at 300 and 310 K, respectively. It suggests that nsp16 binds more strongly to nsp10 at 310 K than 300 K. It can also be noted from Supplementary Table 5 that at the elevated temperature (310 K), the magnitude of total polar interactions ( E ele + G pol ) decreases (52.3 to 49.6 kcal/mol) and oppose less unfavorably to the proteinprotein association. At a higher temperature, the non-polar interactions ( E vdW + G np ) decreased from \u2212100 to \u2212102 kcal/mol and contributed more favorably to the association of nsp16-nsp10. Similarly, Supplementary Table 6 suggested that the estimated binding free energies (without entropy) of the cofactor SAM with nsp16/nsp10 ( G bind ) were \u221246.6 and \u221213.2 kcal/mol at 300 and 310 K, respectively. It was further evident from Supplementary Table 6 that after increasing the temperature, the binding affinity of SAM toward nsp16/nsp10 decreased. At room temperature (300 K) both total polar ( E ele + G pol = \u22122.1 kcal/mol) and non-polar ( E vdW + G np = \u221244.5 kcal/mol) interactions favored the binding of SAM with nsp16. After increasing the temperature to 310 K, the total polar interaction ( E ele + G pol ) became unfavorable to the binding of SAM to nsp16/nsp10. However, the total non-polar contribution ( E vdW + G np ) still favored the binding. As compared to room temperature, the strength of the non-polar ( E vdW + G np ) interactions decreases significantly (\u221244.5 to \u221223.5 kcal/mol). At 310 K, we have noticed that up to 400 ns, SAM binds strongly to nsp16. After that, SAM got detached from the binding cavity (see Supplementary Figure 8) .",

After increasing the salt concentration, it was observed that the total polar ( E ele + G pol ) and non-polar interactions ( E vdW + G np ) increased from 54.1 to 55.3 kcal/mol and \u221298.9 to \u221293 kcal/mol, respectively. The rise in unfavorable interactions caused the destabilization of the protein-protein interactions. Similarly, the binding of SAM to the heterodimer was found to be affected by the increased salt concentration (see Supplementary Table 6 ). The estimated binding free energy of SAM ( G bind ) was \u221223.7 and \u221222.1 kcal/mol for the salt concentration of 0.15 and 0.25 M, respectively. These values are significantly higher than what was obtained for the neutral salt concentration (\u221246.6 kcal/mol). E vdW and E elec were found to contribute less favorably to the binding of SAM to nsp16/nsp10 in comparison to neutral simulations. A similar trend was observed when the temperature was increased from 300 to 310 K. The time evolution of CoM distance between nsp16 and SAM was displayed in Supplementary Figure 9 . It is evident from Supplementary Figure 9 that with the increased salt concentration, the CoM distance between nsp16 and SAM increased and remained stable around 17 \u00c5 and 18 \u00c5 for 0.15 and 0.25 M, respectively. This implies that the cofactor SAM moves away from the binding cavity with the increased salt concentration.",

Our MD/MMPBSA calculations suggested that SAM binds strongly to the nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer and fails to bind to the nsp16 monomer. It emphasized that nsp10 helps in the strong interaction between SAM and nsp16 to execute the 2 \u2032 -O-MTase activity. This finding agrees well with the experimental study, and a similar observation was made for other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We have also investigated the interactions between nsp16 and nsp10. Our study revealed that the binding of nsp10 stabilizes the complex (nsp16/nsp10) structure. Further, our study showed that hydrophobic interactions are critical for the heterodimer association. Thus, apart from the active site of nsp16, the interface of nsp16/nsp10 can also be considered as a potential target site in the design of antiviral drugs such as peptide inhibitors. It includes Ile40, Val104, Ala83, Val78, Met247, Val44, Gln87, Arg86, Lys76, Lys38, Val84, and Met41 from nsp16, and Leu45, Ala71, Val42, Met44, Tyr96, Gly69, Thr47, Arg78, Gly70, Gly94, and Pro59 from nsp10. Besides, the stable hydrogen bond between Ala83 (nsp16) and Tyr96 (nsp10), and between Gln87 (nsp16) and Leu45 (nsp10) were important in the nsp16-nsp10 interface. The CAS study reveals that residues I40A, V104A, R86A, V78A, V44A, M247A, and Q87A of nsp16 were considered as hot spot residues for the association of nsp16-nsp10.",
