Similarly, other research groups reported that the viral loads and pathology signs 104 in the lungs of omicron-infected hamsters were much lower compared to the basal strains and the 105 other VoCs (Diamond et al., 2021; McMahan et al., 2022) . One possible explanation may be that the 106 heavily mutated spike of the omicron variant is so much better adapted to the human ACE2 receptor 107 hence making the attachment of this variant to the hamster ACE2 less efficient. Interestingly a recent 108 study using human ACE2 transgenic mice (i.e. K18-hACE2 mouse model) revealed that omicron 109",

In another study, omicron-infected human ACE2 transgenic hamsters also showed reduced 112 mortality and infectious virus loads in the lung compared to those infected with the D614G strain 113 (Diamond et al., 2021) . Thus a better adaptation to human ACE2 cannot explain the limited infectivity shifted to the upper respiratory tract resulting in limited lung infectivity and hence less also less severe 116 disease. This would be in line with the recently reported data in ex-vivo models from which it is evident 117 that the omicron variant is 70-fold more efficient in replicating in human bronchus tissues than the 118 delta variant but much less efficiently replicating in human lung tissues (Chi-wai, 2021). The cellular 119 entry of the ancestral strains and that of the non-omicron VoCs depend on binding of the S1 subunit 120 of the Spike (S) protein to the ACE2 receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . This process is accompanied by 121 S-protein cleavage (activation) by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) to allow the fusion 122 of viral and cellular membranes (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . However, recent studies showed that the 123 omicron variant replicates much less efficiently in TMPRSS2-overexpressing cell lines as compared to 124 the delta variant (Meng et al., 2021; Peacock et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021) Abdelnabi, R., Boudewijns, R., Foo, C.S., Seldeslachts, L., Sanchez-Felipe, L., Zhang, X., Delang, L., 164 Maes, P., Kaptein, S.J.F., Weynand, B., Vande Velde, G., Neyts, J., Dallmeier, K., 2021a. 165 Comparing infectivity and virulence of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian hamsters. 166",

Moreover, unlike the 125 ancestral strains and other VoCs, omicron enters cells more efficiently via the endocytic cathepsin L 126 pathway (Peacock et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021). These findings could explain the ability of the omicron 127 variant to replicate better than other variants in the cells of the upper respiratory tract that lack the 128 TMPRSS2 expression. Therefore, further experiments are required to assess the viral loads in lung and 129 other tissues from the upper respiratory tract of omicron-infected hamster at different time points 130 post-infection to explain the limited lung infectivity observed in this study. 131 efficacy in animal infection models could be performed using any of the other VoC as a Hendricks for excellent technical assistance with animal experimentation and molecular 145 sample analysis.
