            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , can result in critical illness characterized by severe pulmonary disease (1) , in addition to several extrapulmonary manifestations (2) , and carries a significant morality rate. Critical COVID-19 illness is characterized by a prothrombotic coagulopathy, and higher D-dimer concentrations and activation of coagulation are associated with worse outcomes (3) (4) (5) . Fibrin deposition in the lung vasculature is a commonly identified histopathologic finding, and microvascular thrombosis may be a key driver of COVID-19 pathophysiology (6, 7) . Multiple lines of evidence, including measurement of Endothelial dysfunction accompanies the microvascular thrombosis commonly observed in severe COVID-19. Constitutively, the endothelial surface is anticoagulant, a property maintained at least in part via signaling through the Tie2 receptor. During inflammation, the Tie2 antagonist angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2) is released from endothelial cells and inhibits Tie2, promoting a prothrombotic phenotypic shift. We sought to assess whether severe COVID-19 is associated with procoagulant endothelial dysfunction and alterations in the Tie2/angiopoietin axis. Primary HUVECs treated with plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 upregulated the expression of thromboinflammatory genes, inhibited the expression of antithrombotic genes, and promoted coagulation on the endothelial surface. Pharmacologic activation of Tie2 with the small molecule AKB-9778 reversed the prothrombotic state induced by COVID-19 plasma in primary endothelial cells. Lung autopsies from patients with COVID-19 demonstrated a prothrombotic endothelial signature. Assessment of circulating endothelial markers in a cohort of 98 patients with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 revealed endothelial dysfunction indicative of a prothrombotic state. Angpt-2 concentrations rose with increasing disease severity, and the highest levels were associated with worse survival. These data highlight the disruption of Tie2/angiopoietin signaling and procoagulant changes in endothelial cells in severe COVID-19. Our findings provide rationale for current trials of Tie2-activating therapy with AKB-9778 in COVID-19.",

Endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 may be mediated through circulating inflammatory cytokines (9, 10) , autoantibodies (11, 12) , and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (13) , as well as potentially via direct viral infection (14) .",

            "text": "We have previously demonstrated via unbiased proteomics that endothelial dysfunction is strongly implicated in the coagulopathy of critical illness (23) . Specifically, dysregulation of the Tie2-angiopoietin pathway emerged as a central link between vascular inflammation and inappropriate coagulation (23) . The receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 is highly enriched in vascular endothelium, and its ligand angiopoietin 1 (Angpt-1) promotes vascular stability and quiescence by activating Tie2 signaling (24) . Moreover, activation of the Tie2 pathway can prevent the heightened thrombosis that occurs during septic endothelial injury (23) . Angiopoietin 2 (Angpt-2) is an Angpt-1 paralog that competitively inhibits Tie2. Angpt-2 expression is promoted by tissue hypoxia and other inflammatory pathways and is subsequently stored in endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies and released during endothelial activation (24) . Angpt-2 levels are even further elevated in the plasma of patients with sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation compared with those with sepsis alone, and high Angpt-2 levels potentiate endothelial dysfunction of critical illness (23, 24) . Loss of constitutive Tie2 signaling is mediated through Angpt-2 antagonism or by Tie2 cleavage from the endothelial surface (25, 26) . Inhibition of Tie2 results in loss of barrier function and anti-inflammatory transcriptional machinery, most notably characterized by upregulation of Angpt-2 itself, leading to a positive feedback loop and further Tie2 suppression. Tie2 kinase activity is also tonically inhibited by vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP). Similar to Angpt-2, VE-PTP expression is increased under conditions of endothelial stress such as hypoxia, creating an Angpt-1-resistant state (27, 28) . A firstin-class VE-PTP inhibitor small molecule, AKB-9778 (Razuprotafib) restores cytoprotective Tie2 signaling to protect endothelial cell function in the presence of inflammatory stimuli (27, 29, 30) .",

We used a cell culture model to perturb the Tie2-angiopoietin system and determine if increasing COVID-19 disease severity leads to procoagulant changes in the endothelium. We found that plasma from patients with COVID-19 promoted a prothrombotic state in endothelial cells and that pharmacologic activation of Tie2 signaling rescued endothelial antithrombotic function. We established the presence of prothrombotic endothelial markers in lung tissue biopsies from patients with COVID-19. We next validated the relationship between COVID-19 severity and endothelial dysfunction by measuring Angpt-2 and other markers of thromboinflammatory endothelial activation in plasma from patients with mild, moderate and severe COVID-19. Markers of endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis were correlated with COVID-19 disease severity and survival. Our findings indicate a role for the Angpt-Tie2 system in endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 pathogenesis and offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "Endothelial cells treated with plasma from patients with COVID-19 exhibit upregulation of thromboinflammatory genes and promotion of coagulation on the endothelial surface, which is rescued by Tie2 activation. Plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 contains a wide array of proinflammatory factors including cytokines (1, 9, 10, 31) , autoantibodies (11, 12) , cell-free DNA (32) , and NETs (13) . To determine if the plasma milieu is capable of inducing procoagulant changes in the endothelium, we cultured HUVECs in the presence of 10% plasma pooled from patients with severe (ICU), moderate (non-ICU), or mild (outpatient) COVID-19 or from healthy controls. Plasma from patients with severe or moderate COVID-19 induced significant upregulation of genes encoding tissue factor, E selectin, and Angpt-2 and concurrently decreased the expression of antithrombotic genes encoding endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), TFPI, and thrombomodulin ( Figure 1 ). Plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 also induced the expression of genes regulating complement and endothelial adhesion markers (Supplemental Figure 2 ). Plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 did not significantly alter TIE2 or PTPRB (the gene encoding VE-PTP) expression ( Figure 1 ). Given the significant induction of Angpt-2 and its association with the coagulopathy of critical illness via inhibition of Tie2 (23), we tested whether pharmacologic activation of Tie2 could reverse thromboinflammatory gene expression triggered by COVID-19 plasma. Indeed, stimulation of Tie2 by recombinant Angpt-1 or the small molecule VE-PTP inhibitor AKB-9778 normalized many of the gene expression changes induced by plasma from patients with COVID-19 ( Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 2 ). We further evaluated the ability of humoral factors present in plasma from patients with COVID-19 to promote procoagulant changes in the endothelium by measuring factor Xa and thrombin generation on endothelial cells following exposure to COVID-19 plasma. Factor Xa generation in this assay is dependent on expression of tissue factor, activation of tissue factor activity, and regulators of tissue factor such as TFPI. Thrombin generation is dependent on tissue factor and other regulators of procoagulant activity on endothelial cells. Tenase and prothrombinase formation are the final steps immediately preceding fibrin generation and are promoted by inflamed, but not quiescent, endothelial cells. Plasma from patients with both severe and moderate COVID-19 stimulated factor Xa generation and thrombin generation on the endothelial surface ( Figure  2 ). The proinflammatory plasma milieu of COVID-19 may be similar to that of severe sepsis. Plasma from patients with non-COVID-19 severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) also promoted endothelial cell procoagulant activation in a manner similar to COVID-19 plasma (Supplemental Figure 3 ). Treatment with Tie2 activator Angpt-1 or AKB-9778 significantly attenuated the ability of plasma from severe COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 severe sepsis to promote procoagulant activity on endothelial cells ( Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 3 ). Furthermore, plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 induced externalization of phosphatidylserine, an anionic phospholipid critical for assembly of coagulation enzyme complexes ( Figure  2 ). Treatment with Angpt-1 or AKB-9778 also reduced PS externalization in response to severe COVID-19 plasma. These results suggest that plasma from patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 promotes a prothrombotic state in endothelial cells, and that activation of Tie2 can inhibit this response.",

First, there is a coordinated response such that proinflammatory and prothrombotic genes are upregulated whereas anti-inflammatory or anti-thrombotic genes are downregulated (12, 34) . Second, the effects of the COVID humoral milieu extend to alterations of the endothelial cell surface that catalyze clot formation. Severe COVID-19 is associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 (1, 9, 10, 31) , that scale with the degree of disease severity. These cytokines are known to promote expression of thromboinflammatory proteins such as tissue factor, endothelial adhesion markers, and complement (35, 36) . Similar cytokine elevations are associated with other critical illnesses, including severe septic shock and cytokine release syndrome (9, 37) , conditions also associated with profound endothelial injury and microvascular thrombosis.

As a receptor tyrosine kinase nearly exclusive to endothelial cells, Tie2 signaling promotes vascular quiescence by inhibiting inflammatory NF-\u03baB (38) , thus promoting expression of anticoagulant genes (39) and repressing tissue factor expression (23, 40) . In our study, 2 unrelated approaches to Tie2 activation, direct Tie2 agonism with Angpt-1 and VE-PTP antagonism with AKB-9778, inhibit thromboinflammatory changes in endothelial cells induced by plasma from patients with COVID-19. This includes inhibition of genes encoding Angpt-2, endothelial adhesion markers, tissue factor, and complement C3 and factor B -all, notably, NF-\u03baB target genes (36) . This result is consistent with the ability of Tie2 activation to suppress proinflammatory endothelial phenotypes in non-COVID infectious diseases such as Gram-negative sepsis, anthrax, and malaria (23, 41, 42) . Our findings support previous work suggesting that preservation of Tie2 signaling is both necessary to prevent hypercoagulation and sufficient to normalize pathological thrombosis during systemic inflammation (23) . Is severe COVID-19 a Tie2-deficient state? Similar to COVID-19, severe sepsis is associated with elevated levels of both soluble Tie2 and Angpt-2, the endogenous Tie2 antagonist (23, 26, 43) . Together, these findings suggest that Tie2 signaling is reduced in infectious disease states characterized by marked inflammation. However, soluble Tie2 and circulating Angpt-2 are at best an indirect assessment of Tie2 activation, and further studies are required to determine whether COVID-19 results in reduced Tie2 activation in endothelial cells. In animal models of sepsis, loss of Tie2 -both cell surface receptor and Tie2 phosphorylation -is a common feature of several infectious diseases associated with vascular leak (41) . Tie2 is also expressed on a subpopulation of monocytes and recruitment and/or these cells via Angpt-2 may promote pathologic lung injury through secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes and/or inflammatory cytokines (44, 45) . The role of Tie2 on nonendothelial cells is incompletely defined, and it is difficult to speculate on their role in COVID-19. VE-PTP interacts closely with Tie2 and is a natural brake on Tie2 activity. VE-PTP is highly expressed in the lung, the organ that also bears the highest concentration of Tie2. Like the other endogenous Tie2 antagonist, Angpt-2, VE-PTP is induced by pulmonary vascular stressors such as hypoxia (27, 28) . AKB-9778 (Razuprotafib) has demonstrated beneficial activity in animal models of vascular leak such as LPS-induced acute lung injury (30) . Applied to cultured endothelial cells, AKB-9778 achieves ligand-independent Tie2 activation and activates Tie2 even when Angpt-1 is unable to do so during the high VE-PTP state of endothelial hypoxia. In the present study, we demonstrate that AKB-9778 strongly suppresses the procoagulant response in endothelial cells induced by COVID-19 plasma. AKB-9778 was more efficacious than Angpt-1 (Figure 2 ), which may reflect the ability of VE-PTP to significantly inhibit tissue factor expression or promote the weak agonist properties of Angpt-2 (46) . Tie2 activation by AKB-9778 may, therefore, be an extremely effective means of dampening the thromboinflammatory state of the endothelium in COVID-19. We were surprised that Angpt-1 treatment did not reduce tissue factor (F3) mRNA (Figure 1) , as we had previously demonstrated that Angpt-1 treatment reduced tissue factor protein in endothelial cells stimulated with LPS (23). This discrepancy may reflect differences in assay construction or inhibition of tissue factor protein, but not gene expression, by Angpt-1. TFPI is a potent negative regulator of tissue factor activity and the fact that Angpt-1 increased TFPI expression suggests that the inhibition of factor Xa activity in response to Angpt-1 treatment may be explained in part by increased TFPI. In contrast, AKB-9778 did not increase TFPI expression but did reduce F3 (Figure 1 ). While both activating Tie2 signaling, Angpt-1 and VE-PTP inhibition by AKB-9778 may have different, nonredundant effects on cell signaling. In aggregate, our findings support clinical trials of AKB-9778 to improve pulmonary outcomes and mortality in moderate to severe COVID-19 (RESCUE, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04511650). In addition to promoting endothelial barrier function to reduce the incidence or severity of acute respiratory disease syndrome, by lowering the procoagulant potential of the endothelium, AKB-9778 may also inhibit the microvascular thrombosis that is a hallmark of COVID-19 pathophysiology.",

We attempted to examine the expression of prothrombotic and antithrombotic endothelial proteins in situ in lung tissue from COVID-19 autopsies. Our results demonstrate upregulation of vWF and loss of thrombomodulin and EPCR in lung tissue from COVID-19. It is therefore likely that microvascular thromboses are driven at least in part by prothrombotic endothelial cell changes at the local tissue level. The profound downregulation of EPCR and thrombomodulin suggest that loss of constitutive antithrombotic function may promote clotting in COVID-19. Increased circulating thrombomodulin levels in severe COVID-19 likely reflect its cleavage from the cell surface (22) . Loss of EPCR in lung specimens was unexpected because circulating EPCR was not significantly different between groups in our cohort, even comparing critical COVID-19 disease to healthy controls ( Figure 5) . Nevertheless, the dramatic lack of EPCR antigen in COVID-19 lung specimens suggests mechanisms other than cleavage from the cell surface, such as downregulation of gene expression, may be responsible for loss of anticoagulant endothelial proteins. Indeed, plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 inhibited expression of EPCR by nearly 50% (Figure 1 ).",

This study builds on prior work by demonstrating that the degree of endothelial dysfunction scales with COVID-19 severity and with procoagulant biomarkers. Specifically, markers supporting a procoagulant endothelial phenotype including Angpt-2, P selectin, thrombomodulin, and TFPI were all elevated in severe disease compared with moderate COVID-19 in our cohort. This thromboinflammatory activation of the endothelium is not unique to COVID-19. Prior data published from our group and others have demonstrated that markers of endothelial activation/dysfunction, such as Angpt-2 (23, 50), VEGFR-1 (50), E selectin (50), P selectin (51), thrombomodulin (52), vWF (53) , and D-dimer (52) , are elevated in sepsis, scale with disease severity, and in some cases may be predictive of survival. Previous studies suggest that circulating Angpt-2, thrombomodulin, and vWF levels are associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 (15, 21, 54) . We expand this list to include E selectin and P selectin as well. Correlation of Angpt-2, P selectin, and vWF levels (Supplemental Figure 4 ) in our work and that of others suggests that Weibel-Palade body extrusion may be a common manifestation of COVID-19 endothelial cell injury. Overall, our data are in agreement with several lines of evidence suggesting that endothelial dysfunction promotes the coagulopathy of critical illness (23) and contributes to the pathobiology of severe COVID-19 (8) .",

It would have been useful to determine whether gene expression and coagulation assays of individual plasmas correlated with biomarker measurements or could be associated with clinical outcomes. However, given the limited amount of plasma supply for the endothelial cell-based assays, it was necessary to pool plasma based on disease severity. The number of autopsy specimens was limited, which impaired our ability to perform comprehensive histopathological assessment of multiple endothelial markers, including Tie2 and phospho-Tie2. We cannot rule out that differences in specimen preparation affected antibody staining. That samples were not collected uniformly early upon hospital or ICU admission limits the applicability of our conclusions regarding endothelial biomarkers and clinical endpoints. Since samples were only collected at a single time point, we do not have data regarding how these biomarkers vary over the course of hospitalization. Limited data suggest that Angpt-2 levels increase early in hospital presentation in nonsurvivors of sepsis (26) and perhaps COVID-19 (54) . Future studies may further illuminate how the levels of these biomarkers vary over time in patients with COVID-19.",

Elevated Angpt-2 levels may potentiate endothelial cell dysfunction through inhibition of antithrombotic Tie2 signaling. Activation of Tie2 through 2 independent mechanisms corrects the prothrombotic changes in endothelial cells induced by plasma from patients with COVID-19. Our findings support further investigation into the role of Tie2-angiopoietin in SARS-CoV-2 infection and encourage clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of Tie2-activating therapy for treatment of more severe forms of COVID-19.",
