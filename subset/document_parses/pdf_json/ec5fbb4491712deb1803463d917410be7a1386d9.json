Studies have suggested different seroconversion rates after receiving two messenger RNA (mRNA) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for a solid organ transplant 2,3 and allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients. 4 For patients with malignancies, immunogenicity has been described for solid malignancy patients receiving a two-vaccination series 5 ; however, there is a paucity of data for individuals with hematological malignancies. 6 Some observational reports suggest individuals with hematological malignancies are at higher risk compared to others. 7, 8 Additionally, no definitive quantitative value for spike antibodies has been established to define a degree of immunity or protection from reinfection; however, a qualitative result suggests an immune response. 8 Here, we present three patients with hematologic malignancies who developed COVID-19 infections within six months of being fully vaccinated with available mRNA vaccines. All patients had undetectable COVID-19 IgG (Spike), semi-quantitative antibodies at the time of diagnosis. Case 1. Our first patient is a 29-year-old male with CD20 + Bcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed approximately one year prior to presentation. His treatment history included dexamethasone, rituximab and HyperCVAD with intrathecal chemotherapy, Rituximab, and finally 6-Mercaptopurine + Vincristine + Methotrexate + Prednisone (POMP) with everytwo-week rituximab. However, rituximab, as part of his treatment plan, was delayed for cycle 1 (February 3, 2021) and cycle 2 (March 9, 2021) of his POMP/rituximab regimen in order to receive the Spike-protein-encoding Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine series (mRNA-1273, Moderna TX, Inc) on  February 12, 2021 and March 12, 2021. Approximately four months later, he presented to the hospital with fevers of 102 o Fahrenheit. His physical exam was noteworthy for a body mass index of 31.33, tachycardia with a heart rate exceeding 100bpm, a respiratory rate persistently exceeding 22breaths/minute, and an oxygen saturation of 87%. A comprehensive respiratory viral panel (RVP) was obtained, which resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Computed tomography with angiography of the thorax revealed acute right upper and right lower lobe pulmonary emboli with new bilateral consolidative opacities. His laboratory analysis was significant for transaminitis, markedly elevated inflammatory markers, and a profound lymphopenia of 0.15 K/microliter.",

            "text": "Two years into the pandemic and through rigorous and unrelenting scientific discoveries, vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are now widely available in the United States. The immune response and the antibodies generated against the spike protein following natural infection lead to the virus's neutralization. 1 Currently, all vaccine candidates are administered intramuscularly, thereby strongly inducing serum IgG production, resulting in disease-attenuating or disease-preventing immunity. 1 The gradient of immunogenicity varies among the different types of vaccines, with mRNA vaccines being at a medium-range for eliciting the greatest titers of neutralizing antibodies. 1 These immune responses to vaccines, though, are variable and suboptimal amongst the elderly and immunocompromised patients. Initial vaccine trials have excluded these patients, 9, 10 and the knowledge behind the immunogenicity of these life-saving vaccines amongst immunocompromised patients has only recently emerged. A recent prospective observational study by Monin and colleagues in the United Kingdom 5 assessed for immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. After a single dose of vaccination at approximately 21 days, 38% of patients with solid cancer and 18% of patients with hematologic cancer developed a positive anti-Spike IgG titer compared to 94% of healthy controls. However, in this study, patients with cancer were also older than the healthy controls (median age 73 vs 40.5 years). This seropositivity increased to 100% for patients with solid cancer and 60% at two weeks after a 21-day vaccine boost; unfortunately, the hematology cancer cohort was underpowered for any clinical interpretation. The vaccination schedule in the UK is a delayed 12-week booster regardless of immunocompromising condition. Another recent study in the UK assessed the immunogenicity of a single dose of either BNT162b2 or ChA-dOx1 (AstraZeneca) vaccine among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at 34% (n = 267) and increased to 75% (n = 55) with the second dose 11 at an extended interval regimen of 10-12 weeks. Failure to generate an antibody response was associated with current Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment and IgA deficiency. Similar findings were found from a retrospective study of patients with other hematologic malignancies (primarily B-cell lymphoma, plasma cell disorder, and CLL). Patients received one of three FDA-approved vaccines in the US (Pfizer, Moderna, or Janssen) and had only 39% seroconversion. 12 The majority, 91%, received the mRNA vaccine. Factors associated with lower seroconversion qualitative assay were exposure to B-cell/plasma cell-deleting monoclonal antibodies (risk difference 31%), active malignant disease (27% vs in remission after treatment 49% vs watchful waiting in 67%), and vaccination within 12 months of chemotherapy (24% if vaccinated within 12 months of therapy vs 69% in those vaccinated at longer than 12 months after last therapy).",

However, with inadequate responses to the current schedule of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and a high risk of developing moderate to severe COVID-19 disease, the additional booster dose of the vaccine recently approved by the CDC seems promising. This recommendation comes from recent studies supporting seroconversion among solid-organ transplant patients who did not respond to standard two-dose regimens of vaccine. 8, 13 More studies are expected soon to examine the immunogenicity among immunocompromised patients after a booster dose, via both qualitative and quantitative antibody responses. Until then, it is prudent to check for anti-Spike IgG levels in these patients with hematologic malignancies.",
