            "text": "Freshly isolated monocytes rapidly undergo physiological changes in vitro, resulting in programmed cell death (apoptosis). Activation of monocytes, which promotes differentiation into macrophages, is known to inhibit apoptotic processes. In the present study, we report that human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) prevents monocytes from undergoing spontaneous apoptosis during the first 72 hours of culture. Furthermore, significant alterations in cell-surface phenotype were observed after 72 hours of infection with HHV-6. HHV-6-infected monocyte cultures have considerably reduced levels of CD14, CD64 (Fc\u03b3RI) and HLA-DR antigen on their surface, while CD32 (Fc\u03b3RII) expression is unaffected. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that HHV-6 promotes monocytes survival and causes phenotypic modifications that could favor immune evasion and ensure its persistence within the infected host.",

            "text": "Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) was first isolated in 1986 from the peripheral blood of patients with AIDS or with lymphoproliferative disorders [28] . HHV-6 was identified as the etiologic agent of exanthem subitum, a common childhood illness characterized by high fever and skin rash [31] . A role for HHV-6 in diseases such as organ graft rejection [6] , multiple sclerosis [2, 30] and AIDS (reviewed in Ref. [25] ) has also been suggested. One particular aspect of HHV-6 pathogenesis is its ability to infect cells of hematopoietic origin. HHV-6 can infect T cells [21] , B cells [28] , NK cells [23] , megakaryocytes [1] and monocytes/macrophages [16, 17] . It is also suggested that HHV-6 can establish a latent infection in the monocyte/macrophage lineage. During acute HHV-6 infection, the virus can be isolated from monocytes and T cells [18] , while during the convalescent phase, HHV-6 could only be recovered from monocytes, suggesting that these phagocytes can serve as reservoir for lifelong persistence of HHV- 6. Monocytes and macrophages are key effector cells of the immune system, engaged in host defense against infectious microorganisms. Under physiological conditions, monocytes circulate for 3 to 4 days in the human blood and then emigrate into the tissue where they either differentiate into macrophages or undergo apoptosis. The main functions of macrophages are to phagocytose and destroy particulate material and to present, in association with MHC II, processed antigens to T helper cells. Macrophages have a variety of surface receptors that bind particulate antigens such as bacteria; these include receptors for certain sugars like mannose and for lipopolysaccharide. Macrophages also express Fc receptors and complement receptors, enabling them to bind antigens that are coated with IgG antibodies and C3b complement protein, respectively.",

Apoptosis is genetically controlled and plays a protective role, eliminating cells that might prove harmful if they were to survive, and could help protect against virus infection by limiting viral spread. Several viruses affect apoptosis by interacting directly with components of the highly conserved biochemical pathway that regulates cell death. Many viruses block apoptosis to prevent premature death of the host cell to maximize virus progeny during lytic infection or to facilitate their persistence. Since viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, they must avoid premature cell death in order to complete their replication cycle.",

            "text": "To determine if CD14 reduction following HHV-6 infection required active viral replication, HHV-6 was inactivated by UV irradiation. UV irradiation causes DNA damage and prevents viral gene transcription with minimal effects on viral particle structural integrity and entry processes. When Annexin-V \u2212 /CD14 + cells were studied, wild-type infectious HHV-6 caused a 3-fold reduction in CD14 expression (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, UV-irradiated HHV-6 proved incapable of reducing CD14 expression levels, suggesting that binding to the cell surface and entry of virus into the monocytes are not sufficient to cause CD14 downregulation. However, monocytes incubated with UV-inactivated HHV-6 did not undergo apoptosis, suggesting that CD14 downmodulation and monocyte survival are caused by two different mechanisms. From our results we conclude that viral gene transcription is needed for CD14 downmodulation while it is not essential for HHV-6 to promote monocyte survival. In an attempt to determine whether early or late HHV-6 proteins are playing a role in the noticed CD14 downregulation, we performed experiments in the presence of PAA, a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor that allows expression of immediate-early and early HHV-6 proteins while preventing late protein synthesis [5] . In the presence of PAA, HHV-6 retained its ability to decrease CD14 expression on the surface of human monocytes (Fig. 2B) , suggesting that immediate-early or early HHV-6 proteins are likely responsible for this effect. Lastly, to assess whether CD14 inhibition of expression by HHV-6 is associated with a decrease in CD14 mRNA, Northern analysis was performed. Monocytes were cultured for 72 h in the presence or in the absence of HHV-6, and RNA was extracted from the entire cell populations (Annexin-V \u2212 and Annexin-V + ) and probed for CD14 mRNA expression. Figure 2C demonstrates that infected cells have much reduced levels of CD14 mRNA compared to mock-infected cells. This result suggests that many Annexin-V + cells are viewed as CD14 \u2212 by flow cytometry, but are still expressing CD14 mRNA. This is not uncommon since numerous examples exist of reduction of cell surface marker expression without a noticeable effect on gene transcription (see discussion).",

Following 72 hours of culture in the presence or in the absence of HHV-6, the cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3A , HHV-6 downregulates surface expression of HLA-DR as compared with mock-infected cells. As estimated by the mean fluorescence intensity, HHV-6 caused a 2-fold reduction in HLA-DR expression (425 versus 222). Similar results were obtained when CD64 expression was studied (Fig. 3B middle panels) . As for HLA-DR, HHV-6 infection caused a significant down-regulation of this marker with a 2-fold reduction in CD64 intensity. In contrast to HLA-DR, CD14, and CD64, the expression of the lowaffinity Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) remained unaffected (Fig. 3 bottom panels) by HHV-6, suggesting that this virus selectively represses cell-surface molecule expression.",

            "text": "In the present study, we report that HHV-6 infection protects human monocytes from spontaneaous apoptosis occuring during the first 3 days of culture. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of monocyte apoptosis are only partially understood. Several authors claim the existence of 2 distinct pathways; one by which resting monocytes enter into programmed cell death and another by which activated cells, undergoing differentiating processes, are protected from apoptosis [26, 27] . We also demonstrate that the expression of CD14 on annexin-V \u2212 human monocytes is downregulated following exposure to HHV-6 compared to that of live monocytes from uninfected cultures. HHV-6-induced downregulation of CD14 is associated with reduced CD14 mRNA, suggesting either an effect on transcription of the CD14 gene or a shortened half-life of the corresponding mRNA. The results in Fig. 2C , which show a majority of apoptotic cells from uninfected cultures having reduced CD14 surface expression, yet having a stronger CD14 mRNA hybridization signal compared to monocytes from HHV-6-infected cultures, can be explained as follows: first, apoptotic monocytes from uninfected cultures, for which CD14 cell surface expression was severly diminished, continued to express normal CD14 mRNA with possible inhibition of translation events often observed during apoptosis. Alternatively, it is also known that degradation of cellular mRNA occurs early after apoptosis induction [3] , suggesting that the only source of intact mRNA in uninfected cells would come from live monocytes which express high levels of CD14. Several studies suggest that CD14 acts not only as a surface receptor for LPS but also functions as a polyspecific receptor with broad recognition properties. In fact, it is suggested that CD14 is involved in the regulation of monocyte apoptosis, considering that activating stimuli, which are able to enhance CD14 expression, protect monocytes from apoptosis. Heidenreich and al. reported that downregulation of CD14 expression represents a trigger for the induction of monocyte apoptosis [12] . Our results confirm that the loss of CD14 surface marker is accompanied by spontaneous apoptosis in uninfected cells. On the other hand, we also observed CD14 downregulation in HHV-6-infected monocyte culture that showed prolonged survival and no signs of apoptosis. Our data therefore suggest that lower (3-fold) than normal CD14 expression is compatible with cell survival. Attempts to detect HHV-6 antigens (IE1 and gp106) in monocytes proved unsuccessful. Immunofluorescence studies of primary monocytes proved very difficult to perform for technical reasons. We were therefeore unable to assess the percentage of HHV-6-infected monocytes in our culture. As an alternative, realtime PCR experiments were conducted to determine the quantity of HHV-6 DNA in monocyte cultures 72 h after viral infection. Our results indicate that, on average, 21 copies of HHV-6 viral DNA were detected per monocyte. Whether this reflects a few cells carrying many (>21) copies of viral DNA or the majority of cells carrying 21 copies of the HHV-6 genome could not be determined. At present, we cannot confirm that the observed effects on cell surface markers are directly linked to HHV-6 infection. Whether other factors contribute to promote survival of monocytes in infected cultures remains to be determined. One factor previously reported to promote monocyte survival is TNF-\u03b1. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that HHV-6 is a potent inducer of TNF-\u03b1 and that secretion of this cytokine occurs with kinetics compatible with a possible influence of this factor on monocyte survival [7] . However, experiments designed to neutralize endogenously secreted TNF-\u03b1 in response to HHV-6 suggest that this cytokine has no impact on monocyte survival in this system (data not shown). Further studies are therefore needed to identify the factors contributing to monocyte survival following HHV-6 infection.",

Unlike mock-infected cells, monocytes from HHV-6-infected cultures displayed a significant reduction in HLA-DR antigen expression, which could lead to a substantial loss in their antigen-presenting capacity to T cells. In fact, the major histocompatibility complex molecules constitute an interface between the host and the pathogen. MHC molecules present peptides to T lymphocytes, thereby triggering an immune response that is essential in controlling most viral infections. Not surprisingly, several viruses have evolved diverse strategies for inhibiting MHC molecule expression and thus escaping immune system surveillance. For example, several human herpesviruses such as human cytomegalovirus (CMV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) silence MHC class II molecule expression in a variety of cells (reviewed in [11] ). It has also been reported that HHV-6 variant A but not HHV-6B downregulates MHC class I expression on dendritic cells [13] . In contrast, another study suggests that the variant B induces the expression of both MHC class I and class II molecules on these cells [15] . The mechanisms underlying the HLA-DR down-regulation on monocytes following HHV-6 infection need to be identified, and the true impact of such phenotypic alterations as an immune evasion strategy remains to be determined experimentally.",

These receptors, which bind the constant region of IgGs, are the major mechanism by which cells of monocyte lineage recognize IgG-opsonized pathogens, thereby triggering phagocytosis and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Several viruses are able to overcome this arm of the immune system. Some viruses such as herpesviruses and coronaviruses produce molecules that bind to the Fc region of host immunoglobulins, preventing neutralization of free virus and engaging in antibody-dependent activity against infected cells [20] . HCMV and HSV induce Fc-binding activity in infected cells by encoding proteins with Fc-binding capabilities. Many viruses are not neutralized by antibodies and must be destroyed by other means. To dispose of neutralized virus, antibodies can bind to cells like monocytes bearing Fc receptors which ingest antibody-coated virus and destroy them. By downregulating Fc\u03b3RI, HHV-6 may reduce phagocytosis of opsonized HHV-6 by monocyte and then silencing proinflammatory response of its reservoir cells in order to evade immunosurveillance. Previous studies have shown that HHV-6 infection can modulate the expression of several other receptors. The observation that human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) can induce CD4 gene transcription and expression in CD4(\u2212) cells was reported several years ago [8, 22, 24] . The transcriptional down-regulation of the CD3/TCR complex, by affecting a critical T cell recognition function, could also be relevant to HHV-6 immunoevasion strategies [8] .",
