Clinically late-onset profound BD can present with spectrum of manifestations ranging from single organ to multiple organ involvement, typically affecting function of brain, eye, ear, and skin. Here, a first-born child to consanguineous parents with late-onset profound BD presenting with hyperventilation secondary to lactic acidosis, hypotonia, evolving spasticity, and abnormal neuroimaging findings caused by novel homozygous variant, c.466-3T>G in the BTD gene is reported.",
