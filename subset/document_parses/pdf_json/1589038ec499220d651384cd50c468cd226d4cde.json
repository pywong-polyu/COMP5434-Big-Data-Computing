Superspreading has been observed for many infectious pathogens, such as measles or SARS. 3 During the SARS pandemic in 2003, a superspreading event was defined as one infected person infecting eight others. 4 For SARS-CoV-2, it has been estimated that 80% of the infections are caused by 10% of infected individuals highlighting the importance of the cluster factor (k). 2 In Germany, an indoor carnival event in the beginning of 2020 is considered as the first major outbreak in a German city and was considered a hotspot during the beginning of the pandemic in Germany. 5 Other SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events worldwide have been linked to indoor gatherings with close proximity of individuals. 6 Nevertheless, most",

Since the community of Gangelt was the centre of the first German outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, there was a great interest from the local public to participate in this study to help understand this new virus and to gain access to early testing. Accordingly, the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs of the state government funded this study. In turn, as a service to the public, we informed each participant of their PCR and ELISA result via letter and offered a phone hotline for questions about the results.",

Alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks were served in glasses, and a food truck was located outside in front of the venue.

On the grounds of these coordinates, we calculated pairwise metric distances between all persons and distances to closest inlet and outlet airshafts. For all persons, their pairwise inverse distances were summarised as mean inverse distance. Inverse metric distances to persons or airshafts were regarded as representing infectious potential through local proximity, and inverse distances were capped at 2.5 (the inverse of the width of a seat of 0.4 m). Alternatively, we counted all infected persons within adjacent rings of 1.5 m width around each participant as a measure of crowdedness and infectious potential.",

In this naturally occurring experiment, we found that nearly half of the participants became infected and determined multiple prerequisites for superspreading and risk factors for becoming infected. While our study population is not a representative sample of the general population, the event may be regarded as exemplary for similar party occasions and may help reduce the number of those infected in the future.

Therefore, the results shown here need to be viewed as qualified in describing a superspreading event under the circumstances in the beginning of the pandemic.

Individuals close to the air outlets that contained air with low amount of fresh air had the highest infection risk compared with those close to the air inlets. This was particularly interesting, because we did not see any increased risk of infection from greater proximity to other infected persons, which indicates that ventilation was perhaps more important than physical proximity. Our findings are in line with previous studies that demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 to be able to become airborne under certain conditions and that the ventilation system can have an influence on virus spread. [10] [11] [12] The air filters in the venue were not capable of intercepting virus particles supporting the notion on the importance of proper indoor ventilation systems. 13 14 Indeed, spending the break of the event outside decreased the possibility of infection underscoring the benefit of proper ventilation or fresh air to lower the amount of aerosols. Due to the nature of the event, the spatial distribution of the participants was not fixed throughout the evening and not perfectly recapitulated, so this information carries some error. However, allowing for multiple positions per person, we used all available information. Assuming further error in the spatial data to be random, this might lead to a dilution of effects; that is, true associations may remain undetected. Complementary analyses including, for example, the persons' functions during the event show consistent results, so we see no evidence suggesting bias in our findings. Nevertheless, the infection rate might be overestimated as the study was conducted 51 days after the event as participants could have become infected not related to the event. However, this weakness is limited by the official shut down of the community shortly after the event: a detailed timeline of the containment measures put in place after the superspreading event is included in Streeck et al. 5 Briefly, a strict home quarantine for all attendees of the carnival event was imposed after 38 out of 99 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, 13 days after the event, the town went into full lockdown, including the closing of schools, childcare and outpatient care facilities and restrictions of public access to the town. These concerted containment measures proved so effective that the peak of new infections in the community was already reached 27 days after the event.",

The association might, for example, be explained by a role of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). 19 Because other viruses, such as rabies virus, have been known to bind nAChRs, it was hypothesised recently that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might bind nAChRs as a coreceptor for infection. 20 21 Indeed, in silico molecular docking simulations predicted binding of spike to nAChRs. 22 If this interaction proves to be of advantage to the virus, then nicotine or its derivatives that bind nAChRs could compete with SARS-CoV-2 for binding and thereby reduce interactions of the virus with its target cells. Currently, at least one prospective observational study is being undertaken on the effects of smoking on COVID-19 infection rates, including a smoking cessation control group on nicotine substitutes. 23 While we strongly advise that smoking should not be considered as a protective habit to prevent risk of infection, this knowledge may lead to the investigation of a therapeutic or prophylactic treatment on the basis of this molecular target. 24 Our results indicate a trend that younger people are less likely to be infected compared with older age groups. This trend is strongest for people under 18 years but levels out over 40 years of age. The risk of infection for children in superspreading events has not been investigated, but the overall risk for infection in children seems to be lower than for adults as a systematic review and its recent update reported, which is further supported by our findings. 25 26 Considering the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in general, however, in a meta-analysis, Madewell et al 27 conclude that the secondary attack rate in households is lower to children contacts than to adult contacts. Many primary articles and meta-analyses point out the confounding effect of SARS-CoV-2 infections being mostly asymptomatic in young children has on the identification of children as index persons. To some extent, this problem could be avoided in our study since all participants of the event were invited to take part, regardless of age. As all individuals were exposed at the same event and time, our study is a very suitable model for the previously described notion that children are less likely to become infected. Indeed, a recently published meta-analysis by Viner et al showed a low susceptibility for children and adolescents (OR of 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.85)), which strongly supports our findings of a lower risk of infection in that age group, which is even lower in our study. 28 Our finding supports the previously shown minor influence on the spreading of the virus by children. The finding that for every 10 additional years of age the risk of infection increases during an event indicates that younger people and their limited role should be considered when measures to contain the pandemic are implemented. It should be mentioned that although children had similar exposure compared with adults and probably spent even less time outside the venue hall, the behaviours of children may be different compared with adults. Therefore, we cannot exclude that our findings of lower seroprevalence in children might be biased by factors very specific to this particular event. Taken together, we demonstrate important risk factors for infection during a superspreading event, which helps to understand transmission dynamics in order to improve comprehensive public health preparedness measures, including mandatory ventilation during indoor events and age-adjusted measures according to different risk of infection.",

Because of the time between the event and the study, it is possible that participants were infected unrelated to the event, but the official shut down of the community limits this risk. The number of index cases during the event is not known, and it is possible that a high number of individuals were already infectious. In addition, the identification of a past SARS-CoV-2 infection via serological test is not perfect, and according to the manufacturer, their IgG detection is 94.4% sensitive (on samples collected >10 days after beginning of symptoms or direct detection of virus) and 99.0% specific (for a ratio \u22650.8). For our infection rate analysis, this predicts 2 false positives and 10 false negative IgG results. However, when field tested by the UK National Health Service, the same assay showed 74.7% sensitivity (62 false-negatives in our data set) and the same specificity of 99.0%.",
