In countries most severely impacted by the disease, case fatality rates are thought to be as high as 15% (e.g., Belgium, 15.2%; 'Mortality Analyses', 2020). COVID-19 poses both a physical threat, due to its contagiousness, and a psychological threat through the fear it provokes (a phenomenon referred to as 'coupled contagion' by Epstein, 2020; Epstein et al., 2008) . Terror management theory (TMT; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 1986) , which offers predictions for how people behave in response to fear associated with mortality, helps shed light on this unprecedented existential threat. In this paper, we rely on an extension of TMT, the terror management health model (TMHM; Goldenberg & Arndt, 2008) , to investigate and make predictions about this pandemic, and provide recommendations for encouraging behaviour to slow the spread of COVID-19 and other potential pandemic diseases in the future.",

            "text": "Conscious death-thought activation Proximal defences function to remove the threat of mortality from consciousness, either through denial or through adaptive health behaviours (e.g., handwashing), to help reduce the spread of the virus. The model, consistent with other fear-appeal-based theories, suggests that adaptive responses can be facilitated with guidelines for easily actionable behaviours that mitigate risk, such as handwashing and PPEs. In contrast, recommendations for social distancing (i.e., maintaining physical distance from others and staying home; Cabinet Office, 2020; CDC, 2020a) can be difficult to accomplish effectively. Additionally, social distancing measures can have far-reaching implications for the manner in which a society can function. Thus, because not all proximal defences can be effectively accomplished nor sufficiently activated, motivations underlying behavioural responses to pandemic-based mortality threats must also consider cultural factors (i.e., distal defences) impacting behaviour, which we describe further using the TMHM for pandemics.",

First, death can become less salient as a result of proximal defences like suppression, denial, or handwashing. Death concerns then become non-conscious, due to perceptions that the threat has been sufficiently reduced (through denial/suppression [e.g., Arndt, Routledge, & Goldenberg, 2006] or through immediate action [e.g., Arndt, Schimel, & Goldenberg, 2003] ). However, a more direct path from initial pandemic communications to these distal defences can also be observed. For instance, the proximal defence pathway can be bypassed because COVID-19 itself is still associated with death, but is not immediately threatening (e.g., upon decreases in new cases, as in South Korea, China [Beaubien, 2020] , and Germany [McFall, 2020] ; or desensitization). This may also explain initial reactions to COVID-19 in places where the first cases of the disease were diagnosed later. Donald Trump initially characterized it as a 'Chinese virus' (Rogers, Jakes, & Swanson, 2020) , which can, in many ways, be considered a prototypical distal terror management defence that functioned through this direct path (i.e., out-group derogation). More generally, manifestations of prejudice against Chinese individuals observed at the start of the pandemic (Shen-Berro, 2020) also function as distal defences.",

These young people did not view the threat as personally relevant, and thus, conscious death thoughts were not likely activated, but they may have instead been clinging to identities contingent upon socialization and having fun.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak began, the world's financial markets saw one of the largest drops in history, and nearly all countries affected by the pandemic have experienced business closures, halts to manufacturing, and rampant unemployment (Jones, Brown, & Palumbo, 2020) . Some have expressed the opinion that the lives of the elderly and immunocompromised are worth sacrificing to save the economy. Conservative American radio host, Glenn Beck, stated he would 'rather die than kill the country, because it's not the economy that's dying, it's the country' (Mazza, 2020). This view may seem like a reversal of terror management, but evidence from Routledge and Arndt (2007) affirms the perception of dying for a cause as an effective distal defence, where mortality salience actually increases interest in selfsacrifice when it serves a purpose (i.e., dying for one's country). For those with conservative ideologies, protecting a capitalistic way of life, even at the expense of human life, can also be understood as a distal defence.",

Social distancing is a complex directive, with widespread consequences that impact some more than others. In addition to threatening the economic well-being of the country, these protestors see social isolation mandates as directly impinging on individual liberties. Freedom, and motivations to protect freedom, serves as a common distal defence, where reminders of mortality accompanied by feelings of restriction of personal choice provoke intense desire to defend personal liberties (i.e., where personal freedoms constitute a defendable worldview; see Pyszczynski, Motyl, & Abdollahi, 2009 ). Many protestors defy social distancing protocols, standing shoulder-to-shoulder on the steps of capitol buildings as a means of expressing how such mandates are oppressive (Rutz, 2020) . This defensiveness comes at a cost, where the defiance of social distancing protocols has led epidemiologists, like Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, to expect a new surge of COVID-19 cases as a result of these protests (Feigl-Ding, 2020).",

In contrast to handwashing, covering one's face is a public behaviour, and therefore, it may signal one's commitment to reduce the spread of the pandemic, and potentially become a basis of self-worth. Designer brands have zeroed in on these self-esteem contingencies by manufacturing patterned, colourful protective masks, so helping slow the spread makes statements about both health and fashion (Oerman & Bennett, 2020) . More and more, mask-wearing is becoming an expected behaviour, exemplified by celebrities with social power (Macke, 2020) , and thus more likely to be emulated. Likewise, to the extent that a worldview involving a commitment to social distancing becomes widely adopted, fraternizing with people in public may result in feelings of discomfort; in this case, individuals would avoid being in public because it is a worldview-threatening behaviour (e.g., Greenberg et al., 1995) . Moreover, public engagement in positive health-facilitating behaviours by those in positions of power (especially those leaders seen as charismatic; e.g., Cohen, Solomon, Maxfield, Pyszczynski, & Greenberg, 2004) should serve to encourage shifts in social norms and subsequently, worldviews. When mortality is salient and in-group members display certain, especially positive behaviours, others are more likely to follow suit (Jonas & Fritsche, 2012) .",

This may explain why some collectivist nations responded so quickly to this pandemic. South Korea and the United States confirmed their first cases of COVID-19 on the same day, but with vastly different public health responses. South Korea, in so many words, ignored the potential economic impact of shutting down large cities and did so almost immediately, and made testing free (with a doctor's referral) and aggressive (Moon, 2020) . According to the Hofstede Index (Hofstede, 2011; Hofstede et al., 2010) , Germany measures lower in individualism compared to other European countries like the United Kingdom. Germany has also been one of the most aggressive European nations in terms of COVID-19 testing and city-wide lockdown, and has reported one of the lowest case fatality rates in the region (Noack & Morris, 2020) . Thus, despite similarities in wealth and resources, countries with comparatively more collectivist ideologies (e.g., Germany versus the U.K.) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in a manner not only adaptive for individuals, but also adaptive for the collective.",

Therein lies an important recommendation for those working in public health in the time of a pandemic: Communications should be sufficiently threatening and provide straightforward behavioural solutions to mitigate individual risk, to decrease virus transmission on a larger scale. An effective public health communication might begin with a striking death reminder (like transmission or case fatality rates), and end with simple instructions for a behaviour proven to be effective, like washing your hands or correctly wearing PPEs (see Figure 2a) . But because people are generally effective at pushing death out of consciousness, either as a result of proximal defences or desensitization, interventions aimed at proximal defences, like our hypothetical communication, are not sufficient alone.",

During a deadly pandemic, people are especially likely to cling to their ideological and cultural beliefs. Unfortunately, in the U.K., United States, and other individualist cultures, many worldview strivings are antithetical to curbing a pandemic. In contrast, within collectivist countries, engaging in health-related behaviours to protect the well-being of others is likely seen as a social responsibility. It follows that public health communications and people in positions of social, economic, and governmental power need to adopt a collectivist, rather than individualist, agenda. One CDC commercial ends with the slogan of 'together we can slow the spread' (CDC, 2020c), which, from the perspective of the TMHM, constitutes a good step towards the collectivist direction.",

Thus, through the view of our model, an effective health communication should couple collective responsibility with a slightly more direct reference to COVID-19 (see Figure 2b ). In addition, we suggest that health behaviours should be imbued with ideological significance, and leadership should more openly encourage adaptive health behaviours, and display those behaviours themselves. To this end, wearing a face mask in public becomes, in and of itself, a worldview-bolstering action that encourages self-worth. The more these health behaviours are imbued with cultural significance, the more they will become effective distal, longitudinal defences against mortality threats. From the perspective of TMHM, public health messages that advocate a shift from individual to collective responsibility, and portray health behaviours as culturally valued, offer an informed prescription for affecting change, not only in the age of COVID-19, but during the next inevitable pandemic, too.",
