Protecting these employees is still one of the most important duties during this crisis, as they are essential to keeping global health care systems intact and functional [3] . As SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by droplet infection [4] , undiagnosed infections in medical staff members can lead to an uncontrolled person-to-person spread to other healthcare workers (HCW) and patients, causing a breakdown of the health care system [5] .",

            "text": "The major limitation of this study is its single-center design. Furthermore, the participation rate of 46.66% of all initially included participants in the follow-up is relatively low. This might be due the effects of shift work, holidays, or participants no longer working in the study center, as well as due to loss in the follow-up. Females are highly overrepresented in both groups, representing a common trend in health care workers [40] . As we refer to reported PCR positivity and not to results of a test performed within this study, false-positive results might skew our research findings. This could explain the low antibody level seen in some of the participants with positive PCR results. However, different studies describe a missing seroconversion in participants with no or few symptoms, as was mentioned above. Due to the low number of seroconverted participants within this 6-month follow-up, this study has too low a power for it to detect the characteristics of seroconverted participants and encourage such a seroconversion. The only possibility for grouping the participants is according to their profession and not their working area, as a large number of employees work in multiple areas of the hospital (in both high-and low-risk areas). This limitation may be compounded by the fact that in the study center there were no completely separated pathways for possible COVID-19 patients. Additional testing for other antibodies such as IgM and IgA was not performed in this study in order to retain its comparability with the initial phase of this trial. Such additional testing might provide further information, particularly about recent infections or seronegative participants with reported PCR positivity. The use of additional tests, such as for the cellular immune response, might be useful in further studies.",
