We examined left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular longitudinal strain in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and assessed the correlation with exercise capacity. Methods and results: One hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients with history of COVID-19 disease who had been referred to rest or stress echocardiography because of symptoms, mainly dyspnea and chest pain, were included in the study. These patients were compared to 106 patients with similar age, symptoms, and risk factor profile with no history of COVID-19 disease. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters, including strain imaging, were assessed. The patient's age was 48 \u00b1 12 years. Twenty-two patients had undergone severe disease. There were no differences in the LV ejection fraction and diastolic function between the groups. However, LV and RV global and free wall strain were significantly lower (in absolute numbers) in patients who had recovered form COVID-19 infection (\u221220.41 \u00b1 2.32 vs \u221219.39 \u00b1 3.36, p = 0.001, \u221223.69 \u00b1 3.44 vs \u221222.09 \u00b1 4.20, p = 0.001 and \u221227.24 \u00b1 4.7 vs \u221225.43 \u00b1 4.93, p = 0.021, respectively). Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) < \u221220% was present in only 37% of post COVID-19 patients. Sixty-four patients performed exercise echocardiography. Patients with GLS < \u221220% had higher exercise capacity with higher peak metabolic equivalent and exercise time compared to patients with GLS \u2265 \u221220% (12.6 \u00b1 2 vs 10 \u00b1 2.5 METss and 8:00 \u00b1 2:08 vs 6:24 \u00b1 2:03 min, p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Conclusion: In patients, who had recovered from COVID-19 infection, both LV and RV strain are significantly lower compared to control patients. The exercise capacity of these patients correlates with LV strain values. Rest and stress echocardiography in patients with symptoms after COVID-19 infection may identify patients that need further follow up to avoid long term complications of the disease. These preliminary results warrant further research, to test the natural history of these findings and the need and timing of treatment.",

Global endocardial right ventricular strain and free wall strain (FWRVS) was analyzed using the same software. If more than 2 segments were inadequately tracked, we excluded the data because the images were unsuitable for speckletracking analysis. The cut-off values used for LV strain were based on a WASE normal values study, however we also used higher absolute values, since we wanted to see the small change in GLS and the relation to exercise [12] . The RV and FWRVS cut-off values were based on the study by Muraru et al. [13] . GLS and RV strains are usually negative numbers.

Subsequently, longitudinal strain of all 18 LV segments was averaged to assess the GLS [11] . Global endocardial right ventricular strain and free wall strain (FWRVS) was analyzed using the same software. If more than 2 segments were inadequately tracked, we excluded the data because the images were unsuitable for speckletracking analysis. The cut-off values used for LV strain were based on a WASE normal values study, however we also used higher absolute values, since we wanted to see the small change in GLS and the relation to exercise [12] . The RV and FWRVS cut-off values were based on the study by Muraru et al. [13] . GLS and RV strains are usually negative numbers. However, we used absolute values: higher strain = higher absolute number (more negative) and lower strain = lower absolute number (less negative)",

Since there are different strain analysis software and also variability in strain values we used a large cohort of patients and controls and compared the values between the groups. Ozer et al. assessed GLS by echocardiography in 74 patients one month after COVID-19 infection, 28 of them had evidence of myocardial injury during acute illness. The strain analysis was done by different software. The LV-GLS was abnormal in 37.8% of patients [31] , the rate was higher in patients with myocardial injury. The patients in this study were older with higher rate of risk factors. In addition, the age was higher and risk factors were more frequent in patients with history of myocardial injury. Although we did not find a difference in strain values between patients with severe disease and non-severe disease, we did see a more prominent strain value difference in patients of older age. In addition, the study by Ozer et al. was done a month after acute disease and as part of a routine follow-up and not symptom driven. Recently, two important reports by Lassen et al. and Baruch et al. showed no significant improvement in LV GLS in patients after COVID-19, moreover, in some patients there was a deterioration in LV GLS [32, 33] . The mechanism for acute and persisting subclinical LV dysfunction is unknown, however MRI findings suggest adverse remodeling after myocarditis that may be detected by strain imaging. Another possible mechanism is endothelial and vascular dysfunction that causes subclinical LV function impairment that persists after acute COVID 19 [34] .",

The patients were older with higher rate of risk factors, compared to patients in our study. The RV function was normal, however, the RV strain values were lower compared to our results. The RV strain values in the study by Nazzi et al. were lower compared to other studies assessing RV strain during acute COVID-19 illness [27] , showing the variability in the values. In a recent study by Hayama et al., bi ventricular strain assessment was performed in patients recovered from COVID-19. The study population was very similar to patients in our study regarding patients' age, acute illness severity, and time from disease to study. Their study investigated strain values based on troponin level. We did not assess troponin levels but the findings of abnormal myocardial deformation in patients recovered from COVID-19 is in line with this and the other studies. The findings suggest a myocardial injury may persist after the COVID-19 infection. We and others assessed longitudinal strain only, which may be less sensitive to assess myocardial injury in epicardial layers as seen in myocarditis; however, it is more accurate and reproducible compared to radial or circumferential strain. In addition, studies in myocarditis suggest impairment in longitudinal strain even when the inflammatory process is sub-epicardial [36, 37] .",

To the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed this relation in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection. Raman et al. assessed prospectively the medium-term effect of COVID-19 infection on various organs and exercise capacity [38] . They found that 2-3 months after hospital discharge a significant proportion of patients reported breathlessness, fatigue, depression, and had limited exercise capacity. Twenty six percent of patients had cardiac MRI abnormalities and there was a correlation between native T1 and inflammatory biomarkers. The exercise capacity was lower in patients post COVID, including lower peak oxygen uptake and the capacity was worse in patients with pulmonary abnormalities. There was a correlation between six-minute walk distance and inflammatory markers. Baratto et al. assessed exercise pathophysiology in 18 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, before discharge [39] . They found significantly reduced function capacity in these patients; however, this limitation was mainly related to peripheral factors such as anemia and oxygen extraction. The patients had elevated cardiac output that the authors related to an inflammatory condition. Approximately one third of the patients included, after excluding patients with low LVEF and other cardiac abnormalities, had abnormal LV and RV strain. Muscle deconditioning was a significant factor in exercise capacity in patients with severe disease that had been inactive for a period of time [40] . The patients in our study performed the exercise study at least two months after recovery and the majority had mild disease. The patients did not have deconditioning. The assessed stroke volume did not differ from patients without COVID-19. We found an independent correlation of exercise capacity with LV volume and LV strain. Both factors have been shown to be correlated with exercise capacity [41] [42] [43] .",
