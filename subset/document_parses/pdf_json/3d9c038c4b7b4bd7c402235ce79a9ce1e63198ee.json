Studies have shown that the incidence can be as high as 43-50% (5, 6) . Lower extremity DVT not only causes swelling, localized pain, and varicose veins of the affected limb, but it may also lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), for which it is the primary cause. According to literature reports in the past 10 years, PE is a leading cause of death in neurointensive care unit patients, with a mortality rate between 9 and 50% (4). Therefore, early assessment and prophylaxis should be administered to reduce its occurrence and subsequent mortality. The nomogram model can integrate relevant risk factors and individually predict the risk of adverse clinical events. It has been widely used in medical treatments, especially in clinical predictive models (7) . Despite the risks of DVT and subsequent PE, there is still no nomogram model to predict the occurrence of lower extremity DVT in neurointensive care units. In this prospective study, we focused on neurointensive care unit patients and established a reliable prognostic nomogram for providing a reference to identify the patients at high-risk of developing lower extremity DVT early.",

The Mann-Whitney U-test and chi-square test were used to assess continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The following statistical analysis only included variables with a P < 0.05. Logistic regression analysis was then conducted to determine the independent predictors for lower extremity DVT, and backward and forward stepwise regressions were performed to select the best model. Subsequently, according to the results of logistic regression, the nomogram was formulated in R software 4.0.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted and area under the ROC curve (AUC) was determined to evaluate the discrimination of the nomogram. The Brier score and calibration curve with bootstraps of 1,000 resamples were used to evaluate the calibration of the nomogram model. The decision curve analysis was plotted to measure the clinical benefit of the nomogram. A two-sided test was used, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Points were assigned for age, D-dimer level, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, muscle strength, and infection. The total score obtained by adding up the scores of all individual variables is used to find the appropriate position on the \"Risk of DVT\" axis to determine the patient's individual risk of lower extremity DVT. A simple example analysis: A 50-year-old patient (\u223c45 points) has a GCS score of 8 (20 points) and muscle strength of 3 grade (22 points) when admitted to the neurointensive care unit. After laboratory tests, his blood D-dimer level was 10 \u00b5g/mL (10 points) after the third day of surgery, and he had no infection (0 points) when he was admitted to the neurointensive care unit. The total score for this patient was 97 points. According to the nomogram, the risk of lower extremity DVT in this patient is \u223c36%. category, GCS score, APACHE II score, Caprini score, days of stay, D-dimer level, muscle strength, hypertension, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and infection. Based on these variables, the dichotomous logistic regression analysis was then performed. The results showed that age, GCS score, D-dimer level, muscle strength, and infection were independent risk factors in patients who developed lower extremity DVT ( Table 3) .",

Therefore, it will be more meaningful to explore the optimal prophylaxis and treatment protocols for DVT in combination with the above risk factors in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, several risk factors reported by previous studies were not involved in this study, such as malignant tumor (1, 2), application of dehydration drugs (2) , and femoral CVC (in this study, we did not distinguish the superior vena cava catheter from the femoral CVC, which may have led to the femoral CVC being identified as a non-significant variable) (13, 25) . Lastly, although we found that age and D-dimer level were independent risk factors for DVT, we did not further explore the age and D-dimer thresholds that could indicate lower extremity DVT in neurointensive care unit patients.
