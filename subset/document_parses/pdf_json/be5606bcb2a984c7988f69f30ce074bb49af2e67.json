Accurate knowledge of their structure is central to understanding their antigen binding function. The key area for antigen binding and the main area of structural variation in antibodies is concentrated in the six complementarity determining regions (CDRs), with the most important for binding and most variable being the CDR-H3 loop. The sequence and structural variability of CDR-H3 make it particularly challenging to model. Recently deep learning methods have offered a step change in our ability to predict protein structures. In this work we present ABlooper, an end-to-end equivariant deep-learning based CDR loop structure prediction tool. ABlooper rapidly predicts the structure of CDR loops with high accuracy and provides a confidence estimate for each of its predictions. On the models of the Rosetta Antibody Benchmark, ABlooper makes predictions with an average CDR-H3 RMSD of 2.45\u00c5, which drops to 2.02\u00c5 when considering only its 76% most confident predictions.",

In the case of proteins, using a network equivariant to both translations and rotations in 3D space allows us to learn directly from atom coordinates. This is in contrast to previous methods like TrRosetta [11] or the original version of AlphaFold [12] that predict invariant features, such as inter-residue distances and orientations which are then used to reconstruct the protein.

If all five models agree on the same conformation, then it is more likely that it will be the correct conformation, if they do not, then the final prediction is likely to be less accurate ( Figure 1 ). This allows ABlooper to give a confidence score for each predicted loop. As shown in Figure 1D , this score can be used as a filter, removing structures which are expected to be incorrectly modelled by ABlooper. For example, by setting a 1.5\u00c5 inter-prediction RMSD cut-off on structures from the Rosetta Antibody Benchmark, the average CDR-H3 RMSD for the set can be reduced from 2.45\u00c5 to 2.02\u00c5 while keeping 76% of predictions. As expected, accuracy filtering has a tendency to remove longer CDR-H3 predictions but it is not exclusively correlated to length (see SI).",
