Liner transportation is a service of transporting goods, mostly containerized goods (containers), by ships with regular routes and fixed schedules. In contrast, ships involved in charter transportation do not have pre-established sailing routes and schedules as well as ports of call. This study aims to analyze the optimal order quantity of container slots within the context of liner shipping.",

However, one problem in the booking process is that the actual demand is uncertain, resulting in mismatch between the required demand and the booked quantity. To address this issue, this study develops a Newsvendor model to find the optimal order quantity of container slots for the shipper. In addition, uncertainties in the quantity of container slots booking made by the shipper might cause revenue loss to the carrier and low utilization of ship capacity in the daily operations of liner shipping services. Therefore, this study suggests that the shipper should pay reservation fee when booking container slots. This study also aims to find the maximum profit for the carrier under the optimal order quantity of the shipper. In sensitive analysis, how different prices per container slot offered by the carrier would influence the reservation fee, the optimal order quantity of the shipper, and the expected profit of the carrier are explored and discussed. This study can help to manage and promote the online container booking systems in the liner shipping industry.",

For example, China has successfully used e-commerce in shipping and trade services to reduce delivery time (Panova et al. 2019) . A series of shipping e-commerce platforms have also emerged in the shipping market. For example, Maersk launched its online ordering channel of container slots called Maersk Spot. More than 3000 shippers ordered slots on Maersk Spot, and the ordered quantity increased from over 50,000 forty-foot-equivalent units (FEUs) in the second quarter of 2019 (Wagner 2019) to 300,000 FEU in the fourth quarter of 2019 (Johnson 2020) . Moreover, the \"Internet + shipping\" provides a new way to book container slots online, where liner shipping companies are trying to explore online sales channels to sell container slots (Lam and Zhang 2019) . The development of 5G networks is expected to further enhance the efficiency of e-commerce platforms. In the liner shipping industry, e-commerce enables the traditional paper-based booking system to evolve into a more advanced online booking system. Two advantages can be offered by e-commerce platforms. First, shippers can efficiently access the newest available container slot information via the internet and make container booking plans according to their needs. Second, liner companies are able to obtain the up-to-date container reservation information and make corresponding adjustments in time. Thus, booking container slots online is beneficial to both shippers and carriers.",

One stream is focused on slot allocation, which is related to inventory control in revenue management. For example, Pei et al. (2007) developed a slot allocation model and proposed a method to calculate the allocation of containers according to different characteristics of ports and ships. Mao and Shen (2016) proposed a probability scheme-based slot allocation model for vehicular networks. Feng and Xiao (2006) developed a comprehensive decision support model to integrate decisions on pricing and allocation of container slots' capacity. They found that the optimal decision was influenced by price, and strength of demand. Peng et al. (2017) proposed hybrid scheduling mechanisms that integrated the advantages of both distributed and centralized scheduling mechanisms. Atmayudha et al. (2021) stated that optimization is to select the best option of the type of ships (e.g., diesel or LNG) that carry crude oil to the refinery unit in each scenario. Lee et al. (2007) claimed that selling slots to the right customer with the right price at the right time could generate the maximum benefit for a liner company. Feng and Chang (2010) formulated a mathematical programming model to maximize the operational profit of slot allocation for ocean carriers, subject to constraints of vessel capacity, container demand, and empty container supply. Guo et al. (2018) established a stochastic allocation model considering the multiple dimensions of container type, size, deadweight tonnage, and capacity. This model was then combined with long-term contractual customer booking requirements and the randomness of supply and demand.",

Nevertheless, shippers book container slots based on the estimated demand in most cases, causing a possible mismatch between the actual and estimated container demands. As a result, shippers must cancel some or book more slots from the shipping market at a higher price. Therefore, another stream of container slot research is focused on the overbooking of container slots and analyzes the problem of container slot cancellation. For example, Wang et al. (2007) calculated the maximum expected profit and focused on the problem of overbooking in liner shipping. Later, Wang and Meng (2019) proposed three different forecasting models, i.e., a piecewise linear regression model, an autoregressive model, and an artificial neural network model, to predict the canceled quantities of container slots by mining container slot booking patterns from historical booking data. Unfortunately, due to the lack of real-time data, the up-to-date characteristics and patterns of container slot booking cancellation given the current shipping market conditions remain unclear. Schinas and Bergmann (2021) proved that Market-Based Measures could be supported in international shipping under their findings of taxonomy. Zhao et al. (2019) proposed a conceptual model to analyze container slot cancellation in intercontinental shipping services between Asia and the US West Coast. Zhao et. al. (2020) further considered the primary factors influencing container slot cancellation to estimate the cancellation probability in long-haul transport in liner shipping services.",

The newsvendor or newsboy problem, also called a single-period inventory management problem, is an inventory management model that seeks to identify an optimal order quantity to maximize the expected profit in a period (Khouja 1999; Qin et al. 2011 ). The key insights stemming from the analysis of this newsvendor problem have a broad range of application in managing inventory decisions in many industries, such as hospitality, airline, and fashion goods. Therefore, this study applies the newsvendor model to determine the optimal order quantity of container slots for a shipper.",

The shipper's booking demand is assumed to be stochastic and characterized by a random variable x with the probability density function as f (x) and the cumulative distribution function as F (x) . The carrier is assumed to operate with sufficient capacity and no capacity restrictions and zero lead time of supply. Therefore, the order placed by the shipper from the carrier at the beginning of a period is immediately fulfilled. The sales of the container slots occur during or at the end of a period. Thus, the actual cost at the end of the period for the shipper is As the demand is not realized at the beginning of the period, the shipper cannot observe the actual cost. Hence, a normal approach to analyzing the problem is to allow the shipper to make the optimal decision on ordering quantity at the beginning of the period to maximize the carrier's expected total profit.

Sensitivity analysis aims to find out sensitive factors (e.g., the price of container slots offered by the carrier, and the market price of container slots) that have an important impact on the indicators (e.g., the optimal booking quantity for the shipper and the expected profit for the carrier), and then analyze and calculate the degree of influence on the indicators in the problem setting by changing the value of sensitive factors. Therefore, people can judge the risk tolerance of the problem from the results of sensitive analysis. One main shortcoming of sensitive analysis is that it cannot automatically determine the proper range of an uncertainty factor so as to consider the full range of uncertain situations and the probability of change within this range. Consequently, certain risks might be caused to the shipper and the carrier in our problem.",

We first propose a newsvendor problem to find the optimal order quantity of container slots for the shipper. We then calculate the carrier's maximum profit under the shipper's optimal order quantity of container slots. However, most parameters we consider fluctuate in practice. Hence, we assume that the market price is fixed and then discuss its impact on the reservation fee, the optimal order quantity, and the expected profit by increasing the price of one container slot offered by the carrier. This study can help to manage and promote the online container booking systems in the liner shipping industry. Future studies will focus on the following aspects. First, this paper assumes that the carrier has sufficient capacity. However, there are many factors, e.g., the COVID-19, affecting the capacity of the carrier in actual liner shipping services. As a result, the capacity of container slots might be insufficient, which yields two cases of container slot booking for the shipper, i.e., the booked container slots of the shipper are either equal to or less than the carrier's capacity. Furthermore, as affected by market factors, the actual demand is uncertain. Under this situation, finding the optimal order quantity of container slots while not exceeding the carrier's capacity is of highly significance for the shipper. Hence, future research can consider the optimal order quantity of the shipper under insufficient capacity of container slots.",

In the first case, all container slots in the capacity have been booked by those shippers. In the second case, there is surplus of the carrier's capacity.
