Choreiform and athetoid movements have also been described.

On the other hand, the patient had been taking pantoprazole for at least 10 years. The chronic use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was hypothesised as a possible cause of hypomagnesaemia. The association PPI-hypomagnesaemia was first described in 2006 and afterwards several papers have highlighted this relationship. The postulated mechanism seems to be due to impaired absorption of magnesium caused by PPI-induced inhibition of TRPM6 and TRPM7 channels on the intestinal epithelial membrane [4] .",
