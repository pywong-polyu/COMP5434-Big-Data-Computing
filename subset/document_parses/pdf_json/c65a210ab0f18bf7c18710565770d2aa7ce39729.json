Together with two earlier epidemics including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [1] , SARS-CoV-2 is the 3rd extremely infectious and transmissible human coronavirus, which sprouted in the past twenty years. Due to the rapid emergence and an alarming number of infections and mortalities by this novel coronavirus, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a worldwide pandemic. Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred across the wider community, hospitals, and family settings [2**-4] . Therefore, it is supremely important to limit any further spread in healthcare and public environments. Near touch, viral bio-aerosols, respiratory fomites or droplets, and self-inoculation of the mouth, nose or eye, are postulated for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 to contaminated surfaces or objects [5] [6] [7] . However, many controversial aspects of airborne spreading and coronavirus infection on inanimate surfaces remain (Table 1 ) [5] . This study, therefore, aims to provide information on SARS-CoV-2 in different inanimate areas and habitats, persistence, potential dissemination, and infectivity.",

In conditions of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, COVID-19 infected people will sneeze, cough, or even speak to SARS-CoV-2. Transmission by air can occur in close contact with COVID-19 patients of approximately <1 m. Thus, the likelihood of airflowing SARS-CoV-2 is a worrying public concern [8] . In Singapore, Ong et al. [9] collected surface and air samples, before and after the routine cleaning practice, from the patient's (infected with COVID-19) bedrooms. Until cleaning, around 87% of 15 room sites (including fans of the aerial outlet) and 60% of 5 toilet sites (door handle, drain, and toilet bowl) have been identified positive. The collected data signifying that the environment has been heavily polluted. More specifically, the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 into stools can act as a prospective viral transmission path. Corridor and anteroom samples were recorded negative. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results from two stool specimens of one COVID-19 infected patient without diarrhea and/or pneumonia were also positive. The negative results of post-cleaning samples raise the possibility that current sanitization and decontamination strategies were adequate. Despite the high environmental contamination, all the air collected samples were tested negative. However, positive results of swabs collected from the air exhaust outlets suggest that virus-carrying bio-aerosols may be evacuated by airflows resulting in the deposition on equipment like vents. Jiang et al. [10] investigated 158 viral samples (130 surface and 28 air samples) from isolation wards, nurse stations, and intensive care units guiding service, and outpatient fever clinics by using RT-PCR. Tests show that only one surface sample from nurseries was detected as positive for SARS-CoV-2 and one air sample from intensive care units. Tracheal intubation among health workers was intensively related to the highest risk of SARS-CoV transmission [11] . In many hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a persistence shedding of the virus was observed from the nasopharynx, which was continued to 7 d or for extended periods. The virus has also been detected in the blood (1/12, 8%) and stool (4/8, 50%) and stool (4/8, 50%) of patients by using RT-PCR analysis [12] . Inevitable environmental contamination by SARS-CoV dispersion via respiratory droplets and fecal shedding highlighted the environment as a potential transmission medium and thus necessitate the importance of strict adherence to environmental and hand cleanliness to combat vial contamination [9, 12] .",

According to a recent study, Coronavirus could survive up to 14 d in dechlorinated tap water or domestic sewage at 4 C, 2 d in tap water at 20 C and 14 d in BPS at 20 C [8,13*]]. A SARS pharyngeal swab was isolated from the P9 SARS-CoV strain. SARS-CoV can persist in the urine for at least 96 h and 72 h under testing conditions in plasma, diluted sputum, and feces. SARS-CoV P9 infection continued at room temperature for 60 h then decreased subsequently in 72 h and became virtually invisible after 120 h. However, it remained persistent at 4 C, 20 C and 37 C with cell infection for at least 2 h. Sarg-CoV conditions for non-infection should be 90 min for 56 C, 67 C for 60 min and 75 C for 30 min [14] , to prevent infection with the SARS-CoV. At 25 C, a 99% reduction in reagent water grade was required in 22 d for a transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and 57 d for a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In decontaminated settled sewage, a shorter time (9 d for TGEV and 7 d for MHV) was necessary to decrease 99%. Such facts show that polluted water is a likely source of human exposure [8] . Various earlier reports have demonstrated that the survival and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater profoundly depends on the wastewater characteristics [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Possible SARS-CoV-2 routes to water supplies/streams are schematically shown in Fig. 1 .",

BCoV-88 infectivity declined more rapidly at 10% of bovine fecal suspension than at least a vital FBS suspension of 2%, although the reason was not clear. In bovine intestines and bovine fecal suspensions, bovine enzymes such as proteases or lipases are abundant, cleavage vulnerable virion surface spike glycoproteins, and lipase-sensitive cover [5] . The absence of a responsive protein kinase spike on the surface of the virus or damage of a virus envelope can transmit Bovine coronavirus strain infections.

Low temperature, high inoculation, and sufficient humidity are related to longer longevity for most viruses. The climate change role in air virus survival can be more challenging and substantial. Relative humidity has a notable impact on the virus's survival time and the association between humidity and temperature inactivation was not tedium [21] . The temperature has a greater impact on the survival of the virus than that of humidity level. The titer of the transmittable virus decreases swiftly at 25 C as compared to at 4 C in all water forms evaluated (i.e. reactant-grade soil, lake water, and settled sewage). The extreme heat of >95% at 28 C or 33 C did not expressively disturb SARS CoV HKU 39849 infectivity. An increase in the temperature to 38 C is not conducive to the virus, where there is a gradual loss of viability at 38 C and an Hour >95%. Owing to high temperatures (e.g., 30-40 C), the long-life of extremely pathogenic MERS-CoV, TGEV, and MHV has reduced. The survival of low inoculate SARS-CoV was extended [22] . HCoV-229E at room temperature persists longer at relative humidity (RH) 50% than at RH 30%. Airborne survival HuCoV 229E has been tested under different temperature changes and HR climates. The best survival for Aerosolized HuCoV-229E was with a half-life of 67.33 AE 8.24 h at 20 C and 50% RH, with a virus detectable at nearly 20% infectious at 6 d, while a half-life of 30% RH was 26.76 h. Half-life at a high 80% HR was just around 3 h, and no virus could be found in aerosols after 24 h. HuCoV-229E's survival at 6 C was considerably improved in either 50% or 30% RH conditions and the decay pattern was basically comparable to the scene at 20 C [8] . However, the half-life of HuCoV 229E increased to 86.01 h at 6 C, 80% RH, closely 30 times that of 80% RH and 20 C [8].",

Under numbering the paper money, paper records, and mailwrapping papers during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is a significant problem for people familiar with suck records in their daily jobs [8] . After returning home from hospitals, the healthcare-related people might carry fomites containing SARS-CoV-2 through their cotton clothes or impervious gowns. On inanimate surfaces, human coronavirus strain 229E has been reported to remain contagious at room temperature from 2 h to 9 d on many various kinds of resources [23] . At a temperature of 21 C and relative humidity of 30-40%, HuCoV-229E remained infective for at least 5 d on glass, ceramic tiles, polyvinyl chloride, stainless steel, and poly flu or tetraethylene, whereas persisted for 3 d on silicon rubber. However, this virus survived 1 h or less following drying on sterile cotton gauze, aluminum, and sterile latex gloves at room temperature for 3 h with unnoticeable infectivity [24] . Persistence of fomites or droplets on disposable gloves or gown may present a contamination risk to the environment. Mostly during the 2003 SARS outbreak, the SARS-CoV strain GVU6109 infection, obtained from the lungs of an infected person with SARS, died within 5 min after drying in cotton or paper at ambient temperature [25] . Likewise, no viral contamination was detected within 5 min when a piece of paper with an elevated concentration of viral suspension was dried at room temperature. Thus, the possibility of risk infection by exposure to the droplet-laden paper is comparatively little, and hand sanitization and washing after touching contaminated materials are proven effective against the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

Low levels of this pathogenic virus in environmental samples warrants the development of highly sensitive technologies for accurate detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, COVID-19 is likely to become a seasonal infectious disease. In order to determine the survival, existence, and behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental matrices, the development of an automatic and high throughput strategy is of great importance. Meanwhile, to reduce the chance of infection, it is noteworthy to execute large-scale disinfectant treatment of COVID-19 in all kinds of environmental compartments. A sustainable and strong international data sharing and the collaborative network is needed to limit the spread and threat of novel COVID-19 infectious diseases. In this context, apart from knowledge proficiency and expertise in the fields of public health, and medicine, the dedicated involvement of environmental engineers would be prolific to combat the threat of this infectious disease globally.",

The infection rate of baculovirus in Sf9 cell lines and SARS-CoV in Vero cells was significantly reduced to an undetectable level. The hamster's prion protein expression was dropped down to only 21.8% in the recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells within a contact time of 5 min and was vanished after exposure to a period of 20 min. It was observed that contact with Cu/Al 2 O 3 and Ag/Al2O 3 surfaces for 5-20 min could inhibit the baculo virus, SARS-CoV, and E's proliferation and replication capabilities.",
