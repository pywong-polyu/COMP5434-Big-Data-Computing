Recent examples include outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus in African countries and the pandemic caused by the 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). There are efforts to develop vaccines for diseases caused by Ebola virus, Marburg virus, MERS-CoV, Lassa, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2. However, many of these viruses are subject to export controls (Table 1) based on a determination by the Australia Group [1], which is an informal forum of more than 40 countries ( Table 2 ) which seeks to ensure that exports do not contribute to the development of chemical or biological weapons. As a consequence of Australia Group's recommendations, viral vaccines containing genes or partial sequences of any listed microorganism (Table 1 ) are subject to export regulations, which have a significant impact on the ability to manufacture and ship vaccines to individuals in countries that need it during times of disease outbreaks. There is an urgent need to revisit the intent of the original Australia Group lists and the resulting country-specific laws that have been enacted. Exceptions for vaccines are immediately needed.",

Exports include sending virus construct samples or technology to testing labs in a foreign country, sending virus construct samples or technology to regulatory agencies and non-citizens working on the controlled samples or technology (this includes employees of the US-based company who are based in locations outside the US, or foreign nationals working in the US). Re-exports to a third country or in-country transfer to a separate consignee require additional export licenses. End-user certification, along with import certificates and delivery verification, are needed in some cases. Export licenses add time and cost to vaccine development. In the US, licenses take 30-45 days to obtain from BIS and in Germany, each export license takes 30 days to obtain from BAFA. In the US, the cost of legal fees to prepare license applications range between $5,000 to $10,000, and in Germany legal support can also incur fees of \u20ac3,000 to \u20ac8,000. If export licenses are not prepared properly and physical items or technology is provided to parties without authorization, enforcement actions from both authorities begin with monetary fines and can result in additional restrictions on exports, even for goods not subject to export controls.",

In a global company, research and development, along with manufacturing activities are often distributed to multiple locations to leverage expertise, resources, and capacity.

Out of the 210 COVID-19 vaccines in development [6] , Australia Group's regulations impact 9 vaccines that are based on live virus vectors (such as VSV, Yellow Fever Virus, Rabies Virus and Newcastle Disease Virus). While SARS-CoV-2 is not yet on the Australia Group list, a closely related virus, SARS, is on the list. If SARS-CoV-2 is added to the Australia Group list, it will impact all 210 COVID-19 vaccine in development because these vaccines contain nucleic acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2, such as the nucleic acids encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.",
