            "text": "Recently, Yoshida and Turnbull (2021) have reconsidered the problem of voluntary provision of offsets in a general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition, where environmental degradation is caused by individuals' consumption of differentiated goods produced by monopolistic firms with market power. 3 They have explored how an increase in the population size affects environmental quality, offsets, and net contributions, and have shown that while the comparative static results depend on the specification of the utility function, the offsets are independent of this specification in a large economy with many individuals and \"carbon neutrality\" holds: net contributions are zero. Will the same results hold when environmental degradation is caused by production externalities? The purpose of this paper is to examine this problem in a monopolistically competitive model similar to the Yoshida-Turnbull model. Shibata (1998) assumes that an income-earning activity of each individual causes environmental degradation but he can use two methods to offset the degradation. The first is to reduce his earning activity by increasing leisure which is a non-polluting activity. The second is to expend income on purchase of an environmental good and his own abatement activity. The effectiveness of these methods depends on whether labor supply is institutionally constrained or not. When labor supply is constrained, offsets via leisure and the abatement activity are not available, because pollutants have been already emitted in the environment. Thus, the only effective method is to buy the environmental good. On the other hand, when labor is not constrained, the method of purchasing the environmental good is inefficient compared to increasing leisure or the abatement activity, because the marginal cost of removing a unit of pollutant already emitted is larger than that of reducing emission of a unit of pollutant. Since the abatement activity has no positive utility, it is inferior to leisure. Therefore, the only efficient method is to adjust the scale of earning activity by leisure. Such individual reductions in productive activity to achieve social goals have come into prominence during the COVID pandemic recently as businesses, consumers, and workers have been asked to reduce activities that involve gathering in high-density space such as offices. One response to that is remote work, which managements complain makes supervision harder and leads to decreased productivity. We note that remote work has been recommended for decades as an environmentally friendly alternative to commuting as well.",

We conduct the analysis based on the Yoshida-Turnbull (2021) social demand and supply approach giving environmental quality as functions of the number of monopolistically competitive firms. The social demand function is derived from individuals' demand functions for environmental quality and the social supply function shows the feasible level of environmental quality. Environmental quality and the number of the firms which simultaneously satisfy the social demand and supply functions are their equilibrium levels. In order to examine the existence and uniqueness of an interior equilibrium, where offsets are positive, we specify the utility function consisting of environmental quality and differentiated goods as follows: (i) the CES utility function, which includes the Cobb-Douglas (CD) utility function, (ii) the Krugman (1980 )-Pecorino (2009 (KP) utility function, and (iii) the Krugman (1981)-Mondal (2013) (KM) utility function. After demonstrating that for each utility function, there is a unique equilibrium solution such that environmental quality and the number of the firms are positive, we examine the comparative static effects of the population size on the environmental variables: environmental quality, offsets, and net contributions, and compare the results with those in the Yoshida-Turnbull model with consumption externalities.",

Irrespective of the level of environmental externalities, an increase in the population size decreases the social demand for environmental quality. However, the effect on the social supply depends on the type of externalities. With production externalities, when labor supply is endogenous (exogenous), since pollutants emitted are perfectly (imperfectly) cancelled by an increase in the aggregate offset, the increase in the population size does not affect (decreases) the social supply of environmental quality. Thus, environmental quality is decreasing in the population size, but offsets and net contributions are increasing in it. These results are independent of the specification of the utility function. On the other hand, with consumption externalities, the results are affected by this specification. In the KP case, since the equilibrium level of environmental quality is determined by the social demand function, it is decreasing in the population size. However, in the CES and KM cases, an increase in the population size increases the social supply of environmental quality. Thus, if the equilibrium level of environmental quality is greater (smaller) than its ambient level, then environmental quality is increasing (decreasing) in the population size.",

Section 2 develops a model of environmental offsets with production externalities. Section 3 characterizes an equilibrium solution and specifies several utility functions.

It follows from y j = 0 and f j = 0 that g j = \u2212 (1 \u2212 h j ) < 0 and e j = h j < . Eliminating h j from (4), then we can represent the utility maximization problem as where m j =\u1e20 + G \u2212j . Since the budget constraint in (5) does not involve leisure h j , the optimal demand G d j of environmental quality is represented as G d j = d( P C , m j ) . It should be now noted that the optimal level of leisure is not derived from the utility maximization problem (5). Its level is determined by the equilibrium level of environmental quality in this model (see Section 3).",

Although an increase in the population size decreases the social demand of environmental quality, the effect on the social supply depends on the type of externality. With production externalities, when labor supply is endogenous (exogenous), since the pollutants emitted are perfectly (imperfectly) cancelled by a rise in the aggregate offset, the increase in the population size does not affect (decreases) the feasible level of environmental quality. Thus, the equilibrium level of environmental quality is decreasing in the population size in all cases (Proposition 1-(a)). With consumption externalities, the same result holds in the KP case. However, in the CES and KM cases, since the increase in the population size increases the feasible level of environmental quality, the equilibrium level of environmental quality is affected by the social demand and supply functions. The results depend on whether the equilibrium level of environmental quality is greater than its ambient level: if G * > (<)\u1e20 , then G * L > (<)0 (Result 1-(a)). Next, compare the effects on offsets and net contributions. With production externalities, an increase in the population size increases these offsets by a decrease in the composite good's demand by each individual (Proposition 1-(b) ). With consumption externalities, since it follows from (24) and (25) that e * L =qp \u22121 g * L , e * L and g * L have the same signs.

Irrespective of the source of environmental externalities, the carbon neutrality theorem holds, but offsets in the large economy depend on whether the source of the externalies is consumption or production. With production externalities, whether labor supply is constrained or not, offsets depend on only the degradation rate (Proposition 2-(b)). Therefore, technological progress in the environmental sector decreases offsets, but they are independent of technological progress in the production sector of differentiated and environmental goods. On the other hand, with consumption externalities, offsets are affected by not only the degradation rate but also the marginal cost of monopolistic production and the substitution elasticity between two differentiated goods (Result 2-(b)).",

The analysis has been conducted for several utility functions which are familiar in the literature of public good provision under monopolistic competition: the CES function, the Krugman-Pecorino (KP) function, and the Krugman-Mondal (KM) function. We have demonstrated that whether labor supply is institutionally constrained or not, as the population size increases, environmental quality decreases and converges to zero, but offsets increase and converge to the degradation rate of environmental quality, so that the carbon neutrality theorem holds: net contributions are zero. These comparative static results, which are independent of the specification of the utility function, are different from those with consumption externalities. We have also shown when labor supply is endogenous, the comparative static results of the degradation rate are the same as those with consumption externalities. We have not considered the effect of preference for diversity among the differentiated goods (the PFD effect), but the PFD effect does not affect the main conclusions of the paper, for example, Proposition 1 in Section 4 holds even if this effect exists. We also have not referred to the comparative statics of other parameters except for the population size and the degradation rate. It will be useful to briefly comment on them. First, the results of the ambient level of environmental quality and the fixed and marginal cost of monopolistic production are the same as those with consumption externalities. Second, all environmental variables are increasing in the labor productivity of the environmental good in the KP and KM cases, but in the CES case, they are increasing in this productivity when environmental quality and the composite good are not complements. Third, all environmental variables are independent of the exogenous leisure in the KP case, but they are increasing in it in the CES and KM cases.",

That is, people don't buy automobiles to look at them (usually), they are used to enable other household activities. Smaller automobiles make it difficult or impossible to do some activities (carrying large objects) and force reductions in other (size of car pools). Organic farming is yet another example.

On the other hand, workers employed by such corporations are almost universally bound by contract (whether explicit or implicit) to provide a certain amount of given types of labor to the employer, which we model as fixed labor supply. They cannot engage in reduced production. We do not here argue for either profit maximization or inflexible labor contracts, except to note that they fit the stylized facts tolerably well.",

First, our model provides a rigorous but plausible foundation for the theoretical existence of voluntary reductions in production to ameliorate degradation of the environment, even in the presence of alternative means to that end. Second, we show that in the large economy, carbon neutrality holds. That is, the reduction in per worker output due to this motivation is sufficiently large as to offset the environmental burden of an additional worker. That is surely a significant effect at the macro level. Finally, as usual in these models we assume full rationality and perfect information on the part of our agents. But in practice, information about the effectiveness, and even the true costs, of these actions is quite imperfect. Education will be necessary. As we have seen in the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan as well as in the U.S., it is frequently the case that government regulations are not enforced . In such situations it is reasonable to interpret the compliance that does occur as voluntary reductions in productive activity. It is very likely that similar effects will only grow in importance to carbon dioxide emission reduction as the perception of a climate crisis grows. Aspirational government regulations with no enforcement teeth can serve as an effective educational tool, alongside conventional advocacy for \"greening\"-including downsizing-the economy.",
