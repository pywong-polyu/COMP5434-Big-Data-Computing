The mortality rate was lower in the non-cancer group compared to the cancer group (4.50 vs. 9.03%; P < 0.001). The duration between onset and admission shorter in the cancer group (Days, 9 [IQR 5-18]) compared to the non-cancer group (Days, 10; [IQR 6-19]; P = 0.036). ICU occupancy was higher in the cancer group (n[%], 30[10.83%]) than in the non-cancer group (n[%], 314[4.11%]). In reviewing the anti-tumor therapy, data from 277 selected cancer patients were obtained out of which 74 patients had undergone anti-tumor therapy (mean age 65 [IQR 51-67] years; 45.95% male), 203 had not undergone anti-tumor therapy (non-anti-tumor therapy group, mean age 63 [ years; 49.75% male) in the past 6 months.

Informed consent from patient was waived by the ethics committees from each hospital due to the emerging pandemics.

            "text": "Findings from this study indicated that cancer patients are characterized by older age, but lower prevalence of cough and higher prevalence of fever at onset stage. Of note, the duration between onset and admission was shorter in the cancer group than in the non-cancer group. This may be attributed to the blunted immune status in cancer patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that cancer patients have a higher risk of severe events (19) . This study reported that the physiological severity of illness such as sepsis and septic shock, ARDS, AKI, ALI, AMI, and DIC occurred frequently in cancer patients. Besides, they also experienced more antiviral drugs, antibiotics, vasoactive drugs, hormone therapy drugs, ICU treatment, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation. This indicates the health care providers more resources such as medications, medical supplies, modern equipments, employees were needed to allocate to the population. Even though, higher mortality occurred in the patients of cancer group. These findings remind us, to decrease the incidence of virus infection, phone communication or network consulting service must be considered by both physicians and patients as a way to improve care and follow-up and to reduce unnecessary visits to hospitals during the outbreak (20) (21) (22) . Urgent and semi-urgent patients who require hospital treatment or check-up should do more protections to prevent nosocomial infection. Several oncology societies have developed guidelines on cancer care during COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are some questions that remain open, including the risk of impairing the outcome when treatment stopped, continued, or modified for the patient's well-being and the \"distraction effect\" of the pandemic, which is represented by the risk of shifting total attention away from standard clinical care to COVID-19 only (23) . ESMO, NICE and French guidelines suggested to use a tiered approach to categorize patients into different priority levels to receive active cancer therapy (24) . This study reports that patients who underwent anti-tumor therapy in the past 6 month exhibited a higher accuracy rate of ALI. In the previse study, Yeked\u00fcz E reported chemotherapy increased the risk of death from COVID-19 in cancer patients, but there was no safety concern for immunotherapy, targeted therapies, surgery and radiotherapy (25) . Song K demonstrated a possible association between recent receipt of oncologic treatment and a higher risk of death among patients with carcinoma who are hospitalized with COVID-19 (26) . However, the findings of the current study do not support the previous research (19, 25) . One unanticipated result was that the risk accuracy rate for severe events such as sepsis and septic shock, ARDS, AKI, AMI, and DIC were similar in the anti-tumor group compared with patients not subjected to anti-tumor therapy in the past 6 months. Interestingly, treatments of both populations experienced also had no statistical difference. Anti-tumor therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy) in the past 6 months did not affect the mortality of cancer patients.",

Even though, it is particularly encouraging to find that the patients who underwent antitumor treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy) in the past 6month still showed no worse outcome compared with the other group. The results of our study are similar to the results of the study conducted by Jee J et al. In their study, patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy did not have an increased risk of worse COVID-19 course (27) . Interestingly, K Yang reported receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset, and male sex were risk factors for death during admission to hospital (8) . However, the effect of treatment on its postponement of cancer patients cannot be ignored (28, 29) , the diagnostic or treatments' delays would result in life-years lost. We proposed that streamlined efficient anti-tumor treatment should not be affected or cancelled. Originally prescribed antitumor regimens are recommended when sufficient resources and standard precautions can be ensured.",

First, patients enrolled were infected with early variants of the virus during the time frame of the first outbreak. The effect to cancer patients might change accompanied by viral mutations. Subsequent variants which might potentially result to a slightly different patient presentation. Second, our main aim was to check whether antitumor therapy in the past 6 months could worsen the prognosis of cancer patients with COVID-19. Treatment and outcome of different types of cancer with COVID-19 in non-antitumor group and antitumor group were illustrated. However, the older age for the cancer group might be biased by the types of cancer detected, especially as older patients might have a greater proportion of comorbidities. Limitations in sample size have hampered a more stratified analysis to reduce the effect of selection bias. In addition, we only conducted analysis and research in cohorts in Hubei, China. For patients in other regions, the conclusions we observed may be subject to geographic influences, including local medical conditions, economic levels, and government policies. Although the current study enrolled limited patients, the findings confirmed the vulnerability of cancer patients with the SARS-CoV-2 (30) . Moreover, we suggest that tumor patients should be considered as a special population because they are more susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to immune change and social medical need, Antitumor treatments do not expose tumor patients to more risk of severe complications or higher mortality when they have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antitumor treatments for tumor patients during pandemic should be recommended cautiously.",

Of the 7,926 patients, 277 participants with cancer were defined as cancer group [median age 64 (IQR 56-70) years; 50.90% male] and the leaving 7,649 were defined as the noncancer group [median age 55 (IQR 42-64) years; 48.19% male]. Patient characteristics and comorbidities at admission are shown in Table 1.The cancer group was characterized by older age, lower prevalence of cough and higher prevalence of fever at presentation compared to the non-cancer group. Besides, the duration between onset and admission was shorter in the cancer group than in the non-cancer group [days,[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] vs. 10(IQR 6-19); p = 0.036] (Table 1). The thoracic CT findings revealed higher prevalence of pulmonary infection lesions in cancer group compared to the non-cancer group (Supplementary Table 1). Laboratory examination on admission indicated increased liver enzymes (AST increase 22.02 vs. 14.77%, p < 0.001), kidney function abnormalities (CREA increase 10.83 vs. 5.43%, p < 0.001) and increased C-reactive protein (38.27 vs. 29.45%, p = 0.002 ) and procalcitonin level (27.80 vs. 16.16% p < 0.001) in the cancer group compared to the non-cancer group (Supplementary Table 1). Regarding the inpatients medical treatment, compared to the non-cancer group, we found that patients in the cancer group suffered more from sepsis and septic shock (7.22 vs. 1.78%; p < 0.001), ARDS (18.05 vs. 10.16%; p < 0.001), AKI (7.22 vs. 2.01%; p < 0.001), ALI (13.36 vs. 6.86%; p < 0.001), AMI (12.64 vs. 4.93%, p < 0.001), DIC (2.53 vs. 0.43%, p < 0.001; Table 2). Moreover, the cancer group experienced more antiviral drugs (74.73 vs. 67.67%; p = 0.013), antibiotics (71.84 vs. 59.17%; p < 0.001), vasoactive drugs ( 15.52 vs. 4.52%; p < 0.001), hormone therapy drugs (35.02 vs. 25.70%, p < 0.001), ICU treatment (10.83 vs.",
