Healthy males and non-pregnant females, aged 18\u221259 years and negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, were eligible. Participants were randomised to receive one of six treatments by intramuscular injection twice, 28 days apart: 1 \u00b5g, 1 \u00b5g+CpG1018 (a toll-like receptor 9 agonist), 3 \u00b5g, 3 \u00b5g+CpG1018, 10 \u00b5g, or placebo. Participants and personnel assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. The primary outcomes were solicited and spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs) during 7 and 28 days after each vaccination, respectively. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity measures (anti-S IgG and pseudotyped virus neutralisation). An interim analysis assessed safety at day 57 in treatment-exposed individuals and immunogenicity through day 43 per protocol. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04764422).",

The proportion reporting a vaccine-related AE ranged from 5\u00a27% to 17\u00a21% among vaccine groups and was 2\u00a29% in controls; there was no vaccine-related serious adverse event. The 10 \u00b5g formulation's immunogenicity ranked best, followed by 3 \u00b5g +CpG1018, 3 \u00b5g, 1 \u00b5g+CpG1018, and 1 \u00b5g formulations. On day 43, the geometric mean concentrations of 50% neutralising antibody ranged from 122\u00a223 international units per mL (IU/mL; 1 \u00b5g, 95% confidence interval (CI) 86\u00a240 Articles \u2212172\u00a291) to 474\u00a235 IU/mL (10 \u00b5g, 95% CI 320\u00a290\u2212701\u00a219), with 93\u00a29% to 100% of vaccine groups attaining a \u2265 4fold increase over baseline.",

The manufacturing capacity for egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) is among the largest in the world; these facilities, some in middle-income countries and operating for less than six months per year, use locally produced embryonated eggs to make more than a billion doses annually of affordable human vaccines. 2 To enable these manufacturers to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a COVID-19 vaccine for production in eggs, based on a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the ectodomain of a novel membrane-anchored, prefusion-stabilized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein construct, wherein virions are purified and inactivated (NDV-HXP-S). 3\u22125 From September to November 2020, manufacturers in Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil modified their IIV manufacturing process to optimize production of betapropiolactone (BPL)-inactivated NDV-HXP-S, achieving high yields at pilot scale; the result was three similar processes. A preclinical evaluation of their vaccine candidates, formulated with and without CpG1018, a tolllike receptor 9 (TLR-9) agonist adjuvant (Dynavax Technologies) 6 confirmed that they were highly immunogenic and protective in hamsters 5 with no sign of toxicity in rats at the maximum human doses planned for evaluation (3 \u00b5g S protein+1\u00a25 mg CpG1018; 10 \u00b5g S protein). These results enabled all three manufacturers to initiate clinical development of their vaccine candidates. Herein, we report interim safety and immunogenicity data generated in the phase 1 portion of a phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the NDV-HXP-S vaccine candidate developed by The Government Pharmaceutical Organization of Thailand (GPO). The clinical development program for the NDV-HXP-S vaccine candidate in Thailand began in March 2021, shortly after the Government procured its first COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac and AstraZeneca; these products were authorised for emergency use by Thailand's Food and Drug Administration and administered to health care personnel, older adults, and other high-risk groups. Our aim is to attain emergency use authorisation for the NDV-HXP-S vaccine candidate in 2022 to supply a domestically produced, affordable vaccine for COVID-19 prevention and control. Our results herein provide the first evidence in humans that a recombinant NDV expressing a six-proline prefusion-stabilized S protein offers a unique platform for affordable manufacturing of a well-tolerated and highly immunogenic COVID-19 vaccine.",

Pseudotyped virus was added to the serum dilutions at a target working dilution and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 for 60 \u00a7 5 min. Serum-virus complexes were then transferred onto 96 well white flat-bottom plates (Corning), previously seeded overnight with Vero E6 cells (Nexelis) and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 for 20 \u00a7 2 h. Following this incubation, luciferase substrate from ONE Glo TM Ex luciferase assay system (Promega) was added to the cells. Plates were then read on a SpectraMax \u00d2 i3x plate reader (Molecular Devices) to quantify relative luminescence units, inversely proportional to the level of neutralising antibodies present in the serum. The neutralising titre of a serum sample was calculated as the reciprocal serum dilution corresponding to the 50% neutralisation antibody titre (NT 50 ) for that sample; the NT 50 titres were transformed to international units per mL (IU/mL), based on the WHO international standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin, using a conversion factor determined during assay validation (1/ 1\u00a2872). The assay's cut-off and LLOQ were 5\u00a23 IU/mL (10 as NT 50 ) and 5\u00a29 IU/mL, respectively.

Here we demonstrated for the first time that an engineered inactivated NDV-based vaccine expressing a second-generation (6-proline) stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein, 5 produced in eggs in an existing influenza virus production facility at GPO in Thailand, shows an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile in humans and has immunogenicity that suggests its potential clinical benefit. We evaluated a range of vaccine doses (1 \u00b5g, 3 \u00b5g, 10 \u00b5g) having potency quantified as \u00b5g of virus envelope-anchored SARS-CoV-2 S protein; the low and medium antigen doses were evaluated in formulations with and without the TLR-9 agonist CpG1018 as a vaccine adjuvant. Over 28 days after each vaccine dose, all formulations were very well-tolerated with little reactogenicity aside from mild injection site pain and tenderness. No clinically important treatment-related adverse event occurred during the 56 days of observation following first vaccination with any formulation. Moreover, the vaccine was strongly immunogenic in a formulation and dose dependant manner, inducing levels of vaccine-homologous anti-S IgG and virus neutralising antibodies that exceeded by several fold the levels measured in 14-day convalescent sera from consecutive cases of health care workers with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness in 2020. Unexpectedly, the value of adding the CpG1018 adjuvant to the low-and mid-dose formulations, as measured by enhanced induction of humoral immunity, was modest. On the other hand, the small sample size limited the precision of our estimates; moreover, elderly subjects, for whom an adjuvant effect may be more apparent, were not enroled in this study. Importantly, the vaccine at a 3 \u00b5g dose level elicited neutralising antibodies against three variants of concern: P. Figure 3 . Distribution of neutralizing antibody responses (NT 50 ) against vaccine homologous pseudotyped virus (Wuhan-Hu-1) and pseudotyped variants of concern B.1.351 and P.1 measured post-dose 2 (day 43), comparing five NDV-HXP-S vaccine formulations in placebo controls and vaccinated subjects, Numbers above data denote the number of per-protocol subjects contributing data; geometric mean and 95%CI are shown by horizontal bars.

[14] [15] [16] [17] The degree of reduction in neutralisation is dependant on the assay used and can be especially dramatic with pseudotyped particle inhibition assays as used in this study. 14, 17 The T cell response assessed showed a bias towards a T H 1 response in both evaluated dose groups, alleviating concerns about enhanced disease associated with a T H 2 response (as observed with SARS-CoV-1 in some animal models 18 ). These initial data, while sparse, suggest the vaccine-induced T cell memory capable of an antiviral response. The study has several limitations. The sample size per treatment group was small, reducing precision, and assessments were restricted to 43 days for immunogenicity and 57 days for reactogenicity and safety, narrowing our perspective to acute outcomes only. These are inherent problems of phase 1 trials and interim analyses in a pandemic response setting. Nevertheless, as clinical trials with similar vaccines are underway in Vietnam (NCT04830800) and Brazil (NCT04993209), we determined that publication of early data is a priority. The study had strengths as well. The vaccine construct is a novel platform expressing a second-generation pre-fusion stabilized S protein in a membrane-bound trimeric conformation. We hypothesize that these characteristics contribute to the vaccine's notable immunogenicity, particularly induction of virus-neutralizing activity, even without the CpG1018 adjuvant. The anti-S IgG ELISA and PNA used to assess vaccine-homologous NT 50 activity were validated and results are expressed in International Units 9 for future comparisons.",

This vaccine can be produced at low cost in any facility designed for production of inactivated influenza virus vaccine; such facilities are present in a number of LMICs. 2 The high dose formulation was most immunogenic (NT 50 GMC 13-fold higher than the HCS panel); however, the mid dose formulations without and with CpG1018 adjuvant also induced NT 50 GMCs that exceeded the HCS panel GMC by 4-to 7-fold. Based on these relatively high neutralising antibody ratios and acknowledging the importance to maximise supply of vaccine doses from the manufacturing facility to fulfil its public sector mission, the 3 \u00b5g and 3 \u00b5g+CpG1018 formulations were selected for further assessment in the phase 2 stage of the ongoing clinical trial.",
