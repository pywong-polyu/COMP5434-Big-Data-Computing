[2] [3] [4] [5] On March 8th, Italy became the second most severely affected country in the world, and specific restrictions on social contacts were imposed by the Italian government. 6 In accordance with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic, 7 patients with ambulatory stable heart failure had to refrain from hospital visits, and cardiology centers were strongly encouraged to conduct follow-up and provide patients with medical advice by means of telemedicine, in order to prevent viral transmission to patients and healthcare providers. [8] [9] [10] These recommendations specifically applied to patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). 11, 12 For these patients, inperson office visits could be replaced by remote contact, by using the device information obtained through remote monitoring (RM). 13, 14 Since the beginning of the lockdown phase in Italy, Boston Scientific has communicated to all Italian centers implanting CIEDs its willingness to implement a direct home-delivery service of the LATITUDE communicator, in order to allow RM of all patients not yet monitored, without requiring access to the hospital. The initiative included delivery of the communicator, the informed consent process, and organization of remote training for patients and the staff of the center, if needed.",

To comply with these measures, the healthcare system has had to postpone elective procedures and non-essential follow-up visits, implement virtual interactions and adopt new work procedures in order to provide excellent care. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] This rapid reorganization has also affected CIED patients, for whom RM has proved able to replace in-person visits. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] As reported in the Heart Rhythm Society COVID-19 Task Force and ESC COVID-19 guidelines, in order to maintain a high degree of safety and limit faceto-face interactions, an extensive use of telehealth technologies has been necessary. 11 The safety and efficacy of RM was established a decade ago by the landmark TRUST trial, in which RM with automatic daily surveillance of ICD was able to detect actionable events more rapidly than conventional in-office visits. 15 As also reported in several studies, not only does RM play a central role in preventing hospitalizations and improving survival and quality of life in patients with CIEDs, it is also a costeffective alternative to in-person evaluations.

As expected, centers preferred to assign a home-delivered communicator to specific subgroups of patients (i e., ICD, CRT-D, patients with difficulties in accessing the hospital or those with visits scheduled shortly, in order to protect these compliance or preference. 13 The observation that the percentage of correct activations was higher in centers with previous greater RM activity, suggests that the experience of the center may play a role in patient training. These considerations show that the procedure needs to be better planned in order to be applied in all centers in a nonemergency setting. This is relevant, as patient training has an important role in the perception and acceptance of RM 34 and in the continuity of monitoring, which is also known to be linked to patient outcome. 35 As emerged from the questionnaire, the home-delivery service received positive feedback from clinicians, 96% of whom considered it useful in order to manage patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 92% stated that they like to continue it beyond the lockdown.",

A large number of patients were rapidly introduced to RM: the LATITUDE system was activated in 1324 patients, 821 (62%) of whom received the communicator at home, while 503 (38%) received it in hospital. Prior to the lockdown, most centers (91%) monitored fewer than 50 patients via the LATITUDE System, while by the end of the enrollment period 25 centers (50%) were monitoring at least 50 patients via this system. The increased number of patients enrolled was achieved thanks to the competence of the staff and their ability to reinforce patients' feeling of being constantly assisted, both technically and clinically. Despite the higher number of patients remotely monitored, the centers did not make substantial changes to the use and organization of RM; consequently, no significant increase in resources was necessary. Furthermore, the median time required to complete the activation of RM was 15 min per patient; this was comparable to the time usually needed for in-office activation, as reported in the HomeGuide Registry.29 Moreover, only 22% of the centers required additional staff, indicating that RM is not only effective in preventing hospitalizations but also a cost-effective alternative to in-hospital follow-up.[30][31][32][33] Finally, in this emergency setting, informed consent to home delivery of communicators was obtained from patients by means of e-mail or telephone, in order to avoid personal contacts. These strategies could be maintained in the future through adequate and safe online data storage or sharing systems, thereby facilitating the traceability and management of consent documents.",
