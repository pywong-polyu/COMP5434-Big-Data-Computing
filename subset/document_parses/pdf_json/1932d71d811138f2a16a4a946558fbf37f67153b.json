The clinical examination on admission found a static-kinetic cerebellar syndrome and cervical dystonia. She had ptosis of the right eye with limited abduction, depression, and the pupil does not react to light. The left eye cannot move outward. We also noticed a facial decreased sensation of the left side. Rankin's score was 4. The brain magnetic resonance imaging with contrast showed no abnormalities ( Figure 1) .

The CT chest scan also showed a small right breast nodule localized on the upper and outer quadrant. The short-axis diameter was 7.4 mm ( Figure 2 ). The breast ultrasound showed a small, irregular, hypoechoic right breast nodule and cystic right axillary lymphadenopathy. The results of the positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed a hyper-metabolic right axillary adenopathy with two non-hyper-metabolic mammary nodules ( Figure 3 ). Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the suspected adenopathy suggested breast invasive carcinoma with axillary lymph node metastasis. The estrogen receptor (ER) was positive at 90%. The expression of progesterone receptor (PR) was also positive at 80%. The immunohistochemical assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status was negative. The medical oncology team decided to begin hormonotherapy. The paraneoplastic neurological syndrome did not respond to this therapy. The patient's state after the hormonotherapy was the same. She had a static-kinetic cerebellar syndrome, cervical dystonia, and multiple cranial nerve palsies. Chemotherapy and surgery were planned. Unfortunately, our patient died from a septic shock. ",

The presence of anti-neuronal antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid and/or in the blood is a sign of paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS). However, its absence does not rule out the diagnosis [5] .
