In one third of cases (31/100), symptoms were not documented; however, 6 out of 31 (19%) of these cases did report a relevant travel and/or contact history. Further iterations of the guidance and expansion of case definitions (e.g. that did not require clinical AND epidemiological features) led to increased compliance with testing pathways. Interestingly, 3/100 (3%) individuals who reported feeling well at the time of testing were close contacts of known COVID-19 cases.

We have found the performance of the assay to be satisfactory. The Ct values obtained for either B-\u03b2CoV or SARS-CoV-2 specific RNA of the RealStar\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 assay were less than 35, within the acceptable range according to the manufacturer's instructions. Although one might have expected an association between viral load (inversely related to Ct value) in those tested soon after clinical onset versus those at a later stage in the illness, a trend was not observed in this regard (P > 0.05) (Fig. 2) . A larger sample and a longer followup period might have identified such a trend as many reports indicate a high viral load at the early stage of illness [9] [10] [11] [12] . Other factors such as missing data, sample quality and type, storage conditions and a lack of follow-up samples may have influenced this aspect of the review. Additionally, in comparing those with the classic features of cough, fever or shortness of breath and those without these features, the RT-PCR Ct values did not show a significant difference (P = 0.3) (data not shown).",
