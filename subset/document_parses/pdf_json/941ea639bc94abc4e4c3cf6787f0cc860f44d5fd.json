An imbalance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation has been proposed as the mechanism of PAH. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin (Ang) II into the vasodilator Ang- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , has been shown to be an important regulator of blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Herein we hypothesized diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 activator, could ameliorate the development of PAH and pulmonary vascular remodeling.",

All hemodynamic and biochemical measurements were done at the end of the study on day 42. Animals were divided into 4 groups (n = 6-8/group): (1) sham-operated group, (2) vehicle-treatment group (SuPNx 42 ), (3) early treatment group (SuPNx 42 /DIZE 1\u221242 ) with DIZE at 15 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously from day 1 to day 42, and (4) late treatment group (SuPNx 42 /DIZE 29\u221242 ) with DIZE from days 29-42. Results: In both the early and late treatment groups, DIZE significantly attenuated the mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary arteriolar remodeling, and right ventricle brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), as well as reversed the overexpression of ACE while up-regulating the expression of Ang-(1-7) when compared with the vehicle-treatment group. In addition, the early treatment group also significantly decreased plasma BNP and increased the expression of eNOS.",

Treatment with DIZE for 42 days significantly lowered the plasma BNP levels when compared with that of the vehicle-treated group (31.14 \u00b1 2.83 vs. 130.2 \u00b1 19.76 pg/ml; P < 0.05). There was a trend that the SuPNx 42 /DIZE 29\u221242 rats had a decreased plasma BNP level when compared with the SuPNx 42 rats, but the difference was not statistically significant. The RV BNP was significantly higher in SuPNx 42 rats than that of the sham 42 rats (103.4 \u00b1 10.01 vs. 31.05 \u00b1 2.57 pg/ml; P < 0.0001). Both DIZE treatment groups had significantly lowered RV BNP than in the SuPNx 42 rats (early: 46.82 \u00b1 6.62 pg/ml vs. 103.4 \u00b1 10.01 pg/ml, P < 0.0001; late: 61.83 \u00b1 5.10 pg/ml vs. 103.4 \u00b1 10.01 pg/ml, P < 0.001).

ACE2 is known to improve pulmonary hemodynamics, reduce oxidants and inflammatory mediators, and be well-tolerated in PH patients (5) . In line with previous studies (14, 34, 35) , our results showed that DIZE has no adverse effect on systemic blood pressure. Moreover, histological examination revealed that DIZE attenuates pulmonary vascular neointimal and medial remodeling in the SuPNx model.

Ang II, a principal effector peptide of the RAS, can exert deleterious effects on the pulmonary vasculature resulting in vasoconstriction, proliferation, and inflammation, all of which are contributable to the development of PAH. However, it is difficult to measure the plasma and tissue levels of Ang II due to its very short half-life (16 \u00b1 1 s in mice) (36) . In contrast, ACE, which catalyzes the conversion of Ang I to Ang II, is abundant in the small pulmonary arteries and is therefore more easily to be detected (37) . Thus, measuring ACE, instead of Ang II levels in the lung, provides a more practical method for assessing the associated hemodynamic changes. In our study, there were no significant changes in pulmonary Ang II levels among the four animal groups. However, the expression of pulmonary ACE was increased in SuPNx 42 rats and ameliorated by DIZE in both early and late treatment group, suggesting that ACE may be a representative marker in this animal model of PAH.",

By converting Ang II to the vasodilatory peptide Ang- (1-7) , ACE2 provides a negative feedback on the RAS and protects the major organs such as heart and kidneys from being damaged by excessive Ang II generated during the development of PAH (39, 40) . Interestingly, in the present study, the RV and pulmonary levels of Ang-(1-7) were not significantly altered in the SuPNx 42 group when compared with the sham-operated rats. However, the RV levels of Ang-(1-7) were significantly elevated in both the early and late DIZE treatment groups, and the pulmonary levels of this peptide were also significantly increased in the early DIZE treatment group. It should be noted that, besides the action of ACE2, Ang-(1-7) can also be formed by other biochemical pathways. It can be generated from hydrolysis of angiotensin I by neprilysins (NEPs) or cleavage of the Ang-(1-9) by ACE (41) (42) (43) (44) . With respect to its metabolism, Ang-(1-7) can be subsequently degraded by ACE to form Ang- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) , by dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) to produce Ang-(3-7) and Ang-(5-7), or by aminopeptidase A (APA) to generate Ang-(2-7) (44). Affecting the activity of any of the aforementioned enzymes will undoubtedly result in a change of the levels of Ang-(1-7). To this end, it is speculated other alternative pathways may also influence the formation of Ang-(1-7) in our animal model. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the involved biochemical pathways.",

The efficacy of DIZE in the early and late treatment group suggests its ability to rescue animals from established hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease. However, the exact mechanisms by which DIZE exerts its beneficial effects remain to be investigated.",

To accurately assess pulmonary hemodynamic parameters in these rats, the selection of a close chest technique would have been more appropriate than an open chest technique and could explain why certain values are abnormally low. In addition, the close chest technique would have allowed access to values of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and cardiac output, two other important parameters for evaluating PH severity. Besides, echocardiography is a useful non-invasive screening test for evidence of PH. Therefore, echocardiography would have been useful to validate the fact that SuPNx rats had established PH before the introduction of DIZE treatment in the curative protocol and to follow up its reversal over time.",

Both DIZE treatment groups (SuPNx 42 /DIZE 1\u221242 and SuPNx 42 /DIZE 29\u221242 ) showed significant decreases in RVSP when compared with that of the SuPNx 42 rats (early, 25.10 \u00b1 1.38 mmHg, p < 0.01; late 31.23 \u00b1 4.06 mmHg, p < 0.05). The Fulton index was significantly increased in the SuPNx 42 group (0.55 \u00b1 0.06) than in sham-operated group (0.35 \u00b1 0.04, p < 0.05), but no significant changes were observed in the SuPNx 42 /DIZE 1\u221242 and SuPNx 42 /DIZE 29\u221242 groups when compared with the SuPNx 42 group.There was no significant change in either the lung or body weight in all groups.
