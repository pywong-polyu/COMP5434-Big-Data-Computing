Hyperalbuminorrachia and increased levels of the astroglial protein S100B were suggestive of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Brain MRI findings comprised evidence of acute leukoencephalitis (n = 3, of whom one with a hemorrhagic form), cytotoxic edema mimicking ischemic stroke (n = 1), or normal results (n = 2). Treatment with corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulins was attempted -resulting in rapid recovery from neurological disturbances in two cases.

Severe neurological manifestations occurred in 10% of patients during their hospital stay, with severe disease and uremia acting as potential risk factors [1] .

            "text": "CRS is a potentially fatal complication of different infectious (e.g., influenza, SARS, Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) and noninfectious (e.g., multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, multiple sclerosis) diseases. Moreover, it can have a iatrogenic origin during the course of T and B lymphocyte engaging therapies like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell immunotherapy, rituximab, and immune check-point inhibitors [16] , [11] . CRS is triggered by an initial release of proinflammatory cytokines from activated T and/or B cells; this event in turn activates bystander immune cells and endothelial cells to produce proinflammatory molecules. Engagement of other immune cells follows in the context of a self-perpetuating positive feedback loop. In this scenario, excess production of IL-6 from activated macrophages is a key event. CRS-driven neurological disturbances have been described for the first time following CAR-T cell therapy and termed ICANS. Remarkably, the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of severe ICANS closely resemble those shown by the five patients with COVID-19 described in our series [17] , [18] , [13] . Brain MRI in ICANS revealed the presence of acute T2/FLAIR hyperintensities suggestive of interstitial edema of varying severity and small (mmscale) ischemic strokes [13] . One of our cases had a lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum -a finding in accordance with previous data reported in ICANS [19] and encephalitis complicating acute viral infections (e.g., influenza and mumps) [12] . In ICANS, hemorrhagic forms (similar to the findings of patient 4 in our series) have been described [18] . More importantly, proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6 have been shown to lead to endothelial damage and BBB dysfunction in this clinical entity [18] , [13] .",

Certain neurological complications of COVID-19 may be caused by endothelial activation with subsequent increased BBB permeability, edema, [20] and penetration of proinflammatory cytokines that can activate microglial cells in the CNS. The resulting neuroinflammatory response may yield to reactive gliosis accompanied by infiltration of CD68+ monocytes/macrophage [21] and release of S100B protein. This pathophysiological model is in accordance with an autopsy report in COVID-19 showing a range of white matter pathology with an anatomical distribution compatible with MRI lesions observed in our patients (i.e., subcortical areas, corpus callosum, middle cerebellar peduncle) and the lack of typical features of viral encephalitis. Rare neocortical microscopic organizing infarcts were also identified, suggesting a vascular origin followed by secondary myelin loss [22] .",

Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes -which are known risk factors for severe forms of COVID-19[10] -occur frequently in patients with renal disorders.The current longitudinal study provides an in-depth clinical, laboratory, and imaging characterization of five patients with COVID-19 who developed severe neurological disturbances.The main findings can be summarized as follows. First, the clinical presentation of CNS involvement included confusion, agitation, tremor, impaired consciousness, dysexecutive syndrome, pyramidal syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, cranial nerve palsy, dysautonomia, and central hormonal dysfunction (mainly in the form of hypothyroidism). Noteworthy is also the observation that the onset of neurological manifestations occurred in the second week after COVID-19",

In severe cases of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 induces a cytokine release syndrome during the second week of infection. Following viral infection, macrophages, dendritic cells, other immune cells, and endothelial cells become activated and produce large amounts of proinflammatory molecules (including IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha/beta, and IFN-gamma). IL-6 acts as a master mediator of a self-perpetuating proinflammatory loop that results in lymphocyte activation (via the cis-pathway) followed by a massive release of cytokines (cytokine storm). The transpathway of activation may alter endothelial permeability -resulting in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction [27]",

Diffuse bilateral, symmetric white matter FLAIR hyperintensities with mild hyperintense \"ground glass\" areas (arrow heads) and frank hyperintense areas (conventional radiological FLAIR hyperintensities) (arrows). All abnormal FLAIR areas appeared hyperintense in the diffusion sequence and were characterized by a gradient: frank hyperintense FLAIR lesions had a higher intensity than \"ground glass\" areas. On the ADC map, \"ground glass\" areas were iso-or hypointense, whereas frank hyperintense FLAIR areas were hyperintense. Abnormal FLAIR hyperintensities were preferentially localized to subcortical white matter of motor areas and showed a bilateral symmetric distribution. The anterior frontal white matter appeared normal on FLAIR and DWI sequences (a, b: stars).Panels d, e, f, g, h: Case 2.

However, this lesion maintained a similar aspect following 16 days (f, g), casting doubts on its ischemic origin. Persistence of middle cerebellar peduncles hyperintensities was also evident (h).

Multifocal microbleeds were evident in the splenium (j: black arrow heads) and in the white matter/gray matter junction (i: black arrow head), with an apparent perivascular distribution in the Virchow-Robin spaces. These lesions were associated with hyperintensities on FLAIR weighted sequence (k: arrows).
