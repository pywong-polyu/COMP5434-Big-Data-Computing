We charted memory B cell receptor-encoded monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 19 COVID-19 convalescent subjects against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and found 7 major mAb competition groups against epitopes recurrently targeted across individuals. Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of mAb-S complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated with cross-CoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody signatures. mAbs that competed for binding the original S isolate bound differentially to S variants, suggesting the protective importance of otherwise-redundant recognition. The results furnish a global atlas of the S-specific memory B cell repertoire and illustrate properties conferring robustness against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

We focus on B cells, because antibodies, a key part of the immune defense against most viruses, are sufficient to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in animal models (1, 2). Both PC-derived secreted antibody and memory B cells supply immune memory to prevent repeat infection, but with non-redundant roles. Secreted antibodies can prophylactically thwart pathogen invasion with fixed recognition capability, while memory B cells harbor expanded pathogen recognition capacity and can differentiate quickly into PCs to contribute dynamically to the secreted antibody repertoire (4) . Moreover, memory B cells retain plasticity to adapt to viral variants through GC re-entry and SHM-mediated evolution (5) .",

In a comprehensive competition analysis of 152 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 19 subjects for binding with trimeric S ectodomain, we have identified 7 recurrently targeted competition groups --three for antibodies with epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD), two for epitopes on the N-terminal domain (NTD), and two for S2 epitopes. We show that these groups represent the major practical antibody footprints, with rare antibodies outside them. We map the clusters onto the S glycoprotein by including previously characterized antibodies and new cryo-EM determined structures. Ig repertoire analysis indicates both divergent and convergent clones with the competition groups.",

The three RBD clusters overlapped to varying extents, as expected for sites on a relatively small domain. Asymmetric competition (one mAb blocks binding of another, but the second does not block the first) occurred when one had much higher affinity than the other --e.g., S309 (20) , which binds more tightly than do most of the RBD-1 mAbs we isolated. The clusters define relatively broad epitopic regions, as the footprints of two antibodies within a cluster might not overlap with each other but both might overlap with the footprint of a third (e.g., REGN10933, REGN10987, both of which competed with CC12.1, although they have completely distinct footprints at either end of the RBD receptor binding motif, (RBM) (21) . Some crosstalk between clusters is also evident (e.g. C93D9, which bound the RBD, blocked both RBD-2 and NTD-1 mAbs). The published 4-8, 4A8 and COVA1-22 mAbs (12, 13, 22) , which have been shown to bind the NTD, compete with each other and map to NTD-1. NTD-2 mAbs cluster distinctly from NTD-1, indicating minimal spatial overlap of these two NTD regions. One NTD-1 mAb (C81H11) competed strongly with antibodies from S2-1, and a second could be assigned on the basis of competition either to NTD-1 or to S2-1, suggesting structural adjacency of at least some sites in these two clusters ( fig. S3A ). Several segments of S2 are in contact with either RBD or NTD, some with differential exposure depending on whether the RBD is \"up\" or \"down\".",

The connection of the RBD allows a range of orientations for the up configuration, and association with the G32R7 Fab does not fix the orientation of the RBD, blurring density in a 3-D reconstruction of the intact spike. Local refinement of an RBD-Fab subparticle then yielded a map that allowed us to build a good model of the interface ( Fig. 3 and figs. S6, S7).

The unusually long CDRH3 (24 residues) also interacts with three glycans --one on RBD Asn343 and the others on NTD Asn122 and Asn165. Although VH approaches the NTD closely enough to interact with the glycans, we could identify just one likely additional contact with an NTD side-chain (Phe157). The one published RBD-1 antibody structure is that of S309, a neutralizing antibody isolated from a convalescent SARS-CoV donor that also neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (20) . Its contacts with the RBD do not overlap those of G32R7, but the light chain of the latter would collide with it.",

The same IGVH encodes the heavy chains of both antibodies, and the light-chain genes are closely related (overall amino-acid sequence identity). They contact the slight concavity in the center of the RBM, the site for most of the neutralizing antibodies represented by structures in the PDB.

Like the G32R7 complex, the C12C9 complex also required local subparticle refinement to yield a map interpretable at the level of side-chain contacts at the Fab-NTD interface. Its footprint overlaps that of 4A8, but it is displaced slightly toward the threefold axis of the S trimer. Both antibodies have principal contacts in two NTD surface loops, residues 140-160 and 245-260. The C81C10 mAb, which we have grouped in NTD-1 but which competes with only two of the most weakly binding members of that cluster, appears to represent a distinct and potentially subdominant subset.

This set of BCR sequences and corresponding mAbs thus represents responses to a relatively homogeneous infectious virus and provides a valuable tool for examining the degree to which these antibodies retain recognition of emerging variants and for studying the extent to which loss of neutralizing titer correlates with loss of longer-term protection.",

Any of these mechanisms may contribute to the clusters we have mapped, but the outcome in all cases is an apparent redundancy of binding capacity in a broadly polyclonal response that may nonetheless impart recognition breadth toward an evolving pathogen within a single individual.",

Our data suggest an additional mechanism for preventing viral escape: competing antibodies may help retain recognition of a rapidly evolving antigen by their differential sensitivity to specific mutations. The potential dynamic reach of otherwise redundant mAb recognition, illustrated by selective retention of affinity for the UK variant by some antibodies within a cluster but not by others, may give selective advantage to immune mechanisms that yield multiple competing antibodies to critical epitopes, as those that retain adequate affinity can then re-activate, expand, and potentially undergo further affinity maturation. The emergence of strains that may have gained selective advantage by escape from neutralization emphasizes the importance of determining whether the level of retained affinity for the S protein by some antibodies in the immunodominant clusters influences protection from clinical disease.

COVID-19 was diagnosed by a healthcare professional based on symptoms and a positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR test except for G32, who was diagnosed by an antibody test. Participants self-reported data for body-mass index (BMI), symptom onset and recovery dates and self-rated the severity of their COVID-19 symptoms on a 1-10 scale, with 1 describing very mild symptoms and 10 describing very severe symptoms. Blood samples were collected at least 2 weeks after symptom resolution. Symptom duration is the time between symptom onset and recovery dates. Detailed information about the cohort is in Data S1. BMI was calculated as participant's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. Blood samples were processed within 4 hours of sample collection. PBMCs and plasma samples were isolated by density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Antibody cloning and production Cloning and expression of mAbs from single, SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B-cells were performed as described previously (10) . In brief, mRNA from lysed B cells was reverse transcribed with SuperScript III (ThermoFisher) and random hexamers. Two rounds of PCR were performed to amplify heavy and light chain transcripts. Amplified products from the second round PCR were detected by agarose gel and further verified by Sanger sequencing. Sequences were analyzed with IgBlast (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/), and sequence confirmed PCR products were then amplified with gene specific primers containing restriction enzyme sites for cloning into human IgG1, kappa and lambda expression vectors (gifts from Michel C. Nussenzweig, Rockefeller University). For small scale antibody production, paired heavy and light chains were co-transfected into HEK 293T cells (ATCC, Cat.

            "text": "Extracted particles were downsampled and subjected 2D classification, two rounds for the Titan Krios datasets. Initial models were prepared, and the best of three was used as a reference for 3D classification with C3 symmetry imposed. For the Talos Actica and F20 datasets, all particles from reasonable classes were combined and subjected to 3D autorefinement and sharpening, yielding final reconstructions at 8-11\u00c5 resolution. The Titan Krios datasets for C12C9 and G32R7 required additional rounds of 3D classification and 3D autorefinement to converge to final C3-symmetric, full particle reconstructions of 3.0 and 3.6 \u00c5 nominal resolutions for C12C9 and G32R7, respectively, but with much lower resolution for the Fab-bound domains. We therefore carried out local refinement as follows. Particle stacks from the final C3-symmetric, full particle maps were symmetry expanded and back projected to create a new C3-expanded reconstruction. Models of the most similar heavy and light chains were extracted from the protein data bank and combined to create initial models for the Fabs of C12C9 (heavy: 5ggu, light: 6ghg) and G32R7 (heavy: 4qf1, light: 7byr). Fab models and the NTD (residues 14-290 of 7c2l) were docked into the reconstructed maps; the RBD from 7bz5 was also docked into the G32R7 map. These docked PDB models were used to prepare initial masks with a sphere radius of 8 \u00c5 using NCSMASK and a soft edge of 5 pixels, added with relion_mask_create. The soft mask was then used to make a background-subtracted, subparticle stack as implemented in RELION. Fab-occupied and well-resolved subparticles were identified with 3D classification without alignment. Further rounds of 3D classification with and without alignment were carried out along with 3D autorefinement to obtain final sharpened maps with resolutions of ~4.0 \u00c5 for both C12C9 and G32R7 Fabs. Detailed descriptions of the particle processing are in fig. S6 and statistics, including model refinement, are in Table S1 . Fourier shell correlations are in fig. S7 . Because the resolution was too low for de novo modeling, we docked the following structures (identified by PDB IDs) into the reconstructed maps, based on similarity of heavyand light-chain variable domain sequences: 6B0S and 7KJ5 (for Fab and spike, respectively, in C12C11 reconstruction; only a single spike subunit is shown, and the NTD was adjusted manually after 7KJ5 fitting with Chimera \"fit-in-map\"); 7B3O (for Fab and RBD, docked together, with 6VXX for the rest of the spike, in C93D9 reconstruction); 4QF1 and 6VXX (for Fab and spike in C81C10 reconstruction; only a single spike subunit is shown, and the NTD was adjusted manually after 6VXX fitting with Chimera \"fit-in-map\"). (B) Fourier shell correlation plots for the corresponding maps. The nominal resolutions (0.143 criterion) are 12 \u00c5, 7.1 \u00c5, and 8 \u00c5 for C12C11, C93D9 and C81C10, respectively.

In the case of the SA variant in particular, the clusters of three substitutions and one deletion in the NTD and three substitutions in the RBD concentrate at contacts of the most potent of the many wellcharacterized neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, recurrent deletions in loops of the NTD appear to accelerate SARS CoV-2 antigenic evolution (38). We examined the effects of naturally occurring mutant spike protein on binding of mAbs in each competition group. The UK variant had lower affinity for various mAbs in the RBD-1 and NTD-1 cluster. None of the RBD-1 mAbs lost binding completely, and testing a variant with just the deletion at position 144 in the NTD showed that this single mutation caused loss of binding by nearly twothirds of the mAbs in the NTD-1 cluster. Mutations in the variant B.1.351 had more pronounced effects, particularly on mAbs in the RBD-2 and NTD-1 clusters, as expected from the positions of the sequence changes. In addition to the N501Y substitution also present in the variant B.1.1.7, an E484K mutation lies at the center of the epitope for many of the most potent RBD-2 neutralizing antibodies.",
