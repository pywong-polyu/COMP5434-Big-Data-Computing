As the months progressed and the strict national lockdowns were eased, it was observed that a large majority of the SARS-CoV-2 carriers were asymptomatic and that the natural course of COVID-19 among infected people eventually led to full recovery, especially if the individual had no pre-existing health conditions [3] . In parallel, advances in COVID-19 management started to increase everything from empirical antivirals and repurposed drugs [4] to the emergency use of potentially efficacious COVID-19 vaccines [5] .",

            "text": "Indeed, much has been accomplished by the global medical and academic communities in understanding the etiology and appropriate therapy for COVID-19, especially given the short span of time. In the initial months of the pandemic, a preventive and promising adjuvant therapy was favored given its established role in the prevention of asthmatic exacerbations, viral respiratory infections, pneumonia, and overall mortality in high-risk populations such as the elderly. This well-known supplement is vitamin D [6] [7] [8] [9] . Consequently, accumulating evidence has suggested associations between low levels of vitamin D and the severity of COVID-19 outcome [10] [11] [12] [13] . Among the well-established theories of this association is the biophysical and structural evidence that SARS-CoV-2's point of cellular entry is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein, which is found in abundance on the surfaces of respiratory cells and is the same point of entry observed in SARS-CoV-1 [14] . Vitamin D heightens the expression of the ACE2 receptor protein, which balances the pathways that are known to be disrupted by coronaviruses, ACE/ACE2 and angiotensin II (ANG)/ANG 1-7 [15, 16] . Another interesting theory is that vitamin D is a negative acute phase reactant in most acute and chronic inflammatory conditions [17] , which also explains why vitamin D deficiency is common in states that harbor low-grade systemic inflammation such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and aging [18] .",

Participating centers were all tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and included King Fahad Medical City (KFMC), King Salman Hospital (KSH), and King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC). Male and female adult participants aged 20-75 years old who had an RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnosis (not more than 3 days prior to inclusion) and were presenting with mild to moderate symptoms and who consented voluntarily (written and verbal) were enrolled in the trial. As per the definition of the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) protocol for RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases, a mild-moderate category meant that the patient required no O2 on presentation, had no evidence of pneumonia but had clinical symptoms (e.g., fever), the management of which was supportive care [22] . Criteria for hospital admission required a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patient who was symptomatic with evidence of pneumonia, above 65 years, ARDS, the presence of comorbidities and other illnesses that require admission, amongst others (a full list is provided by the MoH hospital admission criteria version 1.1) [23] . Severe COVID-19 cases (those that required intensive care (e.g., respiratory rate \u226530/min, oxygen saturation \u226493%, presence of bilateral lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field)), children and pregnant women, and those whose baseline 25(OH)D were above 75 nmol/L were excluded. Individuals who were SARS-CoV-2 negative and/or SARS-CoV-2 positive but asymptomatic (for home isolation) were also not included. Ethical approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of KFMC, Riyadh, KSA (IRB Log No. 20-282).

Both supplements were taken orally daily for 2 weeks. The supplements provided were different in color in both packaging and tablet with unit labels stamped in both the tablet and blister, making blinding of the trial impossible. To monitor compliance, participants were given blisters containing 7 tablets at the baseline visit and were asked to return after one week (Day 7) with any unused tablets for a fresh refill and to monitor symptoms. All participants were advised to continue supplementation until Day 14, even if deisolated/discharged earlier. All participants with pre-existing conditions were advised to continue medications for those pre-existing conditions. Anthropometrics and blood collection were done at baseline (Day 0) and Day 7 or on the discharge day. The monitoring of the primary outcomes (existing symptoms) noted at baseline (Day 0) were followed up on Day 7 or on discharge day and 30 days after discharge and/or the last vitamin dose through a mobile phone call by a data collector who was blind to the treatment received by patients. The primary outcome was the number of days to resolve symptoms. Secondary outcomes include changes in the metabolic profile. Other outcomes such as days to discharge, ICU admission as well as mortality were noted. For the purpose of this study, a recovered case (discharged) was based on the guidelines set by the MoH for symptomatic patients, defined as '10 days after onset of symptoms, plus at least 3 days without symptoms (fever and respiratory symptoms) or 3 days without symptoms and one negative RT-PCR test' [21] .",

The goal of the present randomized clinical trial is primarily to determine whether a short-term 5000 IU vitamin D3 supplementation can reduce recovery times of COVID-19 symptoms among mostly in-patients with mild-moderate symptoms. From this trial, it was observed that 5000 IU oral vitamin D3 taken daily for 2 weeks can substantially reduce the days of recovery from cough and ageusia, and this was clinically significant compared to those who took the standard dose for vitamin D deficiency management. It is worth highlighting that the circulating 25(OH)D levels of almost all of the participants at baseline were either in the insufficiency or mild deficiency range, and that 5000 IU vitamin D3 administered for 2 weeks is safe and tolerable, given the acceptable upper safety dose is 4000IU [30] . In a recent case-control study done in KSA, the majority of the 150 hospitalized patients who screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 had severe manifestations of COVID-19 (80% had radiographically confirmed lung infiltrates) and had a much lower vitamin D status (75% had 25(OH)D < 50 nmol) compared to their non-COVID-19 counterparts (n = 72), who also experienced severe symptoms but tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 [20] . In comparison, the present participants whose COVID-19 conditions were under the mild to moderate category also had sub-optimal but relatively higher 25(OH)D levels than both groups in the mentioned study. While causality cannot be derived from these observations, the inverse association of 25(OH)D to the severity of COVID-19 outcomes is evident and as such, the possibility of benefitting from vitamin D supplementations needs to be tested.",

In a pilot study done in Spain, early high dose vitamin D3 prevented ICU admission among COVID-19 patients in combination with the best available standard care for severe cases [31] . In a case-series of COVID-19 patients who received 50,000 IU daily for 5 days, a marked reduction in recovery time and inflammatory markers were observed compared to those who received 1000 IU [32] . A recent quasi-experimental study also showed that among the frail elderly with COVID-19, those who received boluses of 50,000 IU per month or 80,000-100,000 IU per 2-3 months were associated with less severe and improved survival (OR = 0.08 (0.01: 0.81), p = 0.03) [33] . Among the negative trials, a single high dose vitamin D (200,000 IU) given to severe COVID-19 patients (n = 114) did not reduce the hospital stay and severity of outcome compared to the placebo group (n = 118) (Hazard Ratio 1.12) [34] . The trials mentioned have mostly focused on severe cases and mega-doses of vitamin D compared to the present study, which focused on mild cases and lower daily vitamin D doses. In a large-scale meta-analysis conducted involving almost 11,000 participants in 25 clinical trials on the prevention of acute respiratory infections, the protective effects were the greatest among those vitamin D deficient individuals who received daily or weekly doses as opposed to boluses [9] . The dose used in the present study is somewhat similar to a previous RCT, which demonstrated, albeit during a longer term (12 months) , that the supplementation of 4000 IU Vitamin D3 prevented acute respiratory infections by as much as 36% (Relative Risk 0.64, 95 % CI 0.43-0.94) based on a cohort of 140 adults with increased risk of acute respiratory infections (>4 infections/year) [35] .",

            "text": "As mentioned previously, the extra-skeletal roles of vitamin D are well-established, not only in respiratory infections but in the regulation of the innate immune system overall. Observations from past coronavirus pandemics such as SARS-CoV-1 demonstrated that coronaviruses inhibit type 1 interferon (IFN) receptors, which inversely affect innate immunity [36] . When unbound, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) deteriorates the beneficial antiviral effects of IFN through the removal of a key transcription factor (STAT1) in IFN signaling. This inverse association between VDR and STAT1 implicates that the unbinding of STAT1 through the increased circulation of biologically active forms of vitamin D (calcitriol) (e.g., supplementation) heightens the type 1 IFN response, consequently improving the innate immune system [37] . Another theory by which elevating the circulating 25(OH)D can enhance coronavirus degradation is the acidification of endolysosomes, cellular organelles in charge of the release of SARS-CoV-2 in the cytosol, thereby stimulating autophagy [38, 39] . These mechanisms, together with the ones mentioned previously, may partially explain how vitamin D supplementation can alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, which in the present study includes cough and ageusia. Ageusia is of interest as not much has been published on the role of vitamin D in the reversal of this symptom. Loss of taste and smell however are common in respiratory viral and bacterial infections [40] . Wang and colleagues observed that Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) pathways were found to be present in taste tissue, and these pathways are activated in response to inflammation (e.g., respiratory infection), which inadvertently interferes normal taste transduction [41] . Vitamin D may restore gustatory function via the suppression of these pathways in the presence of infection, consequently downregulating the inflammatory response [42] . This mechanism is reversed among healthy individuals, where vitamin D may stimulate TLR expression, but in preparation for pathogen exposure [43] . Another explanation can be due to the neuroprotective effects of vitamin D [44] , which includes the regulation of the neurotrophins responsible for the development of the gustatory taste system [45] .",

Given that most participants in the present study were either overweight or obese, this consequence maybe considered positive for the present cohort, but it also suggests that nutritional therapy may be needed for full recovery of COVID-19 patients following hospital admission and/or isolation [47] .",

Therefore, vitamin D correction, which controls the entire body's calcium homeostasis, may further benefit COVID-19 patients with suboptimal 25(OH)D levels by maintaining calcium balance, consequently decreasing risk of COVID-19 severity.",

Risk of bias is apparent given the study's open-label design since blinding was impossible. To minimize this, the assessment of symptoms at follow-up were collected over the phone by a blinded data collector. The beneficial effects of 5000 IU vitamin D3 supplementation in this case applies only to mild and moderate COVID-19 cases with sub-optimal vitamin D status (mild deficiency to insufficiency), and whether the same dose and duration will also apply to severe COVID-19 cases with worse vitamin D status needs to be investigated in future clinical trials. The duration of intervention was primarily based on MoH guidelines in terms of deisolation/discharge of COVID-19 cases presenting with mild to moderate symptoms, as it was difficult to monitor the participants physically given the existing COVID-19 restrictions imposed during the study period. While the study had no placebo, the use of 1000 IU is standard and served as a control since it would be deemed unethical not to provide vitamin D supplements if participants were known to have suboptimal vitamin D status. Finally, baseline differences in the parameters were evident despite randomization, as is true for most clinical trials. While age and BMI were used as covariates in all models, these necessary adjustments added stringency to the analysis given its small sample size. Nevertheless, the findings are robust and well powered. The present clinical trial is one of the first interventions globally and the first in the Middle East to use vitamin D as a short-term adjuvant therapy in improving mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms among patients with sub-optimal vitamin D levels. Prospective cohort studies are needed to determine whether these beneficial effects ultimately extend to prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
