These measures included closures of schools, non-essential retail and hospitality outlets and stay at home orders. [3] Initial concerns around B.1.1.7 emerged from analyses which determined a higher transmissibility. [2, 4, 5] On 18 th December 2020, the variant was re-designated as a Variant of Concern (VOC-202012/01) and subsequent studies have found B.1.1.7 to be associated with higher mortality than other SARS-CoV-2 variants. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The burden of COVID-19 on hospital services is a key measure outlined by the UK government on progress in controlling the pandemic, influencing decisions on how quickly social and physical distancing measures can be removed. As B.1.1.7 is now the predominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage in England, any potential increased likelihood of hospitalisation with this variant will impact the national healthcare burden and decisions on lifting restrictions.",

These patients represented 41.0% of all confirmed cases during that time. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the SGTF and non-SGTF patients. The mean age of SGTF patients was 37.6 years, and in the non-SGTF group the mean age was 37.8 years.

The crude HR of death was 1.22 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.31). After adjustment for all considered potential confounders the HR was 1.59 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.74). The results indicated that the higher risk of hospitalisation may apply primarily to adults above the age of 30, and the risk was not found to be higher for SGTF compared to non-SGTF COVID-19 patients below the age of 20. This may reflect a similarly low risk of severe disease in younger and less comorbid individuals as previously reported for wildtype variants. [20] We have provided absolute risk estimates of hospitalisation within 14 days by age group after adjustment for potential confounders. Under the model used to estimate the absolute risks, the B.1.1.7 variant can be estimated to have caused an excess 8941 hospitalisations within 14 days during the study period, based on a comparison of the observed hospitalisations with the expected hospitalisations under a counterfactual scenario in which patients with SGTF variants were hospitalised at the same rate as those with non-SGTF variants. However, this estimate ignores the excess transmissibility of B.1.1.7 [2, 4, 5] and hence likely underestimate the total number of hospitalisations attributable to B.1.1.7.",

The calendar period in which the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 increased coincided with a general increase of COVID-19 diagnoses in the UK, [21] and initial outbreaks of B.1.1.7 were local to South East England and neighbouring regions. [5] It is possible that a high local pressure on the healthcare system might lead to higher mortality because of factors such as insufficient resources and staff per hospital-admitted patient. Hence, because the pressure on the healthcare system was higher in areas where B.1.1.7 was more prevalent, it is possible that those areas saw a somewhat higher mortality due to hospital overburden. This could result in positive confounding, i.e. the mortality risk associated with B.1.1.7 may have been somewhat overestimated in this and previous analyses of community testing data in England. [6, 7] In this and previous studies, hospital pressure was not directly adjusted for, and the potential confounding effect of local hospital pressure was only addressed indirectly through adjustment for time period and region. [6] [7] [8] In contrast, high local hospital pressure is not associated with the propensity that newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients experience disease sufficiently severe to require hospitalisation, and is unlikely to lead to a greater proportion of COVID-19 patients requiring hospital care being admitted to hospital. Hence, hospital pressure is unlikely to positively confound the association between SGTF status and hospital admission. Most likely, hospital pressure does not affect the propensity that a severely affected COVID-19 patient is admitted to hospital. If so, hospital pressure does not confound the association between SGTF status and hospitalisation. However, it is possible that due to severe local hospital over-burden, some severely affected COVID-19 patients who would otherwise have been hospitalised were not admitted, or admitted later than they otherwise would. Because of the time-and-region-specific overlap between high hospital pressure and high prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant, this would however be expected to result in negative confounding and hence underestimation of the hospitalisation HR for B.1.1.7-infected patients. In the absence of full control for the potential confounding due to local hospital pressure in analyses of mortality risk, the association with hospitalisation corroborates the hypothesis that the B.1.1.7 variant is associated with more severe disease than wildtype variants.",

However, at least 108 days had elapsed between the patients' dates of positive test and the linkage with the hospitalisation data, which makes reporting delays likely to have had limited impact. Furthermore, the SGTF patients were on average diagnosed later in calendar time than the non-SGTF patients. Hence, any nondifferential underreporting of hospitalisations due to reporting delays may have resulted in underestimation of the hospitalisation risk predominantly in the SGTF patients, which might have resulted in a small underestimation of the true HR. Our analyses controlled for calendar week, which likely makes the effect of this limited. Additionally, the use of hospitalisation data from health service datasets that principally serve administrative purposes has the benefit of broad coverage.",

Consistently, when allowing for time-dependent effects the time-varying HRs in the first 14 days were similar to the overall HR of hospitalisation within 1-14 days from the primary analysis. By contrast, the time-dependent HRs of hospitalisation 15-60 days after the positive test from the additional analysis where we extended the follow-up time beyond 14 days were close to 1.0, and the hazards hence clearly non-proportional over this extended follow-up. These patterns likely reflect that the hospitalisation data were limited by a lack of information on the reason for admission and the analysis therefore based on hospitalisations due to any cause. Due to the narrow time interval considered in the primary analysis of hospitalisations between 1-14 days after a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test, most of these hospitalisations were likely due to COVID-19.",

Such misclassification is a likely explanation for the attenuation of the HR when we extended the follow-up period to 60 days, because non-COVID-19 causes may constitute a higher proportion of the reasons for the late hospitalisations.",

By contrast, in the present study we observed 27,710 hospitalisations in patients with SGTF which allowed us to provide higher precision estimates. The results are also consistent with a previous ecological analysis that estimated a hospitalisation relative risk of 1.7 based on hospitalisation patterns by the regional prevalence of SGTF variants in England, [11, 12] and reported relative risks in the range 1.6-1.7 based on data from Scotland,[11] seven EU/EEA countries, [23] Denmark [24] and Canada. [10] This adds to the evidence of higher severity COVID-19 after infection with B.1.1.7 compared to wildtype SARS-CoV-2, as further indicated by its association with higher risk of intensive care admission [9, 10, 23] and death. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Our finding of lower age-specific HR estimates in younger age groups are consistent with a previously reported age-specific adjusted odds ratio of hospitalisation of 1.0 for SGTF versus non-SGTF patients aged 0-19 in seven EU/EEA countries, [23] but contrasts with a study in Denmark which reported an adjusted odds ratio of 1.84 for SGTF patients aged 0-29. [24] Children and adolescents aged \u226418 who were hospitalised with COVID-19 in November 2020-January 2021 at King's College Hospital in London (where the local prevalence of B.1.1.7 was high) were reported to have had similar clinical severity and treatment requirements compared to those hospitalised in March-May 2020, [25] corroborating the suggestion that individuals in the youngest age groups experience no more severe disease if infected with B.1.1.7 compared to wildtype SARS-CoV-2.",
