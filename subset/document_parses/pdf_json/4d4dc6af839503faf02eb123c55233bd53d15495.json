Under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol [6] as well as the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) the topic of \"digital sequence information\" (DSI) has garnered immense interest and raised concern across the international scientific community. Discussions have focused on the use of NSD from GRs, as DSI is an undefined and non-scientific term. Due to the exponential growth of public sequence and downstream databases [7] many parties are concerned that insufficient benefit-sharing is taking place.

Next, we retrieved scientific papers that referred to these accession IDs via a full text search using the ePMC REST API [17] . These publications we labelled \"secondary publications\".

The starting point of the data extraction process is the EMBL-ENA flat file dump of release 143, which was obtained from the EMB-ENA FTP server and comprised 263,421,789 records. Next, all non-WGS ENA records were parsed to compile a relevant set of attributes for the table \"ENA_SEQUENCES\". A total of 17,820,136 ENA accessions with valid country tags (i.e., the /country field in the ENA entry, comprising 15% of all records) were included. Next, using the ePMC REST API, these ENA accessions were scanned in 36.7 million full text articles accessible via PubMed. Due to performance reasons, this text tokenization was executed on site at EBI in a compute cluster environment. From the resultant publications those were select that have valid author country information and that either (b) cite an ENA sequence as a secondary publication 1 or (b) that are cited by ENA record as primary publication 2 . The publications matching these criteria were compiled into the table \"PMC_REFERENCES\".

This causes a potential loss of recall in comparison to a broad and integrative use of further state-of-the-art literature mining services that include articles behind paywalls. In order to get an estimation of potential missed DSI citation, we used alternative tools that cover patent and closed access publications. We applied the commercial \"Dimensions\" [22] and the free \"Lens.org\" [24] search tools, which include patent and restricted-access publication, to compare recall performance for 20 randomly selected ENA accessions. To work with a comparable corpus, this evaluation was performed within 4 weeks of the ePMC based text mining run. The results are compiled in Table 1 . Specific hits to one of three approaches, ePMC, Lens, dimensions were observed. This is likely due to the larger corpora of Dimensions and Lens. For example, ENA accession AB076935 was linked to 3 public and 3 closed access publications by Dimensions, whereas ePMC did not report any matching publication. Differences in file format may explain some of the differences. There are cases where the PDF rendered articles differ from ePMC rendered HTML versions, so that the PDF versions can contain more ENA accession numbers than HTML versions in ePMC. We did not aim for an in-depth analysis for literature search tools, but our cursory overview supports the notion that a substantial number of publications relevant to NSD may be behind ",

More generally, the web interface illustrated in Figure 4 enables the interactive exploration of DSI use in science by a features text search, data aggregation across the data warehouse and crosslinking to the original ENA records and ePMC records. It enables further complex filtering, grouping as well as visualition as charts, world map projects, and network diagrams. Another re-use scenario is to document the flow of DSI associated with genebank resources across the scientific value chain from seed storage to genetic analysis. A prominent example is the role of molecular passport data as an instance of DSI to characterize plant genetic resources (PGR). Genebank genomics is an emerging research field aiming at using highthroughput sequencing to characterize the genetic diversity in entire genebank collections [25] . Recently, marker profiles from reduced representation sequencing data were reported for more than 20,000 accessions of the German Genebank [26] . Whole-genome shotgun sequencing has been used to characterize the genome of 3,000 rice accessions at the International Rice Research Institute [27] . The approach provides a so-called molecular passport that enables tracking the identity of accessions, identifying redundancies and crosslink international genebanks [28] . For these reasons, molecular passport data is poised to become an essential component of working with PGR in research and breeding contexts. ",

Work in this direction is underway in the EU-funded projectAGENT [30].DSI and their free accessibility are essential for all areas of the life sciences, including biodiversity research, food security, human health, biological conservation and many other disciplines or research areas. Some countries contributing DSI fear that direct access to the increasing amount of freely available sequence information may undermine benefit sharing schemes for genetic resources. A use of this data set supports evidence-based decision making in the context of international policy processes as well as global scale investigations into scientific use and re-use of NSD datasets and sub-disciplines thereof. Indeed, this article is intended as a companion paper for a timely publication on the policy implications of NSD (re-)use for DSI access and benefit-sharing discussions under the CBD in this issue.For future studies, the examples above could be complemented by more detailed use cases including finer-grained groupings for data aggregation such as separation of genera, species and time ranges of publications. In combination with additional text classification techniques[32], it may be possible to cluster by research topics, e.g. considering only citations in paper involving, say, COVID-19 or plant pathogen resistance.https://github.com/alakob/sequence-literature.",
