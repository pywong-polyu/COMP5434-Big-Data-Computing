In these three cell groups we conducted the described experiments. This allowed us to assess the characteristics of HUVECs from women supplemented with Myo during pregnancy. The results obtained in this group of cells were compared with the data obtained from HUVECs of non-diabetic women (C) and from diabetic women treated with diet alone (GDM), neither of which received Myo.

In a preclinical murine model, Myo plays a protective role against stress-induced macrophage metabolism, resulting in a favourable environment for these cells, finally providing an adequate anti-inflammatory response [38] . Moreover, in a rat model of insulin resistance, a reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 circulating levels was observed after Myo supplementation [39] . Interestingly, Myo treatment has been shown to increase synthesis and function of surfactant, improving lung immune defense response [40] .",
