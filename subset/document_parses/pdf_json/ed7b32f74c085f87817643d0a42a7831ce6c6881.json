            "text": "The current worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that causes coronavirus disease 2019 has brought some medical systems to the brink of collapse. This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA). Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short-and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring. This COVID-19 Cerebellum Task Force consensus provides some guidance on how we may approach this uncertain time and consider preparing for the new realities we face in CA patient care once this acute crisis has passed.",

Neurological manifestations occur in about one third of hospitalized patients, involving both the central nervous system (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular events, ataxia, seizure), the peripheral nervous system (loss of smell and taste, neuropathic pain, variants of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), and skeletal muscle injury [3] .

There are diseasespecific issues that CA patients face that potentially place them at high risk of greater complications should they contract the disease. For those CA patients presently unaffected by COVID-19 infection, reduction of medical support negatively impacts their daily lives, and their social and psychological situation is further complicated by the difficulties they encounter accessing vital shopping and delivery services due to their physical handicap. Their reliance on caregivers potentially increases their risk of exposure to the virus. At the same time, diminished care by service providers no longer coming to their homes or available to them in the outpatient clinic limits their access to medical care and much-needed social interactions.",

Because of the heightened risk of the complications of COVID-19 inherent in the disorders that produce cerebellar ataxia, our patients need to adhere to these preventive measures and heed all precautionary warnings.

There is currently no internationally accepted recommendation for patients with immune ataxias. There is no evidence to suggest that IVIg, corticosteroids, or plasma exchange carry an additional risk of contracting COVID-19 [8] . Thus, any decision should be based on the individual's potential risks (age, associated diseases, severity of the immune ataxia), and the patient should be involved in decision-making. The recommendation in the UK, which we endorse, is that these patients should continue their treatment but be considered high risk, necessitating shielding, a step beyond physical isolation. In the event the patient develops symptoms suggestive of infection, they are instructed to stop the immunosuppressive drug until they have fully recovered from the infection, as a common general rule. Further problems arise from the inability to perform the usual monitoring of hematologic parameters, as well as the current inability to administer these medications in outpatient infusion therapy centers. Similarly, there is no consensus about starting immunotherapies. It will be better if at all possible to delay the immunotherapy. Clinicians should also, however, recognize the risk of not starting immunotherapies particularly in cases of rapidly progressive immune-mediated ataxias. There is preliminary evidence that the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are elevated in patients with coronavirus infection and that low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus might have beneficial effects on COVID-19 critically unwell patients [9] . Notably, COVID-19 elicits cytokine storm syndrome, which might be controlled by immunotherapies including IVIG, corticosteroids, and selective cytokine blockade [10] . However, until we have clear evidence that immunotherapy may be of benefit for COVID-19-positive patients, current best practice suggests the approach outlined above.",

Many institutions have already implemented telehealth/telemedicine, and this has rapidly become standard practice for many neurologists. Available programs such as Zoom, Doxy.Me, Cisco Jabber, WhatsApp, and FaceTime are used for healthcare visits if a patient agrees and contacts the doctor first, and while recent security breaches have been recognized, they are in the process of being repaired. These telemedicine platforms are efficient and practical. In our experience, they are appreciated by patients and have demonstrable positive impacts on patient sense of well-being and confidence that they have access to care providers to address concerns either related to our independent of the current pandemic. These virtual platforms make it possible to maintain contact with patients; review interim history and medications; and identify new, active, or potentially resolving issues. They keep the flow of conversation open and allow care providers to have meaningful dialog with patients in real-time. Virtual video-assisted platforms are well suited to performing some of the core elements of the neurology clinic visit including assessing overall mental state, selected eye movements, speech, examination of hyperkinetic movement disorders, ataxia, dexterity, gait (if caregiver is also present), and power (if caregiver can assist). We need to acknowledge, though, that while the virtual visit platform is a powerful and useful tool, it cannot fully replace the in-person encounter. Assessment of movement disorders such as tremor is not optimal using these video-assisted platforms. The oscillating nature of the movements is not always adequately captured in two dimensions, the quality of the video feed may be poor, and technical sophistication may be limited not only on the part of the patients and their families but also the physicians new to this platform. Further, for those patients with accompanying Parkinsonism, dystonia, or hyperkinesias, it is not possible to assess rigidity remotely. Finally, virtual interaction may be more difficult for CA patients because of the flat two-dimensional virtual environment and technical issues related to the audio component of the interaction. Delayed timing of speech and limitations of the visual platform might disproportionately burden CA patients because their automatized social models of timing and sequencing might be weaker and/or less flexible. There are no data on this topic to our knowledge, which makes this a potential fruitful area for future research.",

The virtual visit can lessen the patient's need to come in to the office in person for every visit, relieving the burden of the time and practical challenges inherent in traveling sometimes far distances, incurring expenses to get to the clinic, and requiring the assistance or family members who must take time off from work to accompany them. The era of ambulatory clinical medicine that existed before COVID-19 is thus likely to be transformed in a positive way, at least in part, by the experience of care during this pandemic. This development may represent a silver lining of this catastrophe and an opportunity for scientists and healthcare providers to invest in remote data collection to build on this potentially efficient approach to evaluating disease and monitoring progression in the clinical environment and in clinical trials.",

As a result, patients with CA are already reporting from phone interviews a worsening of balance and falls. Patients with spasticity in the context of spinocerebellar ataxias complain of increased muscle spasms. The benefits of rehabilitation therapy reported for stroke patients are also applicable to patients with CA [12] . A 4-week intensive rehabilitation program (1 h \u00d7 3 sessions per week) improved balance, gait, and limb coordination based on the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. Importantly, the retention of beneficial effects of such programs depends on continuous training. Long-term programs that include daily 1-h training sessions at home are associated with 1-year benefits, despite gradual decline in motor performance associated with natural progression of the disease. These results highlight the long-term benefits of intensive rehabilitation therapy in CAs, especially when combined with home rehabilitation. Thus, discontinuation of rehabilitation could exacerbate symptoms and worsen the clinical condition. Speech therapists are particularly exposed to viral infections due to the nature of their work, and many of them have stopped visiting patients at home or in residential homes. Patients are now reporting greater difficulties not only for oral communication but also more dysphagia. This is a worrisome development because of the greater incidence of potentially life-threatening aspiration pneumonia.

The clinical features vary but include impaired executive function, visuospatial cognition, and personality changes with blunting of affect or abnormal behavior [13, 14] . Patients with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1 and 2 (SCA1 and SCA2) develop severe depression and negative symptoms, particularly apathy [15] . Thus, it is reasonable to expect that these patients may be more vulnerable to a psychological crisis such as we are seeing with COVID-19. In addition to their cerebellar disease, CA patients are chronically ill, which predisposes them to greater anxiety and depression. The altered structure of life around them, social isolation, and fear of acquiring the infection may exacerbate these tendencies. Compounding this psychological vulnerability is the reality that providers may have fewer resources available to offer. General practitioners are overwhelmed by the pandemic and less able to commit time and effort to the daily care of patients with chronic neurological conditions such as CA, and in-person psychology or therapy visits have ceased in most countries.

The physical isolation required to flatten the curve of transmission has the potential negative consequence of true social isolation, with loss of in-person interactions with the support systems and society at large.

One way we can do this is by focusing on the humanity of the care of our patients while at the same time honoring our privilege to foster the academic mission. The practical manifestations of this are to continue our work with the technology of online conferences; giving permission to ourselves and our colleagues to embrace intellectual and emotional space and take a break from the constant terrible news of the pandemic, from our own involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients now or in the imminent future; and finding comfort in thinking about and discussing the topics we care about in cerebellar neurobiology and clinical neurology. Providing some sense of what we used to think of as normal and routine outside of the COVID-19 environment is academically stimulating and important for patient care and for science; it is also, at this troubled time, a balm for the caregiver.",
