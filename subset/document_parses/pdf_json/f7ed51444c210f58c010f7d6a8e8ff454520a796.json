Several mathematical models has been developed to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic. A Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People network model has been developed by Chen et al. [25] to study the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus. Lin et al. [26] extended the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) compartment model to study the dynamics of COVID-19 incorporating public perception of risk and the number of cumulative cases. Khajanchi et al. [38] studied an extended SEIR model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and perform a short-term prediction based on the data from India. A discrete-time SIR (susceptible-infectious-removed) model introducing dead compartment system studied by Anastassopoulou et al. [27] [30] . Here, we developed a new epidemiological mathematical model for novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in India that extends the standard SEIR compartment model, alike to that studied by Tang et. al. [31] for COVID-19. The transmission dynamics of our proposed model for COVID-19 is illustrated in the Figure 1 .",

The model, named SARII q S q , monitors the dynamics of six compartments (classes), namely susceptible individuals (S) (uninfected), quarantined susceptible individuals (S q ) (quarantined at home), infectious but not yet symptomatic or asymptomatic infectious individuals (A), infected or infectious with symptoms/clinically ill (I), isolated infected individuals (I q ) (infected or life-threatening or detected) and the recovered compartment (R) (no more infectious). The total size of the individuals is N = S + S q + A + I + I q + R. In our model, quarantine describes the separation of coronavirus infected populations from the susceptible individuals before progression of clinical symptoms, whereas the isolation refers to the dissociation of coronavirus infected populations with such clinical symptoms. The rate of change in each compartments at any time t is represented by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations:",

Here the parameter \u03b2 = \u03b2 s \u03b5 s is explicitly associated with the measures like lock-down, social distancing, shaking hand, coughing and sneezing etc., which exactly decrease the number of social contacts. By enforcing contact tracing, a proportion \u03c1 s , of individuals exposed to the coronavirus is quarantined. The quarantined classes can either move to the compartment S q or I q , depending on whether they are effectively infected individuals or not, whereas the another proportion 1 \u2212 \u03c1 s , consists of populations exposed to the coronavirus who are missed from contact tracing and move to the infectious class I (once infected) or remaining in susceptible class S (if uninfected). Then the quarantined classes, if uninfected (or infected), move to the class S q (or I q ) at a rate of (1 \u2212 \u03b2 s )\u03c1 s \u03b5 s (or \u03b2 s \u03c1 s \u03b5 s ). Those who are not quarantined individuals, but asymptomatic infectious individuals, will move to the asymptomatic compartment A at the rate of individuals. Asymptomatic population develop to infected population at the rate \u03b3 a , so the average time spent in the asymptotic class is 1 \u03b3a per unit time. In similar fashion, 1 \u03b3i represents the mean duration for infected individuals. We ignore the rate of probability of transforming susceptible again after having cured (recovered) from the disease infection. It is to be noted that our SARII q S q model did not take into account many important ingredients that take part a key role in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 such as the influence of the latency period, the inhomogeneous disease transmission network, the influence of the measures already considered to fight the coronavirus diseases, the features of the individuals (for example, the influence of the stage-structure, individuals who are already medically unfit).",

In a more general way the basic reproduction number R 0 can be stated as the number of new infections created by a typical infective population at a disease free equilibrium. R 0 < 1 determines on average an infected population creates less than one new infected population during the course of its infective period, and the infection can die out. In reverse way, R 0 > 1 determines each infected population creates, on average, more than one new infection, and the disease can spread over the population.

Contour plot shows that for the higher values of \u03b2 s the reproduction number R 0 increases significantly, which means that the SARS-CoV-2 disease will persist among the human and spread throughout the community if the public not take the preventive measures.

After implementation of 3rd phase lockdown, the social distancing are enforced but not strong enough, as a result larger R 0 = 1.6302 and R 0 = 1.0245, which shows a substantial outbreak of COVID-19. But after implementation of fully operational and strict lockdown, after 31 May 2020, resulting a smaller R 0 = 0.4098, yields below 1.
