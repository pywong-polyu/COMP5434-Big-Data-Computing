Methods: The hospital records of the children aged less than 12 years with a final diagnosis of GBS at our hospital from November, 2015 to December, 2018 were reviewed. Disabilities were assessed at 8weeks and 6-month follow-up using Hughes scale (0-6). Results: Demyelinating variety in 57 patients (52.8%) was more common than the axonal variety (33.3%). 71.1% (32/45) of GBS patients had recovered (scale 0,1) during the follow up period of 6 months. These included 67.7% (21/31) of the axonal variety and 78.6% (11/14) of the demyelinating variety. Conclusion: Irrespective of the severity, disability is less with the demyelinating variety as compared with the axonal subtype.",

            "text": "In a study by Korinthenberg, et al. [10] on 95 children there was an improvement of 96% (91/95) (75% Grade 0 and 21% Grade 1) at the end of an observation period of 288 days. They had 74% of the demyelination subtype, which probably explains their excellent outcome. Kalra, et al. [2] in their studies in 52 children conducted in northern India revealed a recovery rate of 87.5% at 1 year follow up and 95% thereafter. In a study from southern India, Kannan, et al. [15] all 43 children recovered (Grade1,2) at 6 month follow up. They reported a mix of axonal (44.2%) and demyelinating (48.8%) subtypes. Recently Yadav, et al. [1] studied 36 children and reported a recovery rate of 84.4% (27/32) (Grade 1,2) at 3 month follow up. Their predominant subtype was the axonal variety (69.4%). We had a higher number of axonal variety in follow up as compared to the demyelinating subtype (31 vs 14) . This was probably due to persistence of weakness in axonal type which also explains the poorer outcome of our study. Data has been difficult to analyze as a few studies [1, 15] have used a Hughes disability score of 1 and 2 to discuss outcome while others [2, 10] , including the present study, have used a score of 0 and 1. More meaningful comparisons could have been done if the same disability scores were used. The overall prognosis in most studies was excellent and it has been observed by most of the studies that a longer duration of follow-up showed improved disability ratings and scores [1, 6, 10] .",
