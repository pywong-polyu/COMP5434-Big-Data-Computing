Between 30 and 90 days after transplant, when T-cell immunity is still limited, there is a rise in the numbers of fungal and CMV infections. Later infections are more commonly caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV) or S. pneumoniae.

Measles is an important respiratory pathogen in the immunocompromised host and it must be remembered that the typical rash may not develop. Mortality can be high, especially amongst patients with leukaemia and those undergoing HSCT. A prospective multi-center review of patients undergoing HSCT found direct RSV-associated mortality to be 17.4%, and mortality directly attributable to influenza A to be 15.3% (Ljungman et al., 2001) . Respiratory viruses often present with non-specific symptoms but progress to a significant lower respiratory tract infection. Chest x-ray will often show a pneumonitis picture with diffuse interstitial changes. HRCT may show peri-bronchial thickening and ground glass attenuation without consolidation in a lobular distribution. Diagnosis requires identification of the organism from respiratory secretions. This may be possible on nasopharyngeal secretions or throat swab but may require more invasive testing, such as bronchoscopy and BAL. Laboratory techniques include immunofluorescence, PCR and viral culture. Treatment is mainly supportive, but specific treatment options are evolving, making rapid and accurate diagnosis increasingly important. Appropriate isolation and infection-control measures are essential to prevent transmission between immunocompromised patients, as these viruses can be easily spread. One UK study in a HSCT unit identified 10 cases of RSV over one winter season, and eight of the nine RSV strains that could be tested by molecular methods were found to be identical (Taylor et al., 2001) .",

Symptomatic infection and virus shedding can be prolonged; for example, one case report of a child undergoing HSCT for cartilage hair hypoplasia demonstrated Norovirus shedding for 156 days following transplant, during the period of immune reconstitution. The child was symptomatic throughout this time (Gallimore et al., 2004) . Again, there is no specific treatment but meticulous management of fluids, electrolytes and nutritional support is essential, allowing time for immune reconstitution and consequent viral clearance.",

Those most at risk are patients who receive allogeneic bone marrow transplant, those with active graft versus host disease and those who receive total body irradiation. There are a number of different species of adenovirus, and these are divided into serotypes, some of which are primarily associated with the respiratory tract, while others have a predilection for the gastrointestinal tract. Young children are particularly vulnerable, as they often carry adenovirus in their gastrointestinal tract, predisposing them to reactivation and dissemination when they become immunocompromised. In view of this, screening can be important in the immunocompromised and adenovirus is usually identified in urine, stool, or sometimes respiratory secretions prior to being identified in blood. A study of 132 patients undergoing HSCT were screened for adenovirus in stool, urine, on throat swab and in peripheral blood during the post transplant period. 27% had a positive adenoviral PCR on at least one screening test, but this was not associated with clinical signs unless it was detected in peripheral blood and, even then, there was a median delay of 3 weeks from first detection of adenovirus until the patient demonstrated clinical signs. In one study, mortality was as high as 82% in those with adenovirus detected on peripheral blood.

Once organisms are identified from blood culture, antibiotics can be tailored appropriately. Antibiotic \"locks\" can be used alongside systemic antibiotics to reduce colonization within the CVC. Antibiotic \"locking\" involves instilling 1-2 ml of concentrated antibiotic solution in to the CVC and leaving it for a pre-determined time before removal. Antibiotics used in studies to treat CVC colonization have included vancomycin, amikacin and minocycline. There is also limited evidence on the use of amphotericin locks. Studies have attempted to look at whether using locks alone or in combination with systemic antibiotics has benefits. The results are variable and, at this stage it must be concluded that locks are a useful adjunct to systemic treatment.

Fever with neutropenia in any immunocompromised child should be acted on promptly. However, exactly how this is defined and what is appropriate management varies widely. This was highlighted by a recent review of febrile neutropenia management in the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group centers (Phillips et al., 2007) . There was wide variation in the definition of fever (from persistent temperature higher than 37.5 \u2022 C to a single reading of 39 \u2022 C) and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1 \u00d7 10 9 , < 0.75 \u00d7 10 9 or < 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 ). Empirical antibiotic regimes also varied greatly, including aminoglycosides plus a second agent (piperacillin based, cephalosporin or carbapenem), carbapenem alone or, in two cases, cefuroxime plus flucloxacillin and ciprofloxacin plus ceftazidime. Timing of the anti-fungal therapy was even more variable, in terms of when to start and the duration of empirical treatment. Some of this variation can be explained by variations in organisms isolated and antibiotic sensitivity from unit to unit, but this does not seem to account for all the differences in practice. Therefore, although local findings should influence presenting patterns, further work is required to devise a framework within which local policies that target specific patient populations and microbiological flora are implemented.

Organisms that result in mild, self-limiting illness in an immunocompetent host can have catastrophic effects on an immunocompromised child. Signs and symptoms are often less specific and finding a causative organism can be more difficult. It is important to have a low threshold for thinking about infections and looking for them. Negative tests should not be taken to be reassuring if there is clinical suspicion and it may be necessary to look further and more closely. It is important to develop a good relationship with local microbiology and virology laboratories to aid this process. Once an infection is identified, it must be acted upon quickly as delay may be disastrous. Treatment of any infection in an immunocompromised child is likely to be more intense and prolonged than in a child with a fully functioning immune system. It is also important to consider prophylaxis for specific patient groups in specific situations (e.g. post HSCT) and each unit should have defined policies and guidelines to follow for these patients.",
