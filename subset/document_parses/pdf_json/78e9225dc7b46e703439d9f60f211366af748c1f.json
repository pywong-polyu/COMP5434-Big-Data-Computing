The aim of this study is to describe the COVID-19 orthopedic trauma patients characteristics and management in a dedicated Orthopedic and Traumatology Hospital in Italy during the first pandemic period. Material and methods A cohort of 25 consecutive patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Health system rearrangement, patients' clinical presentation, diagnostic tools role, laboratory finding, treatment and outcomes were evaluated. Results Health system rearrangement was fast. There was no clear prevalence of comorbidity or surgery type between confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. Nine positive swabs tests and 14 cases with only suspected CT scan findings were recorded. Several laboratory changes have been reported since the onset of symptoms: anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, coagulation abnormalities, alkaline phosphatase, liver enzymes and C-reactive protein alterations. Nineteen patients were treated by oxygen supplement, three patients were administered antivirals, eight antibiotic therapy, and nine hydroxychloroquine. The number of discharges reported in this study was greater than 52% and the number of deaths reached 20%. Conclusion To our experience, the development of patient management algorithms allows the differentiation of the clinical pathways of negative and suspected/positive patients, reducing exposure, and virus spreading. The execution of swabs on all patients allows an early diagnosis and a more adequate management. Considering the different therapy patterns used, there were no significant differences, but anti-thromboembolic prophylaxis administered to all the orthopedic patients may have contributed to complications and mortality rates reduction.",

Considering the 14 femoral fractures, out of the suspected COVID-19-related pneumonia, only two patients had positive swabs, while eight had suspect CT scan; two had false positive CT scan, being affected by COPD exacerbation and cardiopulmonary congestion.

This variability does not allow to establish whether surgical procedure was significant to influence the prognosis, but according to the results of this study (Table 5) , surgical procedure may represent a risk factor for COVID-19 infection to become symptomatic, by depressing the immune system [15] . Deceased patients had several risk factors of poor outcome including age, type of fracture, and multiple comorbidities [12] . Moreover, since all the five patients had negative test for swabs and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was performed on the evidence of interstitial-alveolar pneumonia by HRCT, doubts may arise on the role of COVID-19 infection.",

The development of a patient management algorithms allows the differentiation of the clinical pathways of negative and suspected/ positive patients, reducing exposure, and virus spreading. Patient management protocols implemented beginning late April allowed an earlier diagnosis, since the swabs were performed to all new admitted patients. Further research is required to optimize treatment strategies, establish shared protocols and gain a better understanding on COVID-19 patient's characteristics and possible risk factors related to trauma surgery.",
