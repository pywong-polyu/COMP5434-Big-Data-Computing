While it is fully dependent on the helper virus for its packaging, HDV has no significant sequence similarity to HBV; its replication is independent of HBV and its geographic prevalence is different [30] . HDV is a single stranded RNA virus. It replicates through a double rolling-circle mechanism, probably using RNA polymerase II and cellular transcriptional machinery [8, 22] . Two detectable HDV antigens (HDAg) are encoded by a single open reading frame on the antigenomic strand. The large antigen (L-HDAg) is a result of RNA editing which extends the protein coding sequence of the small antigen (S-HDAg) by 19 residues; L-HDAg appears later in infection, suppresses replication and initiates viral packaging [7, 25] . The small antigen (S-HDAg) is essential for viral replication and is proposed to facilitate the interactions between the cellular transcriptional machinery and the viral template. The central domain of S-HDAg, which is involved in binding to the viral genome, contains two arginine-rich motifs (ARMs) bracketing a leucine zipper. Mutational analysis indicates that both the ARMs and the leucine zipper region are essential for binding to the HDV genome [32] . Using sequence analysis methods we have discovered significant sequence similarity between this central domain of HDAg and the HMG (High Mobility Group) box of the SRY gene [40] , whose product binds to DNA and is essential for sex determination.

Each row of a profile describes a single position in the alignment; its 20 values estimate the likelihood that each of the 20 possible amino acid residues occurs at this position in the alignment. Two additional values in each row represent the position-specific likelihood of gap initiation and extension. Evolutionary profiles improve the description of multiple sequence alignments by modeling varying rates of sequence change at each position in the sequences: each position is modeled using the most appropriate scoring matrix to reflect its rate of change. Sequence weighting, based on a modification of Felsenstein's method [19] , was performed prior to profile construction, so that the contribution of each sequence to the evolutionary profile is proportional to the amount of unique information it contributes to the multiple alignment. Structure-based profiles (to be described elsewhere) are constructed using scoring matrices based on secondary structure information. Each position in the alignment is described as a mixture of four distributions -one for each of the secondary structures (helix, sheet, turn and coil). Each distribution is weighted by the likelihood of the observed residue distribution at a given position being found in a specific secondary structure.

One sequence was shuffled and then realigned to the other sequence under the initial conditions.

A Z score less than 3.0 indicates that the similarities between two sequences are unlikely to be significant and are probably due to biased composition.

This compositional bias may reflect structural and functional constrains placed upon the RNA or DNA-binding domain, and could therefore suggest sequence convergence rather than a common evolutionary origin. Thus the high values for percent identity and similarity in compositionally biased alignments are less significant than in compositionally unbiased sequences. To address the effects of the local compositional bias we used a Monte Carlo analysis -a process that compares the alignment of interest with alignments of the randomly generated sequences of the same composition. Z scores above 6.0 indicate that the alignment of interest supports the inference of homology in spite of compositional biases. The high Z score (Z score = 6.85) of SRY-HDAg alignment argues that the HDAg sequence is more similar to the HMG domain of SRY than to any randomly assembled sequences of the same composition. Therefore, the compositional constraints alone upon the functional domain cannot explain the observed level of sequence similarity between HMG domain of SRY and HDAg. While it is possible that the unusual degree of sequence similarity is due to convergent evolution to an energetically favorable nucleic acid binding structure, one must keep in mind that there are a nearly unlimited number of ways to create a polypeptide that will fold into a given three-dimensional shape.

In all known cases, the binding of HMG box proteins causes distortion or a bend in the DNA [38] . Our model therefore predicts that HDAg will induce a similar bend when binding to the HDV genome. HDAg exhibits binding specificity which appears to be determined primarily by the structure of the HDV RNA. However some sequence specificity is required, since HDAg binds specifically to both a rod-like structure comprising the entire HDV genome, and to a multiple stem-and-loop structure formed by the fragment containing the ribozyme domain of HDV, but does not bind to the double-stranded RNA derived from an unrelated coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus) [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 400, "end": 404, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 498, "end": 502, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1066, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HDAg-SRY structure comparison"}, {"text": "HMG proteins can be divided into 3 major groups based on their size, sequence similarities and DNA-binding properties: HMG-1/-2, HMG-14/-17 and HMG-I/Y [2] .

The sequence similarity between HMG-1 and the RNA-binding domain of HDAg begins within the terminal unit and continues through first and second \u2423-helices (h1 and h2). Together, these structures comprise the side of a flat-shaped arrowhead which is proposed to lie along the minor groove and continue into the major groove of the DNA [38] . Interactions between the terminal unit and the DNA are absolutely essential [38] . The sequence of the terminal unit is conserved between SRY and HDAg, and it is also similar to regions of HMG1/Y proteins, perhaps explaining why a database search with the RNA-binding domain of HDAg showed similarity to several HMGI/Y sequences (see 'Database searches' section in Results). Helix 3 of HMG-1 comprises the other side of the arrowhead and is proposed to lie along the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA [38] ; there is little sequence similarity between this helix and HDAg -there appears to be a deletion in the corresponding region of HDAg. However, the region immediately following helix 3 has a stretch of basic residues that could be aligned with the right ARM of the RNA-binding domain of HDAg (Fig. 3A) . It is notable that the residues proposed to be involved in contacting DNA (terminal unit) and those whose substitution is likely to cause gross structural perturbations (e.g. replacement of the small residue at position 40, or the presence of phenylalanine at position 11, Fig.  3 ) are conserved among the HMG boxes of SRY, HMG-1 and the RNA-binding domain of HDAg. Gly-40 is proposed to pack closely to Phe-10 in the first helix in the resolved structure for HMG1.2 of hamster [38] . These two residues are also preserved within the RNA-binding domain of HDAg.

Another notable feature is the lack of tryptophan residues in the RNA-binding domain (SRY has 3 tryptophan residues, SOX3 has 2 tryptophan residues and HMG-1 has 1 tryptophan residue) and an overall lower percentage of the hydrophobic residues.

The ribozyme activities of HDV, such as self-cleavage and self-ligation, further resemble the properties of the viroid. A possible mechanism explaining the origin of HDV -the only known animal virus with a circular RNA genome -involves the capture of a cellular transcript by a viroid. The elegant capture mechanism proposed by Brazas and Ganem [5] involves the fusion of the cellular and viral transcript, and duplication of the cellular transcript during the synthesis of the antisense strand, followed by the recircularization of the entire transcript (Fig. 5) . The size of the SRY protein matches the HDV size requirements: SRY is 204 residues long; duplication of the SRY RNA would result in a cellular part of HDV over 1200 bases long (the exact length will depend on the length of the non-coding regions of the SRY transcript). This agrees with the approximately 1300 bases of highly self-complementary RNA of cellular origin in HDV. The replication of HDV is conducted by cellular machinery, with the addition of HDAg. HDAg is absolutely required for in vivo HDV replication [32] and serves as a bridging factor between the viral template and cellular transcriptional complex. Coopting a single component of the cellular Fig. 5 . Possible mechanism of HDV formation. A Viroid sense strand joins at the 3 -end of SRY transcript. B Replication begins at the 3 -end of the viroid and proceeds through SRY, synthesizing an antisense of the viroid genome and of the SRY transcript. A hairpin structure at the 5 -end of SRY template allows transcription to continue synthesizing a complement of the SRY-that is a sense version of SRY transcript. The resulting construct has an antisense strand of the viroid, followed by the antisense copy of SRY followed by the sense copy of SRY. C Circularization of the linear transcript. D Additional round of replication results in the reversal order of the regions: viroid region (sense) is followed by antisense strand of SRY, which in turn is followed by the sense strand of SRY. E Subsequent evolution of the genome results in the organization of domains seen in the HDV today: a viroid region is followed by an antisense of HDV antigen followed by a non-coding region which is highly complementary to the region coding for the HDV antigen transcriptional machinery and adapting its specificity to prefer the viral template is an elegant way to ensure viral replication and survival. It is notable that the tissue-specificity of SRY does not match that of HDV: SRY is expressed primarily in germ cells and in somatic cells of the testis [51] , while HDV is restricted to liver tissue. It has been shown experimentally, however, that the replication of the HDV can proceed in the skeletal muscle [37] . A low level of SRY could be expressed in other tissues, including the liver, allowing for transcript capture, or alternatively, HDV could have evolved from an SRY-related gene specifically expressed in liver, such as SOX-18 [15] . Finally, it is possible that the expression of original viroid was not confined to liver cells and the initial capture event of cellular RNA could have occurred in a stem or germ cell where SRY is abundantly expressed [51] .
