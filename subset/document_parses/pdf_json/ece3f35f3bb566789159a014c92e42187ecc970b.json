Given the high morbidity and mortality of sepsis and septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign was initiated globally to help improve the treatment of sepsis and septic shock (J.-S. et al. 2011) . Consequently, a great effort is needed to find new, and more effective therapeutic agents for sepsis/septic shock (Chiao et al. 2013) . In this study, we sought to employ a systematic drug repositioning (Katsila et al. 2016; Lavecchia and Giovanni 2013) bioinformatics approach to identify novel FDA-approved candidate drugs to treat sepsis (Pushpakom et al. 2019) . We proposed a new approach to identify therapeutic drugs for sepsis from existing small molecular compounds, by investigating the difference of functional pathways and the gene expression profile of blood nucleated cells in patients with sepsis and normal control group. This method comprehensively considers the genome expression profile in the state of sepsis, and finds the drugs to reverse the changes of gene expression through pattern matching.",

The role of Tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) -induced necroptosis in promoting the pathophysiology of sepsis has been identified. Necroptosis induced by TNF-\u03b1 initiates downstream signaling cascades driving the production of a wide array of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Necroptosis mediated SIRS and associated proflammatory cytokine storms are increasingly recognized as an important pathogenic mechanism of sepsis (Duprez et al. 2011; Lei et al. 2014) . Blocking TNF-\u03b1-induced necroptosis might be useful in mitigating the cytokine storm and preventing severe sepsis clinically. Thus, effective prevention of necroptosis is expected to improve the prognosis of sepsis patients (Wynn et al. 2008 ). However, no mature inhibitors of necroptosis are currently in clinical use (Moerke et al. 2019) . Therefore, the role of candidate drugs from our previous bioinformatics analysis was verified by the TNF-induced necroptosis cellular model in vitro and the TNF-\u03b1induced SIRS mouse model in vivo in our study.",

TNF-\u03b1, cytokine that plays a key role in sepsis, triggers necroptosis in response to tissue injury and inflammation (Xagorari, Roussos, and Papapetropoulos 2010) . The most pertinent information regarding necroptosis was derived from studies of TNF-\u03b1 induced necroptosis (Junying et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2014; Shan et al. 2018 ). Using a bioinformatics analysis and the drug repositioning strategy, we predicted a set of potential drug candidates for sepsis and validated the effectiveness of drug using both in vitro and in vivo models of TNF-\u03b1-induced necroptosis. Our experimental validation found that the candidate drug linifanib effectively inhibited necroptosis, SIRS and related tissue damage.",

The Library of Integrated Network-BasedCellular Signatures (LINCS) contains the characteristics of drug functional genomics and drug metabolomics of individual cells. Human cell lines were treated with small molecular compounds, and then the multi-level cell responses before and after cell treatment were compared(Keenan et al. 2018).There is a high correlation between human gene expression, and it is possible to calculate the expression levels of different genes. The L1000 library in LINCS makes use of the correlation between gene expression, it mainly uses small molecular compounds to treat human cell lines, then 978 genes were identified as genome-wide marker genes in 384 well plate based on large-scale statistical analysis. The expression of other genes can be calculated by measuring the expression of marker genes. The experimental results show that the changes of nearly 1000 genes adopted by L1000 can represent about 80% of the gene change information of human(Subramanian et al. 2017).The gene set of drug perturbation experimental data in LINCS can be divided into three parts: (1) Landmark space. It contains 978 landmark genes, which is based on the probe fluorescence intensity data measured by the experiment, scaled and standardized after calculation with the control group.

All animal care and experimental procedures complied with the National Institutes of Health guidelines(NIH publications Nos. 80-23, revised 1996)  and under the approval of the Ethical Committee of the Three Gorges University Laboratory Animal Center.For TNF-induced SIRS model, male C57BL/6 J mice (8-10 weeks old) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Mice were raised in a SPF facility with a pathogen-free environment (23 \u00b1 2\u00b0C and 55 \u00b1 5% humidity) of 12:12hour light/dark cycle at the Three Gorges University Laboratory Animal Center.The animal protocols were approved by the Standing Animal Care Committee at China Three Gorges University. Compounds were suspended in distilled water containing 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium. In drug treatment groups, mice were given linifanib by p.o.gavage 30min before TNF injection. Mouse TNF-\u03b1 (mTNF-\u03b1) were diluted in endotoxin-free PBS and injected i.v. (5ug/mice) in a volume of 200\u03bcl. Rectal body temperature was recorded with an electric thermometer. Lung tissues were collected at indicated times after sacrificing the mice. At the end of the experiment, mice were sacrificed with an overdose of anaesthetic (i.v. injection of 1.2% avertin solution; 0.2 ml per 10 g). RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR. The mRNA levels of lung tissues from SIRS model mice were analyzed at 6h after injection of TNF\u03b1. Total lung RNA was extracted with the FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kit V2 (RC112-01, Vazyme) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the HiScript III RT SuperMix (R323-01, Vazyme).Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Q311-02,",
