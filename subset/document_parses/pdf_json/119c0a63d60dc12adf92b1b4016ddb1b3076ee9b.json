Deep classification models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), require large-scale datasets in order to be trained and perform properly. Since the number of X-ray samples related to COVID-19 is limited, transfer learning (TL) appears as the go-to method to alleviate the demand for training data and develop accurate automated diagnosis models. In this context, networks are able to gain knowledge from pretrained networks on largescale image datasets or alternative data-rich sources (i.e. bacterial and viral pneumonia radiographs). The experimental results indicate that the TL approach outperforms the performance obtained without TL, for the COVID-19 classification task in chest X-ray images.",

In particular, like other types of pneumonia (e.g. bacterial pneumonia), on thoracic \u03a7-rays of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, is observed an increased (whiter) density of lungs. Usually, the more severe the disease, the more intense the whiteness on the chest X-rays. In the typical case, ground-glass opacity occurs, with possible simultaneous existence of linear opacities (e.g. peripheral horizontal white lines), resulting in slightly obscured lung markings (Figure 1a) . It is underlined that in severe cases the lung markings become invisible due to the dense whiteness, a phenomenon known as consolidation (Figure 1b) [9] . Hence, utilizing chest radiography, or combining it with laboratory and clinical assessment, can be an efficient tool for the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

In the first procedure, the output of the deep learning model indicates the existence or the absence of the infection, in a given X-ray image. In the second method, the algorithm provides bounding boxes that indicate the location and the dimensions of the infected areas, in the patient's lung. The latter approach involves pixel-based classification methods (e.g. Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) [40] , U-Nets [41] , and Mask R-CNN [42] ), thus defining precisely the shape of the symptomatic areas.",

Figure 4 depicts the performance metrics in terms of precision and recall, for the test set of Dataset_1. More specifically, Model_1, which was trained from scratch performed reasonably well (93.03% precision and 92.17% recall) in the classification task. However, Model_2, which has a matching architecture with Model_1, but trained by utilizing transfer learning techniques, provides improved results, achieving 95.69% precision and 95.62% recall. Lastly, Model_3 (ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet dataset) results in even better outcomes (97.73% precision and 97.67% recall), due to (i) its more complex architecture, and (ii) the transfer learning capabilities, enabled by the pretrained model. Figure 5 illustrates the performance metrics in terms of accuracy and F1-score, for the test set of Dataset_1. Similar to the above, Model_3 achieved the highest scores (97.66% accuracy and 97.61% F1-score). At the same time, Model_2 (95.65% accuracy and 95.49% F1-score) outperformed Model_1 (92.32% accuracy and 92.46% F1-score), by utilizing knowledge from other similar sources (i.e. viral pneumonia). This implies that through transfer learning the error rate of the deep learning model, which is demonstrated in Figure 3 , was reduced to a factor of almost two.",

In parallel, the proposed networks differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia. Bearing in mind that the number of chest radiographs related to COVID-19 is limited, transfer learning can contribute to effectively train the deep models, by transferring knowledge from other data-rich sources and pretrained networks. The results of this study indicate that the transfer learning approach outperforms the performance obtained without transfer learning, for the COVID-19 classification task. .
