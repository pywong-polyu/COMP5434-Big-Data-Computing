However, the current development in Swedish primary care is to blend digital solutions with traditional solutions. This paper addresses this development by examining the normalization of embedding and integrating a digital health care platform into everyday care routines in a primary care clinic. The digital health care platform enables both synchronous (video calls) and asynchronous (chat) communication, as well as self-registration of patient data using automated questions and forms requiring the patient's input.",

Our findings provide insights into how individual and collective actions can be supported to embed and integrate a digital platform into everyday care routines. Primary health care organizations need to involve HCPs throughout the implementation process by reorganizing work and providing frequent feedback loops. HCPs are more likely to engage with and commit to changing practices if they perceive the digital platform to be beneficial compared with the current practice. However, they also need resources (eg, time, training, and continuous support) to put the platform into practice. Patient engagement and appraisal are important elements in implementation. Unless patients are willing to use the platform, there is no motivation for HCPs to embed the digital platform into everyday care practice.",

The digital transformation of health care is associated with the promise of an improved public sector, with self-care and greater self-management of the health of individuals, resulting in increased cost efficiency. Digitalization in primary care entails converting parts of the care process from analog to digital to meet the needs of citizens, patients, decision-makers, HCPs, and clinics. In Sweden, the digital transformation of primary care has involved several different kinds of digital solutions, including web-based physicians (general practitioners performing digital consultations) [3] , self-monitoring mobile apps [4] , patient access to their electronic medical records (OpenNotes) [5] , digital reminders for medication [6] , and digital platforms for patient management [7, 8] . This paper concerns the normalization process of a digital platform for patient management. The platform, which will be referred to as Wolf in this paper, was developed by a Swedish company and is procured and used by both private and publicly run primary health care centers and other primary care operations. In Sweden, all types of primary care are tax funded. Both public and private primary care providers enjoy a large degree of economic autonomy. This means that capital investment decisions, such as the one studied here, are made by the owners of the primary care providers, who also finance the investments. Such investments have no direct effect on user fees and are made in the hopes of providing more efficient and less costly services.",

            "text": "The same digital platforms as studied in this paper have been studied in different primary care settings [7] [8] [9] . However, the findings show diverse results and have not explicitly focused on the normalization process. For example, Entezarjou et al [9] investigated how family medicine physicians and nurses at primary care centers experienced the implementation and use of digital communication in the form of automated patient interviewing software and chat-based patient-provider communication. Their findings indicated that the use of the digital platform streamlined consultations with patients and improved interdisciplinary communication. The study also found that digitalization was perceived as essential because of the expectations of patients and HCPs. However, their interviewees acknowledged that digital communication did not suit all patients and all kinds of patient requests, and thus, they perceived the platform as only a partial solution [9] . Cajander et al [7] studied a digital platform, which they called a digitalized and automated patient-centric service, in their research on how it affected work engagement among nurses in a national telephone nursing service. They found that nurses felt stressed by having to deal with many patients in parallel, knowing that patients were waiting in the queue to chat with them. As the chat function offered asynchronous communication, the nurses spent time waiting for patients to respond and checking over and over to see whether any patients in parallel, ongoing conversations had responded while, at the same time, a queue of new patients was piling up. Another disadvantage highlighted by the nurses was the lack of feedback from physicians and patients. This finding contrasts with the findings of Entezarjou et al [9] , who indicated that the digital platform increased interdisciplinary communication and streamlined patient consultations. However, it is not clear whether the lack of feedback was because of the use of the digital platform or whether this was also common in the ordinary care routine before the implementation of the platform [7] . Another study [8] of the same platform, conducted at primary care centers, indicated that written communication with patients was perceived as more time consuming than communication by phone. It also produced large amounts of text, which made it more difficult to quickly scan information to get an overview of patient concerns. These findings are also somewhat at odds with the finding of Cajander et al [7] that nurses felt that written communication with patients was less emotionally demanding. The prime advantage of using the digital platform, according to Eldh et al [8] , was the possibility for patients to upload photos, which reduced physical patient visits. Their findings indicated that the system of automated triage facilitated response and consultation with patients. They conclude that the HCPs in the study lacked the resources needed to benefit from the platform and settled upon different routines themselves, with varied results [8] .",

            "text": "The findings of the aforementioned studies indicate that several intertwined factors rather than just the digital platform per se affect the outcome in care practice. Thus, technology adaption and implementation in primary care are not straightforward; rather, it is a complex process that is affected by multiple factors (technological, social, structural, historical, economic, and political), different actors (HCPs, patients, next-of-kin, management, and politicians), organizations, ecologies of technologies, and core ideas (eg, patient safety, patient access, and efficiency). These are interrelated and afford certain kinds of care and working conditions while restraining others [10] [11] [12] . Past research shows that the implementation of this type of digital platform is a complex process involving a wide range of actors who translate means, actions, and objectives into care practices in different ways [13] and do not always render the expected effects [7] . Furthermore, early research on digital implementation in health care has been accused of being rich in data but information poor [10] . However, several theoretical tools for comprehending and illuminating implementation failures or successes have been developed [10, [13] [14] [15] [16] . One such explanatory framework is the normalization process theory (NPT) [15] . NPT identifies and explains the important mechanisms that promote or inhibit the implementation process. It allows for a systematic exploration of how and why (or not) a digital health care platform becomes normalized and sustained in health care practice. NPT \"characterizes and explains implementation processes as interactions between 'emergent expressions of agency' (i.e. the things that people do to make something happen, and the ways they work with different components of a complex intervention to do so); and as 'dynamic elements of context' (the social-structural and social-cognitive resources that people draw on to realize that agency)\" [17] . Other theoretical frameworks that have been used to better understand the implementation processes concerned with digital technologies in health care are the Rogers [18, 19] diffusion of innovations theory and the technology acceptance model [20, 21] . Although the latter is primarily concerned with the characteristics at the individual level that affect individuals' intentions to use the technology, the former attempts to connect the macro level to the micro level or context of use. However, although the Rogers [18, 19] diffusion of innovation theory considers the context, it does not account for the dynamics of the context in the way that NPT does.",

The names Albra, Wolf, and company D are thus fictitious). It has approximately 40 employees representing different health care professions. These physicians, nurses, psychologists, rehabilitation coordinators, and health care administrators provide care to approximately 10,000 patients, which makes Albra an average-sized Swedish primary care center. Albra has a team-based approach with close collaboration between different HCPs. Similar to many other primary care centers in Sweden, Albra uses a nurse-based triage of patient errands. This means that the first point of contact is a nurse, who, during the telephone conversation, assesses whether the patient needs to see a physician or another HCP in the team. Primary care nurses in Sweden are both registered nurses and nurses with specialist competence in primary care (district nurses). District nurses can prescribe some medications, such as topical steroids and antihistamines, usually after an in-person assessment. In addition to a varying number of remote patient contacts (usually by phone) and other patient-related administrative tasks, physicians usually meet between 10 and 20 patients daily, with visits varying between 15 and 45 minutes depending on the type of visit (emergency or planned follow-up of chronic diseases). These patients are often triaged by the first-contact nurses before the booking. Primary and secondary care use different electronic medical records, and patients have limited access to medical information from their records by accessing a national platform called 1177 with a bank ID.",

Thus, people not only make sense of an implementation based on their experience of it but also draw on promises, hopes, worries, and fears in regard to the new technology [27, 28] . As a result, before the implementation starts, people already have ideas about what the technology is and how and whether it fits into their worldview, habits, and work. These ideas are not fixed and stable but are part of an iterative and collective sense-making process. The analysis revealed that the interviewees had a shared understanding of the aim of implementing the digital platform.

When asked about the expected benefits of using the digital platform, the interviewees commonly mentioned the possibilities of increased patient access, easier contact with and access to patients, less time spent on phone calls, and nurses spending less time trying to reach physicians for advice about patients and their symptoms. The physicians particularly highlighted the expected benefits for nurses: spending less time on the phone with patients, tools for triage, and increased flexibility. The nurses, on the other hand, particularly highlighted the expected benefits for patients-spending less time trying to reach the health care center by phone and having the option of contacting it through the digital platform. The interviewees also had very similar conceptualizations of how the digital platform and its utility differed from existing practices. NPT emphasizes that differentiation is part of the sense-making process, as it relates to understanding how an innovation and its use will produce a new practice and how the new practice differs from the existing practice [15] . The idea of new practices resulting from the use of the digital platform was welcomed by the interviewees. They perceived that the platform would enable them to relocate some of the work to patients, who would fill in their own symptoms and medical history, answer the follow-up questions provided automatically based on what the patients had filled in, and upload pictures. The envisaged benefits of using the digital platform include the digital platform collecting and providing detailed information about patients, thus providing a foundation for analysis and decision-making. This, together with the chat and video functionality, was seen as more efficient than current practices in which prospective patients generally contact the Albra primary care center by phone.",

Furthermore, the platform and its utility in practice were regularly discussed and scrutinized, both before and during the implementation, during formal meetings between the management and the employees, and during informal meetings between colleagues. Frequent meetings fostered commitment and engagement in the implementation. Moreover, the implementation was conducted in close collaboration with the platform provider. Initially, the platform provider presented a digital platform to the management and a small group of employees. Thereafter, the provider conducted half-day training sessions with the HCPs.

They did not need to invest much time to understand how to use the platform, which was perceived as easy to use with an intuitive interface. The interviewees not only perceived the platform as easy to use and understand but also praised it for enhancing teamwork. Several of them mentioned that the platform enabled and facilitated teamwork between different HCPs. The platform did not configure them or negatively alter professional relations with patients or other HCPs; it supported their professional work, social roles, and responsibilities. The narrative of relief and less stress was pervasive in nurses' accounts of using the platform.",

This type of accessibility was important as the implementation was initiated early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The platform was also perceived as enabling flexibility in terms of which patients were requested to handle and when. Nurses could go through the list of patient requests and decide which ones needed urgent attention; which they could handle themselves; and which needed to be forwarded to a physician, psychologist, or other HCP. Another aspect regarding flexibility was that the HCPs did not have to get hold of the patients but could communicate via the platform at any time, whereas the patient could read the message at a time convenient for them. Thus, the platform extended accessibility across time and space.",

For example, the digital platform was not compatible with patients' electronic health care records (EHRs). As a result, the nurses used two screens when working with the digital platform: 1 for the EHR and 1 for the digital platform. They needed to be able to see the patient's medical history in the patient health care record and compare it with the data in the digital platform; they also needed to copy and paste data from the digital platform into the patient health care records. This, in turn, raised questions about how much data could just be copied and pasted from the digital platform or whether summaries were needed of the data that patients contributed by answering automated questions and filling in forms. At the time of our study, most of the interviewees said that they simply copied and pasted data from the digital platform directly into the EHRs. They noted that this approach resulted in the scattering of patient data within patient health care records. The alternative to copying and pasting would be to extract the data collected in the digital platform; however, this would require more work and thus reduce efficiency. However, the copy-and-paste procedure may result in extra time having to be spent comprehending the data in the EHRs and thus may have a negative effect on patient safety in the long run. This was not something that the interviewees mentioned; instead, the workarounds were discussed during frequent feedback loops with colleagues and the management. All were under the impression that this might be solved in the future or was something they would have to adjust to.",

The platform was also used to collect data from the patient's input, asking automated follow-up questions based on the patient's answers. Consequently, the platform directed what kind of questions the patient was given, resulting in automated triage.

Some patients made contact both by phone and via the digital platform, as the materiality of the technologies in practice enabled it. This, in turn, highlights that materiality is closely connected to usability and how design features are understood and used. However, Orlikowski [31] has shown in her work that the material and the social cannot be viewed separately as organizations, practices, people, social relations, power relations, digital systems, and so on and are interconnected [31] . In other words, materiality goes beyond focusing on material properties such as design features and interfaces. Furthermore, material properties are not stable entities but are subject to interpretations, reinterpretations, negotiations, and local adaptions [32] . Orlikowski [33] insists that it does not matter if a technology can do X, Y, or Z; if people do not perceive it as capable of doing X, Y, or Z, they will not use it, and as a result, the technology will not change the way they work [33] .",

Our findings indicate that the platform became normalized into everyday primary care routines. The work done before and during the implementation involved several actors and actions. The platform developers, who were clinicians, developed a platform to solve problems they faced when managing patients in everyday care practice. The development of the platform was iterative and involved HCPs throughout the development process. Thus, the problem and potential solutions were anchored in health care practices and easily translated by HCPs. Furthermore, the problem of inefficient patient management that the platform was expected to solve is well-known, both to HCPs and in society. As a result, it was readily accepted by patients as well.",

The constructs of NPT are intertwined and interrelated, and the implementation is a continuous process that reinforces sense making, commitment and engagement, and operationalization and appraisal or configuration [15, 17] . Translation studies show that translations are never completed but continuously negotiated and renegotiated. Thus, an initially successful implementation may turn into a failed or abandoned implementation [35] . As the study presented in this paper concerns only the first 6 months of the implementation, it is difficult to know whether the actors will sustain their involvement and engagement with the platform and whether the system will become a sustainable part of everyday care practice.",

However, the materiality of technology should not be neglected as every digital health care innovation designs certain kinds of care and working conditions or at least certain ways of providing care [36] . In our study, the materiality of the platform enabled communication between HCPs and both patients and colleagues across time and space (asynchronous communication without geographical boundaries). The platform required patient input, and the patient was guided through automated questions and forms. As a result, the platform not only stores and transmits information but also transforms the patient data process by automated triaging. Consequently, the patient's experiences of health and sickness are enacted and reproduced through the platform and its algorithms. As such, the platform has performativity and affects the HCPs' understanding of the patient's medical status and, in turn, the care given. Thus, the platform, the patients, the HCPs, and the social contexts they are part of are entangled and coconstitutive of each other [31, 37] . In other words, the platform and its materiality (eg, which actions and decisions it enables vs constrains) affect knowledge and power dynamics in primary care and, as a result, shape and mediate relations among HCPs, patients, and the health care center. This, in turn, raises ethical questions such as which norms and values are embedded in the platform and its algorithms. Further research is needed on the ethical dimensions of the platform and the effects of the platform's performativity.",

They were also actively involved in the implementation, had scheduled hours for working with patients through the platform, and had ongoing support from management and implementation champions. Furthermore, the platform and its materiality (eg, which actions and decisions it enables vs constrains) shaped and mediated relations among HCPs, patients, and the health care center. The findings imply that implementation outcomes for changing work practices do not rely only on microlevel actions and engagements, as shown by the NPT analysis. Implementations also depend on interrelations with macrolevel conditions such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (eg, physical distancing) and the dominant discourse on digitalization as a prerequisite for efficiency and accessibility. This, in turn, circles back and influences microlevel actions and engagements.",
