            "text": "The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 emergency is changing the competitive landscape by pushing companies to adapt to sudden change. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that want to survive must innovate their business. Antifragility represents the capability of a system to absorb shocks and get better, allowing it to overcome a crisis and improve its performance. The use of digital technologies by enterprises is expected to play an important role in building antifragility. The aim of this paper is to study how digital technologies can contribute to the development of antifragility in SMEs. This study analyzed the responses to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis of six small and medium-sized enterprises located in Calabria, South of Italy. All the six enterprises have turned the crisis into a business opportunity developing new products, investing in marketing and communication, or starting new collaborations. The research identifies the factors leveraged by the investigated organizations that enabled this anti fragile behavior. They include slack financial resources, strategic agility, and relations with research institutions. The study highlights the positive impact of digital technologies in developing antifragility. Results were summarized into research propositions to be tested in future confirmatory studies. The findings of the study are useful for researchers interested in antifragility and digital technologies in SMEs. The results are also important for entrepreneurs and managers of SMEs, since they can support their decisions in terms of survival and transformation of their companies.",

This entrepreneurial attitude makes them more comfortable in conditions of uncertainty compared to large organizations.

Flexibility, technical knowledge, creativity, are crucial when facing crisis and in general negative external events (Frare and Beuren 2021) . Ramezani and Camirinha-Matos (2020) summarized the internal skills which facilitate the development of antifragility: creativity, understood as the ability to grasp opportunities during a crisis/disaster; adaptability or flexibility, meaning the ability to change in response to major changes or disruptions; transformability, that is the ability to transform process, structure, and behavior to survive during a crisis. All these skills can be associated to the concept of strategic agility, that is the ability to identify and adapt structures and processes to new opportunities (Soni et al. 2014; Zitzmann 2014; Carvalho et al. 2012; Wieland and Wallenburg 2012) . Agility has been found to facilitate the success of SMEs in complex environments (Bianchi et al. 2017; Troise et al. 2022) . As a consequence, it is expected to facilitate antifragility in SMEs facing large crises. Gra\u00e7a and Camarinha-Matos (2017) , however, suggest that the organizational level might be inadequate to understand antifragility. The most adequate level is the business ecosystem level. In their study on the textile industry, Pal and colleagues have found that resilience depends as much on the internal resources of an organization as on its network of external relations (Pal et al. 2014) . With reference to supply chains, Asamoah and colleagues have found that external networking has a strong positive impact on the success in overcoming crises for SMEs (Asamoah et al. 2020) .",

A codification of the interviews was realized to identify the relevant concepts (Pratt 2009 ) and the relationships between them. First-order concepts were grouped together in second-order themes that describe data at higher lever (Clark et al. 2010 ). Finally, the second level concepts have been grouped into three aggregate dimensions (Silva et al. 2021 ). In the second phase, the results that emerged from the within-case analysis were compared with each other through a cross-case analysis to further modify the concepts identified in each of the three levels in the first phase until reaching their final version with an acceptable degree of internal coherence, between cases and data adaptation.

When discussing antifragility, such an attitude is often associated by the interviewees with the flexibility of the internal organization. In particular, internal processes are described as fluid (Mamouni Limnios et al. 2014 ). This combination of entrepreneurialism and flexibility is consistent with the definition of (strategic) agility (Ahamd et al. 2020; Ramaezani and Camirinha-Matos 2020), in particular with reference with SMEs (Troise et al. 2022) .

This means that, at least in part, the daily activity of entrepreneurs and employees takes place in the digital environment as once it took place in the real world. Firms perceive a digital dimension in their activities and those firms able to navigate this context prove to be more antifragile. In other words, as pointed out by previous studies (Depaoli et al. 2020) , the link between digital technologies and antifragility seems to rely on the intelligence of the digital world. On the other hand, digital communication, defined as the capability of communicating through digital channels, appears to be important for the value created to be visible for the customer (Park and Mithas 2020) .
