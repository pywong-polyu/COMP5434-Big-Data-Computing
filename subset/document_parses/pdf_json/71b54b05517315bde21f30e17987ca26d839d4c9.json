Here, convolutional neural networks with specific focus on to classify Covid-19 chest radiography images. The database comprises Covid-19, normal and viral pneumonia chest X-ray images with 800 different samples under each class. We evaluated the model on 500 images and the networks has achieved a sensitivity rate of 95% and specificity rate of 97%. The DenseNet121 Architecture performed slightly better, compared to other state of art networks. The performance achieved by the method proposed is very encouraging and the accuracy rates can be improved further with larger datasets. Apart from sensitivity and specificity rates, the proposed model is also compared on receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC) of each model. The model is implemented on the TensorFlow framework with the datasets that are publicly available for research community.",

Desai [4] has used a neural network type of classification and compared it with other machine learning approaches. This literature shows that neural network-based approach gives a better result when compared to other approaches. Apurva A. Desai has done this comparison for optical character recognition. Hidden Markov Model and fuzzy logic algorithm has been used on Urdu scripts by Muhammad Imran Razzak [5] for character recognition. The approach was evaluated on Nastaliq and Nasakh script-based languages. With around 26 time-invariant features and statistical features, the approach provided 87.4% and 74.1% of accuracy for Nastaliq and Nasakh scripts respectively. An effective optical character recognition system to recognize and identify the Persian character using Support Vector Machine (SVM) was proposed by Abdelhak Boukharouba [6] . Using chain code algorithm, a transition table in vertical and horizontal direction is extracted. The extracted feature is used for classification using an SVM classifier. Parshuram M. Kamble [7] have used a Feed Froward Artificial Neural Network (FFANN) for Marathi character recognition. Yang, Xu Lijia [8] , combined statistical and structural features to improve the accuracy when compared to other features. Additionally, they have utilized 184 epochs in CNN for increasing the accuracy. Amit Choudhary [9] , describes binarization feature extraction for English characters which increases the prediction rate in a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN).",

Further it is passed through 4 conv layers. The size of the last conv layer is [7 \u00c2 7] with 512 filters. Now, they are connected to a two fully connected layers with size of 4096. The FC layer is then connected to a softmax layer of size 1000. The softmax layer will classify the image based on the threshold and the features stored in the neurons.",

Table 1 shows the summary of the architecture. In DenseNet121 architecture a feed-forward connection is established from each layer to every other layer directly. A regular convolutional network with N layers has N connections between each subsequent layer, whereas the DenseNet121 has N(N\u00fe1)/2 straight connections. The DenseNet121 adopts a shorter connection between the initial and final layers that results in notable improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of the network. As the input progress through the subsequent layers, the feature maps from each layer is concatenated with the previous one. This enables the access of feature maps of any layer by the subsequent layers. The number of parameters is minimum when compared to a traditional convolutional neural network. The DenseNet121 reduces the vanishing gradient problem and implements feature reusing. The regularization effect of the network reduces the overfitting problem to a greater extent even for a smaller dataset which is shown in Table 2 .",
