In view of most recent information on testing activity [32], we present here an update of our initial work [4] . In this work, mathematical models have been developed to study the spread of COVID-19 among the population in Germany and to asses the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Systems of differential equations of SEIR type are extended here to account for undetected infections, as well as for stages of infections and age groups. The models are calibrated on data until April 5, data from April 6 to 14 are used for model validation. We simulate different possible strategies for the mitigation of the current outbreak, slowing down the spread of the virus and thus reducing the peak in daily diagnosed cases, the demand for hospitalization or intensive care units admissions, and eventually the number of fatalities. Our results suggest that a partial (and gradual) lifting of introduced control measures could soon be possible if accompanied by further increased testing activity, strict isolation of detected cases and reduced contact to risk groups.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 373, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "on the number of cases, in particular of those requiring hospitalization and intensive care, as well as deaths. Among the key parameters to be approximated by a mathematical approach is the so-called basic reproduction number (R 0 ), a metric which indicates the average number of secondary infections generated in a fully susceptible population by one infectious individual over the course of the infection. The basic reproduction number is a reference parameter in mathematical epidemiology used to understand if, and in which proportion, a disease will spread among the population. In simple disease transmission models, R 0 > 1 implies that the virus will spread in the population, and the larger the value of R 0 , the harder it is to control the epidemic. First studies on the initial outbreak in China estimated that the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 could range between 2.2 [24, 27] and 4.71 [33] , or could even be larger than 6 [34] . The (effective) reproduction number R for a given population is the corresponding time-dependent quantity which reflects the number of secondary infections generated by one infectious individual in the current population, and is affected by intervention measures aimed at controlling the spread of the disease. Among the first studies to asses the practical implications of public health interventions, Tang et al. [34] identified contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, as well as travel restrictions as the most effective measures to contain the epidemic.

We computed the sensitivity indices of the parameters that could not be determined from literature or are expected to vary between populations and time, in particular the transmission parameters, the probability of developing symptoms and the probability of being detected.

Distinguishing between people in different age groups the model allows for one thing to better characterize contacts between individuals (e.g. child-child contacts being typically different than senior-adult contacts, cf.

This matches with estimations of the RKI [31] and findings by other groups which are also currently studying the situation in Germany [9, 22] . This naturally results in a significant uncertainty of the projection since small deviations of the parameters can make the difference between further growing active case numbers or slowly declining numbers. We parametrized the model using, if possible, known or previously estimated parameter values, in particular those concerning the evolution of the disease (latency time, duration of infection, death rates), or plausible assumptions (e.g. for the relation between infectivity of detected and undetected infectives) as explained in Sec. 2 and the appendix. Uncertainties of parameters which could not be inferred from the literature or well identified from the data, were investigated via stochastic sampling and Sobol analysis (cf. Sec. 2). Such uncertainties could be reduced by integrating further data in the model, e.g. estimated contacts or estimates for the number of unreported cases. In our baseline scenario we assumed the current reporting ratio in Germany to be rather high (over 50% as of mid April). Assuming a lower reporting ratio yields more undetected cases, and therefore leads to a higher estimate of the reproduction number. Analogously, dropping the weekend effect increases the number of active cases at the peak. On the other hand, lower reporting ratios in early April provide a larger margin for improvement by enhanced testing as in our high vigilance scenario. The aggressiveness of the virus and hence the mortality among all affected individuals (whether diagnosed or not) is another unknown, but different assumptions about this parameter can be expected to have similar impacts on all the scenarios discussed here. It may be assumed that earlier detection (as in all our scenarios with enhanced testing) and hence earlier and better care for high risk patients may result in a mortality even below the one observed in Germany so far. The limited capacity of the health care system, in particular of intensive care units, was not yet directly considered as a parameter of our refined model. However, the predicted number of infected individuals at its peak can be used as a proxy for the expected demand for health care resources at the height of the epidemic.
