Moreover, data are limited on the long-term stability of proteins and nucleic acids in lyophilized samples. Here, we offer lyophilization protocols for various rat and mouse tissues (kidney, heart, liver, lung, aorta, and skin) coupled with technical hints for optimal sample preparation. We demonstrate that lyophilized samples stored at 4 \u00b0C for 20 months can yield protein and RNA of similar quantity and quality to \u221280 \u00b0C storage, while phosphorylated proteins are preserved as well. Freeze-dried and subsequently pulverized samples can provide more consistent, more reliable data especially when investigating focal injuries, such as fibrosis. We developed a protocol for the concentration of biological solutions and achieved 20-times concentration in human peritoneal dialysis effluent solution which enables the previously unattainable detection of proteins in these samples. We established a method for water removal as well as accurate water content measurement of fecal samples, which can be valuable for gut metabolome analysis. Taken together, lyophilization is a valuable tool for the preservation of biological samples with many advantages. We aim to draw attention to the wide range of possibilities offered by freeze drying in pre-clinical or basic research.",

            "text": "Water removal by vacuum freeze-drying of biological materials is a first-rate method of preservation that yields final products of the highest quality. Pharmaceutical applications include drying of labile pharmaceutical products, production of long-term stable vaccine formulations, preservation of nucleic acid-based pharmaceuticals, and development of micro-and nanoparticulate systems for drug delivery (Kasper et al. 2013) . Despite the numerous advantages, freeze drying has not become a routine method in research laboratories yet. Specific lyophilization protocols are scarce in the literature; the available recommendations lack specific details and are mainly limited to industrial use or a few specialized research applications (Chen et al. 2010; Fonte et al. 2016; Fornaguera et al. 2019 ). Thus, fine-tuning the right setups is labor-intensive and time-consuming for the everyday researcher (Tsinontides et al. 2004 ). Previous research demonstrated by quantity and quality measurements as well as biomolecular research methods such as RT-qPCR, copy number variation analysis, Western blot, gelatin zymography, SDS-PAGE, or even enzyme activity analysis that nucleic acids and proteins are well preserved in lyophilized samples (Damsteegt et al. 2016; Mareninov et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2012) , however, the maximum storage time that has Agnes Molnar and Tamas Lakat contributed equally to the manuscript been investigated was 1 year. The technique not only offers an appealing, yet untapped potential for long-term storage, but the use of lyophilized tissue samples may also improve validity and reproducibility and may reduce scatter in molecular biology research. Upon new protocol assessment one has to consider several process variables that influence the freeze-drying cycle (Tang and Pikal 2004) : freezing and drying times, temperature ramps, and pressure levels should be adjusted individually depending on product composition, structure, and volume (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "Lyophilization is a complex process consisting of three main steps: pre-freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying (Fig. 2a) . Sublimation is the principle driving force of primary drying (Fig. 2b) , which facilitates solvent removal from the sample, while product structure remains intact and enzymes stay inactive. For cycle optimization industrial application requires precise determination of the primary-drying endpoint, which is the longest part of the process. There are several methods for determining the primary-drying endpoint (Pisano 2020) however, most of these require analytical instruments that are not standard equipment in research laboratories. In the case of occasional use reducing process time usually takes a back seat behind elegance of the product and final moisture content. Therefore, our experiments were performed with a trial-and-error approach. According to this, our main consideration during the setup was to establish a protocol which results in a properly pulverizable product without any visible sign of residual moisture and the alteration of the structure. Images of lyophilized products can be found in Supplementary  Figure 3 . Furthermore, we used a Pt 100 probe to monitor ice sublimation. However, this method indicates the end of sublimation only in the region of the sensor, thus prolonged primary-drying time is recommended to avoid incomplete drying (Pisano 2020 ). In addition, lyophilized products were tested by further biological measurements to confirm the procedure's efficiency. Finally, a shorter final section of secondary drying with higher temperature enables molecularly absorbed moisture to evaporate as well (Pisano et al. 2012) . Based on the hypothesis that lower pressure improves drying rate, pressure is often decreased further during secondary drying. This is a general practice that we also applied. Duration of the pre-freeze step depends on initial sample temperature and volume. Primary drying takes about 10-20 h, while secondary drying is completed in 3-10 h depending on sample properties. Fig. 1 Modifiable process variables and crucial factors to consider for lyophilization optimization. To achieve perfect drying and to keep product structure intact, we need to avoid sample collapse, provide enough time for total drying and control the size of forming ice crystals. Ramp and time of drying, freezing rate, and temperature need to be adjusted based on the specific properties of different samples such as volume, structure, composition, and surface area. Exact physical properties of specific samples such as water content, drying rate, and glass transition temperature are usually determined by meticulous analytical measurements for cycle-optimized professional industrial usage. However, running a longer, safety optimized protocol based on estimated values is sufficient for laboratory application This paper offers detailed protocols for rat and mouse kidney, heart, liver, lung, and skin tissue lyophilization, human peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid concentration, as well as water and solvent removal from human fecal samples. We analyzed whether freeze-dried tissue samples can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for 20 months or more without quality impairment of RNAs and proteins. We conducted experiments to investigate the hypothesis that lyophilization and subsequent homogenization can be a superior method for sample preparation when investigating focal organ injuries, specific protein identification in human PD effluent (PDE) and metabolome analysis of fecal matter. Lyophilization may be an ideal choice in unexpected events such as the present pandemic when transportation and storage of biological materials at \u221280 \u00b0C is obstructed.",

Fig. 2 Theoretic background of lyophilization. a Typical freezedrying cycle: About 1 h pre-freeze ensures the product is below its eutectic temperature to avoid collapsing before chamber pressure is lowered. Shelf temperature is gradually increased until all the ice is removed from the product at the end of 10-20 h of primary drying. During sublimation the product temperature increment slows down (black framed area), which can be monitored by an appropriate temperature sensor placed in the sample. Chamber pressure should be below vapor pressure at all temperatures, but too low pressure makes sublimation slower due to lack of driving force. Eventually, 3-10 h-long secondary drying is applied at lower pressure and higher temperature to remove sorbed water and moisture. b Phase diagram of water with the lyophilization process indicated: product is frozen under normal atmospheric conditions, then at a temperature below the triple point pressure is lowered to reach vapor pressure where ice sublimates Fecal samples were collected from healthy, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome patients at the 1st Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis Protocols for lyophilization and their efficacy for various samples.

The mass of the dry specimen was subsequently measured and recorded. Extraction of the first fraction was performed using ethanol-20 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH = 7.5) 85:15 (v/v), while extraction of the second fraction was performed using a 15:85 (v/v) composition of the same liquids. 500 \u00b5L mixture was added to the dry sample with the container immersed in an ice bath and was shaken on an orbital shaker for 30 min at 200 rpm. The extraction procedure was repeated twice using each mixture, and the extracts were combined for metabolomic analysis.",

Upon testing the same protocol proved to be applicable for several other tissues irrespective of their individual properties, such as the heart, a tissue that contains large amount of muscle fibers; the liver which is rich in lipids; and the lung, a structurally fragile tissue which collapses easier (Fig. 3a) . The protocol had to be slightly modified for rat aorta and skin samples (Fig. 3b) , moreover, proper pulverization was hard to accomplish due to excessive elastic connective tissue content. Results of the Karl Fischer titration showed that residual moisture content was below 5% in all investigated tissue types (Fig. 3e) . Furthermore, lyophilized products were properly pulverizable and there were no signs of wet spots. Due to the smaller absolute size, same protocols can be used in the case of mouse tissues (data not shown).",

We rather decided to freeze-dry samples in vials because they can be closed immediately after the lid of the instrument is opened, and chance of sample loss and contamination can be reduced. Release the pressure very slowly and carefully at the end of lyophilization by opening the valves gradually one by one to prevent bigger airwaves blowing away small sample pieces and spilling ice condensates onto the dry samples.",

Liquids, such as peritoneal dialysis effluent fluids can be snap-frozen on the wall of the container by spinning in liquid nitrogen to provide larger surface for drying. The lid of the container should be open during the drying process. Pulverization of dried samples can be accomplished with a ceramic mortar and a pestle as well, but a TissueLyser machine with metal beads can also be used. Metal beads can be easily removed with a magnet minimizing sample loss. Based on our trial-and-error experiments it is highly recommended to cut solid tissue samples into tiny (~ 20 mm 3 ) pieces, thus larger drying surface can be attained, which significantly increases drying efficacy.

Prolonged exposure to hyperosmotic PD fluid (high glucose content and low pH) causes functional degradation of peritoneal membrane leading to failed ultrafiltration, causing many patients to discontinue their treatment. Therefore, monitoring the function of the peritoneal membrane is crucial. Current research focuses on the possible use of PDE as a \"liquid biopsy\" to detect biomarkers of certain pathophysiological conditions. However, due to their low concentration in PDE detection of these proteins is hardly possible without concentration. After 20 \u00d7 concentration of PDE using lyophilization we were able to detect profibrotic markers such as CTGF. Thus, lyophilization is a reliable and reproducible method to enrich low abundance but clinically relevant proteins in PDE or other biological samples.",

Freeze drying of fecal samples has emerged as a useful tool for microbiota transplantation treatment and metabolome research (Moosmang et al. 2019; Staley et al. 2017 ), but comprehensive setups have not been published yet. The protocol provided here can be beneficial for laboratories utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for metabolome analysis because removing liquid and volatile components from samples provides a highly pure, solvent free product without the degradation of components. Lyophilization of fecal samples minimizes bias caused by water content and better preserves the stability of short-chain fatty acids (Hsu et al. 2019) . Furthermore, accurate water content measurement by lyophilization is also used as a reference to validate other evaluation methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (Shiguetomi-Medina et al. 2017 ). In the metabolome analysis, more substances belonging to various classes of compounds could be detected from lyophilized human fecal samples compared to conventionally processed specimens.Reference: Reference [Hsu et al. 2019 ] was mentioned in the manuscript; however, this was not included in the reference list.

Focality and exact localization of the injury are usually not visually predictable especially in the case of small samples obtained from rats or mice. Contrarily, freeze-dried tissue can easily be pulverized (Rom\u00e1n et al. 2012 ) and a small portion of that homogenous powder used for protein or nucleic acid isolation is more representative to the whole tissue, than segmented parts from frozen samples. This is underlined in the present study, where the focality of fibrotic tissue accumulation in the kidney is clearly demonstrated on Masson's trichrome-stained sections. Consequently, Western blot and RT-qPCR measurements of fibrotic markers from frozen samples yielded considerably higher scatter and more outlier data points compared to lyophilized, pulverized ones. Thus, we propose another advantage of lyophilization is that more consistent and more reliable results are ensured.",
