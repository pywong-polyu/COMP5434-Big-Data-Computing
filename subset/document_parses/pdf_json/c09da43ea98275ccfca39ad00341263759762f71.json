Two previously reported cases suffered dry cough and interstitial pneumonia [8] . However, ARDS caused by human PB19 appears extremely rare in adults at perioperative period. The evidence supporting acute human PB19 infection in our case was derived from the presence of human PB19-specific nucleic acids (in serum and BALF) and positive serum human PB19 IgM, and no other proven infection [9] . Furthermore, there was a significant alteration in serum IgM and IgG. In the early phase, IgM was positive, while IgG was negative. With the clearing of pulmonary infiltration, increased IgM was detected and IgG turned positive. It is usually considered that IgM is present 7-10 days following infection which indicates acute infection, while IgG is protective antibody which indicates past infection. Human PB19 DNA in serum appears 2-3 days after acute infection. But human PB19 DNA has been shown to persist in serum and synovial fluid for many years, which cannot be indicative of an acute infection. Through mNGS, a new choice for finding rare or atypical pathogens in severe complicated pneumonia [10] , we narrowed the scope of suspected pathogens quickly. Thus, a combination of serum human PB19 DNA by mNGS and serum human PB19 IgM could provide higher diagnostic sensitivity for acute human PB19 infection. This patient's immunity level was low during his ICU stay. Although the patient had tumor history, he did not receive chemotherapy before and after cardiac surgery. It is considered that the immune dysfunction has relationship with cardiac surgery injury, CPB, blood loss and malnutrition [11] . Finally, immunodepression may increase susceptibility to infection [12] . We should be vigilant against virus infection. How the reported patient became infected is unclear. During the perioperative period, another patient (suspected patient) in the same surgical ward had the same manifestations. The severe pulmonary infiltration of this suspected patient was accentuated in one week, and human PB19 was detected in the serum by mNGS after discharge home. Both of the patients had blood transfusions, but the two patients had different blood types. It was impossible that they had the same lot of blood transfusion.",

The determination of human PB19 antibodies, especially positive serum IgM, and the human B19-specific nucleic acids in serum should be examined for the accurate diagnosis of acute human PB19 infection [9, 15] . mNGS may be a new choice for finding rare or atypical pathogens in severe complicated pneumonia, especially for some virus [10] .
