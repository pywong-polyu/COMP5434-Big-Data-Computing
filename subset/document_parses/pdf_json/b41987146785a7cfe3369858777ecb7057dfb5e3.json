Far less is known about these impacts on ethno-cultural populations, including East and South Asian gamblers. The present study has attempted to explore the health inequities related to these comorbidities and risk factors among East and South Asian gamblers. A cross-sectional online survey of gamblers in Ontario, Canada, was carried out in August 2020-a time when most land-based gambling venues were not operating at full capacity. Descriptive statistical analyses, odds ratios, and negative binomial regression (NBR) were used to compare East and South Asian gamblers to other online gamblers in Ontario. The total survey sample of 2,012 gamblers included sub-samples of East Asian (n = 206) and South Asian gamblers (n = 107). Compared to other gamblers in Ontario, East and South Asians reported higher likelihood of severe gambling problems, risky financially focused gambling motives, gambling under the influence of alcohol, and elevated levels of mental health problems. An adjusted NBR analysis noted that East Asians were more highly involved in online gambling during the pandemic, compared to non-East Asian gamblers. This study has presented an array of factors representing potential health inequities among East and South Asian gamblers during the pandemic. These findings merit further investigation and replication in order to inform the development of appropriate support resources.",

In contrast, very little is known about the comorbid secondary health impacts of the pandemic on Asian populations that may include addictive behaviors, substance use, mental health problems, and financial concerns. Online gambling has stood out as a reference point for highlighting the effects of addictive behaviors (Wardle et al., 2021) and comorbidities, including intoxicated gambling and elevated mental health problems as well as financial concerns and gambling motives attributed to COVID-19 (H\u00e5kansson, 2020; Price, 2020) . These emergent findings raise questions about the specific comorbid health issues and risk factors that Asian gamblers may face during the pandemic.",

Cultural harms, for instance, may include dissonance between gambling and cultural beliefs, impact on one's ability to participate in cultural activities or meet community expectations, and a resulting loss of connection and cohesion with the cultural community-shame, stigma, social isolation, and loss of identity are some of the potential manifestations of cultural harm (Langham et al., 2016) .",

In other instances, Asian gamblers have reported losing more money from gambling than other ethno-cultural groups (Venkataraman Rinker et al., 2016) . Above all else, the most consistent finding in the extant literature is that East Asians (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese) and South Asians (e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan) are at higher risk for gambling problems and harms than non-Asian populations (Barry et al., 2009 ; J. Barry, 2014; Caler et al., 2017; Forrest & Wardle, 2011; Kim, 2012; Ontario Resource Group on Gambling, 2010; Sobrun-Maharaj et al., 2013) . Some research has also shown that immigrant and international student status can predict risk of problem gambling. For instance, some studies of Asian immigrants and international students in Westernized settings have indicated the use of dysfunctional coping strategies when dealing with settlement adversities that may include problematic gambling (Li et al., 2014; Sobrun-Maharaj et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Differentiating East and South Asian gamblers is difficult, given the limited evidence available, but it is important to establish a more nuanced and incrementally less monolithic understanding of population health risk. Past research has highlighted a strong interest of some South Asian gamblers in card games, festival gambling during events (e.g., Diwali), and sports betting (Benegal, 2013; George et al., 2016) . As with some gamblers in general populations, South Asians who experience problems with gambling may also be associated with lower educational attainment, substance use (i.e., tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol consumption), and mental health concerns (Fatima et al., 2019; George et al., 2016) . Youth and young adults, in particular, have presented with high incidence of problem gambling (George et al., 2016; Jaisoorya et al., 2017) . Research on East Asian gamblers has featured considerable attention on Chinese players in particular. In this context, gambling is perceived generally as a recreational and social activity, which may be introduced at a young age (i.e., under the age of 16) and is also common during holidays and family gatherings (Kam et al., 2017; Keovisai & Kim, 2019; Kim, 2012; Yu & Ma, 2019; Zheng et al., 2011) . Limited evidence has also established an association between gambling problems and mental health concerns and substance overuse, which is to date better represented in general population studies (Cheung, 2014; El-Guebaly et al., 2006; Kong et al., 2011) . Efforts to further understand differences as well as similarities between East and South Asian gamblers may help to inform the development of nuanced, targeted, and appropriate prevention and treatment interventions.",

For instance, one study of non-gambling Chinese respondents during COVID-19 presented increased alcohol consumption alongside substantially increased Internet use and dependence (46.8%)-though gaming and gambling were not used to characterize online activity (Sun et al., 2020) . The pandemic has also depicted some ethno-cultural populations (i.e., African American, Asian, Hispanic, Native America, and other racialized groups) as being at greater risk for both excessive drinking and mental health problems during COVID-19, compared to White respondents (McPhee et al., 2020) . Among Chinese coping with the pandemic, serious mental health problems may be mediated by coping response, with negative coping strategies aggravating emotional distress (Yan et al., 2021) .",

The survey was administered at a time of substantial pandemic-related social and economic disruption, just following the lifting of a province-wide lockdown. The emergency lockdown measures resulted in the closure of most public gathering places and non-essential businesses as well as restrictions on nonhousehold gatherings of 5 or more people (Office of the Premier, 2020). Most land-based gambling facilities remained closed even after restrictions were lifted. Between July and December 2020, approximately 80% (n = 23) of casinos briefly reopened at slightly different time-points in the province with limited capacity (e.g., 50 player limit, enhanced public health screening, no table games, and no food or beverage service) before closing again through the months of October to December, 2020.",

This point was reflected by an increased tendency of both East and South Asians gamblers to report gambling both online and on land prior to COVID-19 and the intention of approximately 20% of both groups to do so once land-based gambling venues reopened fully. Further investigation is required to assess the influence that low awareness of responsible gambling information and problem gambling services, and the impact of shame and stigma have on gambling-related harms-the latter two factors pertaining to cultural harms, specifically (Ontario Resource Group on Gambling, 2010; Papineau, 2013; Tong et al., 2019) .

The present study has provided additional evidence of this dynamic within the context of East and South Asian gamblers during COVID-19. Specifically, gambling online to earn income was a motive endorsed by over 40% of East and South Asian gamblers and was twice or more likely to present in these groups, compared to other Ontarian gamblers. Not only did this reflect a substantial monetary focus on what is meant to be a recreational activity, it was strongly associated with problem gambling. One might speculate that this motivational focus has been inflamed by the substantial economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. However, East and South Asian gamblers did not suffer disproportionate employment losses or negative impact on household income compared to other Ontarian gamblers, though the latter did exceed 40% in both groups. Though this study did not capture household income level or immigrant status, it may still be valuable to consider the potential economic impacts of COVID-19 on East and South Asian gamblers. For instance, Canada's national statistics agency notes that low-income rates among recent immigrants is typically much higher than Canadian-born residents (Picot & Hou, 2014) , calling attention to evidence of the disproportionate impact of problem gambling among low-income groups in Canada (van der Maas, 2016). As such, endorsing a strong financial motivation to gamble may be influenced by other factors not assessed in this study. Previous studies have also shown significant associations between financial motivations and materialism among Chinese gamblers with gambling problems and potentially reflect cultural values that are comorbidly associated with risky gambling behaviors (Netemeyer et al., 1998; Tao et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012) . Far less is known about other East Asian sub-groups and South Asian gamblers, more generally. Intoxicated online gambling has not been an extensively studied topic, especially in relation to ethno-cultural differences. This investigation found that gambling under the influence of alcohol was somewhat prevalent (14-16%) and more likely among East and South Asian gamblers. Similar evidence from high-risk online gamblers in Australia has also noted significantly increased occurrences of alcohol co-use as well as psychological distress (Hing et al., 2017) . More recent investigations examining respondents in China have identified patterns of comorbid addictive behaviors involving Internet use and dependence and increased alcohol consumption, which have been interpreted as a form of maladaptive coping during COVID-19 (Sun et al., 2020) .",

Only moderate anxiety appeared significantly more likely among East Asian gamblers, compared to non-East Asian gamblers. In contrast, South Asian gamblers had approximately twice or more the odds of moderate and severe anxiety and moderately severe and severe depression, when compared to other Ontarian gamblers. Despite these differences, evidence from gambling prevalence data in Canada has indicated that symptoms of mental health problems are more likely to manifest in those experiencing gambling problems, which also identified South Asians as a vulnerable population, and has now been established in the present study with added nuance (Barry, 2014) . In reference to maladaptive coping and addictive behaviors, which was noted previously, other studies have also indicated that mental health problems among Chinese populations may be mediated by coping responses, with risky strategies lending themselves to intensifying emotional distress (Li et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2021) .",

For one, the constructs of East and South Asian gamblers may not capture important distinctions between disaggregated ethno-cultural groups. This decision represented a compromise between sample size and depth of ethnocultural distinction. Despite this limitation, the study has taken a step past previous ones that have used a single monolithic \"Asian\" category to characterize distinct ethno-cultural populations. In addition, the survey itself is cross-sectional and relied upon self-reported feedback, which is prone to response bias. Also, the study's exploratory convenience sample may not be generalizable to the East and South Asian populations in Ontario. With regard to the odds ratio comparisons, no adjustments were made for age or gender. Moreover, sample sizes for East and South Asian cohorts were also small, which may have limited the statistical power necessary to confirm certain phenomena, such as increased incidence of South Asian gambling involvement in the NBR analysis. Indeed, due to the small sample sizes and the unequal variance in the data, additional analyses of financially focused motivation were abandoned due to the potential loss of statistical power.",

It provides a partial and incremental understanding of the relationship between key factors, comorbidities, and gambling risk during an early period of the pandemic, among two distinct gambling population groups. The findings have reaffirmed the disproportionate risk for gambling problems and other comorbidities experienced by these ethno-cultural groups and have presented an array of risk factors that would benefit from further investigation. By extension, this study has implied a potential need for greater focused attention on health promotion and support resources tailored to East and South Asian gamblers. Future studies may also be well served by a more nuanced examination of gambling comorbidities among these and other ethno-cultural groups that take into account migration history. In addition, the protective effects on employment disruption and negative impact on household income experienced by these sampled population groups, relative to other Ontarians, merit further study.",
