Numerous retrospective studies examined the association of ARBs and ACEIs with COVID-19 outcomes using casecontrol and historical cohort study designs and generally reported no excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity among ARB or ACEI users compared to nonusers, with some suggesting potential benefit from ARBs or ACEIs [12] . However, several of the prior observational studies contain methodological limitations that may reduce their internal validity, and thus, their clinical applicability [13, 14] . Despite the volume of published observational analyses to date (more than 80 as of Feb 15, 2020) [12] , focused, high-quality observational studies are needed to complement randomized trials and guide ARB or ACEI use during the growing COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, due to the short duration of the pandemic limiting sample size, it is not feasible to perform a new-user design, which is considered best practice for estimating medication effects outside of randomized trials [15] . However, unlike many prior observational analyses, we utilized several methods to increase robustness of results including an active comparator design, rigorous adjustment for a rich set of covariates, and negative control analyses to assess for residual bias. ARBs and ACEIs are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States (US). The potential risks of abrupt discontinuation are enormous, and their effects on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are not clear. Our goal was to estimate the direction and magnitude of association between ARB and ACEI use with COVID-19-related outcomes among US Veterans with treated hypertension in the outpatient and inpatient settings using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data and robust observational methods.",

            "text": "This historical cohort study of ARB and ACEI use among outpatient and inpatient Veterans with treated hypertension positive for SARS-CoV-2 offers at least two main findings. First, among outpatients, current use of an ARB/ACEI was associated with a 15% lower relative risk of COVID-19-related outcomes compared to a non-ARB/ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimen. Second, this is one of the first reports demonstrating that among outpatients, ARB users had a 9% lower relative risk of all-cause hospitalization or mortality compared to ACEI users. These findings support continued use of renin-angiotensin system blockade for (1) outpatients already using an ARB or ACEI, and (2) continued use of an ARB for outpatients using an ARB prior to testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. For current outpatient users of ACEIs prior to testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in clinical practice, the HR of 0.91 for all-cause hospitalization or mortality with ARB vs. ACEI is insufficiently far from 1.0 to recommend converting from an ACEI to an ARB given the prevalent user design limitations. Randomized trials are needed to confirm the observed potential beneficial effects of ARBs compared to ACEIs on COVID-19-related outcomes. The mechanistic basis for the potential effects of ARB or ACEI use on COVID-19-related outcomes is centered around the physiology of ACE2, the protein which SARS-CoV-2 uses for host cell entry. ACE2 upregulation in the lungs by ARBs or ACEIs could enhance SARS-CoV-2 interaction with its receptor, increase infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells, and increase COVID-19 severity. The contrasting hypothesis maintains that ARBs or ACEIs could mitigate viral-induced inflammatory responses by reducing available angiotensin II or by blocking angiotensin II's actions via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R), thus shifting the balance of the renin-angiotensin system back towards ACE2 and angiotensin- (1-7) . This would, thereby, promote anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in the lungs and possibly mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury [2, 27] . Animal experiments and human studies have not conclusively demonstrated the presence, direction, or magnitude of the association between ARBs or ACEIs and ACE2 levels in the circulation or tissue expression, especially in the lungs [7, 8, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

Also, our analysis evaluated SARS--CoV-2+ outpatients' risk of developing COVID-19, a population not tested in these trials.

Current users of an ARB in the outpatient cohort had a 9% lower relative risk of allcause hospitalization or mortality and 16% lower relative risk of ICU admission compared to ACEI users. There is a mechanistic basis for the differential effects between ARBs and ACEIs. It has been hypothesized that ARBs and ACEIs have differential effects on ACE2 [7, 8] . In healthy adult humans, ACEIs, but not ARBs, may increase duodenal ACE2 expression [37] . In animals, ARB-mediated AT 1 R antagonism reduces peripheral and pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and edema [38, 39] . In addition, angiotensin II can induce beneficial effects through the AT 2 R, and ARBs and ACEIs differentially activate secondary pathways within the reninangiotensin system, leading to alternative angiotensin II generation and metabolism [2] . Recent data suggest that bradykinin-mediated inflammation may contribute to adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 [40] . Because ACEIs inhibit bradykinin metabolism, this is another plausible mechanism for differences in COVID-19-related outcomes between ACEI users and ARB users.",

The recently completed trials and prior observational investigations have generally found no association between users of an ARB/ ACEI vs. non-ARB/ACEI and COVID-19-related outcomes [12] . However, in contrast to the prior analyses largely conducted among inpatients or those with and without COVID-19, the current analysis identified a significant 15% reduction in all-cause hospitalization or mortality among SARS-CoV-2-positive outpatients with hypertension taking ARB/ACEI-vs. non-ARB/ ACEI-based regimens.

One explanation for this inconsistency is the concept of \"depletion of the susceptibles,\" in which ARB users who are susceptible to the beneficial effects of ARBs on all-cause hospitalization or mortality were less likely to be hospitalized, and therefore, were less likely to be included in the inpatient analysis [14] . The restriction of the inpatients to those who did not benefit from ARBs as outpatients could bias results towards observing a benefit in the ACEI group. Accordingly, we caution against over-interpretation of the directionality of the relationship between ARBs vs. ACEIs in inpatients with COVID-19.

This was a highly focused report with two primary exposures and two cohorts utilizing detailed and validated electronic health record and pharmacy data from the largest integrated health care delivery system in the US. We included several sensitivity analyses to assess for residual confounding and robustness of results. The current study also has several limitations. The external validity of our findings may be limited by a predominantly male and white population. Because we restricted the analysis comparing ARB/ACEI-vs. non-ARB/ACEI-based regimens users to only those without a compelling indication for an ARB or an ACEI to increase internal validity, our results may not be generalizable to adults with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or prior stroke. The study question necessitated a prevalent-user design, which could introduce bias. Our active-comparator design and methods of covariate adjustment mitigate these sources of bias, as is evident through the balance in exchangeability achieved between exposure groups before and after weighting. In addition, the results of the negative control analyses suggested a low risk of substantial residual bias. We were not able to estimate the impact of initiating ARB or ACEI in patients not previously receiving treatment, stopping treatment in inpatients already receiving treatment, or, finally, switching patients between ARB and ACEI after developing COVID-19; our findings can be interpreted within the clinical question of continuing an ARB vs. continuing an ACEI during infection with SARS-CoV-2. We did not capture healthcare utilization external to the VHA, however, we do not believe there would be differential ascertainment by exposure groups. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Instead, consistent with the recommendations from Rothman [41] , Perneger [42] , Feise [43] , and Althouse [44] , we provided extensive information and detail on the study design, methods, and statistical analyses and report effect sizes, confidence intervals, and p-values so that the readers can make their own interpretation of our findings in the context of the other recent reports on this topic. Data on symptoms at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing were unavailable. Due to regional differences in the acceleration of COVID-19 cases and resource availability in the US, decisions on which patients with COVID-19 were admitted likely varied by facility and over time according to clinical judgment, local bed availability and patient acuity. Therefore, the severity of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 included in the inpatient analysis may have varied by region and over time.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a persistent public health crisis that has infected more than 27 million and killed more than 475,000 US adults as of February 15, 2020. More than 45 million US adults use ARBs and ACEIs annually. Unlike prior randomized trials and observational analyses, we provide novel evidence that for SARS-CoV-2-positive outpatients, use of an ARB compared to ACEI in the three months prior to infection was associated with significantly lower risk of all-cause hospitalization or mortality. Randomized trials are needed to confirm the signal of potential beneficial effects of ARBs compared to ACEIs on COVID-19-specific outcomes. We also confirmed results of prior randomized trials and observational reports which found no evidence of a harmful association of ARBs or ACEIs with adverse COVID-19-related outcomes compared to use of non-ARB/ACEI antihypertensive medications. In light of the serious risks of discontinuation of ARBs and ACEIs in patients with hypertension, our findings support professional society recommendations to continue ARB or ACEI treatment among patients with hypertension in the absence of an established indication to discontinue them.
