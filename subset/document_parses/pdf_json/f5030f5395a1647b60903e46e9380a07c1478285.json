Many patients with impaired glucose tolerance and undiagnosed diabetes do not know that their glucose metabolism system has been in a state of disorder. Every year, about 5% to 10% of prediabetics develop diabetes. One of the important achieving factors may be the increase in blood lipids. However, it is not clear whether the triglyceride/highdensity lipoprotein ratio is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in the Chinese population. erefore, we investigated the relationship between triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein and impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in the Chinese population. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the health screening program. e study included 116,855 participants from 32 locations in China, all of whom were adults over 20. Participants measured fasting blood glucose levels at each visit and collected information about their diabetes history. Impaired glucose tolerance was diagnosed as fasting blood glucose \u22656.00 mmol and self-reported diabetes mellitus. e patient was measured on the date of diagnosis or on his last visit (whichever comes first). Results. e results showed that, after adjusting the potential confounding factors, the ratio of TG/HDL was positively correlated with the occurrence of prediabetes and diabetes, and there was a saturation effect. e inflection points were 1.04 and 1.33, respectively. e effect value and 95% confidence interval before and after the inflection point of impaired glucose tolerance patients were 1.57 and (1.42, 1.73) and 1.03 and (1.01, 1.05), respectively. e effect value and 95% confidence interval before and after the inflection point in patients with diabetes were 2.07 and (1.80, 2.39) and 1.08 and (1.04, 1.12).",

For example, studies in Japan, South Korea, and the United States have shown that TG/HDL is an independent risk factor for the incidence of diabetes. However, the effect sizes of these results are inconsistent [31] [32] [33] . is may be due to the significant differences between ethnic groups. At the same time, these studies only analyzed the relationship between TG/HDL and diabetes and did not include patients with the prediabetic stage. erefore, it is of great significance to analyze whether the ratio of TG/HDL is correlated with the incidence of prediabetes and diabetes.

At the time of inclusion, participants were excluded if they had no available weight and height measurements (n \ufffd 103946), no available information on gender (n \ufffd 1), an extreme BMI value (<15 kg/m 2 or >55 kg/m 2 ) (n \ufffd 152), no available TG or HDL indicators (n \ufffd 90124), or no available fasting glucose value (n \ufffd 31370).

Participants were asked to fill out a detailed questionnaire to assess demographics, lifestyle, medical history, and family history of chronic diseases at each visit to the health screening center. Height, weight, and blood pressure are measured by trained staff. Weight is measured without shoes and wearing light clothing, with weight measured to one decimal point and height measured to one decimal point. BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Blood pressure is measured with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. Fasting venous blood samples were collected after a minimum of 10 hours of fasting for each examination. Serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured by the Beckman 5800 automatic analyzer.

However, it gradually leads to impaired glucose tolerance, and in most cases, these individuals will develop diabetes [9] .
