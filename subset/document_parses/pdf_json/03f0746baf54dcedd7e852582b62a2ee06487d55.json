Information loss occurs in part because there are more limited social and body language cues available using video treatment delivery. In addition, communication challenges may be more difficult because it is sometimes unclear to whom questions are directed or when to respond. Thus, clinicians may need to clearly state names when asking questions and overtly direct interactions and conversations when using TeleHealth compared to in-person visits. It is possible the clinicians will feel less connected and more distant to families when conducting therapy remotely. The authority of the therapist may also be altered when providing treatment solely through a video format. Patients and/or family members may feel less connected and accountable in sessions done remotely, which could lead to increased distraction during the session. Although overall acceptability, user experience, and therapeutic alliance is often rated highly by individuals receiving TeleHealth psychotherapy (Jenkins-Guarnieri, Pruitt, Luxton, & Johnson, 2015; Simpson & Reid, 2014) , some studies note mixed findings and cite lower clinician-rated alliance (Ertelt et al., 2011; Lopez, Schwenk, Schneck, Griffin, & Mishkind, 2019; Richards, Simpson, Bastiampillai, Pietrabissa, & Castelnuovo, 2018; Simpson & Reid, 2014) . This may also apply to TeleHealth FBT though this has not been explicitly studied. Clinicians should stay attuned to the therapeutic relationships throughout TeleHealth FBT and work to mitigate and/or repair any ruptures that occur, particularly those resulting from the use of technology to deliver treatment.

Briefly, FBT is a family psychotherapy treatment consisting of between 10 and 20 sessions conducted over 3 phases lasting between 6-12 months. Sessions in FBT include not just the patient but also parents/guardians, siblings, and anyone living within the home. Each session begins with the therapist weighing the patient followed by a private one-on-one check-in between the patient and therapist for the first 5-10 minutes. The family then joins for the remainder of the session. Consistent across all eating disorder diagnoses, FBT takes an agnostic stance towards the development of the eating disorder, encourages externalization of the illness, and seeks to empower parents as the agents of behavioral change in helping patients disrupt behaviors that maintain the eating disorder. The therapist maintains a consultative rather than directive stance to facilitate parental learning. Phase 1 of FBT is typically 6-10 sessions in length and focuses on re-nourishment efforts in AN , regular eating and reduction of purging behaviors in BN (Le Grange & Lock, 2009) , and re-nourishment, expansion of food selection, or presentation of feared foods in ARFID depending on patient's clinical presentation (e.g., sensory difficulties, fear of adverse consequences of eating, or low appetite) (Lock, Robinson, et al., 2019; . Sessions 1 and 2 include specific interventions, such as emphasizing the severity of the eating disorder and the medical, social, and psychological dangers of not acting immediately to reverse starvation or other serious disordered eating behaviors (orchestrating an intense scene), reviewing the family's previous attempts to help their child through circular questioning, and, charging parents with the responsibility of taking control of eating and activity until their child is better able to manage these in an age-appropriate and healthy way. In session two, FBT includes promoting parental learning about how to work together, setting appropriate goals for meal consumption, and direct coaching about how parents can change their strategies to promote weight gain or disrupt other eating disorder behaviors (see Le Grange & Lock, 2009; . Sessions are held weekly during this initial phase.

Often, discussions in Phase 3 focus on adolescent development issues that exist in the family, as it is important to ensure the adolescent remains on track with development once the eating disorder has resolved.

With TeleHealth, families may have a tendency to look at the video screen when speaking rather than communicating with one another. The process work that occurs within an FBT context may be hampered if family members cannot easily see and communicate with one another. In a traditional office setting, the therapist has control over the setup of the \"therapeutic space,\" but considerably less when the family is in their own home. Similarly, the physical arrangement of family members may be impacted by the type of device used for the videoconferencing session, limitations related to screen size and camera angles, and the availability and size of confidential space within the home. Nonetheless, the therapist should feel comfortable asking the family to arrange themselves in a manner most conducive to the family therapy session and be prepared to work with the family to solve any logistical or technical barriers that may arise. However, there are challenges when assessing weight progress that are not present in standard FBT when the therapist weighs the patient in-person. There are many ways to obtain weight information without actually weighing the patient in the office. Some patients are comfortable weighing themselves ahead of session, but they may not always be reliable reporters. One alternative is for the therapist to be present on camera observing the process of self-weighing at the beginning of the session to provide support in case the patient becomes upset when taking his or her own weight. Another alternative is to ask parents to take the child's weight on a home scale before session. If using home weights, it may be useful to provide additional education to parents and patients regarding how best to obtain weights for treatment sessions (e.g., weigh at the same time each", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Initial pre-therapy contact"}, {"text": "week, ask patient to use the restroom prior to weighing, weigh patient in light clothing, limit weighing to once a week or just for treatment sessions and/or medical visits). If a family does not have a home scale, they may buy or borrow one or ask that the provider or clinic supplies them with one for use in treatment. As is the case in office-based FBT, it is important to review the potential consequences of frequent weighing with the family and patient and encourage parents to keep possession of the scale to prevent unlimited weighing by patients if they foresee this becoming an issue.

Given that patients and providers only have a limited view through a screen of the TeleHealth therapy space, a brief discussion reviewing the privacy of the space and other confidentiality measures at the beginning of sessions could help maintain a similar environment to the therapist office. It is important to confirm that the patient is indeed in a private space that prohibits family members from listening, either intentionally or inadvertently. In practice, this often necessitates asking the patient to take the phone, computer, or device to another room or private space in their home. Some patients may need to participate in this portion of the therapy session from places outside of the home, such as the car, garage, or backyard to ensure privacy. When space is limited and/ or safety concerns exist that limit options outside of the home or shared space, privacy can be enhanced by wearing headphones, placing a noise maker or fan outside of a door, or using a \"white noise\" application on a cellphone or other device.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Patient one-on-one check-in"}, {"text": "It is recommended to set a plan ahead of time to reconvene with all family members after the individual check-in is completed. The therapist will need to be explicit in stating this in a TeleHealth session, as the therapist does not, as noted above, have control over the therapeutic environment as they would in an office setting. This may occur as a brief conversation led by the therapist at the start of each session, particularly in early sessions, before a routine has been established. For divorced or blended families across multiple households, providers may want to set a time with all family members to reconvene (i.e., \"ok, everyone join the therapy call again in 10 minutes at 6:10pm\") or ask one party to text the other party when it is time to rejoin. Some TeleHealth platforms have a \"waiting room\" feature that enables the therapist to let family members virtually join the session once ready to proceed. In contrast to sessions held in a physical office space, it may not be feasible for all family members to join session together on the same screen, particularly if parents are separated or divorced and shared living space does not exist. Recent public health directives to \"shelter-in-place\" and maintain physical distancing designed to limit the spread of COVID-19 may also impact a family's ability to be in a shared space using one screen. Thus, it is recommended that the videoconferencing platform used in TeleHealth FBT sessions allow for multi-point video (e.g., multiple screens) so as to not exclude family members who may not live together that are deemed essential in the treatment or re-nourishment process.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Patient one-on-one check-in"}, {"text": "The therapist should also be mindful of how TeleHealth could impact rapport building with the patient. There may be both advantages and challenges in building therapeutic alliance via video for adolescents with eating disorders. The ego-syntonic nature of AN, the shame and guilt often associated with BN and binge eating (Blythin et al., 2020) , and the anxiety that often accompanies ARFID (Fisher et al., 2014) may complicate this whether in person or over a video screen via dis- At the start of FBT, the therapist might expect parents and guardians to feel a stronger therapeutic alliance with the clinician than the adolescent patient (Forsberg et al., 2014) , though this difference may be less pronounced for patients with BN (Zaitsoff, Doyle, Hoste, & Le Grange, 2008 ). Yet, there could be unique opportunities for relationship building via TeleHealth that are not available in a traditional office setting, such as gaining insight into the patient's home environment, noticing items in the house, commenting on decorations in the patient's room, or meeting the family pet. There could be additional advantages that these glimpses into a family's home environment provide, such as meeting other family members (e.g., a grandparent or adult sibling) that may be helpful in the patient's recovery. Therapeutic alliance may play an important role in FBT outcomes (Pereira, Lock, & Oggins, 2006) , particularly in psychological improvements when strong alliance with the patient is established early (Isserlin & Couturier, 2011) . All of these additional visual clues may help the therapist form a relationship with the patient apart from his or her eating disorder and show interest in the development of the healthy child or adolescent.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 322, "end": 344, "text": "(Blythin et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 392, "end": 413, "text": "(Fisher et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 641, "end": 664, "text": "(Forsberg et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 734, "end": 776, "text": "(Zaitsoff, Doyle, Hoste, & Le Grange, 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1401, "text": "(Pereira, Lock, & Oggins, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1534, "text": "(Isserlin & Couturier, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Rapport building"}, {"text": "There are several critical intervention components that the therapist seeks to accomplish in the first session of FBT.

As is the case with FBT conducted in the office setting, the therapist should work to ensure that all family members are present and encourage active participation in session, through the use of circular questioning and other therapeutic techniques .

This set up may not be readily available in patient's homes and thus can take some logistical problem-solving at the start of the session. Therapists will likely need to ask more clarifying questions about the meal itself than they would in their offices when they are unable to see the food being eaten or served. Also, it may be necessary for the clinician to ask for explicit descriptions of the meal, such as what the meal is, how it was prepared, how much was plated, etc. The information that may have been more easily gleaned by simply examining the meal session or observing the parents plate the food in the office may be lost over video. Though asking about all this in a detailed manner may seem awkward at first, in fact, this will allow the therapist to use this information gathering process to facilitate a deeper discussion and understanding of the choices the parents made in preparing and serving the meal. Finally, providers may want to encourage families to monitor the movements of family pets, as the eating disorder may enlist the help of household animals to finish unwanted food. Again, the role of pets at the family meal would not typically be part of a meal session in a therapist's office, but may be an important factor when the family is eating and trying to change eating at home.

As done in-person during the family meal, the clinician may encourage family members to switch seats or ask parents to sit on either side of the patient to provide additional support. In situations where the eating disorder becomes activated and food is removed, destroyed, or thrown away before being eaten, parents may more easily replace the food at home than if they were in an office setting with limited access to additional food sources or supplies. While meal coaching may also feel a bit different at a distance than providers are used to, it may be more empowering to parents because they are the ones implementing strategies in their own home with their own child while the therapist remains a remote presence.

This may be more difficult if all family members are positioned facing the screen rather than one another.

Additionally, it is possible that therapists may notice a decline in session attendance and the learning of the patient and family in remote therapy with the transition to Phases 2 and 3 and the spacing of treatment sessions. The reinforcement from in-person contact with a therapist may be of value in keeping some families moving forward with treatment goals; without it, families may stop prioritizing treatment.

The impact of this intervention may be muted when delivered via TeleHealth for any number of reasons, including unstable video connection, technological difficulties, relaxed atmosphere of the home environment, among other factors. Nonetheless, the therapist should continue to convey the severity of the illness and the need to act urgently to prevent the dangers to life, social and physical development, and mental health that keeping the eating disorder risks. The therapist may accomplish this by changing the intonation or cadence of their voice, demonstrating grave and concerned facial expressions, leaning towards the computer screen, and holding the frame despite distractions that may be occurring within the family's home environment. The strategic use of silence can be impactful, although challenging via TeleHealth given presumed expectation of the need for someone to talk while on screen. While this may come easily to a therapist in a typical office setting, adjustments such as augmenting or exaggerating these skills may be needed to communicate over video to patients at a distance.1.7 | Session 2: The family mealSpecific interventions utilized in FBT, such as the family meal in session 2, may also look and feel different to the clinician when conducted at a distance, but in reality the goals and process are identical to FBT conducted in a therapist's office. The purpose of the family meal is to assess the family's, and particularly the parents', understanding of how and what to feed their child, identify negotiations and compromises that are maintaining the eating disorder, and provide an in-vivo opportunity to align parents in their goals to disrupt eating disorder behaviors. While it is unknown what impact conducting FBT via TeleHealth may have on achieving these goals, several suggestions about what therapists can do to be effective in this session are discussed below.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "ulated. Similarly, situations may arise in which patients or parents become distraught, feel overwhelmed, or respond in overtly critical or hostile ways. Across family therapy modalities, it is not uncommon for arguments to escalate during treatment sessions and require intervention or redirection by the therapist. TeleHealth FBT providers are encouraged to manage similar situations in much the same way they would in a clinic setting; that is, to ask the parents how they want to respond to this behavior and support their thoughtful deliberations about how best to proceed without the therapist trying to direct the parents or tell them what to do. Patients occasionally leave the room during in-person FBT sessions due to high levels of emotion or distress. Unlike an office or clinic-based setting, parents and family members have the advantage of knowing the layouts of their homes, insight into patient's typical patterns of behavior in the home environment, and awareness of the resources they have to manage escalated behaviors at home. Additional emotion regulation strategies may be available to patients and family members that are traditionally unavailable in a therapy office, such as separate spaces, self-soothe items, and other comforts of home. Clinicians providing TeleHealth FBT may want to consider helping parents plan ahead at the outset of therapy how they would like to handle and respond to behaviors should they occur during sessions.Patients may also become distressed discussing eating disorder behaviors and weight while viewing themselves on the screen during video sessions. Patients may insist on appearing off camera for this very reason. Practically, switching the presentation view in the video conferencing platform to minimize patient's on-screen appearance or enabling functions that hide the patient's view of themselves may alleviate some of the in-session distress. Alternatively, the therapist may help the patient reframe their discomfort as an exposure opportunity and assist patients in acclimating to viewing their bodies on screen, much the same as if they were on a video call with family or friends or in front of a mirror. This can also provide a learning opportunity for family members to experience firsthand the patient's distress around body image concerns and position families to provide in-vivo support to patients.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Common TeleHealth family-based treatment (FBT) challenges and solutions Look at the camera rather than the screen to promote \"eye contact\" Hold emotional tenure of session regardless of distractions within family home \u2022 Strategic use of silence, given expectations to talk when on screenFamily meal\u2022 Difficulty seeing the meal over video\u2022 Work with family members to position camera appropriately to maximize visualization of the meal and patient eating \u2022 Ask more clarifying questions about food served and eaten \u2022 Ask for explicit descriptions of the meal Discuss changes of where family members sit during mealtimes before and after the eating disorder \u2022 Access to additional food and supplies at home \u2022 Impact of family pets may be addressedManaging in-session behaviors \u2022 Patient leaves session \u2022 Continue session, as long as safety concerns are adequately addressed \u2022 Manage as if behaviors occurred in office setting (e.g., support parent management of behaviors without telling them what to do) \u2022 Ask patient to rejoin session when ready \u2022 Patient refuses to be on video \u2022 Ask patient to join by voice until ready \u2022 Patient disconnects video session \u2022 Have family contact information handy for all video sessions \u2022 Attempt to re-connect with family \u2022 Establish back-up method of communicating (e.g., call on another device, phone call to help family problem-solve and re-start video session) clarify family behavioral expectations for TeleHealth FBT. Because therapy is not taking place in the therapist's professional office where the setting typically imposes behavioral expectations in line with visiting a clinician, it may be less clear to patients and families how to behave helpfully in a therapeutic session conducted remotely. Thus, it may be important to clarify that family members, including siblings, are not allowed to come and go throughout the session but rather explicitly state that everyone is expected to be present and fully engaged for the duration of the video session. Younger patients as well as siblings may have more difficulty focusing during videoconferencing sessions compared to standard in-person office visits. It may be helpful for clinicians to anticipate this ahead of time and provide guidance to parents on what to expect as well as model appropriate redirection strategies in session. For families with very young children (e.g., under 5 years old), the therapist should discuss appropriateness for attendance in sessions and problem-solve with the family how best to incorporate young children, who may need parental supervision and oversight. The therapist should ask the family to hold TeleHealth FBT sessions in a confidential, quiet space and minimize distractions to the greatest extent possible. This may include turning off the television or other devices, or moving family pets to a different room. As with any therapy delivered via TeleHealth, patients and families should not be driving or riding in a car during session to minimize the risk of harm. The therapist can also address how mental health safety concerns, including acute suicidality, will be managed should they occur during the course of treatment.

As schools and restaurants are closed, the opportunities to practice social eating outside the family may be limited. Families may need additional guidance on creative ways to continue helping the adolescent progress through appropriate developmental steps in return to eating. The previous treatment goals related to adolescent developmental themes that arise in Phase 3 may also need to be shifted during this time. Typical adolescent routines including attending school, afterschool activities, sports practices and athletic events, in-person socialization with peers, and memorable moments such as prom and graduation have all been suddenly suspended with no clear return date in sight. Moreover, adolescents are spending an increased amount of time at home with their parents and families, with less opportunities to interact and socialize with same-age peers. This shift towards more family interaction is actually developmentally inappropriate, as one of the primary goals of adolescence is to individuate and achieve independence from the family unit. The added stress, anxiety, and grief teenagers may feel during this time could contribute to increased family conflict as well as a worsening of eating disorder symptoms. The therapist should anticipate these potential challenges and help families problem-solve barriers that inhibit the patient from achieving age-appropriate developmental goals.
