Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze navigational risks to ensure the safety of waterborne transportation. In this paper, the navigational risks of Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (NYRB) waters are investigated based on spatiotemporal mining on massive automatic identification system (AIS) trajectories by using geographic information system (GIS) techniques. A time-series-oriented trajectory processing method is proposed to deal with the historical AIS data in the whole year of 2019. The method adopts a periodic processing strategy to produce traffic density estimation products in multiple temporal scales for supporting spatiotemporal analysis. The proposed method greatly improves the data-processing efficiency and provides a flexible way to deeply understand the vessel behavior patterns in NYRB waters. Then the complete characteristics of the spatial distribution and temporal variation of AIS trajectories are revealed. Based on that, three types of critical navigational risks are discovered, which include the safety distance risk, the pier collision risk, and the traffic congestion risk. Moreover, we find that the greatest risk is existed in small vessels in the flood season, which is worth the most concern.",

Detection of potential risks from accumulated vessel behaviors poses significant challenges to researchers and maritime authorities.

(2015) leveraged a fuzzy analytical hierarchy approach to analyze the navigational risks in port waters by using the navigation data collected from several captains. Faghih-Roohi et al. (2014) proposed a simulated accident model based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation for assessing accident risk based on limited accident data. Merrick et al. (2003) created a simulation model of ship navigation based on the Bayesian theory to estimate the navigational risks and the degree of ship congestion. However, the conventional methods for analyzing navigational risks are of limited practical use because they generally depend on subjective knowledge from experts, or modeling based on small amount of data (Zhang et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "1. For upstream vessels, Fig. 4a shows that the large vessels generally choose the fourth span to go through the bridge, while Fig. 4b indicates that there are a certain number of small vessels which choose the third span. Furthermore, by comparing the two figures, we can find that after traveling through the bridge, the average distance between the vessel trajectory of the small vessels and the north shore is smaller than that of the large vessels. 2. For downstream vessels, Fig. 4a shows that the traffic densities of the large vessels in the approach channel of the sixth span and the eighth span are basically the same; while in Figure 4b , the traffic density of the small vessels in the approach channels of the sixth span is much lower than that of the eighth span. This indicates that the downstream small vessels are more inclined to choose the eighth span to go through the bridge. 3. Figure 4b shows that near the #142 red navigation aid, there exists an obvious crossing track, which is mainly formed by the small city ferries (40 m-50 m) connecting the Nanjing City and the Pukou District. Figure 5 is the comparison result of the lane boundaries. It can be clearly seen that the lane boundary of the upstream small vessels is closer to the north shore than that of the large vessels. Besides, the overlap between the lane boundary of the upstream vessels and the designed waterway, denoted with dotted lines, is much lower than that of the downstream vessels. Figure 6 shows the variations of the AIS trajectories in different seasons. Here, for vessels traveling in the Yangtze River, the seasons refer in particular to the flood season (May to September) and the dry season (January to April and November to December). In this case, centerlines were used to represent the traffic lines for a clear contrast. The solid lines represent the large vessels and the dotted lines represent the small vessels; the red lines represent the flood season and the blue lines represent the dry season. Note that the lane centerlines of the small vessels in the approach channel of the sixth span could not be explicitly extracted due to the traffic lanes that were not salient. To demonstrate the differences in detail, we further took two cross sections at the upstream and downstream of the bridge respectively, and drew traffic density curves of the cross sections, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 . It can be found that the red lines are always on the north side of the blue lines, whether they are dotted lines or solid lines. This indicates that vessels are always closer to the north shore in the flood season than in the dry season whether they travel upstream or downstream. This trend can be observed more clearly from the variations of the density curves in Fig. 7 Next, the spatial relationship between vessels and the bridge axis was quantitatively investigated. This relationship provides an important reference for analyzing navigational risks in NYRB waters since it reflects the attitude and position of the vessels when passing through the bridge span. Figure 9 describes two indices for measuring the spatial relationship between the bridge axis and a sailing vessel. The \u03b1 means the included angle between the vessel's bow direction and the normal direction of the bridge axis (dotted line). The d means the distance between the central axis of the hull and the center of the bridge span. Here, the extracted lane centerlines were used to represent the central axis of the hull for calculating the indices of \u03b1 and d. Table 1 and Table 2 show the different values of \u03b1 and d at different bridge spans in different seasons. From Table 1 , we can find that the angle \u03b1 is maximum at the eighth span, followed by the fourth span and the sixth span. In addition, we can also find that the angle \u03b1 in the flood season is larger than that in the dry season, and the angle of the small vessels is larger than large vessels. From Table 2 , we can observe that the absolute value of the distance d of small vessels is generally larger than that of large vessels. For small vessels, the absolute value of d is maximum at the fourth span, followed by the eighth span and the sixth span. For large vessels, the absolute value of d is maximum at the eighth span, followed by the fourth span and the sixth span. Figure 10 depicts the monthly evolution of the AIS trajectories. For clarity, the representative centerlines are drawn in the first and second half of the year, and different colors are used to represent different months. As depicted in Fig. 10a , the lane centerlines of the upstream large vessels show a distinct changing trend from southeast to northwest over time. The downstream large vessels show the same trend, while the changing extend is relatively smaller. Meanwhile, the change of the centerlines in the approach channel of the sixth span is not obvious. In Fig. 10b , we can find the same changing trend for the small vessels. In Fig. 10c and Fig. 10d , we can observe that in the second half of the year, the centerlines show a reverse changing trend from northwest to southeast, and the changing extend is even greater than the first half of the year.",

As shown in Fig. 11 , the bar charts represent the distances between the centerlines and the boundary lines of the waterway, the line charts represent the monthly average water level in the Nanjing section of the Yangtze River from January to December in 2019. We can find that the monthly change extent is consistent with the change of the water level. Such consistency is particularly marked as the water level rises suddenly from February to March (which is called the spring flood).",

The representativeness gradually decreases from class 2 to class 4 due to that the inner similarities of the density values descend. From Fig. 12a , we can observe that the class 1 mainly distributes in the three approach channels of the navigable spans. The red area in the approach channel of the fourth span is distinctly longer than that of the sixth and the eighth span. This indicates that the navigation pressure of the waterway for the upstream large vessels is stably high throughout the year. Figure 12b shows the same high pressure in the approach channel of the fourth span for small vessels.

Moreover, based on the monthly results, the distance between vessels and the north shore has become closer as the water level rises. These can be explained by the vessels' choice for the most economic traveling in considering the water flow condition. As we introduced in the \"Study area\" section, the water flow in the middle of the river is faster than that of the two banks. Therefore, the upstream vessels prefer to sail in nearshore waters with lower resistance for reducing the oil consumption, increasing the speed, and promoting the economic benefits. Especially in the flood season, as the flow velocity increases and the water surface widens, the vessels are closer to the north shore.",

As we marked in Fig. 13a , the distances between the starboard side of the sailing vessels with wakes and the portside of the berthing vessels are merely 14 m and 16 m respectively. Therefore, if a sailing vessel is not maneuvered Fig. 9 The spatial relationship between the bridge axis and a vessel properly, it is very likely to touch with berthing vessels. The situation would be even worse when berthing vessels begin to move. As shown in the white box of the Fig. 13b , the large container is moving, while the small cargo is passing by, serious collision may occur if either of them made a mistake. Hence, it is very important for maritime authorities to enhance the supervision for the safety distance between vessels and the north shore.

The abovementioned angle \u03b1 and the distance d in the flood season are distinctly larger than those in the dry season. Besides, we also find that the \u03b1 and d of small vessels are larger than large vessels. This phenomenon is caused by the water flow conditions under the NYRB. As we mentioned, there is an angle between the water flow direction and the normal direction of the bridge axis. Hence, the unfavorable force of the water flow would easily carry the vessels to collide to the bridge piers. In fact, the reason why there is a high degree of consistency between the monthly evolution of AIS trajectories and the water level change is that vessels have taken maneuvers to avoid such collision. Vessels need to adjust the hull to north before they sailed into the narrow approach channel, in order to obtain more space to rectify their position to aim at the span. The higher the water level and the faster the water flow, the further north the vessel would take.",

It is not difficult to understand the high pressure of the fourth span because it is the only navigable span for vessels to travel upstream. While for the eighth span, the stably high pressure is mainly caused by the traffic flow of small vessels. Although small vessels can choose the sixth span to route, they prefer to choose the eighth span due to that the water flow near the sixth span is irregular and the velocity is faster. However, such long-term persistent high pressure will bring great traffic congestion risk to safety navigation. The narrow bridge span is the primary cause of accidents. The literature from Park et al. (2008) reported that nearly 90% of the accidents associated with bridges across waterways happened when the width of the navigable span is less than 500 m. However, the clearance width of the navigable span of the NYRB is merely 120 m. Due to this limitation, only one vessel can pass at a time, and other vessels must slow down and queue up to wait in the approach channel. A certain number of small vessels even choose the unofficial third span to travel in order to catch up with time. Figure 15 demonstrates the traffic congestion risk through snapshots from remote sensing images. In Fig. 15a , a crowd of sailing vessels congests in the narrow approach channel of the fourth span; among them, there is even a fleet of 14 vessels. It is easy to rub against each other in the narrow space. Moreover, the distance between the front and rear vessels may be sometimes very close when speed is fast. As shown in Fig. 15b , the distance between the two small vessels is less than 23 m, nearly colliding with each other. Note that the remote image was captured in April 2020, which means it was still in the period of Coronavirus 2019, the traffic flow was much lower than usual. Once an accident occurs near the bridge span, more serious secondary accidents will happen due to the large inertia of subsequent vessels.",

In addition, other factors which may impact navigational risks such as the speed and the course of vessels will also be considered. The exploration of adding the meteorological information to risk analysis will be another interesting future research topic.",
