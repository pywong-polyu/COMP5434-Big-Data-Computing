In this paper, we revisit and extend their model, thus we present their assumptions and results in more detail. They considered a situation where cells can produce different leaky materials that are essential for a higher carrying capacity. Variants may range from non-producers (complete cheaters) to generalist strains producing all types of secretions. Oliveira et al. assumed that numerous local populations are founded initially by some cells. Populations grow within local habitats following a dynamics depending on the proportions of different producer strains. After the growth phase, cells are mixed together and establish new local populations which then start to grow. This life cycle continues iteratively until a stationary state is reached. They showed that specialist interdependent producer strains are selected only if the cost of secretion is high and a medium number of individuals found a new habitat (genotype mixing or heterogeneity is at intermediate level). A low level of heterogeneity favors generalist cooperators, while high levels of heterogeneity prefers complete cheaters. Additionally, the coexistence of complete cheaters and generalist cooperators was possible under at very specific circumstances in their model.",

If diffusion of the secretions is faster than the cells movement, a concentration gradient is present around the producers. Therefore, increasing the density increases the proximity of cheaters to the cooperators which helps cheaters to exhaust cooperators intensively (Ross-Gillespie et al., 2009; Morris et al., 2014) . On the other hand, diffusion of the secretions can sometimes be slow compared to the cell's movement. Then, increasing density enhances the amount of public goods that can be captured by the cooperators themselves (Dobay et al., 2014) . Lindsay and his colleagues recently proved experimentally that both cases are realized (Lindsay et al., 2018) . Thus, we extended the model used by Oliveira et al. (2014) to include density-dependent private benefit of cooperators. Besides this extension, we also modified the basic dynamical system to describe the competition among the strains more adequately.",

A consequence of the nonrandom distribution of cells and the secreted material is that the relative fitness of cheaters and cooperators is density-dependent. Evidence that the relative fitness of cooperators can increase or decrease with density (see the Introduction) is supported by theoretical and experimental results. In this way, taking this effect into consideration we modify the availability of the secreted material in the function of density and trait-type in eqs. (4, 5). We introduce the \u2206(g ) function which describes the density-dependent private benefit of producers, where g = g 0 + g 1 is the total density of the population.

Red lines denotes the equilibrium density of cheaters, black lines denotes the equilibrium density of cooperators. The cheater state is globally stable for \u03b4/c below a critical level and locally stable above it (horizontal red line at density 1). a) Private benefit decreases with density. b) Private benefit increases with density. c = 0.01, r = 1, K base = 1, K max = 10 5 , K \u2206 = K max /2 \u03b4/c 1/2. There is a polymorphic stable equilibrium of cheaters and cooperators between 1/2 \u03b4/c 3/2 , while the cheater strategy becomes a locally stable state if \u03b4/c 1/2. If \u03b4/c 3/2 the system will be bi-stable with alternative monomorphic stable states, the dynamics converges either to the cooperative or to the cheater state ( Fig.   3a ). The situation is simpler if the private benefit increases with density. Then again the cheater strategy is the only stable state below a critical \u03b4/c, and the system becomes bi-stable with the pure cooperative and pure cheater state above this \u03b4/c level (Fig. 3b) . Naturally, there is an unstable polymorphic fixed point between the alternative stable states, which is not depicted in the figure. For the analysis of the 2-secretions model, again it can be shown easily that cheaters win over cooperators if there is no private benefit (\u03b4 = 0). Using a similar argument from the 1-secretion model, we can give a sufficient condition for the competitive dominance of cheaters over generalist cooperators ( g 00 d t > g 00 d t , for every g 00 , g 11 > 0).

As \u03b4/c increases further cheater strategy is dismissed by the generalist cooperator in the polymorphic equilibrium, and increasing \u03b4/c even further results in that the generalist cooperator and the cheater will be the two alternative stable states of the dynamics (Fig. 4) .",

In our model system, the cooperative genotypes are probably supported by the population structure. For the 1-secretion model the intuitive explanation is simple: consider a case when the cheater excludes the cooperator (\u03b4/c < 1/2) in a local population. This will happen in every local population where there is at least one cheater initially. In those local populations which contain only cooperators initially, populations grow to a much higher population density (K max K base ) than in those \"infected\" by the cheaters. Consequently, the local cooperative populations send a lot of cooperators to the next generation, balancing or even overriding the weakness of cooperators in competition with cheaters locally. However, here we studied a more complex situation where besides the complete cheaters, the specialist and generalist cooperators are in competition with each other where the private benefit of the producers is density dependent.",

A very low n favours the generalist cooperators, while the cheater strategy excludes the others at a high n as in the local populations (Fig. 6 a,b) . The explanation is the following: although generalist cooperators are competitively inferior to cheaters and specialist cooperators at a small \u03b4/c, there is some probability that an initial local population is formed only by one genotype at very low n (n < 4). If only the generalist cooperators inhabit a local population initially then this population reaches a very high density (nearly K max ) at the end of the growth phase, thus transferring a high number of generalists to the next generation. Naturally, it is highly probable that local populations will be founded by specialist cooperators and cheaters initially, however, specialist cooperators have a significantly smaller carrying capacity (nearly K max /4) than the population of generalists, not to mention that the cheaters' carrying capacity is K base . As a consequence, generalist cooperators exclude their competitors. As n increases, the probability of having a founder population with a single strategy decreases. This is detrimental to the generalist cooperators since they are competitively inferior to the other strategies while the specialist cooperators suffer less. Furthermore, higher n increases the probability that interdependent mutualistic couples be formed initially. Consequently, specialist cooperators win the competition for an intermediate n.",

Changing the parameters in the opposite direction favors the generalist producer. Other parameters are the same as in Fig 6. secretions model, it is not surprising that this qualitative similarity continues in the structured population. Similarly to the 2-secretions model we found that the C h strategy wins the competition only if the relative private benefit of cooperation is small and the mean number of founder cells is high (Fig. S3 ), while C o3 always wins the competition if there are only two or three founder cells in the local population (Fig. S3 ). Further, if the relative private benefit is high, then C o3 will be the winner of the selection, independently of the number of founder cells (Fig. S3 g, h) . C o3 is competitively inferior to any other strategy if \u03b4/c is small or not big ( Fig. S1 and Fig. S4 ), so this strategy is excluded in every local population where there are individuals from the other strategies initially. This happens more and more frequently as n increases. On the contrary, C o2 cooperators are successful when there are only a few founder individuals locally and \u03b4/c is small or moderate (Fig. S3a, b,c) . In these cases, there is a high probability that two different genotypes of C o2 are placed together in the same local population. They mutually help each other; thus this local population can reach a high population density. Although C h or any member of C o1 excludes the mutualistic C o2 pairs (see Fig. S1 and Fig. S4 ), the chance of these competitors being together with the C o2 pairs in the founder populations is low if n is not too large. Increasing the number of founders further makes co-residence of C h and C o1 with C o2 more probable initially. Consequently, the relative benefit of C o 2 decreases. In parallel, the complete co-residence of the interdependent C o1 community occurs with higher probability in local populations, increasing the relative benefit of this strategy. Thus C o1 will be the winner of the selection or will be dominant in the whole population at a medium n (Fig. S3 a,b, c) . As in the 2-secretions model, different cooperative strategies are in coexistence only if the private benefit decreases with density, \u03b4/c is roughly 0.5 to 1.5 and n is not too small to prevent the emergence of cooperative coalitions initially (Fig. S3 c, e) . According to the numerical simulations (not shown), the parameter dependence of the results remains the same as in the 2-secretions model: smaller K \u2206 and \u03bd > 1 are favorable for the specialist cooperators, while \u03bd < 1 increases the parameter space where the generalist win the competition.",

A quicker decrease (smaller K \u2206 ) of density dependence of the private benefit helps the interdependent mutualists to coexist with the generalist (Fig. 4a,b and Fig. 7a ). The situation is the opposite if the private benefit increases with density: faster saturation to the maximum private benefit increases the success of the generalists and suppresses the specialists (Fig. 5a,b and Fig. 7b ). The intuitive explanation is the following: specialists have a competitive benefit over the generalists at lower densities since their density independent growth rate is larger than the generalist's growth rate ( r 10 = r 01 > r 11 ), but the generalists can have a fitness benefit over specialists at higher densities because they can reach a higher equilibrium density. The relative dominance of these opposite effects is affected by the density dependence of the private benefit. If it is strong at lower densities and negligible at high densities, this supports the specialists, if it is significant at high densities this promotes the generalist strategy.",

            "text": "Theoretical and experimental studies pointed out earlier that cooperators are supported in the spatially structured populations (Nowak, 2006; Chuang et al., 2009) . However, these studies considered only the selection of a cooperative and a cheater strategy, different common goods and the mutual dependence of specialized cooperators, in other words, the presence of partial cheaters was not possible. One of the few exceptions is the work by Oliveira et al. (2014) who they focused on the possibility of mutualistic interactions between specialized cooperators in a structured population. They have found that microbial mutualism is possible only if the number of founder individuals is not extremely large (n = 4 \u2212 8) and the cost of producing the leaky material is high (c > 0.1). This result led them to the conclusion that interdependent mutualism among the partners competing for the same niche should be rare in microbial communities. We used in our model the same population structure as Oliveira et al (2014), but our conclusion is significantly different because density dependent private benefit is taken into account. Comparing the dynamical behavior in the structured model with the well-mixed model (see e.g. Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6) , it is apparent that dynamics in the local population are strongly retained in the structured population, although the population structure further increases the possibility of microbial cooperation. Naturally, if n is small then the generalist genotype will be the winner of the competition, but specialist mutualists win or coexist with other genotypes for a larger number of founder cells under very different circumstances (Fig. 6 Fig. S3 ). Further, the mutually dependent cooperators are selected in the structured population even in those cases when the cheater strategy is the winner of the competition in the well-mixed population. Our results suggest that interdependent mutualism should not be rare in real microbial communities, especially in those in which their private benefit decreases with density. The selection of interdependent cooperation and coexistence of traits with different levels of cooperation, in general, is in harmony with the Black Queen Hypothesis which explains the loss of essential leaky functions of microbes as an adaptive process (Morris et al., 2014; Morris, 2015) . The consequence of the adaptive loss of the production of leaky materials is that the effectiveness of communities with specialist cooperators is sub-optimal since maximal population density can be attained if generalist cooperators dominate the community (Fig. 4) .",
