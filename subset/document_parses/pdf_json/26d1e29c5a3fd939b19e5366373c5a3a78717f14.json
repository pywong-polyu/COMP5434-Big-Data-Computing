The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is so high that up to 66% of family members in close proximity to a confirmed case are likely to be infected by one of these two routes [1] [2] [3] . Transmission via aerosols (airborne particles less than 5 \u00b5m also called \"droplet nuclei\") is also known to be possible when these particles are generated during certain medical procedures such as nebulization, mechanical ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and bronchofibroscopy, among others. To date, insufficient scientific evidence exists to support the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the air through small particles that remain floating for hours in the environment.",

Their analyses found no detectable viral load in the samples taken from the exhaled air. Although this sampling was carried out in a room that simulated a well-ventilated room, it was possible to detect SARS-CoV-2 in an environmental sample taken from near the patient's bed, indicating that contact transmission, but not airborne transmission, was possible [3] . Other published reports of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have also found no viral load in air samples taken from their environments [3] .",

[4] reported that viable viral loads could be detected in the air for up to 3 hours (the time Letter to the Editor the sample collection lasted), it is important to keep in mind that in their study, aerosols were generated in an attempt to simulate the possible aerial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 employing high-powered nebulizers (\"three-jet collision nebulizers\") that do not reflect the droplets generated by human beings under actual coughing conditions. Thus, their findings may demonstrate that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible, but under non-physiological conditions. As previously mentioned, there are some medical procedures, such as aerosol-generating nebulization, that are recognized as sources of nosocomial airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, this study does not demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne in the community.",

The current information indicates that homemade and cloth masks do not provide sufficient protection from acquiring an infection by a respiratory virus [5] . Although surgical masks may protect the wearer, prior training is necessary to make them effective, instead of risky [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, the general population should be recommended to wear at least one surgical mask. (2) Would the extensive use of surgical masks be enough to avoid airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2? We know that in Asian countries, the use of masks has been prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the role of mask-wearing in the containment of the pandemic is limited, and any observed associations may even be coincidental, because so far, the evidence supporting the use of masks in the community is also scarce [2] [3] [4] [5] .",
