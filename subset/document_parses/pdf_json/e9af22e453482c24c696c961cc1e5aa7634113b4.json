Iran was one of those first countries facing the second wave of coronavirus, due to the lack of appropriate public restrictions because of economic problems the country is facing. The clinical and demographic characteristics of severe cases and non-severe cases of Coronavirus Disease in 192 patients in Tehran, Iran, between June 16 and July 11, 2020, were investigated. The patients were divided into severe cases (n = 82) and non-severe cases (n = 110). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two study clusters. The mean age was 54.6 \u00b1 17.2 years, and the most common presenting symptom was persistent cough (81.8%) and fever (79.7%). The logistic regression model revealed that age, BMI, and affected family members were statistically associated with severity. Patients with complicated conditions of disorders faced more hospitalization days and medical care than the average statistical data. As the coronavirus spike in the case and death reports from June 2020, we observed the rise in the incidence of severe cases, where 42.7% (82/192) of cases have resulted in severe conditions. Our findings also suggested that the effect of IFB (Betamethasone) was more valid than the other alternative drugs such as LPV/r and IVIg.",

Recent daily reports from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran had demonstrated that several provinces in Iran are now experiencing a continues to rise in the case and death report, indicating the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, as of July 30, 2020, the number Iranian infected by coronavirus reached over 300,000 [3] .

Iran was one of those first countries facing the second wave of coronavirus, due to the lack of appropriate public restrictions because of economic problems faced by unfair sanctions against the country [5, 6] .

Coronaviruses can cause respiratory tract infections, which can result in a mild form (Rhinoviruses), causing common cold, or lethal form (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and COVID- 19) , which can be severe and even fatal [7] . SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS-Cov (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were two pathogenic human coronaviruses that happened in recent decades with thousands of case reports [8, 9] , but the MERS-Cov did reach high mortality rates of up to 50% in some populations in the region of Middle East [8] . COVID-19, as an RNA virus, was a new type of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first observed in late 2019, so the disease was named COVID-19 [10, 11] . There are similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (leading to genome sequence identity between the two viruses is 79.5% [12] . The SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to severe conditions and even fatal pneumonia SARS-CoV-2 acts very similar to the way SARS-CoV infection was associated with high mortality [13] . There are pieces of evidence for person-to-person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in spaces people share and gather (family members living in the same place, dormitories, etc.), hospitals and health care facilities, and public transport systems (bus, subway, etc.) [14, 15] .",

A recent study consisting of 1420 patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 indicated that the most common symptoms are headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%) [18] . There is not any effective and validated therapy (including vaccine or any antiviral drugs) for COVID-19 until now, but supportive therapies that ease the symptoms and protect multi-organ function may be beneficial. We can decrease the mortality rate and health care service cost by Identifying the integrated symptoms, clinical and demographic characteristics of patients, and identifying the high-risk groups exposed to ease the mortality rate. This retrospective study on the clinical and demographic characteristics of 192 patients with COVID-19, divided into severe and no-severe clusters, was administrated at Amir Al-Momenin Teaching Hospital and Bu Ali Hospital in Tehran. The patients and their extracted clinical data belonged to the coronavirus spike in cases and death reports in Iran, which was started during June 2020. We aimed to understand the collected clinical and demographical data during this coronavirus spike, to compare the demographic, clinical reports, and laboratory results of severe and non-severe patients.",

During this period, there was a significant coronavirus spike in the case and death reports, and we reported the incidence of severe cases by 42.7% (82/192). COVID-19 as an infectious disease has infected a large number of people all around the world and countries such as Iran [19] . According to recent studies around the world, the clinical manifestations of coronavirus patients are not consistent or having a fixed pattern and so the fertility rate and percentage of severe patients are very different [20] . The incidence of severe cases by a recent meta-analysis was the same as our findings, and it may reflect the same complicated wave of the epidemic taking place in Iran [17] . The male gender, with 102 cases (53.7%) were more exposed to the risk of infection with coronavirus, and the available BMI of part of the participated cases indicated that the male gender did have a higher chance of over-weight than females. The factor of age in patients induces the risk of death and fertility mainly because of declined immune system ability [21] and our logistic regression results indicated the correlation between age and fertility risk (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.12). The average time from the onset of symptoms to admission at the hospital, about 6 \u00b1 5 days in non-severe patients but severe patients experienced a higher average time of 10 \u00b1 5 days for the diagnostician of their coronavirus infection; but in contrast, the non-severe cases spend less hospitalization time (5 \u00b1 4, against 9 \u00b1 5). Patients with complicated conditions of disorders especially do suffering from two different disorders, may face more To date, there was not any recommended and high-effective treatment for COVID-19 patients, but there were some reports on the efficient effect of some anti-inflammatory drugs for severe patients with chronic lung conditions [22] . Most patients undergo treatments dealing with the control of their hydration, nutrition, and fever [23] . In severe cases, those suffering from hypoxia, mechanical ventilation, high flow nasal cannula, and face mask may supply the inhaling oxygen [24, 25] . Some anti-viral drugs can be used as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents including interferon-alpha (IFN\u03b1), Remdesivir, Betamethasone (IFB) Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), and Arbidol [24] [25] [26] . There were patients receiving medicines for their current treatment (any background diseases) or their severe conditions due to coronavirus infection. These medications including IFB (Betamethasone), Kaletra or Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r), and IVIg (Intravenous immunoglobulin) may have good impacts for severe patients, but there is not any Food and Drug Administration approval on it. Betamethasone is a steroid prevents the release of substances in the body, which causes inflammation [26] . IFB can be prescribed for use in the treatment of many different inflammatory conditions such as allergic reactions, multiple sclerosis, and inflammation of the joints or tendons, and problems caused by low adrenal gland hormone levels [27] . Recent studies indicated that IFN\u03b1 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV in vitro, suggesting that IFN\u03b1 can be considered as a potential drug candidate for COVID-19 therapy [26] . Lopinavir/Ritonavir with the brand name of Kaletra can slow down HIV, the infection that causes AIDS [28] . Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy (IVIg) can help people with weakened immune systems or other diseases fight off infections such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [29] . The findings suggested that the effect of IFB (Betamethasone) was more valid than the others were.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study aimed to run a retrospective study on the clinical and demographic characteristics of 192 patients with COVID-19, divided into severe and no-severe clusters, in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. This study was conducted during the second coronavirus spike in cases and death reports in Iran. With the appearance of the pandemic, many researchers and clinicians struggle to identify symptoms and characterization of the pandemic and even propose effective drugs dealing with it. We found demographic and clinical differences between severe and non-severe clusters. It can be suggested that patients of male gender and elderly people may face more probably severe conditions, just as other recent studies suggested [18] . The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were cough (81.8%), fever (79.7%), headache (70.3%), and Fatigue (68.8%). The most hospitalization period achieved by patients suffering from COPD and CVD (22.17 days) and HTN, Diabetes, and HCL (21.10 days). Our findings also suggested that the effect of IFB (Betamethasone) was more valid than the other alternative drugs used, such as LPV/r and IVIg. We hope by further studies, the mortality rate and health care service cost may be decreased by identifying the integrated symptoms, clinical and demographic characteristics of patients, suggesting alternative medicines, and identifying the high-risk groups exposed to ease the mortality rate.
