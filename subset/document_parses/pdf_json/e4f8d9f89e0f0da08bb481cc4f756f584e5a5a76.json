The pus developed from the infection compromises the blood supply beneath the periosteum, leading to ischemia which in turn becomes necrotic. The frequency of occurrence of maxillary osteomyelitis is less owing to the extensive blood supply, presence of thin cortical plates, and scantiness of medullary tissues impeding the limitation of infections within the bone. The involvement of fungus in the bone marrow renders the fungal organisms' growth, affecting the endothelial lining of vessels causing vascular insufficiency eventually leading to necrosis of the bone developing into fungal osteomyelitis. Fungal osteomyelitis offers high diagnostic difficulty and is more aggressive.",

He was diagnosed in a local hospital with acute right maxillary sinusitis by the Department of ENT and it did not resolve after the antibiotic course. Later he was referred to a faciomaxillary surgeon and was advised for a CBCT of the maxilla. It revealed aggressive osteolytic lesions with respect to the right maxilla. So a biopsy was done, curettage and saucerization was performed, and the sample was sent for histopathological examination which in turn confirmed as fungal osteomyelitis. History of paresthesia was present in the same region. Then the patient came to our hospital with no relief of pain and also the radiation of pain towards the zygoma region of the right side. The patient was also a known case of Hypertension and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and was under medication for the same. On extraoral examination gross facial asymmetry was noted with swelling extending from the infraorbital rim till zygomatic bone anteroposteriorly and medial canthus of the eye till the alar base of the nose of the right side. The swelling was firm, tender on palpation, non-erythematous, non-fluctuant, and was devoid of any surface change. The reduction in the mouth opening was noticed. Intraoral examination revealed a large defect involving the first quadrant, with no active pus discharge. Medically the treatment was started by administering insulin and iv liposomal Amphotericin B 5 mg/kg/day. Surgical resection via Weber Ferguson approach according to the involvement of midface bone as shown in the CT scan ( Fig. 1 ) was done. Later antifungal drug was changed to oral Itraconazole 200 mg. 2 months post-discharge patient has not shown any signs of re-infection. Case Report 2: 50-year-old male patient reported to our hospital with a complaint of swelling over the right side of the midface since 2 months. His history included swelling of the same region with pus discharge treated by extraction of all teeth of the upper right quadrant with grade III mobility following an antibiotic course 2 months before. Despite the treatment, the swelling did not reduce. The patient is a known case of uncontrolled type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Initial examination showed a firm, non-tender, non-erythematous, non-fluctuant swelling in the right malar region with no evidence of any drainage. Intraoral examination revealed a necrotic alveolar region in the right posterior maxillary region and swelling involving the hard palate. A biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed thick-walled aseptate fungal hyphae with right-angled branching in P.A.S. stain and we diagnosed it as mucormycosis of the right maxilla. Medically the treatment was started by administering insulin and intrevenous liposomal Amphotericin B 250 mg. Surgical resection via Weber Ferguson approach according to the involvement of midface bone as shown in the CT scan (Fig. 2) was done. Post surgically antifungal drug was changed to oral Posaconazole 300 mg. 2 months post-discharge patient has not shown any signs of re-infection.",

In COVID-19, infected lung epithelial cells produce IL-8 and IL-6. IL-8 is a chemoattractant for neutrophils and T cells. Infiltration of inflammatory cells in a massive amount owing to lymphopenia was observed in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients. In severe cases, thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were other prominent symptoms along with respiratory distress. These patients also showed elevated d-dimer and fibrinogen levels. The function of the endothelium includes the promotion of vasodilation, fibrinolysis, and anti-aggregation. COVID-19 patient's hypercoagulable profiles indicate a significant endothelial injury. This will increase microvascular permeability facilitating bacterial invasion [3] . Chinese studies have found a high percentage of secondary infections (8-15%) in COVID-19 patients, including bacterial or fungal infections, and Chen et al. concluded in their study on 99 COVID-19 patients that only 5% cases developed fungal infections [4] .",

Germination and invasive growth of acquired fungal spores are facilitated by high glucose levels, excess levels of ketone bodies, low pH environment, reduced oxygen, and high iron levels. Hyperglycaemia causes excessive glycosylation of transferrin and ferritin with a subsequent decrease in the iron-binding affinity of these proteins. Rhizoferrin produced by fungal hyphae forms iron-rhizoferin complexes after binding to serum iron which is required for the growth, development, and multiplication of fungal spores [6] . Vascular invasion of the vegetative forms into vessels forms thrombus within, causing ischemic infarcts sequentially causing necrosis of adjacent tissues.",
