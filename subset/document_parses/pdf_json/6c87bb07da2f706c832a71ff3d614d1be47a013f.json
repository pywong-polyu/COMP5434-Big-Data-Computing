At risk groups including diabetic and obese patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19-related complications and poor outcomes. Substantial evidence points to hypovitaminosis D as a risk factor for severe disease, the need for ICU, and mortality. 1,25(OH)D, a key regulator of calcium homeostasis, is believed to have various immune-regulatory roles including; promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines, down regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, dampening entry and replication of SARS-COV-2, and the production of antimicrobial peptides. In addition, there are strong connections which suggest that dysregulated 1,25(OH)D levels play a mechanistic and pathophysiologic role in several disease processes that are shared with COVID-19 including: diabetes, obesity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, and even hypercoagulable states. With evidence continuing to grow for the case that low vitamin D status is a risk factor for COVID-19 disease and poor outcomes, there is a need now to address the public health efforts set in place to minimize infection, such as lock down orders, which may have inadvertently increased hypovitaminosis D in the general population and those already at risk (elderly, obese, and disabled). Moreover, there is a need to address the implications of this evidence and how we may apply the use of cheaply available supplementation, which has yet to overcome the near global concern of hypovitaminosis D. In our review, we exhaustively scope these shared pathophysiologic connections between COVID-19 and hypovitaminosis D.",

Although Vit D3 has a longer t \u00bd and higher affinity for Vit D binding protein (Vit BP), the total concentration of both D2+D3 are used to assess Vit D functional status. Figure 1 (Haussler et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2014 ) demonstrates the physiology of Vit D. Vit D3 is synthesized in the skin using ultraviolet rays from the sun, or obtained from ingesting Vit D containing foods (fish, mushrooms, fortified foods, etc.). Hydroxylation occurs in the liver and then again in the kidney to form 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25(OH) 2D], the active metabolite which functions as a nuclear hormone through its affinity for the transcription factor Vit D receptor (VDR) (Lips 2006) . VDR is expressed in the vast majority of human cells extending the role of Vit D beyond just calcium homeostasis and bone formation (Lips 2006) .",

            "text": "1,25(OH)D affects both the innate and adaptive immune system (Aranow 2011) . VDRs are present in activated macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and thymus tissue (Tsalamandris et al. 2019) . 1,25(OH)D has been shown to modulate the immune system in the following ways: (1) promoting the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages (increasing cytotoxicity); (2) reducing antigen-presenting activity of macrophages; (3) preventing the maturation of dendritic cells; (4) inhibiting delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions; (5) inhibiting T lymphocyte-mediated immunoglobulin synthesis; (6) suppressing the activity and generation of new natural killer cells; (7) decreasing pro-inflammatory type I cytokines [interferon (IFN)-\u0263, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b2, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12] (Tsalamandris et al. 2019); and (8) increasing anti-inflammatory type II cytokines (IL-4,5,10, and regulatory T cells) (Zdrenghea et al. 2017) . When looking at the relationship between 1,25(OH)D and viral immunity, Teymoori-Rad et al. points out that hypovitaminosis D is associated with an increased CD4/ CD8 ratio, which would result in the decreased ability of the immune system to produce activated T lymphocytes (CD8+ T), which predominately target virally infected B cells (Teymoori-Rad et al. 2019) . Vit D also promotes the production of human \u03b2 defensins (HBDs), which facilitate the antiviral state against infection (Teymoori-Rad et al. 2019 ). Viral infections up-regulate CYP27B1, a cationic host defense peptide involved in the innate immunity of intracellular pathogens (Teymoori-Rad et al. 2019) . CYP27B1 (mainly expressed in respiratory epithelial cells) along with Vit D induce cathelicidin (an antimicrobial peptide) at the site of infection (Teymoori-Rad et al. 2019) . Elevated levels of CYP27B1 promote the expression of Vit D-regulated genes, particularly those with immuno-modulatory actions, which proves to be beneficial in response to respiratory viruses (Teymoori-Rad et al. 2019 ). Hansdottri and colleagues found that 1,25(OH)D stimulates I\u04a1B\u03b1, a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u04a1B) inhibitor located within airway epithelium, which reduces the induction of NF-\u04a1B in response to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Hansdottir et al. 2010) . They also demonstrated that despite the activation of I\u04a1B\u03b1 and the dampening of chemokines, there was no further increase in viral proteins, mRNA, or replication (Hansdottir et al. 2010) . With normal levels of serum 1,25(OH)D, there is optimal stimulation of cathelicidin and defensins, which not only promote antimicrobial activity of the immune system, but have been found to destroy the influenza virus. Greiller et al. found that 1,25(OH)D has a direct effect on T-cells, which is independent of dendritic cell activity (Greiller and Martineau 2015) .",

It is characterized by the hyperactivity and proliferation of macrophages, natural killer cells, T cells, as well as the over production of more than 150 inflammatory mediators and cytokines, which may be released by immune or non-immune cells/components (Sun et al. 2020) . Under the effect of ultraviolet rays (sun), 7-dehydrocholesterol (skin) is converted to vitamin D3 (which is also present in food sources demonstrated at the bottom left corner). Vitamin D3 in the liver undergoes its first hydroxylation (25-hydroxylase) to form 25-(OH) D. In the kidneys, 25-(OH) D undergoes a second hydroxylation (1-\u03b1 hydroxylase) to form 1, 25-(OH) D, which enters into the cell via vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR). This promotes the formation of calcium binding protein which allows for calcium absorption from the gut and into the bloodstream. Vitamin D targets multiple bodily cells including; bone, malignant, and immune cells Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an alarming condition which results from lung tissue damage caused by platelet and neutrophil dependent injury to the protective barriers of the respiratory tract (epithelial and endothelial) (Matthay and Zemans 2011) . The damaged epithelial barrier will deprive the lung of optimal surfactant levels resulting in alveolar edema and collapse (Matthay and Zemans 2011) . The clinical presentation of ARDS can also be demonstrated in cytokine storm, seeing that hypercytokinemia directly injures the lung using the same mechanisms (Fajgenbaum and June 2020; Matthay and Zemans 2011) .",

They also demonstrated that 1,25(OH)D and serum ferritin are inversely correlated (P = 0.013), which suggests that in an active COVID-19 infection, there is both a state of hypovitaminosis D and hyperferritinemia (Menshawey et al. 2020 ). In addition, COVID-19 patients with Vit D deficiency had a greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and longer ICU stays (Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2020 Table 1 Laboratory profiles in the setting of COVID-19 and hypovitaminosis D This table demonstrates different categories of laboratory profiles which are affected in positive COVID-19 patients as well as individuals with hypovitaminosis D regardless of etiology. The fifth column demonstrates the changes that would occur to these profiles in response to vitamin D supplementation. Although some results may be inconclusive, it should be noted that there are similar changes to these laboratory profiles in the setting of both COVID-19 and hypovitaminosis D. Both pathologies present with elevated inflammatory markers, liver and renal function (except albumin levels) tests, as well as coagulation profiles. Regardless of pathology, correction of vitamin D levels (through supplementation) also corrected these laboratory markers Profiles ) demonstrates specific laboratory profiles of COVID-19 and hypovitaminosis D, as well as the effect of correcting 1,25(OH)D levels (via supplementation) on these profiles (in any pathological state). It can be seen that the inflammatory derangements in immunity are nearly identical in COVID-19 and hypovitaminosis D, which are resolved upon normalization. In a study assessing 25(OH) D concentrations among asymptomatic and severely ill COVID-19 patients (n = 154), Jain et al. found that: (1) there was a significantly lower level of 25(OH) D in the severely ill patient group, (2) serum inflammatory makers (TNF alpha and IL-6) were elevated in the vitamin deficient group; and (3) fatality rate was significantly increased in the low Vit D group, which suggests an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality if associated with hypovitaminosis D. They recommended that a mass administration of Vit D supplementation be provided to the general public, especially those at risk of contracting COVID-19 . Nurshad Ali pointed out that mechanisms, including: papain-like protease-mediated replication and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 receptor (DPP4/CD26) binding are required to elucidate virulence mechanisms of COVID-19 (Ali 2020). Human DPP4/CD26 connects with the S1 domain of the spike protein of SARS-COV-2, which suggests that this substance may be a virulence factor for COVID-19 (Ali 2020). In vivo studies have shown that upon correction of hypovitaminosis D, the DPP4/CD26 receptor is significantly reduced (Ali 2020) .",

A classical feature of the Coronavirus genus is the Nsp15-like endoribonucleases, which was hypothesized to be the proofreader, but was later found to regulate the length of viral RNA (number of polyuridine found at the 5' end of the negative strand) to evade the hosts' response to foreign nucleic acid (innate response). Shalayel et al. (2020) concluded that Vit D may be a potential drug against COVID-19 compared to other repurposed medications seeing that it has the strongest interaction against the Nsp 15 of COVID-19 binding sites (Shalayel et al. 2020) . These data requires more clarification, but raises an important question; can Vit D enhance the hosts' immunity against COVID-19 by targeting the endoribonuclease (responsible for evading the hosts' immunity during the incubation period) to limit the number of viral particles that result in cytokine storm and subsequent immune-mediated tissue destruction? More robust research is needed to determine the exact effects of Vit D in the setting of COVID-19 infection, and its potentially protective role in limiting transmission, pathogenesis, and severity of the infection.

Evidence supports the antiviral activity of cathelicidin during influenza A and RSV via binding to the virus and disrupting its envelope while modulating the response of cytokines and toll-like receptor (TLR) 3. Defensin was seen to inhibit RSV by destabilizing its envelope with subsequent inhibition of viral entry (Zdrenghea et al. 2017) . As mentioned before, both defensin and cathelicidin are affected by Vit D. Zdrenghea and colleagues reported that in experimental conditions, human alveolar epithelial cells (line A549) treated with Vit D prior to H1N1 exposure lowered the levels of H1N1-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (Zdrenghea et al. 2017 ). Jolliffe et al. in a review concluded that patients with hypovitaminosis D had an increased risk of developing both upper and lower respiratory tract infections (Jolliffe et al. 2013 ). Contradicting to this data, Vuichard Gysin et al. in a systematic review and metanalysis of 15 trials found that, in previously healthy individuals, Vit D supplementation did not reduce the risk of clinical respiratory infections (Vuichard Gysin, 2016) . However, they suggested that this conclusion is based on a group of studies that varied with respect to, baseline levels of Vit D, the population, and the length of the study (Vuichard Gysin et al. 2016 ). Cannell et al. reviewed the effects of Vit D and the Influenza virus. In England, a significant inverse correlation is seen between the incidence of influenza and temperature, which is strongly associated with solar radiation (Cannell et al. 2006) . They also pointed out that, at a latitude of 52\u00baN (the latitude of London), no Vit D is formed in the skin, especially during October to March, since the atmospheric zone filters out most of the ultraviolet radiation (Cannell et al. 2006 ). In addition, during these months in particular, influenza associated mortality peaks, not only in the UK, but in other Western/European countries (Cannell et al. 2006) . This may be one of the factors which could explain why currently, there is an exponential growth in COVID-19 infections and mortality during the winter season. Rhodes et al. found that countries in the northern hemisphere (during May 2020) had higher rates of COVID-19 mortality (Rhodes et al. 2021) . For every increase in latitude degree north (above 23\u00ba N), there was an increase in mortality by 4.4% (P 0.031) (Rhodes et al. 2021) .",

Interestingly, there is also a rise in COVID-19 cases and associated mortality in countries that do not fall within the latitude of Non-Scandinavian European countries. For example, in Brazil, the number of cases has risen by over 70,000 just within the first week of June 2021 (Organization 2020). This does not directly correlate with the latitude or the amount of sun exposure, but may actually be linked to the fact that Vit D deficiency is highly prevalent, according to a study which consisted of 80,000 Brazilian people (Le\u00e3o et al. 2021) .

Evidence confirms that the VDR is expressed within preadipocytes. During the differentiation of adipocytes, 1,25(OH)D inhibits C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA and C/EBP\u03b2 (CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins which are a family of transcription factors), which are involved with lipogenic enzymatic activity of specific enzymes like fatty acid synthase, a strong precursor of lipid synthesis (Wong et al. 2009 ). The inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)D on preadipocyte differentiation may be more prevalent with higher intakes of 1,25(OH)D, which would imply that Vit D plays a pivotal role in adipocyte differentiation in vivo. Interestingly, the Vit D binding protein (Calbindin-D 28K ), which functions as a transporter for Vit D metabolites and is required for its endocytosis and metabolism, also affects the binding of globular actin and fatty acid immunomodulation (Tsalamandris et al. 2019) . These evidences suggest the potential role of Vit D in the pathogenesis of obesity.",

Wortsman et al. also demonstrated similar findings (Wortsman et al. 2000) . Parikh et al. found a negative correlation between vitamin D and BMI (P < 0.0001) (Parikh et al. 2004) . Although the exogenous intake of Vit D is not blunted in obese patients, the bioavailability has been shown to become inhibited, thereby resulting in hypovitaminosis D even when the patient is on Vit D supplementation (Parikh et al. 2004) ; this may have current implications on the suggested use of vitamin D as a therapy for COVID-19 if obesity is a potential effect modifier and may warrant the additional need for weight loss in these patients. Zhu et al. reported that elevated serum Vit D is linked to lower adiposity and metabolic health (Zhu et al. 2013) .",

Few observational case controlled studies demonstrated that supplementation of Vit D during pregnancy and early childhood are associated with decreased incidence of type I diabetes (Pittas and Dawson-Hughes 2010) . Hypovitaminosis D has been found to decrease the secretion of insulin as well as its sensitivity in both animals and humans (Palomer et al. 2008 ). There are many factors that explain the involvement of Vit D in the pathogenesis of this metabolic syndrome including: (1) allelic variations in the VDR and Vit DBP may influence glucose tolerance and secretion; (2) Vit D modulates the expression of the insulin receptor and secretion; (3) the presence of Vit D-dependent calcium binding proteins on \u03b2 cells of the pancreas which suggest a nonclassical alternative mechanism of action; (4) alterations of serum Vit D levels result in the decreased secretion of insulin without altering the secretion of glucagon; (5) Vit D increases the levels of intracellular calcium via non-selective voltage gated channels, which may directly affect the levels of calcium dependent endopeptidases, enzymes which are required for the cleavage of pro-insulin to insulin; and (6) the chromosome region that codes for the Vit DBP is located on chromosome 4q11-13 was found to be linked to fasting insulin within the genome of some type II diabetics (Palomer et al. 2008) .",

Individuals who had the highest (> 25 ng/ml) levels of serum 25(OH)D were 43% less likely to develop DM than those who received the lowest dose of Vit D supplements (< 14 ng/ ml) (Mitri et al. 2011) . Furthermore, in a double blinded cohort assessing the effect of serum 25(OH)D levels on endothelial function in diabetic patients, Sugden et al. found that, the use of Vit D supplementation for patients with type II diabetes improved endothelial function significantly by 2.3% (P = 0.048) (Sugden et al. 2008) . They also performed a post-hoc analysis which showed that, insulin sensitivity was improved in individuals who received Vit D supplementation compared to those who did not (P = 0.003) (Sugden et al. 2008) . It should be noted that endothelial function is dramatically affected in patients with COVID-19 due to the fact that the cytokine storm (the main pathogenesis for COVID-19) causes vasculature damage as a result of endothelial leukocyte recruitment, also the high expression of ACE2 on endothelium makes it more susceptible to direct viral damage. This explains why COVID-19 can present with cardiovascular complications (thromboembolism, DIC, etc.) (Evans et al. 2020) .",

Suzuki et al. demonstrated that there is mRNA and protein expression of the VDR in human coronary arterial endothelial cells (HCAEC) (Suzuki et al. 2009 ). They also examined whether or not Vit D inhibits TNF-\u03b1-induced activation of NF-\u04a1B, an essential factor needed for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in HCAEC (Suzuki et al. 2009 ). The results of their study were as follows: (1) Vit D inhibits TNF-\u03b1 and its consequent expression of E-selectin on HCAEC and (2) Vit D significantly inhibits TNF-\u03b1-induced activation of NF-\u04a1B, both of which play a vital role in the pathogenesis of KD vasculitis (Suzuki et al. 2009 ). In a study assessing the relationship between 25(OH)D serum levels in KD children and the occurrence of KD-associated vascular abnormalities, Stagi et al. reported the following; 98.7% of the patients presented with hypovitaminosis D, and those who presented with severe deficiency developed coronary artery abnormalities significantly (P < 0.0001) (Stagi et al. 2016) . Sung Jun et al. also noted that patients with KD who presented with severe hypovitaminosis D (P = 0.023) were resistant to IVIG therapy than those who did not, thus concluding that low 1,25(OH)D levels may be a risk factor for immunoglobulin resistance (Jun et al. 2017 ). Falcini et al. concluded that Vit D may contribute to the course and severity of coronary aneurysms present in the setting of KD (Falcini et al. 2015) .",

Agmon-Levin et al. documented that: (1) there is a significantly higher prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)-hypercoagulable state patients (P < 0.05); (2) an inverse relationship between thrombotic manifestations and Vit D levels in APS patients (P < 0.05); (3) Vit D supplements aid in preventing thrombosis mediated by APS; and (4) there is a 50% increased risk of developing arterial and venous thrombosis during winter (lack of sun exposure) compared to other seasons (Agmon-Levin et al. 2013) . The mechanism by which 1,25(OH)D exerts an anticoagulant effect is by; up regulating the anticoagulant glycoprotein (thrombomodulin), and down regulating the expression of some coagulation and tissue factors (Garc\u00eda-Carrasco et al. 2018) . In a 6538 cohort study investigating the association between Vit D levels and seasonal variations of plasma hemostatic markers (fibrinogen, D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and Von Wille-brand factor), Hypp\u00f6nen et al. reported the following: (1) serum 25(OH)D levels were inversely correlated with tPA antigen as well as D-dimer and fibrinogen but to a lesser extent and (2) all three of these hemostatic factors varied by season which was correlated with the seasonal fluctuations of Vit D (Hypp\u00f6nen et al. 2010 ). In addition, hypovitaminosis D is associated with elevated levels of asymmetric dimethyl-arginine, which is a marker for endothelial dysfunction (Targher et al. 2012 ). Beer et al. noticed a significant reduction of thrombotic adverse events (pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and ischemic cerebrovascular accident) in cancer patients receiving Vit D along with their cancer therapy compared to those receiving placebo (Beer et al. 2006) . Although these data may suggest that Vit D has a non-classical coagulation associated mechanism of action, more clinical studies are needed to better understand the impact that Vit D has on the coagulation process and coagulopathies.",

Individuals with increased skin pigmentation are at high risk of hypovitaminosis D (Kaufman et al. 2017) . Currently people of color are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in terms of poor outcome. Ethno religious variations are another risk factor for vitamin status, for example, Muslim women are at risk of hypovitaminosis D due to adapting modest attire which covers most of their skin, in spite of living in sunny equatorial countries (Ojah and Welch 2012) . Dietary concerns are another problem that should be addressed from perspectives of both personal dietary choices and economic influences on diet. Further observation would show that food options which contain the highest available Vit D can be expensive (Hess et al. 2019) . The cheapest known source of Vit D is fortified milk, and though it has contributed greatly to increasing 1,25(OH) D levels in consumers, it is still not enough. A call has been made for more biofortification of foods with 1,25(OH) D to accommodate dietary diversity (and economic diversity should be considered).

One of the clinical trials (NCT04449718) (Rastogi et al. 2020) found that supplementing 200,000 IU of Vit D did not significantly reduce clinically relevant outcomes or hospital stay, while the other clinical trial (NCT04459247) Murai et al.

Low Vit D has been pinpointed as a risk factor for COVID-19 poor outcomes. Vit D should be considered as a prognostic marker for COVID-19 patients and an elaborate plan should be developed to address the issue of low status which encompasses the various dietary, ethnic, cultural, social, vocational, and health factors that influence Vit D status.",
