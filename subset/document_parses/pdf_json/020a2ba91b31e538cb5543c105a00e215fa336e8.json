Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including school and business closures, have been implemented in an effort to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and to protect those most vulnerable to severe disease (1) . However, these NPIs do not come without associated social and economic losses. In the event of continually reducing case counts, hospitalizations, and mortality associated with COVID-19, decision-makers are posed with the task of identifying strategies to safely relax physical distancing measures. However, it is challenging to assess how and when a safe reopening can be executed, while minimizing public health and economic losses and at the same time ensuring the health care system will not be overwhelmed.",

While efficacious vaccines exist and are being administered, most nations are in the situation where the wide rollout of vaccination among the general population has not been achieved; hence, most individuals remain susceptible to infection and controlling virus transmission (and hence the downstream hospitalizations and deaths) while more transmissible variants are actively circulating still poses a real challenge. In this light, the task of identifying smart reopening strategies provides an opportunity for mathematical modeling to assist and inform the reopening decision-making process through means of evidence synthesis.",

Previously, the optimal timings for Ontario's phased reopening that maximized the relaxation of physical contacts while not exceeding the province's ICU capacity for COVID-19 patients were identified through the integration of a disease transmission model with a stochastic optimization model (5) . Following the premature easing of restrictions, Ontario experienced a resurgence of cases in Fall 2020 (\"the second wave\") that triggered another lockdown which led to declining case counts, hospitalizations and associated mortality. This, along with a vaccine rolling out to at-risk groups and the surgency of a more transmissible variant under the surface of declining total cases, created the pressure to relaunch the reopening process as early as February 14, 2021. With the expectation of vaccines becoming available to a broader range of individuals in April 2021 and the potential start of mass vaccination for the general population, the identification of smart reopening strategies became critically needed at that time to minimize economic and social losses, and finding sub-optimal pathways has been remaining as a challenge when the optimal timing to relaunch the optimal reopening strategies was missed, and when mass vaccination rollout is being accelerated in parallel with the emergence of more transmissible variants.",

More specifically, we identify optimal strategies toward mass vaccination, had the optimal strategy been initiated on February 14, 2021, March 14, 2021, May 16, 2021 and June 14, 2021 that would enable a gradual increase in activity levels in the Ontario population. We examine the projected confirmed cases of COVID-19 and hospitalized cases including those in ICU according to each of the optimal reopening strategies; we then examine the situation when those opportunities were missed and then identify a new optimization opportunity facilitated by the accelerated vaccination rollout to allow for a pathway leading to near pre-pandemic activity level.",

            "text": "The province of Ontario has implemented a variety of control measures with varying intensity in response to the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population, as well as relaxations to partially resume social and economic activities. A series of physical distancing control measures were implemented in March 2020 to mitigate the first wave in the province. These restrictions began to be lifted in the province's staged reopening process from mid-May until October 10, 2020. At this time on October 10, 2020, control measures to mitigate the second wave were implemented in select hotspots in the province. On November 23, 2020, the enhancement of control measures had commenced, and this date marked the second so-called lockdown of Toronto and Peel. The modeling of these distinct phases of varying control measures (of first two waves) in terms of activity levels was conducted in prior transmission modeling works and the key event timelines discussed (2) (3) (4) 6) . The first cases attributed to the B.1.1.7 lineage (Alpha), with demonstrated increased transmissibility, were detected in Ontario on December 26, 2020. Also, in late December 2020, there was a provincewide lockdown and also the schools went on Winter break. On January 12, 2021, a second state of emergency was declared and a stay-at-home order was effective as of January 14, 2021. In mid-February 2021, the majority of public health units in the province had lifted the stay-at-home order, while hotspots such as Toronto remained under these strict measures. These select hotspots had an active stay-at-home order which was effective until their eventual lifting in early March 2021 and then returned to the province's so-called response framework. In mid-March, daily confirmed cases began again to increase potentially due to increased social mixing and the circulation of more transmissible variant strains. In light of the reported case increase and circulating VOCs (namely B.1.1.7/Alpha lineage), a series of measures including a provincewide emergency brake was implemented in early April 2021. Days after followed a third state of emergency declaration and subsequent (second) stay-athome order, in early April 2021. The stricter measures brought the \"third wave\" to a peak in mid-April 2021. Also, on April 23, 2021, the first cases of the B.1.617 lineage (Delta), substantially more transmissible than the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), were detected in the province. Finally, the stay-at-home order was lifted on June 2, 2021; however, restrictions remained in place to control transmission. The level of activities, the average level of contacts made by one individual per day, in these difference phases of the past three waves were estimated using a data fitting procedure FIGURE 1 | The flowchart of the transmission dynamics model, where the population is stratified into susceptible (S), vaccinated (V), exposed (E), asymptomatic infectious (A), symptomatic infectious (I), and recovered status (R), and by quarantine and isolation status (S q and E q , respectively). The compartment of diagnosed but not yet resolved cases is further stratified by the need for the use of hospital wards (D ward ) and/or ICU beds (D ICU ), and mild (D mild ). described in the Supplementary Methods, and these estimated levels of activities, shown in Supplementary Figures 1, 2 , provide important baselines for our model-based optimal reopening strategies.",

We searched for the optimal initiation time of physical distancing relaxation in different stages while keeping the number of COVID-19 patients needing ICU beds as small as possible. We first considered the situation in which the maximum allowable number of ICU beds in the province for COVID-19 patients was 350 and 500, respectively. We aimed to maximize the social contacts until the targeted mass vaccination rollout took effect in reducing the infection and disease burden, set here to be within May 2021. We aimed to find optimal strategies, in terms of the optimal time to switch between contact rates, by taking into account the various scenarios of social-economic activities at each reopening stage. We emphasize that in our study, the contact rates we defined in our transmission models are effective contact rates, similar as the contact rate modeled in (2) . We assumed that the contact rates, at each stage are random variables, so the algorithm will inform the best possible contact rates at each stage and how long one should stay in a particular stage. The appropriate utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE) including face masks/coverings that would reduce effective contact rates is directly reflected in our data fitting for contact rates when the baseline transmission probability is fixed. We will discuss this in more details in the section Discussion as it relates to the optimal pathways identified.",

Therefore, we were forced to consider sub-optimal strategies with the ICU beds increased to 500 and a lower range of activity levels, as shown in Supplementary Table 4 .

In the simulations, the contact rates for the de-escalations phases are shown in Supplementary Table 6 . The contact rates in each de-escalation phase gradually increased until de-escalation phase 3 (the final phase), which has range [9.5, 10] . This final range was chosen, as these contact rates are representative of contact rates (or activity levels) close to the estimated pre-pandemic activity levels (4) . The parameters associated with the diagnosed case compartments were also updated in this set of simulations (Supplementary Table 7 ). In Supplementary Table 7 , the parameters associated with health care resources and model equations (2) are provided for both the resident and the VOC strains.

The reference activity levels were chosen based on those estimated from a modified model based on the model shown in Figure 1 Table 11 ). The duration of this phase is substantially longer than other phases identified in the optimization. This is because the number of ICU patients remains high in late January and early February 2021, as a result of the large number of infected individuals prior to phase 0 combined with the longer average ICU stay of patients. The optimal lengths of de-escalation phase 1 (\u01eb 1 ) are between 14 days and 16 days, the length of de-escalation phase 2 (\u01eb 2 ) varies from approximately 24 days to 27 days, depending on the scenario (Supplementary Table 11) .

            "text": "Despite modeled uncertainties in the contact rates for each of the de-escalation phases, the optimal timings identified in each scenario were similar for time of strategy initiation on February 14, March 14, May 16, and June 14, 2021 (Supplementary Tables 11-14) . In the first set of simulations, the optimal initiation of the first stage was on April 10, 2021 for all eight scenarios (Supplementary Table 11 ). This first phase of de-escalation, lasting approximately 2 weeks until April 24-26, 2021 and the second phase of de-escalation lasting until May 19-22 2021, depending on the scenario (Supplementary Table 11 ). The third and final de-escalation phase was initiated between May 19-22, 2021 and marked activity levels near prepandemic levels (Supplementary Table 11) . Note that in each simulated scenario, phase 0 has always a longer duration since the number of infected individuals prior to this phase were high and the time of ICU stay for ICU patient was relatively long. In these simulations, the ICU is predicted to reach its capacity for COVID-19 patients after May 31, 2021 ( Figure 2B ). Of note, the cases occupying the ward beds and ICU at the end of cost evaluation are composed primarily of VOC-associated cases (Figures 2B,C) . Following the initiation of de-escalation phase 2 at the end of April, the increased contact rate results in the downstream effect of rapidly increased occupancy of ward beds and ICU during the month of May (Figures 2B,C) . The projected rapid increase in ward bed and ICU occupancy at the end of cost-evaluation was also observed in the second set of simulations (initiation time on March 14, 2021), when following the optimal strategies (Figures 3A,C) . This is in contrast to the simulations with initiation time of May 16 2021 and June 14 2021, where the impact of vaccination and reduction of individuals susceptible to infection was observed (Figures 4B-D,  5B-D) and the health care resources and confirmed COVID-19 cases were projected to decline. When the B.1.617 (Delta) was considered to have emerged since June 1 2021, with initiation time of June 14, 2021, the projected ICU occupancy was able to be controlled under 200, when following the optimal strategies ( Figure 6B ). There are several limitations of the analysis presented and areas that can be expanded in future work. The transmission model incorporated key interventions from the public health system, including the proportion of contacts of cases that traced and quarantined before they become infectious, and the rate at which symptomatic individuals are detected and isolated. However, in this work, we have assumed that these levels, as well as all transmission parameters remained at their current estimated levels until the end of cost evaluation in each simulation. In this light, during the period of cost-evaluation, the strain-specific transmission probabilities per contact remained at their respective levels estimated. Enhancing personal protection within the population (e.g., through the appropriate utilization of facial masks/coverings, other PPE and hygienic measures) can reduce the transmission probability per contact. High-efficacy face masks, for example, can reduce this transmissibility substantially (7) . In our model, the parameter for the transmission probability achieved was estimated with a certain level of requirements for facial masks/coverings in public indoor settings in Ontario; however, a higher compliance/broader utilization with respect to masking could result in further reduced transmission probability and lead to a higher level of contact rate permitted. Instead of varying the transmission probability regarding to different level of personal behaviors during pandemics, we used the effective contact rates in our study that already considered the effort of personal behaviors (such as facial masks/covering utilization) in disease transmission. In a similar light, behavioral factors such as increased vaccination may lead to decreased risk perception and lower compliance levels or utilization with respect to PPE and hygienic measures, leading therefore to a higher transmission probability per contact. Meanwhile, relatively high reported case counts could lead to more cautious behavior including higher levels of PPE utilization and improved hygienic measures. These behavioral elements could also be incorporated in the model by considering the transmission probability per contact a dynamic function of vaccinations administered or reported case counts, similar to the established work (8) . In this analysis, we extended the vaccination rate according to the expected rollout and did not explicitly consider hesitancy with respect to vaccination. It may be the case that, for some jurisdictions, additional considerations should be made to account for hesitancy (9) . This could be modeled directly with anticipated uptake data [e.g., informed by surveys such as those reviewed in (9)] in the population or assumptions about the uptake. This may be particularly relevant for simulations over long time horizons. Also, the region of Ontario is composed of 34 public health units (PHUs) with varying infection rates and regional features, which we did not consider in this analysis. We here did not consider heterogeneities in the population such as age structure. We have considered the ICU capacity for COVID-19 patients not being exceeded as the sole constraint and the objective function being minimized represented contact loss. There may be additional factors to consider as constraints and within the objective function; however, in this analysis, we considered these two primary factors. In the model, for the vaccinated population we considered the \"effectively vaccinated population\" in the sense that effectively vaccinated individuals have 100% protection against infection. The daily vaccination rate therefore should be considered as the \"effective daily vaccination rate\": the product of vaccine doses administered times the vaccine efficacy against infection. This consideration can be replaced by more explicitly incorporating \"leaky\" or \"all-or-nothing\" vaccines, for example, in future studies (10) . Also, in reality, there are several different vaccine products approved for use (and being administered) in Ontario and therefore there are variations in vaccine efficacy according to product. Similarly, for select vaccination regimen, individuals receive a first dose followed by a second dose at a later date. These two elements can be explicitly incorporated in future studies. Finally, in light of limited data regarding the duration of protection granted by vaccination, we have assumed no waning effect of the protection granted.",

The stochastic optimization framework can accept an agestructured analog of the transmission model used in this analysis, which features age-and setting (household, workplace, community and school)-specific contact mixing (4). Thus, optimal pathways with additional considerations for agespecific activity levels could be identified. In a similar light, age-structured transmission models are equipped to weigh different vaccination strategies; for instance, according to their capacity to interrupt transmission and reduce mortality (11) . The stochastic optimization technology demonstrated within can be applied also to weigh these vaccination rollout strategies (e.g., including age prioritizations) according to the program's priority needs. Prior work has made the case for the strong coupling of social and epidemiological dynamics (11) . As an example, the perception of risk may be linked to the population's collective adherence to NPIs (11) . Hence the consideration for social factors by incorporating social dynamics (coupled with epidemiological dynamics) may provide additional insights with respect to reopening strategies. The modeling and quantification of abstract behavioral factors such as the population's level of caution and sense of safety may also be considered (8) . We here have identified reopening strategies according to activity levels based on the anticipated rollout to the population. In addition to the identification of reopening strategies, we note that an effective implementation requires additional considerations given the critical role of the population's collective behavior on the disease trajectory. In this light, understanding how to effectively reach, communicate with and build trust with the public is key. Overall, the incorporation of social dynamics may uncover additional insights to equip decision-makers with, in order to inform suitable actions from the public health system to mitigate social and economic burden.",

We note the generality of this method; the transmission model can be parameterized according to different regions and the contact levels for reopening phases may also be altered based on regional constraints. In this sense, we have developed and illustrated a methodology with the intention that it can be utilized to identify reopening measures in different regions. We further have demonstrated the practical usage of this framework through this retrospective analysis, which allowed for the identification of the updated optimal pathways according to evolving circumstances.",

The diagram for the compartmental disease transmission model and health care resource model is shown in Figure 1. We obtained the baseline range of activity levels during different stages of reopening by fitting the model to the time series of the reported cases in Ontario from February 26, 2020 until April 11, 2021 and Supplementary Figure 1 shows the estimated average social contact rate c per day during this time period.",
