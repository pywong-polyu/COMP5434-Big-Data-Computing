Coinfection of tuberculosis (TB) and viral hepatitis may increase the risk of antituberculosis treatment-induced hepatotoxicity, which is regarded as a common cause of termination of the first-line antituberculosis drugs. e study aimed at investigating the protective effects of antiviral therapy on the liver and innate immunity in patients with TB-HBV coinfection. Methods. A total of 100 patients with TB-HBV coinfection were recruited and split into antituberculosis and antiviral groups, 50 per group, according to odd or even date of hospital admission from December 2019 to October 2020. e patients in the anti-TB group received antituberculosis therapy, and those in the antiviral group received antiviral therapy. e clinical effectiveness; HBV-DNA negative conversion rate; liver function assessment involving alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL); immune function evaluation including CD4 + , CD8 + , CD4 + /CD8 + , and CD3 + T cells; inflammatory cytokines containing tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-c (IFN-c); and intestinal microflora including bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, enterobacterium, enterococcus, and clostridium were main outcome measures after treatment. Results. It was found that the total response rate in the antiviral group was significantly higher than the anti-TB group after treatment (\u03c7 2 \ufffd 3.157, P \ufffd 0.017). ere was a significant difference in HBV-DNA negative conversion rates between the antiviral group and anti-TB group (82% vs. 58%, \u03c7 2 \ufffd 6.384, P \ufffd 0.001). e ALT, AST, and TBIL in the two groups were all increased after treatment (P < 0.05), but the antiviral group indicated a rise of the above indices compared to the anti-TB group (P < 0.05). e two groups showed a rise on the concentration of CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD4 + /CD8 + T cells and a decline on the CD8 + T cells after treatment (P < 0.05), but these changes in the antiviral group were more evident to those in the anti-TB group (P < 0.05). ere was an increase on the IFN-c level and decrease on the TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in both groups after treatment (P < 0.05), but the antiviral group revealed a higher level of IFN-c with lower levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 compared to the anti-TB group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was increased, and the number of enterobacteria, enterococci, and clostridium were decreased in the two groups (P < 0.05), while these changes in the antiviral group were more remarkable compared to the anti-TB group (P < 0.05). ere was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (\u03c72 \ufffd 0.267, P \ufffd 0.731). Conclusion. Antiviral therapy for tuberculosis-HBV coinfected patients could inhibit HBV replication, providing protection against liver damage, improving innate immunity, and balancing intestinal microflora.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) are common diseases all over the world, which cause huge burden on global health care [1, 2] . e disease TB is mainly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that most often affect the lungs. e other bacteria such as Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium parvum, and Mycobacterium canetti are responsible for TB as well [3] . e World Health Organization (WHO) reported that a quarter of the world's population runs the risk of being potentially infected with tuberculosis every year [4] , and TB, as one of the top 10 causes of death, was associated with 1.37 million deaths estimated by the WHO in 2015, which was comparable with that of chronic HBV and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) [5] . Nowadays, the WHO recommends antituberculosis therapy (2HRZE/4HR) for patients with tuberculosis. In brief, the patients take in isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol daily for 2 months during the intensive phase and were treated continually with isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months. e 2HRZE/4HR therapy is relevant with low costs and excellent response, but leads to liver injury [6] . e chronic HBV represents a partial double-stranded hepatophilic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus, which leads to the persistent and chronic infection in human body [7] . e natural process of chronic HBV infection includes immune tolerance, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive immunologic activity, inactivity, and HBeAg-negative immunologic activity [8] . During the natural process, treatment, or after treatment, the viral biomarkers were closely related to the diagnosis of chronic HBV infection [9] . e main HBV biomarkers consist of serology and molecular methods. e serology involves the detection and quantification of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and the molecular methods were applied to detect the quantification of HBV-DNA [10] . e chronic HBV infection has been contributed to the major threat of global public health and economy burden [11] . e first effective vaccine against HBV was available in 1981 but with limited use in the infants who was born in low-income and middle-income countries due to its high cost [12, 13] . Although the HBV vaccination programme has been widely applied since 2001, it was estimated that 257 million people worldwide were infected with the HBV in 2015 reported by the WHO. e virus hepatitis mostly involving chronic HBV and HCV leaded to 1.34 million deaths, and the cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were responsible for the major causes of deaths [5] . e current treatments of pegylated interferon-alfa (PEG-IFN-\u03b1) and antiviral nucleoside analogues were widely used for HBV-infected patients, but PEG-IFN-\u03b1 therapy was turned out to have modest efficacy and poor tolerability [14] .",

In this analysis, compared to the patients only received antituberculosis therapy, it was found that the antiviral therapy on patients with TB coinfection was successful in symptom relief and cure rate. In addition, the antiviral therapy inhibited the HBV replication, ending up with much higher negative conversion rate of HBV-DNA. e data indicated the entecavir therapy was related to the excellent clinical efficacy for patients with antituberculosis therapy. e findings were similar to another study which revealed that the patients with TB and HBV coinfection only treated with anti-tuberculosis therapy tend to drug-induced liver injury, liver damage, and bad clinical response [24] . Furthermore, this study observed that antiviral therapy reduced drug withdrawal incidence and adverse reactions including headache, fever, and gastrointestinal reaction. e liver injury or dysfunction is associated with the detection of a set of serum biomarkers including ALT, AST, ALP, and TBIL [25] . According to the data in this study, the anti-TB group and the antiviral group both demonstrated a significant rise on the ALT, AST, and TBIL after treatment, but the patients in the antiviral group were with much lower level of ALT, AST, and TBIL compared to the patients with antituberculosis therapy only, which revealed that the antiviral therapy with entecavir has significant influence on alleviating the liver injury. ese findings were closer to a study about oral obeticholic acid for mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute liver injury, and it suggested that the high level of ALT, AST, and TBIL induced by lipopolysaccharide was significantly decreased after obeticholic acid administration [26] . e other research indicated that the severe patients with COVID-19 were with higher growth on the ALT and AST level, but there was a slight difference on TBIL between the severe patients and the mild patients [27] .",

IFN-c is considered as the crucial cytokine in antitumor immunity due to its cell inhibition, promotion of apoptosis, and antiproliferative functions [34] . Based on the data we analyzed, the higher level of IFN-c and lower value of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were observed in the two groups after treatment, but compared to the anti-TB group, the antiviral group showed a higher increase on the IFN-c, and a significant decline on the TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. e antiviral therapy contributed to the relief of inflammatory response in patients with TB and HBV coinfection.",
