In a time of limited resources, a policy of PACU extubation could have a substantial impact on the financial viability of children's hospitals. INTRODUCTION: Trauma center benchmarking has become standard practice for assessing quality of care. Verification standards require participation in a risk-adjusted benchmarking program, but do not specify a requirement for pediatric-specific benchmarking in centers that treat adults and children. Centers that are high performers for adult patients might similarly be high performers for children, but this has not been established. This study evaluated whether there is consistency in performance across both adult and pediatric populations cared for within the same trauma center.",
