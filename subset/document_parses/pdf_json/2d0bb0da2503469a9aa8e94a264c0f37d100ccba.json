The charge transfer properties are presented in terms of localisation lengths, crudely speaking the length over which electrons travel. Various types of disorder, including random potentials, are employed to account for different real environments. We have performed calculations on poly(dG)-poly(dC), telomeric-DNA, random-ATGC DNA and \u03bb-DNA. We find that random and \u03bb-DNA have localisation lengths allowing for electron motion among a few dozen base pairs only. A novel enhancement of localisation lengths is observed at particular energies for an increasing binary backbone disorder. We comment on the possible biological relevance of sequence dependent charge transfer in DNA.",

The suggestion that electron transfer/transport in DNA might be biologically important has triggered a series of experimental and theoretical investigations [5, 17, 20, 31, 35, 54] . Processes that possibly use electron transfer include the function of DNA damage response enzymes, transcription factors or polymerase co-factors all of which play important roles in the cell [2] . Indeed there is direct evidence [9] that MutY -a DNA base excision repair enzyme with an [4Fe4S] + cluster of undetermined function -takes part in some kind of electron transfer as part of the DNA repair process [36, 46] . This seems consistent with studies in which an electric current is passed through DNA revealing that damaged regions have significantly different electronic behaviour than healthy ones [9] .",

Photo-induced charge transfer rates can then be measured whilst the donor/acceptor molecules, the distance and the sequence of DNA that lies between them are varied. The reactions are observed to depend on the type of DNA used, the intercalation, the integrity of the intervening base pair stack and, albeit weakly, on the molecular distance [5, 9, 17, 35, 52] .",

The remarkable diversity that characterises the results seems to arise from the fact that many factors need to be experimentally controlled. These include methods for DNA alignment and drying, the nature of the devices used to measure the conductivity, the type of metallic contacts and the sequence and length of the DNA. DNA has been reported to be an insulator [10] , an ohmic conductor [3, 21, 32, 34, 45 ] and a semiconductor [43] . Theoretically, single-step super exchange [31] and multi-step hopping [8] models have provided interpretations of solution experiments. For experiments in dry DNA, several additional approaches such as variable range hopping [57] , one-dimensional quantum mechanical tight-binding models [13, 47, 48, 55, 58, 59] and non-linear methods [12, 39] have also been proposed.",

The reduction of the DNA base-pair architecture into a single site per pair, as in the fishbone model (1), is obviously a highly simplified approach. As an improvement on this we model each base as a distinct site where the base pair is then weakly coupled by the hydrogen bonds. The resulting 2-channel model is shown in Fig. 3 .

However, in the present situation we are interested in finding \u03be also for viral DNA strands of typically only a few ten thousand base-pair long sequences. Thus in order to restore the required precision, we have modified the conventional TMM and now perform the TMM on a system of fixed length L 0 . This modification has been previously used [22, 33, 49] and may be summarised as follows: After the usual forward calculation with a global transfer matrix T L0 , we add a backward calculation with transfer matrix T b L0 . This forward-backward-multiplication procedure is repeated K times. The effective total number of TMM multiplications is L = 2KL 0 and the global transfer-matrix is \u03c4 L = T b L0 T L0 K .

Within these energy bands, the electronic states are extended with infinite localisation length \u03be as expected. Outside the bands, transport is exponentially damped due to an absence of states and the \u03be values are very close the zero. In Fig. 4 the resulting inverse localisation lengths are shown. These are zero for the extended states in the two bands, but finite outside, showing the quick decrease of the localisation lengths outside the bands. In Fig. 5 , we show the same data but now plot the localisation length itself. We see that the energy gap observed previously [13] for the poly(dG)-poly(dC) sequence in the fishbone model remains. The difference with respect to the ladder model is a slight renormalisation of the gap width. The localisation lengths of poly(dG)-poly(dC) DNA tend to infinity, meaning that the sequence is perfectly conducting. This is expected due to its periodic electronic structure.",

But due to its structure of just 6 repeating base pairs, there is a further split of each band into 3 separate sub-bands. They may be calculated like in section II D. We would like to point out that it may therefore be advantageous to use the naturally occurring telomeric parts of DNA sequences as prime, in-vivo candidates when looking for good conductivity in a DNA strand. The structure of the energy dependence for the random-ATGC and the \u03bb-DNA is very different from the preceding two sequences, but it is quite similar between just these two. The biological content of the DNA sequences is -within the description by our quantum models -just a sequence of binary hopping elements between like and unlike base pairs. Thus the models are related to the physics of random hopping models [7, 19] and in agreement with these, we see a Dyson peak [18] in the centre of each sub-band. Furthermore, we see that the range of energies for which we observe non-zero localisation lengths is increased into the gap and for large absolute values of the energy. This is similar to the broadening of the single energy band for the Anderson model of localisation [50] . The localisation lengths, which roughly equal the average distance an electron would be able to travel (conduct), are close to the distance of 20 bases within the band, with a maximum of \u223c 30 bases at the centre of each band. Note that this result is surprisingly good -given the level of abstraction used in the present models -when compared to the typical distances over which electron transfer processes have been shown to be relevant [9, 17, 25, 31, 35, 52, 54] .",

DNA randomly bent or at finite temperatures As argued before, environmental influences on the transport properties of DNA are likely to influence predominantly the electronic structure of the backbone. Within our models, this can be captured by adding a suitable randomness onto the backbone onsite potentials \u03b5 q i . In this fashion, we can model for example the influence of a finite-temperature [11] and thus a coupling to phonons [24] . We emphasise however, that in order for our localisation results -which rely on quantum mechanical interference effects -to remain valid, the phase breaking lengths should stay much larger than the sequence lengths. Thus the permissible temperature range is a few K only. The bending of DNA is another possibility which can be modelled by a local, perhaps regular, change in \u03b5 q i along the strand. Another important aspect is the change in \u03b5 q i due to the presence of a solution in which DNA is normally immersed.",

Let us first choose uniform disorder with \u03b5 q i \u2208 [\u2212W/2, W/2]. In Fig. 6 we show the results for all 4 DNA sequences as a function of energy for W = 1. Comparing this to Fig. 5 , we see that now all localisation lengths are finite; poly(dG)-poly(dC) and telomeric DNA having localisation lengths of a few hundreds and a few tens of bases, respectively. The localisation lengths for random-ATGC and \u03bb-DNA are only slightly reduced. In all cases, the structure of 2 energy bands remains. Furthermore, W = 1 already represents a sizable broadening of about 1/2 the width of each band. Thus although the localisation lengths are finite compared to the results of section V, they are still larger than the lengths of the DNA strands used in the nano-electric experiments, implying finite conductances. We remark that the Dyson peaks have vanished as expected [19] . We plot the DOS for \u03bb-DNA in Fig. 6 which clearly indicates the 2 bands. Upon further increasing the disorder to W = 2, as shown in Fig. 7 , the localisation lengths continue to decrease. Note that we observe a slight broadening of the bands and states begin to shift into the gap. We also see that the behaviour of random-ATGC and \u03bb-DNA is quite similar and at these disorder strengths, even telomeric DNA follows the same trends. At W = 5, the localisation lengths have been reduced to a few base-pair separation distances and the differences between all 4 sequences are very small. The gap has been nearly completely filled as shown by the DOS, albeit with states which have a very small localisation length. This will become important later. Thus, in summary, we have seen that adding uniform disorder onto the backbone leads to a reduction of the localisation lengths and consequently a reduction of the electron conductance. Strictly speaking, all 4 strands are insulators. However, their localisation lengths can remain quite large, larger than in many of the experiments. Thus even the localised electron can contribute towards a finite conductivity for these short sequences. In agreement with experiments, poly(dG)-poly(dC) DNA is the most prominent candidate.",

            "text": "The results of the previous section suggest that increasing the disorder in different regions of the energy will lead to different transport behaviour. Of particular interest is the region at E = 0. In Fig. 12 the variation of \u03be as a function of binary disorder strength for all different sequences is shown. While \u03be < 1 for small disorder, we see that upon increasing the disorder, states begin to appear and their localisation lengths increase for all DNA sequences. Thus we indeed observe a counter-intuitive delocalisation by disorder at E = 0. As before, poly(dG)poly(dC) and telomeric disorder show the largest localisation lengths, whereas random-ATGC and \u03bb-DNA give rise to a smaller and nearly identical effect. In Fig. 13 we show that this effect does not exist at E = 3, i.e. for energies corresponding to the formerly largest localisation lengths. Rather, at E = 3, the localisation lengths for all DNA sequences quickly drop to \u03be \u223c 1. The delocalisation effect is also observed for uniform disorder, but is much smaller. As shown in Fig. 14 , the enhancement is up to about \u03be = 1 for the fishbone model (1) . Results for the ladder model (2) are about 1.7 times larger. This surprising delocalisation-by-disorder behaviour can be understood by considering the effects of disorder at the backbone for the effective Hamiltonians (3) and (4) . At E = 0, the onsite potential correction term (t q i ) 2 /(\u03b5 q i \u2212 E) will decrease upon increasing the \u03b5 q i values. For binary disorders \u03b5 q i = \u00b1W/2, this holds for |\u03b5 q i | > |E| as shown in Fig. 13 . However, for large |E|, the localisation lengths decrease quickly due to the much smaller density of states. Thus the net effect is an eventual decrease (or an only very small increase) of \u03be for large E. Note the dip at |\u03b5 q i | = E = 3 in the figure, which corresponds to the effective \u03b5 i = \u221e, i.e. an infinitely strong trap yielding extremely strong localisation. For uniform disorder \u03b5 q i \u2208 [\u2212W/2, W/2] -and generally any disor-der with compact support around E = 0 -the above inequality is never full-filled and even for E = 0 we will find small \u03b5 q i \u223c 0 such that we have strong trapping and localisation.",

Differences in the localisation properties should then indicate the importance of the exact order. From the biological information available on bacteriophage \u03bb-DNA, we compute the localisation length for the coding regions [14] and then for window lengths K that correspond exactly to the length of each coding region. Again, if the electronic properties -as measured by the localisation length -are linked to biological content, we would expect to see characteristic differences.",

From Fig. 15 , we see from P (\u03be) that the localisation lengths for \u03bb-DNA are mostly distributed around 15-20, but P (\u03be) has a rather long tail for large \u03be. However, there are some windows where the localisation lengths exceed even the size of the window K = 100. Thus at specific positions in the DNA sequence, the system appears essentially extended with \u03be > K. On the other hand, the distribution P (\u03be) is identical when instead of \u03bb-DNA, we consider scrambled DNA. Therefore the presence of such regions is not unique to \u03bb-DNA. The results from windows positioned at the coding part of \u03bb-DNA appear statistically similar to the complete sequence, i.e. including also the non-coding regions. This suggests that with respect to the localisation properties there is no obvious difference between \u03bb-DNA and scrambled \u03bb-DNA as well as coding and non-coding regions. We emphasise that similar results have been obtained for a DNA sequence constructed from the SARS corona-viral data. In Fig. 15 , we repeat these calculations but with K = 1000. Clearly, P (\u03be) is peaked again around 15-20 and this time has no tail. In all cases, K > \u03be. Again, the results for scrambled DNA are different in each window, and now even P (\u03be) is somewhat shifted with respect to \u03bb-DNA.",

This is most pronounced for binary disorder, taken to model the adhesion of cations in solution. Thus within the 2 models studied, we find that their transport properties are in a very crucial way determined by the environment.
