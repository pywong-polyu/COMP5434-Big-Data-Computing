At the time of this writing COVID 19 infections have impacted 191 counties, and the death toll stands at 1,488,513 [2] . COVID-19 infection is known to cause coagulopathy and an inflammatory state [3] , but there are few case reports involving COVID-19 related spontaneous bleeding outside of disseminated intravascular coagulation [3] . To date there has only been a single case report of pituitary apoplexy in the setting of COVID-19; this was in a pregnant woman, which is a known risk factor for apoplexy [4, 5] . Here, we present a case of pituitary apoplexy in the setting of COVID-19 infection with no such risk factors. (See Figs. 1-3.)",

The patient developed upper respiratory tract infection symptoms four days prior to arrival, including fevers, dysgeusia, anosmia, increased sputum production. Vitals were as follows: blood pressure 142/89, heart rate 117, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 95%, and temperature of 101.4\u00b0F. Physical exam revealed a well-developed, diaphoretic male with a normal visual and neurologic examination. CT of the head was obtained and revealed a small hyper-dense blood collection within the Sella measuring 7 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 8 mm, not exhibiting mass effect on the optic chiasm, and without evidence of other subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient was covered empirically with antibiotics for central infection and community acquired pneumonia, given the lobular consolidation noted on chest x-ray. He was confirmed positive for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal PCR swab. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated normal cell line counts with elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) and liver function tests (ALT 293, AST 141, LDH 318). Neurosurgery was consulted and the patient was admitted to the ICU. On Hospital Day 1 patient received another head CT which revealed slight worsening of the bleed; MRI later confirmed hemorrhagic pituitary microadenoma consistent with pituitary apoplexy. Additionally, during hospitalization the patient developed pancytopenia, which has been previously exhibited in COVID-19 infection [3] . Hormone testing was unrevealing, the remainder of his hospitalization was unremarkable, and the patient was discharged with endocrinology follow up in place.",

Currently, there is controversy surrounding the optimal course for these patients. Pituitary function should be assessed with hormone assays for future management [6, 10] . Once the diagnosis is confirmed, coagulopathy and electrolyte imbalances should be addressed; any evidence of altered level of consciousness or changes to visual field or acuity should prompt immediate surgical evaluation [6, 10] .",
