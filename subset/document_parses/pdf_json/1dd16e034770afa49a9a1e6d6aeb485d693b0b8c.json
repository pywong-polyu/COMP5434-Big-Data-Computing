Therefore, the level of perceived threat from COVID-19 could be related to the use of different cognitive emotion regulation strategies. It is also known that 2 of 10 those affected by COVID-19 could feel anxiety and distress from the disease symptoms themselves, as well as fear of consequences, and those in quarantine may also be bored, lonely, and angry [17] .",

The fact that unknown problems are still emerging related to COVID-19 and its cause has produced uncertainty, and psychologically uncertain situations are usually accompanied by anxiety due to agitation from anticipation of threat and stress. Therefore, it must be managed to lower psychological distress and ensure adjustment [11, 19, 20] . Therefore, we may think that there are different profiles according to different characteristics within the COVID-19 context such as level of perceived threat and whether or not someone close is COVID-19 positive.",

            "text": "In addition, negative coping strategies, such as self-blame, rumination, catastrophism, and blaming others are closely related to alterations in health [16, 21] . Meanwhile positive coping strategies are not [16] or are even related negatively to the presence of symptoms such as psychological distress, anxiety, stress, or sleeping problems [22, 23] . In this sense, and according to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory by Lazarus and Folkman [24] , stress is a two-way process. It involves the production of environmental stress factors and the response of the person subjected to those factors. In this theory, coping is defined as the efforts a person makes to anticipate, challenge, or change conditions to alter a situation that is appraised as stressful. Thus, coping strategies are cognitive, behavioral efforts that a person must make to be able to manage external (environmental, stressors) or internal (emotional state) demands that exceed the person's resources [24, 25] . In a stressful situation, people develop different ways of coping, which are related to personal factors, situational demands, and available resources, with the goal of reestablishing balance in the organism faced with reactions triggered by the stress factor [26, 27] . It is worth mentioning that the type of coping strategy used in a concrete situation varies according to personality or experience, as well as the characteristics of the situation [28] [29] [30] [31] . Hospital nurses tend to develop problem-focusing strategies, which protect them from stress [28] . Other authors have shown that the acquisition of skills is among the main adaptive coping strategies in the nursing work environment: training in relaxation for adequate use of emotions, biofeedback, meditation, physical training, or modifying cognitive processes [32, 33] .",

Thus, in stressful situations in clinical nursing practice which can and should be resolved immediately, such as solving an acute problem in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit), problem-focused or active coping strategies should be used. While in those situations where resolution is more uncertain that do not depend so much on nursing intervention, strategies focusing on emotion, or passive, would be considered adaptive. In this regard, the best coping strategies in critical settings (ICU) are associated with greater satisfaction and less secondary stress syndrome, while avoidance strategies predict secondary traumatic syndrome [35] .",

This can lead to deterioration of the person's health, which is manifested as cardiovascular alterations [36] or worsening of pre-existing pathologies, such as diabetes [37] as well as sleeping problems [17] . There are even signs of the pernicious effect of stress in some biological parameters of health professionals [38] . Nurses who have worked in COVID-19 units show higher levels of stress, exhaustion, and depressive mood as well as lower job satisfaction than their colleagues in the usual hospital units due especially to job tension and uncertainty about the future [39] [40] [41] . In addition, perceived threat can itself cause a diversity of psychological maladjustments [16] . Therefore, due to the various complicated situations nurses are faced in the context of COVID-19, the impact on their quality of life and health can be strong, and it is important to determine the best strategies for coping with stress in this discipline to avoid negative consequences. On this basis, we proposed to analyze the relationships between the use of coping strategies and health by nurses in the context of COVID-19 with attention to related factors such as perceived threat and/or whether or not someone close to them is COVID-19 positive.",

            "text": "After analyzing the relationships between nurses' coping strategies and health based on related factors, threat perceived from COVID-19 showed significant associations with the use of different cognitive emotion regulation coping strategies. Previous studies have shown that negative coping strategies, such as self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing, and other-blame lead to health problems in nurses [16] . In our study, catastrophizing was shown to be the strategy most closely related to all the health subscales, while self-blame, rumination and other-blame showed a positive correlation with somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, and depression. Rumination was found to be more related to someone close being COVID-19 positive, and considering that Thanoi and Klainin-Yobas [50] suggested that this was one of the determining factors in the mental health of nursing students, it would be of interest to assess this strategy in undergraduates to intervene appropriately and prevent secondary effects of rumination in registered nurses. In addition, \"positive\" coping strategies, such as acceptance, positive refocusing, planning, positive reappraisal, and putting into perspective were health protection factors [16, 22] . COVID-19 has had a strong impact on the mental health of nurses, and supporting intervention, for example, providing them with coping strategies, would reduce the appearance of psychological disorders [51, 52] . Any such intervention should consider age, since it is a negative element in acceptance, rumination, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, and putting into perspective strategies. On the contrary, we cannot affirm the existence of gender differences, simply a higher tendential difference in women in positive refocusing. Although in this case, the small number of men in the sample, which however, is also a faithful reflection of the characteristics of the nursing profession, should be kept in mind.",

This study also showed how COVID-19 contexts, characterized by high perceived threat, are associated with the more frequent use of \"negative\" coping strategies, such as rumination, catastrophizing, or other-blame, and with more somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, and depression. This information could be oriented toward the prevention of occupational risks which in future similar scenarios would help nurses develop positive coping strategies preventing health problems [27] [28] [29] and thus improving their physical and mental well-being. It would be of interest for future studies to explore our hypotheses to see whether they are confirmed in other sociogeographic settings and in other health professionals such as doctors, physiotherapists, etc. Future studies could also analyze the characteristics of work done by nurses at this time. As the questionnaire evaluated individual strategies, specifically, nine cognitive strategies for coping with negative situations, no strategies were included that were related to the workplace or social context in which they work.",
