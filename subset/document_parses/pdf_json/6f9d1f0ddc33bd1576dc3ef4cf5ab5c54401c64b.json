However, we believe it is telling that even with variable culturing methods, isolation of replication-competent virus after 10 days appears to be the exception rather than the rule. We further note that CDC's recommendation of 10 days of isolation is directed at immunocompetent patients with mild-moderate illness; CDC recommends up to 20 days for patients with severe or critical illness, or those who are severely immunocompromised, based on evidence of prolonged infectious shedding in those populations. [2, 3] It is also important to emphasize that CDC's criteria for discontinuation of isolation is also contingent on resolution of fever and improvement in symptoms. In some cases this can take more than 10 or even 20 days. [4] Furthermore, while it is clear that some individuals can have replicationcompetent virus cultured after 10 days, the human infectious dose is unknown and current data provide little insight into the degree of infectivity for those outliers.",

[5] In a Taiwanese prospective cohort of 100 individuals with COVID-19, all A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 3 secondary transmissions occurred with exposures within 5 days of symptom onset, and none when exposures occurred after 5 days. [6] It is therefore reasonable to assume that even in the rare cases where SARS-CoV-2 can be cultured beyond 10 days, the risk of transmission is likely low at that point, particularly if the individual is no longer symptomatic and coughing. Any residual risk of transmission is likely to be further be reduced if usual mitigation measures are followed. Indeed, CDC recommends that all people, including those who have had COVID-19, take steps to prevent the spread of infection, including hand hygiene, physical distancing, and wearing masks. [2] Ultimately, as CDC acknowledges, it is extremely difficult to establish recommendations that ensure that 100% of persons who are shedding replicationcompetent virus remain isolated. The risk of propagating transmission must be weighed against the potential detriments of highly conservative protocols. Prolonged isolation in healthcare settings, for example, contributes to delays in procedures and medical care, consumes personal protective equipment, imposes limitations on visitors, and can impede hospital discharge. Prolonged isolation outside of healthcare settings may have important psychosocial effects and impacts on the workforce. We look forward to additional studies that use standardized methods for culturing replicationcompetent virus and ideally pair this with epidemiologic data to inform better recommendations on the duration of isolation for individuals with SARS-COV-2 infection.",
