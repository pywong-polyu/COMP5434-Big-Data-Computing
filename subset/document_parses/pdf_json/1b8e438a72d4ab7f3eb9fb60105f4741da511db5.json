We sought to determine the efficacy of PP among patients whose ARDS was caused by PC. Methods. A retrospective observational study was performed at an intensive care unit (ICU) from January 2017 to June 2021. ARDS patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) < 150 mmHg were enrolled. During the study period, we enrolled 121 patients in the PP group and 117 in the control group. e changes in vital signs, laboratory tests, and compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) were recorded for 3 consecutive days. e mechanical ventilation time, duration of ICU stay, complications, extubation rate, 28day ventilator-free days, and mortality were also recorded. Results. In the PP group, the P/F and Crs increased over time. Compared to the control group, the P/F and Crs improved in the PP group over 3 consecutive days (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the PP group also had shorter total mechanical ventilation time (5.1 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 9.3 \u00b1 3.1 days, P < 0.05) and invasive ventilation time (4.9 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 8.7 \u00b1 2.7 days, P < 0.05), shorter ICU stay (7.4 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 11.5 \u00b1 3.6days, P < 0.05), higher extubation rate (95.6% vs. 84.4%, P < 0.05), less atelectasis (15 vs. 74, P < 0.05) and pneumothorax (17 vs. 24, P > 0.05), more 28-day ventilator-free days (21.6 \u00b1 5.2 vs. 16.2 \u00b1 7.2 days, P < 0.05), and lower mortality (4.4% vs. 13.3%, P < 0.05). Conclusions. Among PC cases with moderate to severe ARDS, PP can correct hypoxemia more quickly, improve Crs, reduce atelectasis, increase the extubation rate, shorten mechanical ventilation time and length of ICU stay, and reduce mortality.",

            "text": "A pulmonary contusion (PC) is a parenchymal injury to the lung caused by an external force (e.g., trauma) either directly or indirectly acting on the chest [1] . It is often accompanied by clinical manifestations, including chest pain, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis. Often, in the most critically ill patients, the amount of pulmonary contusion may evolve into a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), i.e., severe hypoxemia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and a decrease in pulmonary compliance. In the context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the safe and effective management of PC patients has become more challenging [2] , and the early elimination of COVID-19 can significantly improve the treatment of PC [3] . In recent years, the technical ability to establish a diagnosis of PC early and to predict disease aggravation has been significantly improved [4, 5] , and a variety of clinical studies on the treatment of PC have been proven to be effective [6, 7] , significantly reducing the clinical mortality of PC.",

First, bromhexine hydrochloride was injected (4 mg three times a day, intravenous drip) as an expectorant. en, tanreqing was injected (40 mL once a day, intravenous drip) to clear away heat and resolve phlegm. Next, select antibiotics were administered to fight infection according to the results of pathogenic microorganism culture and the antibacterial spectrum. Fourth, sufentanil citrate was injected (0.2 \u03bcg/ [kg\u2022h], intravenous pumping) as anesthesia. Fifth, midazolam was injected (0.3 \u03bcg/[kg\u2022h], intravenous pumping) as a sedative. Sixth, the patient was fed with full-tube nutrition support. Next, we determined the appropriate mechanical ventilation strategy with low tidal volume lung protective ventilation (LTV), and the positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO 2 ) values (lower PEEP/higher FiO 2 ) according to the ARDSnet protocol [16] [17] [18] . Finally, lung recruitment was conducted with pressure-controlled ventilation using a recruiting maneuver [19] . Other treatments such as using vibration to release sputum, bronchoscopy, maintenance of internal environment stability, prophylactic noninvasive ventilation immediately after extubation, and intensive care were performed when necessary. e ventilator was adjusted according to the arterial blood gas results until the patient was evacuated from the ventilator. In controls, the arterial blood gas was collected in the supine position, and in the PP group, it was collected in the supine position after the end of PP. Before measuring the compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) in both groups, we confirmed adequate sedation and restrained the patients from breathing spontaneously. When analgesia and tranquilizers did not effectively inhibit spontaneous respiration or were limited by negative hemodynamic effects, short-acting neuromuscular blockers were used, if necessary, as standard measurement indicators. In the PP group, when the P/F was lower than 150 mmHg, PP was used to treat patients with severe hypoxemia until the P/F > 200 mmHg could be sustained and then the PP treatment was stopped; the PP time was 12-16 h/day [16] . During PP, patients with chest and abdomen trauma were bound and fixed with medical chest straps, and the area surrounding the trauma was raised using a water bag such that the traumatic site could be elevated. Changes in arterial blood gas and Crs were observed for 3 consecutive days after enrollment in the two groups. ree days after enrollment, a chest CT was performed to assess atelectasis [13] . e statistics for the total mechanical ventilation time (including invasive ventilation time and noninvasive ventilation time), invasive ventilation time, noninvasive ventilation time, ICU stay, atelectasis, pneumothorax, extubation rate, and mortality of the two groups were collected.",

In our clinical study, we found that PP can safely be used in patients with ARDS caused by PC, as it improves hypoxemia and Crs and has a positive effect on the outcome of treatment. Most PC patients show chest and abdomen trauma, which increases the difficulty of PP implementation and the risk of complications, limiting the clinical implementation of PP. erefore, there has been no clinical research on PP treatment of patients with PC after ARDS. We used elastic chest straps to address the wounds of our patients to prevent secondary injuries caused by wound dehiscence during PP. At the same time, the surrounding area of the wound was raised using water bags to elevate the injured part and avoid sores caused by prolonged pressure. Our results showed that the trauma sites were not aggravated and did not acquire pressure sores during PP in the PP group, confirming that this procedure can be safely used in the clinical treatment of PC patients with ARDS.",

At the same time, the postural drainage of PP has a certain airway clearance effect and partly reduces the risk of disease deterioration. erefore, the patients in the PP group had shorter mechanical ventilation time, a higher extubation rate, and fewer patients with prophylactic noninvasive ventilation after extubation than those without PP treatment.
