Using different monthly time-series as proxies for the financial and macroeconomic cycles, we first specify the determinants and then build two indicators to measure the financial and real business cycles based on principal component analysis. We identify not only the main different cycles for each indicator but also measure the duration of the phases for each indicator. Second, we study the relationship between economic and financial indicators per cycle and per phase using a vector autoregressive model. Our findings show that the economic indicator is useful to forecast the financial, and that there exists a significant relationship between the financial and economic cycles that is actively stronger during the \"expansion-growth\" phase. This result enables investors and policymakers to better forecast the future dynamics of financial sector using the information provided by the analysis of the real business cycle.",

Indeed, Eug\u00e8ne Fama, who is considered the father of modern financial theory, refers to his theory of market efficiency by suggesting the impossibility to forecast asset prices in the short-term. However, Robert Shiller, who shares the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics with Eug\u00e8ne Fama, shows it is possible to predict asset prices in the long run. Accordingly, forecasting the dynamics of the financial sector has always been a challenge. 1 That is, in line with Shiller, significant attention has been paid to the analysis of the business cycle, as well as the financial environment. This is particularly relevant as the recent global financial crisis, induced by the US subprime crisis of 2007, has led to an economic downturn for most developing, developed, and emerging countries during [2008] [2009] . The interaction between the US real sector 2 and the financial sector has also shown further evidence of significant connectedness in the context of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.",

            "text": "In the literature, numerous studies have investigated the impact of the financial sector on the business cycle (Cover & Mallick, 2012; Rafiq & Mallick, 2008 ; because the financial sector has always been considered as an important factor of production and a key economic growth driver. For example, Aikman et al. (2010) and Schularick and Taylor (2012) investigated the effect of credit on the real economy and Hatzius et al. (2010) and Benetrix and Lane (2011) measured the effect of the financial sector on the real business cycle. More recently, Drehmann et al. (2012) and Borio (2014) found further evidence of a significant relationship between the financial cycle and the macroeconomy, while Niemira and Klein (1994) developed channels to document the usefulness of financial (respectively economic) information to forecast the dynamics of the economic (respectively financial) cycle and to explain its fluctuations. Claessens et al. (2012) explained how financial and economic cycles interact, and showed strong linkages between these two cycles for 44 countries over January 1960-April 2010. In particular, they found that recessions relating to financial issues such as equity prices raids are longer and deeper than other recessions. Nevertheless, the recovery after asset price busts is weaker, whereas recoveries related to rapid growth in credit are stronger. Accordingly, the authors confirmed the effect of financial market development on the real economy. Moreover, Drehmann et al. (2012) empirically characterized the financial cycle while analyzing turning points and using frequency-based filters. They identified the financial cycle using the medium-term approach, and found that financial cycle peaks are close to financial crises, and the length of the financial cycle has augmented since 1985. Accordingly, they concluded that financial cycles are longer than economic business cycles. Further, the recessions of the business cycle are more profound when associated with the contraction phase of the financial cycle. Recently, Sch\u00fcler et al. (2015) applied a multivariate spectral approach to characterize financial cycles, and identified common cycle frequencies across a set of indicators. Focusing on 13 European Union countries over 1970-2013, they showed that credit and asset prices share cyclical similarities. They also proved that the financial cycles appear long in upswing phases, with an important dispersion across countries. Interestingly, the concordance between financial and economic cycles appears only 2/3 of the time, 1 See Barnett and Serletis (2000) for a concise survey.",

These changes have affected the cost and level of production and thus, company behavior, as companies balance investment to deal with this new economic conjuncture. Accordingly, the unemployment rate and poverty have increased, resulting in a negative shock to consumer behavior and an increase in the saving rate per measure of precaution. On the other hand, most central banks (e.g., Fed, ECB, Bank of England) have switched to new central banking rules dominated by unconventional monetary policy (e.g., quantitative easing, qualitative easing, lender of last resort, purchase of public debt, important increase of the size of the balance sheet of central banks). This switch from conventional to unconventional monetary policy is due to the zero lower band effect, which occurs when the short-term nominal interest rate is near zero. At this interest rate level, there exists a liquidity trap and the central bank is less able to stimulate economic growth. These new central banking rules also implied massive injections of liquidity into the market and are expected to impact the financial sector as well. As such, all things being equal, these factors have directly or indirectly affected financial resource allocations and thus financial cycle fluctuations. This yielded a priori close time-varying correlations between the economic and financial cycles, giving credit to Minsky's theories of cycles and the movement of the financial system from stability to fragility followed by crisis regarding the evolution of macro-economic indicators and credit conditions. 3 To fill this research gap, our study proposes to check whether economic indicators can help forecast the dynamics of the financial sector. Particularly, we propose to investigate the relationship between the financial and business economic cycles as a whole and also across different phases of these cycles. To this end, we estimate the financial turning points through an analysis of turning times and fluctuations of the economic cycle. In other words, we identify the drivers of the volatility of the economic cycles and test how far they impact the fluctuations of the financial cycle.",

Second, we apply the BBQ approach proposed by Bry and Boschan (1971) to identify the cyclical peaks and troughs for both the economic and financial indexes. Third, we identify for each index the number of cycles and distinguish the different phases of each cycle. Finally, we investigate the connectedness between the financial and economic cycles while estimating their bilateral dependency per phase.

In particular, our previous analysis investigated the relationship between the financial and economic cycle indexes. However, based on our finding of the phases and turning points identification of financial and economic indexes, the relationship might be lead-lag. This intuition is motivated by previous studies. To check this hypothesis, we specify a bivariate VAR model, which allows analyzing the dynamics of each index based on its lags and the lags of the other market. Further, we might employ a Granger causality test based on this VAR model including the appropriate lags and estimate the impulse response function for each market to the shock of the other market. The general form a VAR(p) is as follows:",

The results of the Granger causality tests are presented in Table 4 and those of the VAR model in Table 5 . Table 4 points to significant evidence of bilateral causality between the economic and financial indexes at the 5% level, suggesting the usefulness of previous information for both indexes to improve the forecasting of their future dynamics.",
