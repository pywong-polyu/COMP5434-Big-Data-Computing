            "text": "Purpose Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test is the gold standard for diagnosing central precocious puberty (CPP). However, intravenous GnRH is not always readily available. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of triptorelin-stimulated luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations in the diagnosis of CPP among girls presenting with premature thelarche compared to the gold standard GnRH test. Methods A prospective, case-control (CPP vs isolated premature thelarche), clinical study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of triptorelin-stimulated LH concentrations in 60 girls with premature thelarche was performed. All girls underwent stimulation with subcutaneous triptorelin injection and intravenous GnRH in a randomized order. During the stimulation test with triptorelin, LH and FSH were measured at time 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after the injection. Estradiol was sampled 24 h after the injection. During the GnRH test, LH and FSH were measured at time 0, 30, 45, and 60 min. Girls with peak GnRH-stimulated LH concentrations \u22655.0 IU/L were classified as having CPP. Area under the curve (AUC) for triptorelin-stimulated LH concentrations was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results Triptorelin-stimulated LH concentrations were significantly higher in girls who had CPP according to the GnRH test (53.3%). LH peaked at 180 min after the triptorelin injection. The highest diagnostic accuracy for CPP (AUC = 0.973, sensitivity 96.9%, specificity 89.3%) at 180 min was at a LH concentration \u22653.4 IU/L. The 24 h estradiol concentration did not improve the predictive model. Conclusions Measuring LH concentrations 180 min after triptorelin injection with a cut-off value of \u22653.4 IU/L demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy compared to the GnRH test. Thus, stimulation with triptorelin can be used as a reliable alternative for diagnosing CPP in girls with premature thelarche.",

Ultrasensitive chemiluminescence assays are used in many centers to analyze LH, and a peak GnRH-stimulated LH concentration \u22655.0 IU/L is commonly used to define HPG activation in girls with premature thelarche [3, 14, 15] . However, intravenous GnRH preparation is not always readily available, in contrast to GnRH analogs such as triptorelin [11, 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] . Stimulation of the HPG axis with GnRH analogs has been proposed as an alternative to the gold standard GnRH test [3, 11, 12, 20] . Triptorelin has a longer half-life and stronger affinity for the GnRH receptor. Thus it may provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the HPG axis and at the same time be less invasive for patients compared to the intravenous GnRH test [12, 21] .",

The differences in the means of variables between groups were tested using the parametric t-test or Mann-Whitney U test accordingly. Categorical variables were tested using Pearson's chi-square test and chi-square test for trend. Pearson correlation was used to assess correlation between variables. Binary logistic regression was performed in order to assess the relationship between dependent variable (CPP vs IPT) and independent variables (LH and estradiol concentrations after stimulation with triptorelin). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the area under the curve (AUC) in order to evaluate the discriminative abilities of triptorelin-stimulated LH and estradiol concentrations at different sampling times. ROC analysis was performed for LH concentrations at all specific sampling times (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min) and for estradiol concentrations at 24 h after stimulation with triptorelin. ROC analysis was also performed for all peak LH concentrations irrespective of sampling times after stimulation with triptorelin. AUC was calculated from ROC analysis for all these variables in order to identify a classifier with the highest discriminative power (CPP vs IPT). After identifying sampling time with the highest AUC, optimal cut-off value of triptorelin-stimulated LH concentrations for discriminating CPP and IPT was established by determining the highest diagnostic performance based on best sensitivity and specificity ratio on the ROC curve. Diagnostic accuracy was the percentage of true findings (sum of girls with CPP and triptorelin-stimulated LH concentrations above the cut-off point and girls with IPT and LH concentrations below the cut-off, divided by the number of total girls). All probability values less than 0.05 were considered significant.",

This suggests that triptorelinstimulated LH concentrations can be used as a reliable alternative for evaluation of the HPG axis when intravenous GnRH is unavailable. Premature onset of breast development in girls younger than 8 years is increasingly common and frequently associated with childhood obesity [1] [2] [3] . To confirm (or exclude) CPP as the cause of premature thelarche, it is necessary to evaluate the pubertal activation of the HPG axis [3] . Although consistent with precocious puberty, clinical parameters such as accelerated height velocity, significant bone age advancement, uterine and ovarian enlargements should not be considered reliable in distinguishing IPT from CPP [3, 6, 7, 17] . Accelerated height velocity and advanced bone age is also seen in girls who are overweight and particularly with concomitant adrenarche [27, 28] . In addition, bone age advancement and uterine/ovarian enlargements can be absent in some girls with premature thelarche due to CPP, resulting in missed or delayed diagnosis. Our study confirm this overlap of clinical characteristics between girls with CPP and IPT (Table 1) , emphasizing the need for a laboratory examination of the HPG axis.",

            "text": "The LH concentration is the most reliable diagnostic parameter, with random basal serum LH concentrations in the pubertal range confirming CPP. However, mildly elevated LH concentrations can be detected in prepubertal children, and recent findings indicate that pre-injection LH may even remain at pubertal concentrations during GnRH therapy in spite of lack of pubertal progression [3, 29, 30] . More importantly, basal LH concentrations below the pubertal range do not exclude CPP, emphasizing the need for evaluation of stimulated LH concentrations [3, 9, 29, 31, 32] . Thus, the GnRH stimulation test continues to be the gold standard for discriminating IPT vs CPP Fig. 1 in girls with premature thelarche [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Due to frequent unavailability of intravenous GnRH in many countries, stimulation testing with a widely available GnRH analog such as triptorelin, shown to induce comparable peaks of LH secretion, has been proposed as an alternative test for diagnosing CPP [3, 11, 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . In the present study, the potency of triptorelin to stimulate LH secretion has been confirmed by a significant strong correlation of peak LH responses after triptorelin injection compared to peak GnRH-stimulated LH concentrations (Fig. 2) .",

In the first study, Poomthavorn et al. measured LH concentrations at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after subcutaneous triptorelin injection in girls with CPP. The highest concentrations of LH were detected 60 min after injection of triptorelin. A sensitivity of 89.1% and a specificity of 91.3% was obtained for diagnosing CPP, equivalent to a triptorelin-stimulated peak LH cut-off concentration of \u22656 IU/L. However, this study was retrospective and due to unavailability of intravenous GnRH, the diagnosis of CPP was based on clinical criteria rather than on GnRH testing [11] . The second study, by Freire et al. [12] , was a robustly designed prospective study of 46 girls with premature thelarche, using the GnRH test as reference standard. By combining 3 h LH and 24 h estradiol cut-off concentrations after stimulation with triptorelin, Freire et al. obtained a high diagnostic accuracy of 96% (sensitivity 94%, specificity 100%). The protocol used different sampling times (before the triptorelin injection, after 3 and 24 h), and LH was not measured at 60 min, which has previously been associated with peak LH concentrations [11, 12] . In addition, the GnRH gold standard test was performed without measuring LH at 45 min, which has been shown to have the highest sensitivity in diagnosing CPP [12, 33, 34] . The protocol also required cumbersome blood sampling (estradiol) at 24 h after the triptorelin injection, resulting in significantly increased length of hospital stay and healthcare costs. Despite these variations, both studies clearly demonstrated the potency of triptorelin to cause an immediate rise in LH concentrations allowing clinicians to use it when evaluating girls for CPP.",

Since sampling of 24 h estradiol did not improve the predictive model, according to this model inconveniently long hospital stays are unnecessary, benefitting patients and healthcare costs. Thus, we propose a one-blood-sample protocol for the assessment of triptorelin-stimulated LH response, by sampling 180 min after the administration of subcutaneous triptorelin injection. This strategy provides high diagnostic accuracy, short hospital stays, and is less invasive compared to the GnRH gold standard model and previously proposed test protocols using triptorelin.",

Thus, it can be used as a reliable alternative to the gold standard GnRH test when evaluating girls with premature thelarche for CPP.",
