Subsequently, patients in the placebo group demonstrated similar improvements in quality of life and happiness after they received treatment. 3 This result, in it of itself, is not novel, as multiple studies have shown increased patient satisfaction after Botox injections in the upper third of the face. For example, Chang et al, in a cohort of 57 female patients, found satisfaction increased by 28%, also assessed by the FACE-Q. 4 Similarly, in a different study, patients treated with onabotulinumtoxinA reported significantly higher satisfaction than patients treated with placebo, regardless of patient age. 5 The unique aspect of the current study is the use of a sample novelty of patients who receive regular neurotoxin injections but may \"have exceeded their normal treatment interval\" as a result of shutdowns during the pandemic. However, the only criterion for inclusion in the study prior neurotoxin treatment at least 20 weeks before enrollment. While this may have captured the aforementioned target population, could this could also include patients with remote history of neurotoxin treatment, for whom the pandemic had no effect? Thus, the interpretation of the results in light of practice changes related to the pandemic must be interpreted cautiously.",

While this intuitively makes sense, the study design does not We began exploring how the COVID-19 pandemic, and specifically mask usage, affected perceptions of beauty in the first 6 months of the pandemic. 6 We found that, in general, most faces were rated as more attractive when a mask was worn. More specifically, faces which were judged to be less attractive at baseline demonstrated the greatest improvements in perceived attractiveness, while attractive faces were rated no differently when wearing a mask. The study raised many important questions about how mask usage disrupted normal assessments of facial beauty. The periorbital region has often been tabbed to be what defines beauty, but our results suggested harmony between facial aspects was the most important. 6, 7 If disharmonious aspects of the face were covered by the mask, like the perioral region or the jaw, perceived attractiveness of masked faces would increase, also suggesting increased importance of the visible upper third of the face. Taken together, this could suggest patients receiving neurotoxin treatment for forehead wrinkles, as in this study, would experience greater improvements in perceived attractiveness while wearing a mask than would patients whose full face was visible.",

As the authors mention in their discussion, the upper face is crucial to expressing \"anger, sadness and fear\" whereas the perioral region is critical for expressing happiness. 8 With seemingly reduced ability to express these negative emotions, were patients in the study perceived to be more positive on the whole? Additionally, were there any drawbacks of this, including miscommunication of negative emotions, with visual clues from the bottom half the face being obscured by a mask and reduced expression from the upper third of the face? Both issues should be part of the informed decision-making process between patients and aesthetic providers.",

Do patients who received neurotoxins injections in the upper third of the face demonstrate increased satisfaction levels compared to prior studies where patients underwent treatment before masks became commonplace? In a similar vein, do patients who receive facial injections in the lower half of the face demonstrate more modest gains in satisfaction and happiness now that the lower face is not visible under masks? It would be interesting for future studies to address these key questions.",
