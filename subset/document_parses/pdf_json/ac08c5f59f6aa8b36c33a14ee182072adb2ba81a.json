Much has been learned about the origins and subsequent evolution of the antigen-specific receptors used by this crucial arm of the immune response. Among recent discoveries are the early appearance of three lymphocyte lineages in vertebrates with antigen-specific receptors based on leucine-rich repeats in jawless fish but on immunoglobulin (Ig) domains in jawed vertebrates (1) , and the proto-RAG transposon which created split genes that could recombine to generate diversity in the three antigen-specific receptors of jawed vertebrates (2) . In contrast, there has been little agreement on the origin and subsequent evolution of cell surface molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which play central roles in adaptive immunity as the targets of T cell recognition. By discovering the W genes as a proposed intermediate in the evolution of MHC class I and class II genes, the paper by Okamura et al. (3) in PNAS provides a welcome advance.",

With well over 10,000 alleles among humans, the classical MHC molecules form the most polymorphic system currently known. Having been discovered as transplantation antigens, their true function is resistance to infectious pathogens and cancers. The high polymorphism is primarily due to a molecular arms race with pathogens, highlighting their importance in resistance to infectious disease. In addition, nonclassical class I molecules have evolved to carry out a wide variety of specialized functions. For example, natural killer (NK) cells of the innate immune system recognize certain classical and nonclassical class I molecules for both immune and nonimmune functions, the latter including placental blood supply for pregnancy (4, 5) .",

Class II molecules are heterodimers of \u03b1and \u03b2-glycoproteins (encoded by A and B genes), each with a membrane-distal domain and membrane-proximal Ig-constant (Ig-C) domain, a transmembrane (TM) region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. In contrast, class I molecules are composed of one small Ig-C protein, \u03b2 2 -microglobulin (\u03b2 2 m), in noncovalent association with a large \u03b1 (or heavy) glycoprotein chain with two membrane-distal domains followed by a membrane-proximal Ig-C domain, a TM region, and a cytoplasmic tail (4, (7) (8) (9) . For both class I and class II molecules, the two membrane-distal domains together form a pair of broken \u03b1-helices atop a platform of \u03b2-strands (sometimes called an open-face sandwich or MHC fold) (8, 9) . The groove between the \u03b1-helices and the \u03b2-sheet is where most of the polymorphic positions are found, in which each classical MHC allele binds a different set of peptides (4) . The \u03b1\u03b2 TCRs of T cells and the killer-Ig receptors of human NK cells recognize the peptide and \u03b1-helices of the MHC molecules (4, 8, 9) . Although originally envisaged as symmetrical molecules (10), in fact, the Ig-C domain of the class II \u03b1-chain and the equivalent \u03b2 2 m are wedged under the \u03b2-sheet of the membrane-distal domains (8, 9) , perhaps to allow the grooves to breathe as they test many peptides for those with appropriate binding. A detailed analysis by coauthor Dijkstra and coworkers (12, 13) identified key attributes of class I and class II molecules, including interdomain contacts, hydrophobic core residues, and sequence indels. Among many examples are three involving tryptophan (single letter code W): one in \u03b2 2 m to interact with the membrane-distal \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains of the class I heavy chain, the replacement of one in \u03b2 2 m that is otherwise nearly invariant among Ig domains, and one in the membrane-proximal \u03b22 domain of class II molecules to interact with the membrane-distal \u03b21 domain (Fig. 1) .",

Once the genes were characterized, a simple evolutionary scenario was evident (10, 11) . Since most class II molecules are encoded by A-B gene pairs in opposite transcriptional orientation, an inversion would lead to a class I \u03b1-chain gene and a gene encoding an Ig-C domain with a TM region and a cytoplasmic tail, which could give rise to \u03b2 2 m by a single mutation. This scenario is supported by the location of the \u03b2 2 m gene in the MHC of sharks (14) , being cartilaginous fish which are the most primitive living jawed vertebrates, although the \u03b2 2 m genes in other jawed vertebrates are located outside of the MHC. An alternative proposal was that class I molecules are ancestral, with the exons encoding peptide-binding domains of a chaperone gene being transferred in front of an exon encoding an Ig-C domain to form the class I \u03b1-chain. This tempting scenario was based on proposed sequence similarities between class I molecules and chaperones (15, 16) , which became implausible once the completely different structures of the two were determined (11) .",

They show that the WA and WB genes are found in pairs and are expressed as \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers, each chain of which has two extracellular domains followed by a TM region and a cytoplasmic tail, just like class II molecules (Fig. 1 ). In addition, some amino acid positions are in common with class II molecules, including the distinctive pattern of glycines that allows the two TM regions to pack together. However, many key residues are like class I molecules (Fig. 1) , including those involved in the interfaces of the extracellular domains such as the tryptophan for which the new group is named, and in the intradomain packing such as the replacement of the nearly invariant tryptophan in common with \u03b2 2 m. This loss of tryptophan in \u03b2 2 m and the W \u03b12 domain shows that they are both derived from a class II-like ancestor. In addition, phylogenetic analysis groups the W \u03b12 domain with \u03b2 2 m, and groups the W \u03b22 domain with the class I \u03b13 domain, showing that the special aspects of class I domain interaction were present in a class II-like heterodimer before the emergence of the class I domain organization.",

Thus far (3), there is no evidence in existing W molecules for the key residues that coordinate peptide binding in either classical class I or class II MHC molecules, or evidence for high levels of polymorphism. However, there is sequence variation between W genes within species, suggesting various W molecules with different functions. The fact that nonclassical MHC molecules include many class I but few class II molecules may be due to structural reasons (11) . The W molecules might provide a test of whether the particular mode of domain interaction contributes to the greater evolvability of class I compared to class II molecules.",

A radical thought would be to link the function of the original W genes with another enigma, the original function of T cells with TCRs composed of \u03b3and \u03b4-chains. In mammals, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are found largely (but not exclusively) in mucosal tissues, recognizing a wide variety of ligands, including certain nonclassical class I molecules, class II molecules, and butyrophilins (4, 19, 20) . Is it possible that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells acquired an enhanced taste for these various ligands once their original ligands, the W molecules, were accidentally lost in most tetrapod lineages? The tissue distribution of W gene expression might be a first step to examine this conjecture.",

The ancestral molecule has nearly invariant tryptophans between the \u03b2-sheets of both membrane-proximal Ig-C domains (W in gray), which are maintained in the class II molecule but are replaced by other hydrophobic residues in the W \u03b12 domain and \u03b2 2 m. Among the other changes are tryptophans involved in interdomain interaction (W in black): one in the \u03b22 domain of class II molecules and ones in the W \u03b12 domain and \u03b2 2 m.",
