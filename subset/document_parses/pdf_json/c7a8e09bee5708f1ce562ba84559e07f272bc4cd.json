To the best of our knowledge, no appropriate surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified or confirmed for chlorine and antimicrobial surface disinfection. We completed a study to evaluate the efficacy of two hypothesized antimicrobial surfaces, and four chlorine solutions on nonporous and porous surfaces, against SARS-CoV-2 and three potential SARS-CoV-2 surrogates [coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2], to identify a BSL-1 or BSL-2 virus to use in future studies. We found SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced >4 log 10 on porous and nonporous surfaces within 30 s upon exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. The results indicate coronavirus MHV-GFP is inactivated faster than SARS-CoV-2 (MHV-GFP \u2265 6.08 log 10 ; SARS-CoV-2 = 0.66 log 10 at 30 s with 0.05% NaOCl on steel) and MS2 is inactivated more slowly. Phi6 is inactivated like SARS-CoV-2, and we propose Phi6 as a slightly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 chlorine disinfection. Additionally, disinfection of bacteriophages on wood was challenging, and exposure to antimicrobial surfaces had no disinfection efficacy as tested. We recommend using 0.5% chlorine on surfaces for a minimum of 30 s of contact to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 and recommend additional research on Phi6 disinfection with varied surfaces and conditions.",

Surrogates can be used as a model for highly infectious pathogens, as largevolume testing can be conducted with a surrogate and confirmed with small-volume infectious pathogen testing. 8 To the best of our knowledge, no appropriate surrogate has been identified or confirmed for chlorine surface disinfection with SARS-CoV-2.",

A primary goal for the research was to identify a BSL-1 or BSL-2 surrogate, for use in future studies. We selected murine hepatitis virus (MHV), Phi6, and MS2 for the study. MHV is a member of the Coronaviridae family 9 and shares characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1 ). As a BSL-2 virus, MHV has been used as a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate for disinfection 7 and was found to be resistant to disinfection by 0.06% NaOCl on stainless steel. 10 We utilized MHV expressing green fluorescent protein (MHV-GFP). Recombinant coronaviruses expressing reporter proteins, such as GFP, are widely used for antiviral activity assays. Because the virally encoded reporter protein is not incorporated into the viral particles, it does not alter the structure of the virions or their physicochemical properties. 11, 12 Therefore, it is assumed that MHV-GFP has the same susceptibility to disinfection as wild-type MHV. We selected two BSL-1 bacteriophages, Phi6 13 and MS2. 14 Phi6 is enveloped like SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1 ), has been used as a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate for disinfection, 7, 15 and is an appropriate surrogate for H5N1 avian influenza virus and Ebola virus for chlorine disinfection. 16, 17 While MS2 is nonenveloped, it is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus like SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1 ) and has been used as a surrogate of enteric viruses, 18 and the efficacy of free chlorine disinfection on surfaces has been well-documented. 17\u221219 Preparation of Materials. Surface Carriers. Five surfaces (steel, plastic, wood, copper, and Supertowel) were tested in total. Three surfaces, representing a range of materials found in low-resource contexts, were chosen for chlorine disinfection, including nonporous (stainless steel and polypropylene plastic) and porous (wood) materials. 20 Copper was chosen as an antimicrobial surface because of its use in brass taps, a hightouch surface during water collection in some low-resource contexts, and previous literature documenting its antimicrobial properties. 21 Supertowel (Real Relief Way, Kolding, Denmark), a reusable microfiber handwashing towel with a permanently bonded antimicrobial layer, was chosen as it is intended for use where handwashing materials (e.g., soap and water) are scarce, and previous research on antimicrobial towels has recovered viable bacteria from the surface after use. 22 Surface carriers were prepared from a virgin stock of each material (see the Supporting Information); 1 cm diameter disks were used for stainless steel, plastic, wood, and copper, and 0.88 cm 2 squares (the same surface area as disks) were used for Supertowel. Carriers were appropriately sterilized before use.",

In particular, the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and MHV bind to different cellular receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 30 and mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a), 31 and the receptor binding domains are located in different regions of the spike proteins, 32,33 which might affect inactivation mechanisms.

On the basis of our results, we conservatively recommend the use of 0.5% NaOCl with a minimum of 30 s of contact to disinfect nonporous and porous surfaces to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in healthcare facilities and high-touch contexts. Future research is needed to understand the impact of soil load, the presence of additional organisms, the chlorine application mode, and the impact of surface type on chlorine disinfection efficacy. We discourage the use of coronavirus MHV-GFP as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 in chlorine disinfection studies and propose the bacteriophage Phi6 as a model organism. Future work is needed to investigate the chlorine disinfection mechanism of MHV-GFP and SARS-CoV-2 to understand why this promising surrogate is not appropriate. We recommend investigating the impact of humidity and temperature on disinfection efficacy as these parameters can impact Phi6 survivability 47 and whether Phi6 is an appropriate surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 for other disinfectants (where mechanisms might vary), such as ultraviolet light, simulated sunlight, ethanol, and hydrogen peroxide. 48 Lastly, we recommend testing the disinfection mechanism of antimicrobial surfaces in practical use.",

Further research is necessary to understand the efficacy of Supertowel virus removal in handwashing practice, including after friction and handrubbing with the towel. Limitations. The following limitations were documented. (1) Testing was completed by two different researchers; variations between laboratory technique may have influenced results in unknown ways.",
