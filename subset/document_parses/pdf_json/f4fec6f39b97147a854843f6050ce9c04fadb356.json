Little is known about protective antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in tears after infection or vaccination. We analysed the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA responses in human tears after either COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Methods. We measured the antibody responses in 16 subjects with COVID-19 infection for an average of 7 months before, and 15 subjects before and 2 weeks post-Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNtech) vaccination. Plasma, saliva and basal tears were collected. Eleven pre-pandemic individuals were included as healthy controls. Results. IgG antibodies to spike and nucleoprotein were detected in tears, saliva and plasma from subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison with uninfected controls. While receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies were detected in plasma, minimal RBD-specific antibodies were detected in tears and saliva. By contrast, high levels of IgG antibodies to spike and RBD, but not nucleoprotein, were induced in tears, saliva and plasma of subjects receiving 2 doses of the Comirnaty vaccine. Increased levels of IgA1 and IgA2 antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were detected in plasma following infection or vaccination but were unchanged in tears and saliva. Comirnaty vaccination induced high neutralising Abs in the plasma, but limited neutralising antibodies were detected in saliva or tears. Conclusion. Both infection and vaccination induce SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in tears. RBD-specific IgG antibodies in tears were induced by vaccination but were not present 7 months post-infection. This suggests the neutralising antibodies may be low in the tears late following infection.",

While we detected a sharp increase in neutralising activity in plasma after vaccination, neutralising activity was only marginally increased in saliva, and no differences were observed in tears after vaccination (Figure 3ai-vi) . Furthermore, to verify our observations, we also performed a cell-based neutralisation assay 14 using Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of paired plasma and saliva samples (n = 6). Tear samples were unable to be assessed using this cell-based assay because of insufficient sample volumes. We found that vaccinated plasma but not saliva samples effectively neutralised SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3bi and ii). To investigate whether the enzymes in saliva were interfering with neutralising antibodies, we spiked baseline saliva samples with recombinant neutralising monoclonal antibodies and found that the monoclonal antibodies in spiked saliva samples still potently neutralise SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary figure 2) .",

Re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 is being increasingly reported, and we speculate that low mucosal antibodies may leave subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection vulnerable to re-infection through these sites, particularly through eye surfaces. Importantly, this report demonstrated vaccination induced high levels of tear and saliva IgG antibodies, including RBD. This suggests that vaccination, at least early after the course is completed, induces key antibodies at the ocular surface that may help protect from the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2. While we were unable to detect neutralising protection in post-vaccinated tear and only limited neutralising antibodies in saliva samples, it is feasible that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG present could still induce non-neutralising protection, warranting future investigation. The relative levels and durability of tear antibodies induced by differing COVID-19 vaccines also remain to be determined. This may be an important factor governing the waning of vaccine-induced immunity and the need for future booster vaccinations.",

We have previously reported IgA responses wane rapidly in plasma post-infection. 11 Similarly, strong plasma IgA responses were induced after a single vaccine dose of phase clinical trials I of a protein-MF59adjuvanted spike glycoprotein clamp but rapidly waned despite a second dose. 15 However, we do acknowledge that our study is limited by lack of access to tear and saliva samples collected during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Further study of secretory IgA, more specific to mucosal IgA, is also warranted. In general, we also noted that background IgA1 and IgA2 responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were high in the tears and saliva of uninfected and unvaccinated subjects. It is possible that prior exposure to other human coronaviruses may induce high levels of cross-reactive IgA antibodies at baseline, and studies of antibodies to other coronaviruses are warranted.
