While surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment for isolated recurrences, locoregional melanoma can often present as bulky, unresectable disease and can pose a significant therapeutic challenge. This chapter focuses on the natural history of local and regionally recurrent metastases and the multiple treatment modalities which exist for advanced locoregional melanoma, including regional perfusion procedures such as hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion and isolated limb infusion, intralesional therapies, and neo-adjuvant systemic therapy strategies for borderline resectable regional disease. Hyperthermic limb perfusion (HILP) and isolated limb infusion (ILI) are generally well-tolerated and have shown overall response rates between 44% and 90%. Intralesional therapies also Introduction The incidence of cutaneous melanoma continues to steadily increase and accounts for the majority of skin cancer-associated deaths (Siegel et al. 2017) . Over 80% of melanoma patients present with clinically localized disease and can be managed with resection of the primary tumor with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy (Balch et al. 2009 ). However, up to 10% of patients will develop recurrent locoregional disease (Borgstein et al. 1999) . For isolated and resectable local and regional recurrences, complete excision of disease is the mainstay of therapy. However, patients often present with advanced, bulky, and unresectable disease either locally at the primary tumor site, in the regional nodal basin(s), or within the dermal lymphatic channels between the primary site and regional lymph nodes, and can pose a significant therapeutic challenge, as shown in Image 1 (Pawlik et al. 2005) .

Long-term results of the Intergroup Melanoma Trial designed to evaluate 2 cm versus 4 cm surgical margins demonstrated a higher risk for local recurrence in patients with thicker primary melanomas (Karakousis et al. 1996; Balch et al. 2001) . The risk of melanoma local recurrence increased with tumor thickness, despite the wider margins employed as tumor thickness increased (Table 1) . The presence of ulceration in the primary melanoma is also an important risk factor for local recurrence, as evidenced by results of the Intergroup Melanoma Trial, as the presence or absence of ulceration had the greatest impact on risk for local recurrence (Balch et al. 2001 ). In the randomized group of patients with lesions on the trunk and proximal extremity, there was a sixfold increase in local recurrence rates (at any time) in patients with ulcerated primary melanomas, with local recurrence rates of 6.6% in patients with ulcerated primary melanomas compared with 1.1% in patients with nonulcerated primary lesions. In the nonrandomized group with lesions involving the distal extremity and head and neck sites, the local recurrence rate was 16.2% (at any time) in patients with ulcerated lesions compared to 2.1% in patients with Image 1 In-transit melanoma of the upper extremity nonulcerated lesions (p < 0.001) (Balch et al. 2001) . Resection margin size has not been shown to correlate with local recurrence as several prospective multi-institutional and large retrospective studies have shown that narrow margins for resection of thin melanomas result in similar rates of local recurrence.

However, superficial femoral lymphadenectomy is performed at time of isolated limb perfusion only when clinical evidence of nodal metastases is present given that the incision used for this lymphadenectomy has high likelihood of infection or dehiscence, especially in a chemotherapy-treated field. Moreover, perfusion from an iliac approach does effectively treat nodes in the femoral triangle (Koops et al. 1998 ). The vessels are circumferentially isolated and small collateral vessels distal to the cannulation sites are tied off. A Steinmann pin is placed into the anterior superior iliac spine to serve as a cleat and prevent slippage of the tourniquet around the root of the extremity. Once the dissection is complete, 350 U/kg heparin is administered to achieve an ACT of over 450 sec.

The vein and artery are cannulated through transversely oriented incisions in the vessels, and each held in place with a Rummel tourniquet placed around the distal vessel and cannula, taking care to avoid fracturing any atherosclerotic plaque that is present. The tourniquet around the root of the limb is tightened maximally. After confirmation of a therapeutic ACT (typically >450 s), the cannulas are connected to the extracorporeal circuit and the roller pump is gradually brought up to the maximum flow rate at which the reservoir volume does not diminish.

Studies utilizing a neoadjuvant approach with targeted therapy have also shown promise. A prospective trial randomized patients in a 2:1 fashion to neoadjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibition for 12 weeks followed by surgery and up to 44 weeks of postop treatment, for a total of 52 weeks.

Responses to treatment occur within 6-12 weeks and no trial to date has reported the loss of control of a regional nodal basin by administering neoadjuvant therapy. Therefore, neoadjuvant therapy remains a safe option for patients with borderline resectable disease. The response rate to 12 weeks of targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibition, 85%, with a CR rate of over 50% at surgery, is the highest noted to date, and better tolerated. The early reports of combination Ipilimumab and nivolimab are also encouraging, with responses from 80% after 6 weeks of treatment, and a CR rate at surgery of 38%. However, combination immunotherapy data is not as mature, and treatment is associated with more toxicity and this risk must be weighed on an individual basis. It will be interesting to see if the high response rates seen in early combination trials persist in larger cohorts. Also, future studies will look at whether surgery can be delayed in responding patients to the point of maximal response. In general, for a patient with borderline resectable disease and a BRAF mutation, neoadjuvant therapy has the highest tolerability and chance of success.
