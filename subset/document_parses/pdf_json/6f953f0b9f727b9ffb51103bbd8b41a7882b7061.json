We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. Results: The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p<0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p<0.05). Conclusions: There is an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of RRMS patients. Healthcare organizations need to provide professional therapeutic advice and psychosocial support for this population of patients during the pandemic.",

Enrollment of patients and both assessments were conducted by the same researcher. Exclusion criteria on both assessment time points were: the presence of other chronic illness (diabetes, asthma, hypertension, heart failure, renal and hepatic insufficiency), active infection, known history of addiction, relapses of the disease in previous 3 months and intravenous methylprednisolone treatment within the previous 3 months. Known psychiatric comorbidity before the time of the establishment of MS diagnosis was also an exclusion criteria (these patients were not included in the first assessment), because we wanted to exclude the impact of previous psychiatric disease on psychological status of RRMS patients. All patients had an MMSE score >24, and have been receiving immunomodulatory therapy (beta-interferons or glatiramer acetate) at the time of both assessments. Sex and age-matched healthy controls (HC) were included in this study.

Television was the main source of information for RRMS patients (54.4%), followed by social media (35.5%). Regarding the information that they received from media, we found that 12.5% of patients were very concerned, 33.5% somewhat generally concerned, 44.6% not very concerned, and 8.4% were not concerned at all. Furthermore, regarding the concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health or the health of their relatives and friends, 14.5% of patients were very concerned, 38.5% somewhat generally concerned, 40.6% not very concerned, and 6.4% were not concerned at all.

Also, this pandemic could last for months which could jeopardize the use of medical services to patients with chronic diseases. We do not know if people with MS are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19, but they are a unique group because they receive immunomodulatory therapy. Another aspect to consider in MS patients is that less mobility increases the risk of severe infection, especially if the patient is in a wheelchair.",

Among people most affected psychologically by the COVID-19 are those with an accompanying chronic disease (Ozamiz-Etxebarria et al., 2020; \u00d6zdin S and Bayrak \u00d6zdin, 2020) . For that reason, it was expected that RRMS patients have pronounced psychological distress than the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. RRMS patients had different degrees of fear of COVID-19 disease. The main concerns were that some patient's relatives or friends could be infected with COVID-19 or could die due to infection. Also, lack of specific treatment options for COVID-19 was noted as one of the reasons for fear among RRMS patients. The main concern about RRMS status was that the patients could not go to the hospital as usual. The majority of patients would try to get to the hospital and to find medical doctors who treat them. The patients, who would not go to the hospital, stated the fear of getting infected as the main reason. Visits for RRMS care should preferably be done by telemedicine or phone, but it is of note that in Serbia telemedicine is not widely available. Also some hospitals in Serbia during the COVID-19 outbreak are converted in hospitals only for COVID-19 patients due to the large number of patients with this infectious disease.",

The level of anxiety in Iranian MS patients during the COVID 19 pandemic was within the range of moderate to severe (Moghadashi, 2020).

Public health emergencies, such as a pandemic, have a significant impact on QoL of the general population (Chan and Huak, 2004; Kwek et al., 2006) . QoL is impaired in RRMS patients for many reasons and pandemic could just aggravate this. We found a statistically significant correlation between female gender, employment and partner status, severe disease A. Stojanov, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders 45 (2020) 102407 according to EDSS and more relapses with worse QoL, and more pronounced anxiety and depression. Depression and higher disability are independent risk factors for lower QoL. Depression and psychological distress symptoms are among the factors with the most essential impact on subjective well-being in MS patients (Yalachkov et al., 2019) . Lower household income, higher EDSS score and more progressive disease course have been all linked to a lower QoL, (Ruet et al., 2013; Lanzillo et al., 2016; Solaro et al., 2018) . These findings are in line with our results. There are some limitations of our study, such as a relatively small sample. Prolonged monitoring of RRMS patients after the COVID-19 pandemic is necessary for a better understanding of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on QoL and the overall psychological status. Also, it would be interesting to see whether patients treated with immunosuppressive therapies known to increase the risk for respiratory tract infections, exhibit higher degrees of psychological distress in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, compared to RRMS patients receiving beta-interferons or glatimer acetate. On the other hand, this study is done only on RRMS patients and for that reason could give a better insight into the psychological status of this subgroup of MS patients.",
