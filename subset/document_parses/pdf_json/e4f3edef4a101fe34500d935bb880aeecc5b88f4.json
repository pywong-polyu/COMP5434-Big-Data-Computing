SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was declared a pandemic on 12 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] . As of 16 April, 1 991 562 cases have been reported including 130 885 deaths [3] . A sensitive diagnostic assay is crucial to limit SARS-CoV-2 spreading as it allows to early detect new cases which lead to patient isolation and contact tracing. The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was published on 10 January 2020 [4] enabling the rapid design of a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay by Charit\u00e9 (Germany) [5, 6] . This test was the first to be dispatched by WHO [7] and was widely implemented in clinical virology laboratories worldwide [8] .",

Herein, ORF HKU was more sensitive than RdRp Charit\u00e9 but slightly less sensitive than other assays such as N1 US CDC or N HKU. Although RdRp Charit\u00e9 performed well for the lowest dilutions, it was nevertheless found to be less sensitive than others, a result in line with those of Vogels et al. [16] . It is worth noting that the Charit\u00e9 assay was the first to be published at the early stage of the pandemic [9] and has been widely used worldwide [8] . This assay was initially designed for the diagnosis of SARS-related CoVs and then optimised for SARS-CoV-2 detection [5] . Thanks to this assay, an important number of COVID-19 diagnoses were made, which contributed to limit the spread of the outbreak. In line with the present results, it was reported that RdRp IP2 and RdRp IP4 sensitivity was similar when used in multiplex [14] , suggesting that the Institut Pasteur assay should preferentially be used in multiplex. As previously reported [16], we identified probable primer contamination using N2 US CDC and E Charit\u00e9 which prevented us from further evaluation of the sensitivity. Although not observed herein, the amplification of non-specific products for ORF1 and N China CDC, and N2 and N3 US CDC has also been reported [17] .",

ORF1b and N HKU, and ORF1ab China CDC assays detected all replicates of dilutions inferior or equal to 10cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained for each assay were then compared for dilutions 10 -5 to10 -8 (Figure 1, Supplementary table 2). Since the accepted technical variability of RT-PCR is below 0.5 log 10 , we considered a difference of 2 Ct as significant. At 10 -5 dilution, the lowest Ct value was 27.7 for RdRp IP4. No significant difference in Ct values (Ct ranged from 28.0 to 29.1) was reported with N1 and N3 US CDC, and RdRp IP2. A similar Ct profile was observed for these assays at 10 -6 and 10 -7 dilutions.
