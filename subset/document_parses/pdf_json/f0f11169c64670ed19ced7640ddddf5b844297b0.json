            "text": "Quantification of feeding rates and selectivity of zooplankton is vital for understanding the mechanisms structuring marine ecosystems. However, methodological limitations have made many of these studies difficult. Recently, molecular based methods have demonstrated that DNA from prey species can be used to identify zooplankton gut contents, and further, quantitative gut content estimates by quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeted to the 18S rRNA gene have been used to estimate feeding rates in appendicularians and copepods. However, while standard single primer based qPCR assays were quantitative for the filter feeding appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, feeding rates were consistently underestimated in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. In this study, we test the hypothesis that prey DNA is rapidly digested after ingestion by copepods and describe a qPCR-based assay, differential length amplification qPCR (dla-qPCR), to account for DNA digestion. The assay utilizes multiple primer sets that amplify different sized fragments of the prey 18S rRNA gene and, based on the differential amplification of these fragments, the degree of digestion is estimated and corrected for. Application of this approach to C. finmarchicus fed Rhodomonas marina significantly improved quantitative feeding estimates compared to standard qPCR. The development of dla-qPCR represents a significant advancement towards a quantitative method for assessing in situ copepod feeding rates without involving cultivation-based manipulation.",

These studies demonstrated successful extraction and PCR amplification of the prey algal 18S ribosomal DNA from the gut of calanoid copepods and in their fecal pellets.

When applied to the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, realistic quantitative feeding and house trapping rates were observed (Troedsson et al. 2007 ). However, when a similar assay was applied to copepods, prey ingestion rates were significantly underestimated compared to independent methods (Nejstgaard et al. 2008) . A possible explanation for the underestimation of ingested prey cells by qPCR is the digestion of prey genomic DNA in copepod gut. This hypothesis is supported by previous reports of prey genomic DNA degradation in predator guts and feces (Zaidi et al. 1999; Hoogendoorn and Heimpel 2001; Symondson 2002; Jarman et al. 2004; Sheppard and Harwood 2005; Deagle et al. 2006) .

Rhodomonas sp. specific primers amplified fragments of increasing size from 74 to 616 bp (74, 142, 213 and 616 bp). Initially primers were designed to include amplicons that were 1,000 bp long. However, the digestion of the Rhodomonas sp. genomic DNA was too extensive for detection of these amplicons and they were subsequently excluded from the analysis (data not shown). Primers were designed using the primer design tool GeneTool-lite v. 1.0 (BioTools, Inc.). Primers were empirically optimized for qPCR using a Bio-Rad iCyclerIQ Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) and a MJResearch Opticon \u00d2 2 real-time thermal cycler. All the primers designed in this study were optimized for these specific laboratory experiments, e.g. to not amplify Calanus sp. and not specifically designed to exclude amplification of other target species not included in our analysis. Therefore, these primers should be carefully tested before application in other experimental systems.",

(800-1,600 lg C l -1 ) was performed. These experiments were conducted following procedures described previously by Nejstgaard et al. (2003) . Copepods were collected by gentle net tows from 0 to 30 m depth in the Raunefjord, western Norway (60\u00b016 0 N, 05\u00b014 0 E) using a 500 lm mesh size, 1 m diameter net with a 14 l non filtering cod-end. The samples were diluted with 40 l surface water and transferred within 30 min of collection to a walk-in cold room at in situ temperature (5-10\u00b0C). Animals were maintained at constant temperature under dim light with a 14:10 h light:dark cycle. Stage CV or CVI females of C. finmarchicus were sorted into five litre beakers using a wide mouth pipette and acclimated to the experimental food concentrations of R. marina (800-1,600 lg C l -1 ) for 4-6 days before use. At these food concentrations C. finmarchicus late copepodites have been documented to reach saturated feeding rates (B\u00e5mstedt et al. 1999) . After food acclimatization, animals were starved for 3 h in filtered (0.22 lm) seawater to allow complete gut evacuation prior to gut filling experiments. After starvation, animals were randomly split into five groups of ca. 35 individuals, transferred into new saturating suspensions of the same prey type in 450 ml Perspex chambers with 500 lm false bottoms, and incubated for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min. An initial sample (0 min) was collected as a starved control. After the incubation, copepods were removed and quickly rinsed by dipping the Perspex chambers in 4 consecutive baths of 450 ml filtered (0.22 lm) seawater and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10-20 s to stop gut activity and prevent defecation before sampling. Within a few minutes, the copepods were thawed in filtered (0.22 lm) seawater, collected onto a Petri-dish and randomly sorted under dim light into 1.5 ml Eppendorf TM microtubes for DNA analysis, or glass tubes for gut pigment analysis (five individuals for each analysis and incubation). To minimize the risk of including prey algae from the water, copepods were sorted by grabbing the base of the antennule with a forceps and dip-washing each copepod in droplets of prey-free filtered seawater before transfer to the tubes. Care was taken to minimize the amount of water in the tubes, and to immediately re-freeze the sorted copepods in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. Copepods for gut pigment analyses were extracted for 12 h in 90% acetone at 4\u00b0C and analyzed on a Turner Designs TM Model 10-AU Fluorometer as previously described (Nejstgaard et al. 1995) . Copepod gut pigment (chlorophyll a and derivates) concentrations were calculated as described in B\u00e5mstedt et al. (2000) .",

However, direct quantification of target prey species presents a unique set of methodological challenges, and to our knowledge there are only three studies attempting such quantification in marine zooplankton; one investigating the differential ingestion and house trapping in a Urochordate appendicularian Oikopleura dioica (Troedsson et al. 2007) , the second examined the gut content of the calanoid copepod Calanus finmarchicus (Nejstgaard et al. 2008) , and the third investigated multicellular prey particles with Acartia tonsa nauplii stages N1 and N2 as prey for the adult female Centropages typicus (Durbin et al. 2008) . In the study of Nejstgaard et al. (2008) , we conducted a series of optimization experiments, including development of efficient quantitative DNA extraction and purification protocols, minimization of PCR artifacts associated with detection of prey in the environment of a predator organism, and use of appropriate quantitative calibration standards. However, although the quantification protocol was optimized, there was still a significant underestimation of gut content compared to gut pigment analysis. Although initially we hypothesized that the digestion of prey DNA would be less than that of pigments because of the greater stability of DNA compared to photosynthetic pigments, these studies suggest that DNA associated with prey organisms is rapidly digested by copepods. Also, in the study of Durbin et al. (2008) significant underestimation of target gene copy number per prey nauplii was observed in the copepod gut. Prey DNA degradation in gut and feces and the difficulty of PCR amplifying large gene fragments has previously been reported in terrestrial arthropods and mammals (Zaidi et al. 1999; Hoogendoorn and Heimpel 2001; Symondson 2002; Jarman et al. 2004; Sheppard and Harwood 2005; Deagle et al. 2006) . Recently, Deagle et al. (2006) developed a model to evaluate DNA quality in fecal samples based on qPCR amplification of different sized amplicons. The dla-qPCR assay described here is based on the same principle, but is applied to obtain absolute estimates of prey consumption by copepods by correcting for DNA digestion. Nejstgaard et al. (2008) suggest that underestimation of prey numbers ingested by copepod obtained by conventional qPCR is explained by DNA digestion. The results also suggest that it is not possible to accomplish absolute copepod gut content estimates without accounting for DNA digestion. In this study, we use the digestion profiles generated by dla-qPCR to account for DNA digestion and to correct qPCR estimates of copepod gut content. Based on digestion corrected estimates of copepod gut content, the dla-qPCR assay yielded estimates of consumed algal prey within the same order of magnitude as those determined by analysis of gut pigments (Fig. 4) .",

For complete gut content Cell numbers are given as mean values with standard deviation Fig. 4 Comparison of qPCR (circle) and dla-qPCR (filled circle) with gut pigment (Chlorophyll a) estimates of Rhodomonas marina cells consumed by Calanus finmarchicus. Single amplicon qPCR was based on detection of the 74 bp amplicon. The dashed line indicates the theoretical expected 1:1 correspondence line between gut pigment and qPCR-based estimates analysis, the design of four specific primers for each prey target is often not practical and the analysis of each sample would be very expensive. It also adds uncertainty to the level of specificity for each prey species, especially when using 18S rRNA gene targets. Nevertheless, for studies where the aim to conduct quantitative estimates of specific trophic interactions, the dla-qPCR approach could provide a direct quantitative estimate. In addition, because the dla-qPCR approach yields predictable digestion profiles, it could be used in the lab to find digestion correlation factors under a given set of environmental conditions. These correlation factors could then be applied in the field where single primer qPCR is more practical.",
