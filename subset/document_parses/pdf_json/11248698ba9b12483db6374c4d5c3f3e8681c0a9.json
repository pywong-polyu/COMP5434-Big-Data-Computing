            "text": "An important category of immunosuppressive and anticancer drugs is that of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, i.e., rapamycin (sirolimus) and their analogues everolimus, temisirolimus, and deforolimus. Rapalogs bind to FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12). This complex inhibits the mTOR regulatory protein kinase signal transduction pathway, which regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival [1] . mTOR can form two functionally distinct complexes that differ in their sensitivity to rapalogs. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates translation and cell growth via phosphorylation of S6 kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E binding protein (4E-BP) and is very sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin. The second mTOR complex (mTORC2) is resistant to rapamycin and is involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton [1] . The immunosuppressive properties of mTOR inhibitors allow them to be used in solid-organ transplantation to prevent acute rejection [2, 3] . They also possess antineoplastic activities, which provide effective treatment of many cancers (renal carcinoma, advanced breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin) [4] . There are also some reports about mTOR inhibitors as candidate drugs against viral infections such as HIV or SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6] . However, until now, its most promising clinical application is in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a rare disease where a mutation of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene leads to overactivation of mTORC1, resulting in the growth of benign tumors in multiple organs including the brain, kidney, heart, and skin [7] .",

The most common side effects reported in those trials were stomatitis, infections, and metabolic and hematologic toxicities [10] . Most of the adverse hematological effects of mTOR inhibitor use are reported by organ transplant recipients and cancer patients [11, 12] ; however, similar effects have also been noted in TSC patients [13] [14] [15] . mTOR inhibitor use is also known to lead to microcytic anemia, which has been a subject of recent interest, partly due to its ubiquity and partly due to its obscurity. Many reports suggest that microcytosis is related to iron homeostasis. Other mechanisms, such as suppression of bone marrow, diminished globin production, and resistance to erythropoietin have also been considered [11] .",

Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry, measuring relative differences in size between control and everolimus-stimulated cultures based on the FSC-A parameter ( Figure 3C ). To check if iron administration could inhibit the tendency to a decreased cell size after everolimus exposure, the cell culture medium was supplemented with iron in the form of ferric chloride heme (hemin). Hemin alone, at a concentration of 40 \u00b5M, did not affect K562 cell size ( Figure 3B ,D); similarly, the addition of hemin to the cell culture with 5 \u00b5M everolimus did not prevent any decrease in cell size upon everolimus treatment. Everolimus-treated K562 cells were significantly smaller than those receiving hemin alone; this was indicated by flow cytometry measurements of median forward scatter ( Figure 3C ) and automated cell counter measurements of diameter in the live cell population ( Figure 3B ). This finding indicates that microcytosis occurring during everolimus treatment was unlikely to be related to iron deficiency since cell size was still found decreased in the presence of hemin, an iron-containing porphyrin.",

In addition, hemin did not affect cell viability and caused only minor changes in the proliferation efficiency of K562 cells. However, induction of erythroid differentiation with doxorubicin and cisplatin was accompanied by a reduction in the proliferation rate and viability of K562 cells. Since changes in proliferation rate, caused by cell cycle arrest, and cell viability, caused by necrosis or apoptosis, can influence the results of the cell size test, hemin was selected as the optimal agent for erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.",

Most fluctuations appeared to be within normal ranges, which may be the reason why this problem has not yet been explored in TSC patients during mTOR inhibitor therapy. However, significant microcytosis is a unique characteristic of mTOR inhibitor-induced anemia reported in patients after kidney and heart transplantations, as well as in cancer patients [16] [17] [18] . Among these patients, anemia might occur as a result of underling conditions such as cancer or kidney dysfunction. It has been proposed that the microcytic appearance of this form of anemia may be related to dysregulation in globin synthesis or failure in the autoregulatory mechanism of inflammation [11, 19] .

However, our longitudinal analysis of other blood markers of iron metabolism did not support the hypothesis that iron deficiency is the main cause of observed microcytosis. Firstly, ferritin and IL-6 levels did not change during treatment, which excludes iron deficiency and anemia due to inflammation; in addition, most iron measurements were within the normal range. Secondly, hepcidin level did not change over six months of therapy, and the only difference was noted after 12 months. Lastly, BMP-6 and HJV proteins, connected to hepcidin production, did not correlate with hepcidin concentration.

The K562 cell line, considered to be analogous to erythroid stem cells and one of the best known in vitro experimental models of erythroid cell maturation, was chosen for all experiments [20] . The size of K562 cells decreased by approximately 8% during three-day culture in the presence of everolimus. This is consistent with our in vivo observations, as the mean MCV value decreased by 9.2% after three months of everolimus treatment. Our in vivo study required a longer time to detect changes in erythrocyte size due to the fact that RBCs have a life span of 120 days and that circulating anucleated RBCs are not the target of everolimus. mTOR, a serine-threonine kinase, serves as a nutrient availability sensor regulating cell growth and proliferation. Knight et al. reported that reticulocytes show high level of signaling through mTOR [21] . They also noted the occurrence of severe macrocytic anemia following mTORC1 activation in genetically engineered mice demonstrating overand underactivation of mTORC1. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC1 resulted in lethal microcytic anemia. The authors conclude that the mTOR protein seems to be regulated by iron, as iron deficiency resulted in a marked reduction in mTORC1 signaling in RBCs in vitro and in vivo [21] .",

            "text": "Therefore, in the present study, to confirm whether iron administration could inhibit the tendency to a decreased cell size after everolimus treatment, the cell culture medium was supplemented with iron in the form of ferric chloride heme (hemin). Hemin (ferriprotoporphyrin IX) is routinely employed to reduce heme deficits in porphyria patients [25] . Our findings indicate that hemin alone did not affect K562 cell size. On the other hand, the combined addition of hemin to the cell culture with everolimus did not prevent any decrease in cell size upon everolimus treatment. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the observed decrease in cell size of erythroid-like K562 cells in vitro upon everolimus treatment is not the effect of iron deficiency. mTOR plays a distinct role at different stages of human erythropoiesis. In the early stage of erythroid differentiation, mTOR signaling is relatively high and promotes erythroblast proliferation. As erythropoiesis progresses, mTOR activity weakens, as reflected in the decrease in expression of mTOR downstream genes [26] . The K562 cell line is a well-known and broadly used in vitro model of erythroid maturation. Under standard culture conditions, K562 cells exhibit a low potential of hemoglobinization. However, erythroid differentiation of K562 cells can be induced by different stimuli [27, 28] . We hypothesized that cells at different stages of erythroid maturation might show different requirements for mTOR signaling and hence different levels of everolimus sensitivity. In the present study, hemin was used to induce erythroid maturation of K562 cells. Hemin treatment appeared to promote erythroid differentiation, as indicated by a significant increase in the percentage of cells with a high hemoglobin level; however, no changes in erythroid differentiation of K562 cells in vitro was observed following the addition of everolimus to the cell cultures with hemin. The percentages of benzidine-positive cells did not change in cell cultures exposed to a combined treatment with hemin and everolimus in comparison to cell cultures incubated with hemin only (84.1% vs. 85.4%). Undifferentiated, and more mature, hemoglobin-producing K562 cells did not show differences in sensitivity to everolimus treatment. The everolimus treatment decreased the cell size of these two cell populations at distinct stages of erythroid maturation by the same value (4%). Our finding suggests that the stage of erythroid maturation did not affect the response to everolimus.",

            "text": "Although reduced mTORC1 activity is known to induce a decrease in size in many cell types, differential sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors is observed [29, 30] . For example, Trendowski et al. noted that hHSCs are more sensitive to rapamycin than U937 human monocytic leukemia cells: under the same experimental conditions, a 48 h treatment with 25 nM rapamycin inhibited hHSC cell size by 24% and U937 cell size by only 12%. Rapamycin was found to have similar effects on U2OS and 293E human embryonic kidney cells (10% decrease in size) [29] . However, HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma) appeared to be more resistant, with a decrease in size of only 4%. In the present study, K562 cells decreased in size by approximately 10% and were still able to proliferate even in the presence of 10 \u00b5M everolimus. The K562 cell line is genetically characterized by the presence of an aberrant, oncogenic Bcr-Abl kinase, which may explain the resistance of K562 cells to high doses of everolimus. The reason for this differential response to mTOR inhibitors is still unclear, but these previous findings might suggest that different cell types depend on mTOR signaling to varying degrees in the control of cell growth. Alternatively, in the case of mTOR inhibition, compensatory pathways might by activated.",
