First, infected MS were concentrated mainly in Hubei Province, of which Wuhan City reported 1080 confirmed cases, and other cities in Hubei Province reported 394 cases. Deaths were also concentrated in this area. Twelve of the 13 MS who died were in Hubei Province. Second, according to the CNHC, 422 medical institutions reported infection accidents. For example, there were 40 cases of MS infection in the Central South Hospital of Wuhan University. 8 In Wuhan Union Hospital,>100 MS were infected, 9 and Wuhan Central Hospital had >200 cases. These hospitals were in charge of management of severe COVID-19, there had far fewer infected medical staff in hospitals which treated mild patients. For example, among the 14 Shelter Hospitals used for treatment of patients with mild COVID-19 in Wuhan City, zero infection of MS was maintained. Third, the infected MS were distributed among various departments: respiratory medicine, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, general surgery, organ-transplantation, traditional Chinese medicine, and endocrinology. Fourth, the infection rate in the early stage of the epidemic was high, and there was no information on the later stage of infection. 10 The last data released by the CNHC was on 17 February 2020, after which the number of new infections was not reported. 11 Fifth, the mortality rate of infected MS was low. 12 This accounted for 0.4% of MS, whereas the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 in China was ~5%. 13",

            "text": "In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, it had not been disclosed to the Chinese public that they were facing a dangerous infectious disease, but instead something akin to influenza. Patients went to hospitals as usual. 26 Patients would first choose a general clinic, visit the physicians in departments of internal medicine, respiratory medicine, and emergency medicine: MS in these departments had the highest frequency of making contact with patients. 27 In addition, some COVID-19 patients had conjunctivitis and diarrhea, so they had close contact with MS from the ophthalmology and gastroenterology departments, respectively. 28 Hospitalized patients were treated for viral pneumonia initially. 29 MS needed to carry out inspection, medication, infusion, and oxygen-supply duties for patients, and to provide mechanical ventilation and life support for patients with severe COVID-19. 30 They also needed to take care of the patients' daily diet, and they would have a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. 31 In this common type of diagnosis and treatment processes, MS from several hospital departments were exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and the latter could spread widely within the hospital. After COVID-19 had been confirmed officially, many people who had a fever or cough rushed to hospitals. In the face of a sudden increase in the number of patients, the number of MS was not sufficient. A total of 50,003 patients were noted in Wuhan City. However, data on Wuhan City from 2018 revealed39, 600 licensed physicians and 54,400 registered nurses. However, the MS of the departments of respiratory medicine, infectious disease and intensive care unit (ICU) were only a small part of the total medical staff. This disparity placed the medical system under tremendous pressure. 32 Besides the departments of infectious diseases, respiratory medicine, and ICU, other MS were involved in treatment of COVID-19 patients. 33 According to data from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, in the last 10 days of January 2020, 600 MS were infected.",

This MS supplementation also enabled rotation and vacation of MS. The most important feature was the change of healthpolicy strategies. From February 2020, the CNHC proposed a hierarchical program of diagnosis and treatment. 34 COVID-19 inpatients would be treated by Infectious Diseases Hospitals and specialist Respiratory Diseases Hospitals and large hospitals were designated in which other medical services were stopped. In Wuhan City, there were 37 hospitals that fitted this description. These hospitals were transformed and increased the number of PPE and medical equipment. 35 Other hospitals no longer treated patients with fever. Second, the Chinese Government built two hospitals in WuhanCity (Leishenshan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital) equipped, in total, with 2500 beds and ICU facilities, which could be employed specifically for the treatment of severe COVID-19. The MS needed by these two hospitals were from the military and medical teams of other Provinces. 36 Third, the Chinese Government set up 14 Shelter Hospitals in Wuhan City for the treatment of mild COVID-19. 37 COVID-19 patients were exposed to the new hospital and MS, and the infection rate of other peripheral MS decreased. MS nursing COVID-19 patients learned their lesson, and took strict protective measures to reduce the infection risk. 38 ",

On the one hand, the scale of this pandemic was tenfold larger than that for SARS in 2003.On the other hand, China did not have the drugs and medical equipment needed for treatment of infectious respiratory diseases. For example, China has not been able to produce extracorporeal membrane oxygenation equipment and computed-tomography (CT) equipment on a large scale. Therefore, China's main \"weapon\" against the COVID-19 epidemic was human resources: MS. In recent years, the level of education and experience of MS and hospital facilities in China have improved greatly, but MS paid a heavy price when they were confronted with COVID-19.The Chinese authorities have not published their investigation into the cause of SARS-CoV -2 infection and efficiency of protection of MS. From the diagnosis-and-treatment system, working environment and working intensity, as well as the level of protection of MS within Chinese hospitals, four main risk factors can be observed. First, governments worldwide recognized that SARS-CoV-2 had many transmission channels, strong transmission, and high infectious risks. 43 Second, in the face of a rapidly spreading epidemic, the medical system struggled to cope. 44 Third, information on protection obtained by MS was not comprehensive, and vigilance regarding protection had not been increased to the highest level. 45 Fourth, PPE was not supplied in a timely fashion.",

            "text": "In addition, some hidden problems in hospital construction and dealing with emergencies in the publichealth system in China were revealed. In terms of hospital construction, the scale and funding of Infectious Disease Departments in most hospitals was not sufficient to resist a large-scale epidemic. 46 In terms of dealing with emergencies in the public-health system, infection-prevention training for all MS (especially young MS) must be carried out continuously to remind them to protect themselves when dealing with new diseases. 47 Two aspects merit discussion with regard to Chinese MS infected with COVID-19. One was the scale of infection. Compared with the number of MS infected in other countries, especially in Italy and Spain, where the epidemic scale was close to that of China, there was adifference. 48 In March 2020, the National Federation of Physicians in Italy reported that 6205 medical staff had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, which accounted for 9% of confirmed cases, and 20% of them were frontline physicians, 65 of whom died. The number of Chinese MS infected with SARS-CoV-2 was relatively small, and there were two possible reasons for this phenomenon. First, the Chinese authorities counted only the physicians and nurses in public hospitals, not external staff. 49 Second, PPE in Italy was more scarce than that in China, and MS suffered more pressure. 50 Another issue worth discussion was how to reduce accidental infections. According to statistical data and case reports, the number of MS infected at the beginning of the epidemic was the largest. Of all hospital departments, the number of infections was greatest in MS of the outpatient department because most MS were not aware of the epidemic at that time and protective measures were poor. Infected MS were also distributed in the departments of internal medicine, respiratory disease, and ophthalmology because they had a high frequency of contact with the air droplets and secretions of patients. The scope of infection was more severe in large hospitals than that in small and medium-sized hospitals. This was because when people heard that COVID-19 was a high-mortality disease, they first chose a large hospital to seek reputable physicians and advanced medical facilities. However, the number of respiratory-disease departments and ICU wards in large hospitals was also limited, and could not accommodate the sudden increase in the number of patients. The crowding of patients led to a deterioration in the health environment and increased the probability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In short, the more patients there were, the more danger MS faced. Another group of MS who could be infected readily was physicians and nurses in the inpatient department. The patients with confirmed COVID-19 that they made contact with (especially critically ill patients) were highly infectious. SARS-CoV-2was detected in the medical supplies and household wastes they had used. MS needed to be in contact with seriously ill COVID-19patients 24 h a day, and the exposure risk was very high. 51 Other factors should also be mentioned. First, Chinese data showed that the infection rate of MS was high at the peak of the epidemic. 52 When the epidemic stabilized, the probability of infection declined quickly. Hence, in addition to adequate protection for MS, interruption of the infection source was very important. 53 In China, with construction of new hospitals specializing in treatment of severely illCOVID-19 patients and opening of \"fever clinics\", the waiting time for patients to be seen decreased. The corresponding medical devices and isolation equipment were upgraded so that infectious patients were treated appropriately and the infection source reduced. 54 Second, the sufficiency of information on protection was very important. China had encountered the SARS epidemic in 2003 and other infectious respiratory diseases in recent years, and the healthcare system had gained some experience in dealing with these infections. 55 Nevertheless, the healthcare system had to focus on how to use drugs instead of preventing infection. The key to preventing infection was to be fully informed. Early infections of some MS in the COVID-19pandemic were due largely to MS not knowing about the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 let loose in their hospital.",

China took measures to reduce the number of newly confirmed patients to single digits within 6 months, and to ensure that the vast majority of patients were discharged from hospital successfully. These measures involved ensuring the health and \"combat effectiveness\" of MS. During the COVID-19 epidemic, infection of Chinese MS elicited some painful lessons: lack of PPE, inadequate information on protection, and an unscientific diagnosis-and -treatment system. These problems should prompt publichealth authorities to make improvements. 57 They should help MS to establish a comprehensive protection network to prevent infection. We believe that some measures, such as increasing medical manpower, improving the level of protection, and enhancing the transparency of information, should be universal worldwide. However, it will be difficult to form a unified template for the training and deployment of MS if a public-health emergency occurs because the healthcare conditions of different countries vary.",
