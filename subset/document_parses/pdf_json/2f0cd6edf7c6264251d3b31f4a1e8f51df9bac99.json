There is also considerable interest in the potential of small (< 50 kW) hydrokinetic turbines to generate off-grid power from rivers, mainly for third world villages, but attempts to use scaled-down versions of large tidal turbines have met with little success for a range of reasons, as discussed in a previous publication (Kirke, 2019) and further explored below.",

For example a turbine rated at 5 kW in a 3 m/s flow will only deliver 5\u00d7(2/3) 3 = 1.5 kW in a 2 m/s flow and 0.18 kW in a 1 m/s flow.",

            "text": "The Garman turbine was among the first designed to pump water, and Thropton Energy (http://www.throptonenergy.co.uk/) developed a range of conventional axial flow designs resembling wind turbines, ranging from 1.8 to 4 m diameter. They also offered area and site surveys, market surveys, licenses and training for local manufacture. A flow velocity of at least 0.5 m/s was required, up to 1.5.m/s. These are realistic velocities for typical sites, but the required depth of at least 1.75 m for the 1.8 m diameter turbine would exclude it from many sites. Fig. 1 shows a Garman-Thropton turbine in a river. A 0.5 m/s flow velocity contains very little kinetic energy. Kinetic energy flux or power density = \u00bd \u03c1 A V 3 where \u03c1 = water density = 1000 kg/m 3 , A = flow area intercepted by turbine and V = free stream velocity. So a 0.5 m/s flow has a power density = \u00bd \u03c1 A V 3 = \u00bd x 1000 \u00d7 1 x (0.5) 3 = 62.5 W/m 2 , and the 1.8 m diameter Garman turbine with a swept area of 2.55 m 2 , if fully immersed, would intercept 159 W of kinetic power. So the turbine plus generator with a combined efficiency of say 30% would deliver 47.7 W. This may be enough to trickle charge a battery or pump a small amount of water at low head, but not much else. However this is the bottom end of the Thropton range, and it is claimed that up to 2 kW can be generated at higher velocities.",

Although velocities around 3 m/s have been measured in a few places such as the Colorado River in Utah (Magirl et al., 2009) , these are exceptions and are unlikely to be found at sites near consumers where small of-grid HKTs can be useful. As shown in Table 2 , typical river velocities are generally <1 m/s, and although there are places with higher velocities, these higher velocities generally coincide with shallow depth, or they occur on the outside of bends where flow can be very non-uniform, making it difficult to locate turbines.",

They found that a Darrieus turbine that would have achieved C P no more than about 0.35 in open flow, produced an apparent C P just over 1 where blockage was about 60%. This is clearly impossible if only kinetic energy was involved, so there must have been some conversion of potential energy. Kinsey and Dumas (2017) found a similar effect, as shown in Fig. 4 , showing that the effect is more significant for cross flow than for axial flow turbines. This effect is very important in small and moderate sized rivers where the available energy is limited, and it may be practicable for a turbine to occupy most of the flow areaprovided 1. There is provision for boats to pass where required 2. The banks are stable, or can be stabilised, and the turbine is not likely to be washed away by flash floods.",

Deployment can be difficult in fast flows, even for small turbines (image from http://idenergie.ca/en/news/). length can be large enough to achieve acceptably high blade chord Reynolds numbers. Kirke (2016) has demonstrated that the performance of Darrieus turbines decreases sharply as Reynolds numbers decrease below about 200,000. He has built such a turbine with diameter 1 m and chord length 0.16 m, giving an effective solidity of 0.32, which is ideal, and a Reynolds number ranging from 640,000 to 320,000 at a tip-speed ratio of 3 in a 1 m/s flow, as the blade moves upstream then downstream.",

But at tipspeed ratios \u03bb of 3 or more, nearly all of the power is extracted on the upstream pass (0 < \u03b8 < 180\u00b0), as shown in Fig. 16 , so a large diameter shaft needed for the high bending moments on a long turbine spanning most of the width of a river would probably have little effect on the turbine's performance. A three-blade version of the New Energetics turbine with arc camber blades, able to operate in either fixed or variable pitch modes, was built and tested in Australia in 2019-20. As expected, it failed to self-start in fixed pitch mode and although it self-started in variable pitch mode, it shook so violently that it was not possible to measure its performance. A four-blade version was built in Sarawak in 2019 but according to Dr. Anyi \"was almost impossible to test\" (probably due to its weight and depth requirement, site access difficulties and limited manpower available). It was clear that multiple blades would be necessary for smooth operation, as indicated in Fig. 14.",

The Waterotor website makes extravagant claims but gives no information on performance. \"Estimated target prices\" are given at https:// waterotor.com/products/#specsheet. Waterotor Energy Technologies Inc, 2020b Waterwheels Waterwheels can be driven by either flowing or falling water, or a combination of both. The \"stream wheel\" shown in Fig. 22 , from https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_wheel#Undershot_wheel, is effectively an HKT. They are simple but bulky for their power output, and they rotate very slowly, with optimum efficiency achieved when the paddles are moving at \u00bd -1/3 of the water velocity, making them unsuitable for driving generators, compared with axial flow turbines with tip-speed ratios of 4 or more, 2.5-3 for Darrieus and 1 for Savonius rotors. Although they are normally narrow with a large diameter, there seems no reason why water wheels could not be made wide to intercept more flow in a shallow river. M. Anyi (2013) found three images of large, fairly wide floating waterwheels, one of which is shown in Fig. 23 . These are referenced in Table 3 . They are all different in appearance, located in three different countries, published in 2003-5, with no evidence of more recent developments along similar lines, suggesting that they were one-off prototypes and further development was not deemed justified.",
