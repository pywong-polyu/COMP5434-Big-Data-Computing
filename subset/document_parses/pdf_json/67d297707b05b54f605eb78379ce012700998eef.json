            "text": "Background The effectiveness of laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR) in patients with defecatory disorders secondary to internal rectal prolapse is poorly evidenced. A UK-based multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of LVMR compared to controls at medium-term follow-up. Methods The randomized controlled trial was conducted from March 1, 2015 TO January 31, 2019. A stepped-wedge RCT design permitted observer-masked data comparisons between patients awaiting LVMR (controls) with those who had undergone surgery. Adult participants with radiologically confirmed IRP refractory to conservative treatment were randomized to three arms with different delays before surgery. Efficacy outcome data were collected at equally stepped time points (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 weeks). Clinical efficacy of LVMR compared to controls was defined as \u2265 1.0-point reduction in Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life and/or Symptoms (PAC-QOL and/or PAC-SYM) scores at 24 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included 14-day diary data, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), St Marks incontinence score, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12), the chronic constipation Behavioral Response to Illness Questionnaire (CC-BRQ), and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ). Results Of a calculated sample size of 114, only 28 patients (100% female) were randomized from 6 institutions (due mainly to national pause on mesh-related surgery). Nine were assigned to the T0 arm, 10 to T12, and 9 to T24. There were no substantial differences in baseline characteristics between the three arms. Compared to baseline, significant reduction (improvement) in PAC-QOL and PAC-SYM scores were observed at 24 weeks post-surgery (-1.09 [95% CI -1.76, -0.41], p = 0.0019, and -0.92 [-1.52, -0.32], p = 0.0029, respectively) in the 19 patients available for analysis (9 were excluded for dropout [n = 2] or missing primary outcome [n = 7]). There was a clinically significant long-term reduction in PAC-QOL scores (\u2212 1.38 [\u2212 2.94, 0.19], p = 0.0840 at 72 weeks). Statistically significant improvements in PAC-SYM scores persisted to 72 weeks (\u2212 1.51 [\u2212 2.87, \u2212 0.16], p = 0.0289). Compared to baseline, no differences were found in secondary outcomes, except for significant improvements at 24 and 48 weeks on CC-BRQ avoidance behavior ], and \u2212 0.92 [\u2212 1.52, \u2212 0.32], respectively), CC-BRQ safety behavior (\u2212 13.7 [95% CI \u2212 20.5, \u2212 7.0], and \u2212 13.0 [\u2212 19.8, \u2212 6.1], respectively), and BIPQ negative perceptions (\u2212 16.3 [95% CI \u2212 23.5, \u2212 9.0], and \u2212 10.5 [\u2212 17.9, \u2212 3.2], respectively).",

The most common abnormalities (either singly or together) are rectocele and intussusception [3, 4] . While parameters for diagnosis and intervention vary [1, 5, 6] , structurally significant rectoceles and high-grade intussusception (i.e. those descending to the level of anal canal or beyond) [1] may benefit from surgical repair in well-selected patients. Procedures broadly aim to reinforce the rectovaginal septum (mainly focused on rectocele) [7] [8] [9] , excise part of the rectal wall (most commonly using stapling devices) [10] [11] [12] , or suspend the rectum (mainly forms of rectopexy) [13, 14] . The varying popularity of numerous procedures to address these problems reflects the fact that no single approach has achieved obvious clinical primacy and also that there is no high-quality evidence base for decision-making [15] .",

While some large patient series provide general support for LVMR in populations of patients with a mix of symptomatic presentations (obstructed defecation or incontinence) due to ERP or IRP [17-19, 21, 22] , the utility of LVMR for patients with obstructed defecation and IRP is not well-supported by published evidence. Indeed, a previous UK National Institute for Health Research-funded systematic review included only 18 studies with a total of 1238 patients [23] . Of these, the vast majority of included studies provided only level IV (Oxford) evidence. Furthermore, outcomes have generally been based on poorly validated measures, e.g. patient global rating scales and the obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) score [24] [25] [26] , which were originally developed to evaluate the effect of surgery [27, 28] . There is concern that objectively determined long-term outcomes of LVMR using validated measures will not match those from enthusiasm-driven case series (as has been the case for numerous other surgical procedures for chronic constipation) [29] , and this question has become more important with the international scrutiny of mesh-related complications in general.

Contrary to most stepped-wedge trials individual patients were randomized rather than utilizing cluster sampling. This is, in effect, a modification of a standard parallel-group, waiting-list control design, but with several advantages. First, a stepped-wedge design is more efficient and thus improves recruitment feasibility (the bane of nearly all surgical trials). Simulation demonstrated that a parallel-group design required a much larger sample size than that proposed for the current study at the same power. Second, the trial design meant that there was only a onein-three chance (rather than one-in-two chance for a parallel group) of waiting 6 months for surgery, which was more acceptable to patients. The study received national ethical approval ( (2) self-report of problematic constipation; (3) symptom onset > 6 months prior to recruitment; (4) symptoms meeting the American Gastroenterological Association definition of constipation [33] ; (5) refractory constipation after a minimum basic standard (lifestyle and dietary measures and \u2265 2 laxatives or prokinetics) tried with no resolution of symptoms and no time requirement; (6) ability to understand written and spoken English (due to questionnaire validity); (7) ability and willingness to give informed consent; (8) failure of non-surgical interventions (minimum of nurse-led behavioral therapy) [34] ; (9) IRP as determined by clinical examination and defecography, using the following criteria: (a) recto-anal or recto-rectal intussusception \u00b1 other dynamic pelvic floor abnormalities (e.g. rectocele, enterocele, excessive perineal descent); (b) deemed to be obstructing and/or associated with protracted or incomplete contrast evacuation by expert review.

We assumed that PAC-QOL score followed a normal distribution over all time points with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.5 points and with a correlation between repeated assessments equal to 0.5 points. Simulation showed that detection of a 1-point difference in PAC-QOL score at 6 months with 95% power (purposely chosen to reflect the magnitude and risk of intervention) at the 5% significance level required 34 participants in each of the three arms. Allowing for a 10% loss to follow-up, a sample size of 38 was needed per arm, for a total sample size of 114 patients across the 3 arms. Should the correlation between repeated assessments be < 0.5 points, a sample size of 114 will still provide at least 90% power for the study.

To model the effects of surgery, dummy variables were used to indicate if participants had already received treatment before each follow-up time. The Kenward-Roger correction was employed to account for inflated type I error rates due to the small sample size. The contrast of primary interest was between the score at 24 weeks after surgery and the score at baseline. Some outcomes were scores calculated by summing the responses to all the questions in a questionnaire. If fewer than half of the questions were unanswered the missing responses were imputed with the mean of the available cases. All outcomes were analyzed under a 'missing at random' assumption (i.e. assuming that 'missingness' depended only on outcomes that had been observed). Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM) scores [51] were analyzed by the same approach as above. Binary outcomes were summarized at 24 and 48 weeks post-surgery with number and percent indicating problems and an odds ratio comparing 24 and 48 week outcomes to baseline.

Although preoperative PAC-QOL scores were higher (worse) in the latter group, the total PAC-QOL score was significantly improved in both groups at 12 months (p < 0.001). The Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was also improved in both groups. The same authors showed equivalent GIQLI improvements in a series of 50 incontinent patients undergoing LVMR for high-grade IRP (p = 0.01) [21] .",

            "text": "Several limitations associated with our RCT warrant mention. The study was severely hampered by under-recruitment (28 out of a planned 114 patients). The media scrutiny of the use of mesh undoubtedly affected both patient and surgeon perception and willingness to take part in the study. Some centers paused or abandoned LVMR totally in the light of the mesh controversy, and there was a perception that for others the heightened scrutiny of practice in the protocol also negatively affected recruitment. Difficulties in attracting centers to recruit pre-dated the zenith of the mesh publicity and also reflected wide variation in practice across the UK in terms of both patient selection and LVMR operative technique. The attention we paid to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria (based on guidance from the Pelvic Floor Society, London, UK) [36] led to increased scrutiny in many centres where such surgery was previously being undertaken without rigorous application of these criteria. This regrettably led to a rapid revision (manifest as a drop-off) in the number of patients eligible for recruitment to the trial. With the media storm blowing up and the Cumberlege report in preparation [58] , there was never a time when the results of this trial were more needed. Included patients had a high symptom burden and long duration of symptoms that had been refractory to previous treatments, including a minimum of bowel habit training by a specialist practitioner. Patients had been thoroughly investigated and, therefore, could be considered both 'hard to treat' and 'carefully selected' for surgical intervention.",
