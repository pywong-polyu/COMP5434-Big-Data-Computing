C-KAP is an interdisciplinary research pilot project led by university scholars in psychology and social work in partnership with community partners. The exploratory cross-sectional mix-method study recruited 141 (n=141) youth and young adults (ages 18-39). This study was informed on empirical research and a bilingual online questionnaire was field-tested, and data was collected via QuestionPro Software. Quantitative analysis was conducted using SPSS version 27. Descriptive statistics and frequency analysis were used for demographics and basic statistics. Chi square tests and Fisher's exact tests between variables were ran to find statistically significant associations. For the qualitative data, independent coders conducted recurrent content analysis to identify themes. Salient themes include knowledge about cancer types; access to health care; prevention; and the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlight a lack of knowledge and orientation on cancer in youth and young adults suggesting the need for community tailored education and screening interventions. Other findings reflect gender differences in knowledge and practices, which indicates that a gender-specific lens is needed when delivering education.",

The adolescent, youth, and young adult population (AYAs) account for 5% of cancer diagnosis in the United States with about 89,000 young people ages 15 to 39 diagnosed with cancer each year. 1 In Texas, AYAs account for 7,800 diagnoses annually, with 1,000 of these dying. 2 AYAs are defined as those between ages 15-39 years; adolescents, ages 15-19 years; emerging adults, ages 20-25 years; and young adults, ages 26-39 years. 3 The AYAs population is unique in terms of cancer risks and psychological needs. 4 Cancer is 1 of the leading causes of disease-related death in these age groups. 5 The most common types of cancer among these age groups include brain and other central nervous system tumors, breast, cervical, colorectal, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, sarcoma, testicular, and thyroid. 1 The importance of addressing the needs of AYAs helps educational programs focus on their developmental stage and learning abilities. Adult learners are more independent, self-driven, tend to seek information surrounding current interests and their roles in society, while adolescents are more likely to seek help from others who are more knowledgeable, gather a drive to learn through social engagement, interaction and appreciate information that is related to their lives outside of a school setting. 6 Adapting educational messages to each age group would enrich the ways information is presented, delivered, and how education may lead to healthy practices and behaviors.",

They constitute a salient population for digital use to translate and transfer information to improve health outcomes by providing messages geared at the levels of cognitive capacity and psychosocial development. 12 Research indicates gender differences in cancer knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Traditionally males have a history of lower participation in cancer screenings. 13 Not only is health behavior different, so is the generation of health practices among genders. In a meta-analysis study, females in good health were found to actively seek more cancer information than males, and males diagnosed with cancer were more likely to seek cancer information than females. 14 Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate cancer knowledge, attitudes and practices from the perspective of youth and young adults in 2 rural communities in the border region. Findings will inform cultural and linguistic proficient education efforts to engage AYAs to promote behaviors to reduce cancer risks.",

KAP surveys reveal misconceptions that may represent barriers and challenges to behavior change and are frequently used to collect information on knowledge (ie, what is known), attitudes (ie, what is thought), and practices (ie, what is done). [15] [16] [17] The study is exploratory and cross-sectional mixed method. The inclusion criteria consisted of adults 18-39 year of age residing in either of the 2 study locations at the time of the study. A pre-screening tool was used to assess eligibility. Potential participants were asked to provide their zip code number and their birthdate. If the zip code entered was not 1 of the 2 of the study location or if their birthday indicated not being withing the 18-39 age group, they were excluded from the study. The pre-screening tool was set to deny any additional tries from the same device previously used. A total of 189 potential participants were pre-screened with 48 being considered ineligible due to residing in a different zip code. Potential participants who were eligible were then guided to the study consent form and would begin the questionnaire upon consent. The study received IRB approval from the authors' academic institution. Data collection took place through QuestionPro software institutional license between September 22 and November 22, 2020. Local community partners, and Community Health Workers, bilingual project flyers distributed in study locations, and Facebook ads were used to assist with recruitment. The study used a convenience sampling technique in addition to snowball sampling, which encouraged participants that completed the study to invite others who met inclusion criteria to do the same. Participants who completed the study were welcome to share the study flyers, which included a QR code with study link as well as email contact information for the study, with other potential participants who they knew met study eligibility. Participants received a $20 e-gift card as an incentive for their time.",

The instrument was developed by the primary authors informed by KAP model literature and health promotion theory. The KAP model is designed to be mixed methods to be able to identify the gaps and how to address these. Instrument was translated to Spanish, back translated, and field-tested with a group of 5 bilingual youth and young adults attending college. The instrument was available in both English and Spanish, participants had the option to complete in their preferred language. The online questionnaire took between 20-30 minutes for participants to complete. With the help of the University Data Analytics Laboratory from the institution, it was determined that a convenience sample of 70 participants from each location (1.3 and 4% of the total age group residing in Location A and Location B) would be a modest sample given the exploratory nature of the study. Therefore, the sample consisted of N = 141 participants, 44% (n = 62) from location A and 56% (n = 79) from location B.",

Descriptive analyses included Chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests between variables to find associations, with \u03b1 = .05. Significant associations between variables relevant to the study were followed-up with odds ratios. Chi-square for association were conducted between gender and (a) sociodemographic characteristics, (b) knowledge of cancer and risk, (c) attitudes about cancer screenings, (d) practice and health seeking behaviors, (e) prevention actions, and (f) COVID-19 and cancer care. Unless noted otherwise, all expected cell frequencies were greater than 5. Fishers' Exact test was used when expected cell frequencies fell below 5. The Multiple Marginal Independence test (MMI) was utilized to assess the relationship between gender and the source of cancer prevention information since each respondent could have selected multiple responses (eg, select all). 22 Gender was defined as W i and the source of cancer prevention information was set as Y j . The MMI was conducted in R (version 4.1.0) using the MMI. test function from the MRCV package. Bonferroni adjustments were used to calculate for statistical significance, as per the guideline provided by Bilder and Loughin. 23 Figure 1 Both thematic and content analyses were conducted with the qualitative data. Content analysis was conducted first to identify and quantify the data and utilized to guide the thematic analysis. Thematic analyses were conducted to identify the patterns across answers from the population of interest and to organize qualitative data in English and Spanish to identify central themes as the team is proficient in both languages. A pre-coding technique was utilized to filter information through highlighting salient words and/or phrases in individual participant responses. The first 2 authors, with more than 15 years of experience with qualitative data, and third author, an undergraduate student with basic experience with thematic data analysis following protocol, observed the data together to develop a consensus way to code. Once the method was established, the authors individually coded the data to later come together and discuss. Standardization of coding by 3 independent coders and triangulation by the first 3 authors was used to reduce bias, enhance intercoder reliability, and reduce error. 24 Disagreements were discussed and resolved during coding meetings. Final codes and categories were generated through collaboration among all 3 independent coders. ",

Though all measures were taken to keep anonymity, the study does not go without social desirability bias, which may create a tendency for participants to over-report desirable and under-report undesirable behavior. Due to confidentiality, the research team could not ensure that participants from only the projected locations participated.

The way forward in cancer prevention and care is to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration between the behavioral social and clinical sciences. There are, however, challenges that need to be overcome before true health interdisciplinary approaches to address AYAs health needs can be achieved. The KAP survey is useful to obtain general information about public health knowledge regarding prevention practices and care. The KAP survey model gather cancer information to inform research and plan public health programs for AYAs. Considering the study findings, we conclude that it is necessary to prepare health and human service professionals to launch gender-based programs focused on AYAs cancer and chronic disease prevention to improve knowledge, attitudes and practices. Health practitioners are instrumental in educating, promoting health literacy and screening for risks and promoting protective factors. It is imperative to design culturally and linguistic proficient educational tools for professionals and peer educators to better connect AYAs with accessible and available venues of prevention and care. Organizational policies to ensure affordable health services and care are needed if not in place and engaging AYAs in generating local knowledge and recommendations to promote healthy practices is important if we want to reach vulnerable communities. Documenting barriers and challenges to cancer care is not enough, creating community-based participatory action research experiences where AYAs are co-researchers and they co-lead the design, data collection, and analysis is fundamental to successful health program implementation.",
