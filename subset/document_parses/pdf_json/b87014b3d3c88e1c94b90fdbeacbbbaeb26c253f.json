Overlapping clinical presentations may make bacterial respiratory tract infection (RTI) difficult to differentiate from COVID-19, particularly in those with chronic respiratory conditions. This has led to concerns about potential inappropriate overuse of antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 symptoms with resultant adverse effects and development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).",

At the core of the ASP coordinated by SAPG and delivered in collaboration with primary care teams is work to reduce the population's unnecessary exposure to antibiotics in two main areas. Firstly, antibiotics should not be used for self-limiting infections such as sore throats and coughs in otherwise fit and healthy people, and secondly when antibiotics are needed, the right antibiotic, at the right dose for the right duration, should be used. National data shows these have been successful with antibiotic prescribing rates in the community at their lowest level on record. 5 In Scotland, most antibiotic prescribing takes place within the GP practice setting. 5 In Scotland when a clinician generates a prescription using the GP practice operating system at the point V C The Author(s) 2020.

Following a sharp rise in March 2020 the number of prescriptions, primarily for respiratory infections, fell by 34% compared with the corresponding week in 2019. We suggest the peak was due to 'just in case' prescriptions, particularly for anticipatory care in patients with chronic lung conditions as lockdown was introduced as the greatest increases were seen with doxycycline and also moderate increases in amoxicillin and clarithromycin. This study suggests that either self-limiting respiratory tract infections were less frequent or that patients were more likely to practice self-care leading to reduced use of antibiotics for these conditions. Other factors that may have influenced reductions in antibiotic use include improved hand hygiene, reduced transmission of infection due to lockdown, patient anxiety and desire to protect the NHS. It is also possible that self-isolation with presumed COVID-19 influenced the reduced number of patients presenting to GP practices, some of whom may have had a bacterial infection. Initially we only evaluated data for RTI antibiotics and suspected that reductions may be due to prioritized face-to-face GP appointments and utilization of telephone or video consultations. However, data for non-RTI showed no change in the number of prescriptions for 2020 compared with 2019, suggesting that GP prioritization was not impacting on patients seeking treatment for infections. We did not evaluate antibiotics provided via community pharmacies, which would be mainly for urinary tract infections.",

            "text": "Although not applicable in NHS Scotland the publication of NICE rapid COVID-19 guidelines 7 on the Healthcare Improvement Scotland website 8 on 3 April 2020 may have had an impact on supporting clinicians not to prescribe antibiotics. However, we are unable to determine if NICE guidance was accessed or followed but the approach in Scotland has always been to follow local antibiotic guidelines. During the pandemic, the key message from SAPG to all clinicians has been to continue to follow routine antibiotic prescribing practice. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are both first-line agents in all health board guidelines for community respiratory infections with the choice in individual patients based on any previous therapy and contraindications. We also suggest that it is possible that as clinicians became increasingly accustomed to COVID-19 presentation they became more confident in not prescribing antibiotics. There may also be improved public understanding about the differences between viral and bacterial infections due to the intensive COVID-19 media and increased use of the NHS inform website for self-care advice. New models of care by GP practices that may Malcolm et al. continue into the recovery phase of COVID-19 may support sustained reductions in respiratory antibiotics with resultant benefits for antimicrobial resistance. Our data are encouraging as reports of reduced ASP activities have the potential for long-term negative impact on global AMR. 9 The system in Scotland for seeking advice on infections in the community is via the 111 line triage system followed by referral to either the CAC or to local GP practice for a phone or video call with a healthcare professional. We cannot exclude the possibility that antibiotics supplied from CACs as pre-labelled packs (not captured in this dataset) accounted for some of the reduction observed. NHS 24 took the vast majority of all calls for any cough, breathlessness or fever. The maximum number of calls daily to the COVID-19-line peaked at around 7000 on 23 March 2020 (Week 13) and referrals to CACs peaked at around 1800 per day on 7 April 2020 (Week 15). 1 Up to 20% of patients required assessment and could COVID-19 and community antibiotic prescribing JAR potentially be given antibiotics. 1 The number of COVID-19 confirmed cases peaked on 7 April 2020 (Week 15) 1 . There was a correlation with the peak in prescribing activity with calls to the COVID-19 line but not with referrals to CACs or confirmed cases. In addition, OOH services could e-mail prescriptions to community pharmacies. Informal feedback from clinicians suggests around 20% of those assessed received an antibiotic for respiratory infection and accordingly we do not believe this use significantly impacts on the findings of this study. Data on RTI antibiotics issued by CACs will be analysed in due course.",

It will also be important to monitor trends in AMR to assess the impact of these changes in antibiotic use.
