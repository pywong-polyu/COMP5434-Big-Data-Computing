The OASI Care Bundle was implemented in 16 maternity units in Britain in the OASI1 project (2017)(2018), which demonstrated the care bundle's effectiveness in reducing OASI rates. In OASI2, the care bundle will be scaled up to 20 additional National Health Service (NHS) maternity units in a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study that will examine the effectiveness of strategies used to introduce, implement and sustain the care bundle.",

The additional study arm (sustainability, n = 10 units) will include some original OASI1 units to evaluate the care bundle's sustainability and OASI rates over time, from before OASI1 and through the end of OASI2. Units in all three study arms will receive an Implementation Toolkit with training resources and implementation support. The C-RCT arms will be compared in terms of OASI rate reduction (primary effectiveness outcome) and clinicians' adoption of the care bundle (primary implementation outcome). Clinical data will be collated from maternity information systems; implementation data will be collected through validated surveys with women and clinicians, supplemented by qualitative methods. Descriptive statistics and regression modelling will be used for analysis. Emergent themes from the qualitative data will be assessed using framework analysis.",

The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) first defined care bundles in 2001 as 'a small set of evidence-based practices that, when implemented together, will result in significantly better outcomes than when implemented individually' [1] . The OASI Care Bundle (OASI-CB) was developed in response to a tripling in rates of reported obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) in England over a 10-year period [2] . OASI is the collective term for a third-or fourth-degree perineal tears, a severe complication of vaginal childbirth that may have long-term consequences including chronic pain, sexual dysfunction, and urinary and/or anal incontinence [3, 4] . Approximately one in 13 primiparous women with assisted vaginal births and one in 20 primiparous women with unassisted (spontaneous) vaginal births in Great Britain (GB) are reported to experience an OASI [5] . Over half of the women who sustain an OASI have continued morbidities and close to half report an impact on their future birth choices [6] . Furthermore, OASI has significant resource implications for healthcare providers due to ongoing follow-up and litigation [7] .",

'Recipients' are the clinicians 'receiving' the implementation and adopting the care bundle into their routine practice. Facilitation and recipients are therefore internal determinants of implementation success. Conversely, 'innovation' and 'context' are external determinants that may impact the OASI QI Leads and clinicians. Innovation refers to the acceptability and evidence base supporting the four components and the OASI-CB as a whole; depending on the strength of this evidence, this can have a positive or negative impact on OASI QI Leads, clinicians, and ultimately, the implementation. The favourability of the context will further impact implementation. At the national level, this depends on the opinion of professional clinical leadership and support of women's advocacy groups; a favourable local context includes existing capacity for quality improvement and senior buy-in early in the implementation period. Context also takes into account the approval and support of the care bundle's target population; women who are eligible to receive the care bundle and women who have received it.",

For the two C-RCT arms, the regression analysis will assess the impact of care bundle adoption (based on NoMAD score from clinicians' survey) on relative differences of odds of OASI. In the sustainability arm, the regression analysis will assess the impact of additional 'sustainability strategies' on the adoption of the care bundle and on odds of OASI.",

A pragmatic approach is taken in the study design as well as the development of implementation materials and the monitoring and evaluation plan. The two implementation support methods to be compared were selected as feasible options for national scale-up. The Implementation Toolkit was developed by experienced clinicians and aims to assist implementation by passing on lessons learned in a way that can be both operationalised and localised. Study findings will be shared widely through peer-reviewed publications, evidence briefs, and media/social media channels. Beyond OASI2, through triangulation of data and theory, this study aspires to create a more thorough understanding of barriers and enablers to the sustainable, large-scale implementation of care bundles in maternity care.
