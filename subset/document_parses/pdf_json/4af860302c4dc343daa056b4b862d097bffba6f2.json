Spending long time at home and worrying about family members had prompted more anxiety and depressive symptoms and posed a challenge to our psychological resilience (2) .",

However, healthcare workers were exhausted by the risk of infection as well as physical and psychological problem because of the overstretched health systems, shortage of personal protective equipment, and overwork. Previous studies have found that healthcare workers and their households had increased risks of admission with COVID-19, especially patient-facing healthcare workers (3) . The risk of mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, and fear was also higher (4, 5) . Also, 41% of hospital staff disrupted sleep/wake cycle after the quarantine (6) . A study conducted in China also showed that a large number of Chinese healthcare workers experienced mental health problems during this epidemic, and those healthcare workers working at COVID-19-designated hospitals were more likely to report anxiety symptoms (7) . Moreover, staff working in the epidemic area of the hospital in Wuhan had a high prevalence of sleep disturbance (41.8%) (8) . So, protecting the mental health and improving sleep quality of these healthcare workers is of great importance. In a study of America, family situation, education, friends, and social support were found relevant to self-reported sleep (9) . For healthcare workers, the main factors affecting the sleep quality include workloads, coping style, and whether they had confidence to complete tasks and anxiety (8, 10) . Treatments for these problems (such as insomnia and anxiety) usually include relaxation training and cognitive therapy (11) . But several other interventions may also benefit people with these problems.",

Tai Chi was usually described as a meditative or internal martial art. It comprehensively incorporated breathing and meditative techniques, body awareness, and imagery (13) . In the past decades, a large number of studies have been conducted to explore the advantages of Tai Chi and have proved that Tai Chi has multiple positive effects on our health. Several studies have reported that Tai Chi improves sleep quality and reduces anxiety and depression in both healthy adults and elders (14) (15) (16) . However, randomized controlled trials remain insufficient in this area, and most participants in these studies are patients and elders.",

Both Tai Chi training and relaxation training lasted 2 weeks during 6 January 2021 to 21 January 2021. Tai Chi training was conducted by a professional 24-style Tai Chi teacher. The trainer formulated the teaching outline, teaching contents, methods, and schedule. All participants in this group received a Tai Chi course with 6 pretraining sessions within 3 days before the intervention. In the process of the course, participants were asked to practice movement, posture, and movement speed, until they learned the correct posture. After each pretraining session, each participant played Tai Chi videos online to facilitate self-practice. In the last pretraining session, a Tai Chi exam was setup. Only after passing the exam can participants attend the formal intervention, and all participants passed it at last. During the 2-week intervention, the participants practiced Tai Chi with the teacher and teaching video from 10:00 to 10:30 every day. While the participants in control group received a relaxation training using elastic belts, hula hoops, skipping rope, and pushups. They all did free exercise from 10:00 to 10:30 every day.

It was suggested that 11.3% participants had bad sleep quality in this study, which was lower than previous results. This could be due to the time of this study, which was conducted in January, 2021 when domestic epidemic tended to be stable. The situation of overstretched health systems has eased and works of frontline healthcare workers became more regular at that time. In addition, several existing studies have identified a few factors to be associated with sleep quality, including female, older age, divorced or separated marital status, lower educational level, and socioeconomic status (19) (20) (21) . Results of this study demonstrated that worse sleep quality was related to older age, which was consistent with previous studies (22) . Possible reasons may include supporting children, taking care of parents, and a higher risk of medical conditions. We also found that longer working years were associated with better sleep quality. This may be caused by the proficiency or higher position of people with longer working years. Moreover, for healthcare workers, due to rotating working hours and night work, their circadian rhythm can be easily disrupted and result in impaired sleep (23) . In keeping with previous findings, nurses were more likely to have bad sleep quality compared to hospital assistants or doctors because of their longer working hours, more night shifts, and heavy workload, especially during the pandemic. Besides, designated hospitals implemented a rotation system (working for 14 days and then following isolation of 14 days) during the epidemic. The greater intensity and longer hours of work than normal situation brought more pressure to frontline healthcare workers and influenced their sleep quality. So, interventions are really needed to improve sleep quality of frontline healthcare workers, particularly nurses. There were no significant differences in marital status or educational status, which need to be investigated further with a bigger sample.",

It should be noted that Tai Chi training can also improve frontline healthcare workers' sleep quality and anxiety symptoms that was proved in this study, expanding the applicability of Tai Chi effects in the crowd. Another point worth mentioning is that many studies showed that Tai Chi was helpful to people's mental health, but most of them compared it with a blank control group or could not figure out the differences between different methods (26, 27) . This study compared the effect of Tai Chi training and relaxation training, indicating that the effect of Tai Chi training in improving sleep quality and anxiety symptoms is probably better than relaxation training. Tai Chi, which is not equivalent to random relaxation training, is a full set of punches and gradually increases the intensity during the training. It is inherently a complex intervention composed of multiple components such as breathing, mindfulness, imagery, and psychosocial interactions (12) . Each of these components has potentially independent and synergistic therapeutic value. When practicing, our movement, breathing, and thought work together, promoting the function of human nervous system and coordinating the excitatory and inhibitory processes of the nervous system. All of these showed that Tai Chi training has its own irreplaceable advantages.",

Due to female participants accounting for 93% of the total participants, results of gender need to be discussed carefully. Second, after the experiment ended, no follow-up was performed. How long the training effect lasts is still unclear. Further studies are needed. Finally, Tai Chi has many styles, only one of them was trained in this study. More Tai Chi styles can be put into for comparison in future research.",
