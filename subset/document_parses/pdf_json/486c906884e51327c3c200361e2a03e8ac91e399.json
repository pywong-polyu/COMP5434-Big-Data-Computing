Antivirus medicines, antibiotics, and supportive care with various dose, duration, route, and combinations were applied to some patients based on their conditions. The finding of high mortality and the need for ICU care among the COVID-19-associated ARDS may be related to pre-existing respiratory diseases and inflammation [5] . The fatal complications of COVID-19, including PE, shock, cardiac failure, kidney injury, and MOF, further reduce the survival rate. In addition to WBC, increased plasma PTT and fibrinogen levels could signify a poor prognosis. Considering few adverse events associated with fibrinolytic therapy, early and the local application of tPA and others (i.e., uPA, plasminogen, plasmin) combined with precisely anti-inflammation interventions to target case-dependent cytokines and chemokines could improve the survival of COVID-19 patients with critically ARDS. By comparison, fibrinolytic therapy for COVID-19 patients without ARDS or other severe complications significantly improves the outcomes [2] . The main limitation of retrospective study was the scarcity of randomized controlled groups and standardized procedures for laboratory tests, clinical readouts, and fibrinolytic therapy. The randomized controlled trials designed to test the benefits of fibrinolytic therapy are recruiting patients. Nevertheless, this pooled study has implications for the stratification and prognosis of COVID-19-associated ARDS. , fibrinogen (c), and WBC (d) levels prior to fibrinolytic therapy were compared for four outcomes of all patients. The outcome without sufficient patients (n < 3) was removed for PTT (c) and WBC (d). The full names of abbreviations were described in Table 1 .",
