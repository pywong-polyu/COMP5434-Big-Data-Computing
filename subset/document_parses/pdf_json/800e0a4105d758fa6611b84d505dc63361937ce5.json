These recessions are unique, caused initially by supply disruptions, largely due to governmentimposed 'stay-in-shelter lockdowns'. These have interacted with falling incomes and demand, declining exports (and imports), collapsing commodity prices, shrinking travel and tourism, decreasing remittances and foreign exchange shortages. Highlighting implications for employment, wellbeing and development, it argues that governments need to design comprehensive relief measures and recovery policies to address short-term problems. These should prevent cash-flow predicaments from becoming full-blown solvency crises. Instead of returning to the status quo ante, developing countries' capacities and capabilities need to be enhanced to address long-term sustainable development challenges. Multilateral financial institutions should intermediate with financial sources at low cost to supplement the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights to lower borrowing costs for relief and recovery.",

Government responses have not only been diverse, but often poorly conceived due to the novel nature of the crises. Impacts have varied with the contagion and policy responses, 1 unhelped by often confusing, if not misleading metrics. 2 Such uncertainty is also reflected in the wide-ranging growth forecasts by major international organizations (e.g., OECD). 3 The International Monetary Fund (IMF 2020a) has recognized the 'Great Lockdown' as due to 'self-imposed' contractions, leading to the 'worst recession since the Great Depression'. Most low-income developing countries (LIDCs) are in a particularly difficult position to respond. In an IMF blog, Gurara et al. (2020) noted, 'growth in LIDCs is likely to come to a standstill this year, compared to growth of 5% in 2019. Further, absent a sustained international effort to support them, permanent scars are likely to harm development prospects, exacerbate inequality, and threaten to wipe out a decade of progress reducing poverty'.",

Petty businesses, like street vendors, are particularly hard hit as they do not have much in terms of financial buffers; hence, they are generally more critically dependent on daily cash flows. A May 2020 survey by the International Trade Centre expected one in four small businesses in developing countries to close permanently due to COVID-19 crises, and two-thirds of micro firms to be strongly affected, compared to 42% of large companies. 12 Before COVID-19 hit, 113 million more people on the planet were already struggling with severe acute food insecurity due to earlier shocks. 13 A joint report of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) warns that in 25 countries, hunger will rise to famine levels. According to the report (FAO-WFP 2020), more than 130 million people will suffer 'acute food insecurity' by the end of the year, bringing the world total to 265 million. WFP Director David Beasley warned in April that the world risked 'a famine of biblical proportions', warning 3 months later that 'the world's very poorest families have been forced even closer to the abyss'. 14 As COVID-19 spreads exponentially, there has also been far more concern about food supplies, with a renewed emphasis on food security, defined in terms of greater food production and self-sufficiency, as before the 1990s, rather than more recent redefinitions of food security. Far greater emphasis should be put on nutrition and food safety, especially excessive antibiotic use and extensive use of toxic agricultural chemicals, than concerns about reliance on food imports.",

Thus, a wide range of protagonists professing concern for developing countries' plight-from the President of the World Bank, some UN quarters and civil society activists, such as the Jubilee Debt Coalition 31 -understandably appealed for debt relief, cancellation and restructuring, even buybacks before the COVID-19 crisis.
