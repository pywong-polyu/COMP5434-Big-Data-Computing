After reaching the preliminarily stable state, the government and the scenic area management department implemented a series of incentive policies in order to speed up the recovery of the tourism industry. Therefore, analyzing all sorts of social effects after policy implementation is of guiding significance for the government and the scenic areas. Methods: Targeted as the social effect with the implementation of tourism promotion policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper briefly analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on the national cultural and tourism industry and selects several representative types of tourism policies, crawls the comment data of Weibo users, analyzes users' perception and emotional preference to the policy, and thus mines the social effect of various policies. Subsequently, by identifying the social effects of various policies as dependent variables, a binary logistic regression model is constructed to obtain the best combination of tourism promotion policies and promote the rapid revitalization of the cultural and tourism industry.",

Finally, this paper proposes suggestions for policy formulation to improve the ability of the cultural tourism industry to cope with crisis events. Conclusion: These results explain the perceived effects of the public on the government policies and can be used to judge whether the policies have been released in place. Based on the above results, corresponding suggestions are proposed as follows: 1) the combination of economic policies and security policies can achieve better results; and 2) the role of \"opinion leaders\" can be played to improve the perceived effect of policies.",

About 2 months after the enforcement of prevention and control, on February 25, the national culture and tourism office issued the guidance to lead the national scenic spots to implement the epidemic prevention and control to make recovery steadily. Meanwhile, local governments and scenic spots have issued a series of promoting policies, such as travel coupons, current limiting, 2.5-days off, which aims to stimulate recovery of the tourism industry while preventing COVID-19. However, the policies have received mixed reviews from netizens, who have focused on the safety issues brought about by the opening of scenic spots. For the government and scenic spots, the most concerning question is which kind of policies have the most obvious stimulating effect on the tourism economy.",

Alexander and Yusaku 9 took Japan as an example, and carried out a survey experiment to let citizens understand the policy information of the US, which varied according to the source, policy content, and problem prominence. The results showed that when the source signal (Trump attribution) led to negative views in the US, policy content (cooperative than uncooperative) had a greater impact on shaping the opinions of American citizens. Ho 10 analyzed the success factors of a convalescent tourism policy, and discussed the priority and importance of success factors of the recuperation tourism policy by using an AHP analysis method. Yin 11 redefined the theory of the political system based on the agenda setting theory in communication science, and constructed a \"network public opinion decision hypothesis model\" to analyze how and to what extent network public opinion affects government decisionmaking.

Kim et al 13 studied the \"free public transport\" policy and the \"citizen participation alternative day no driving\" system implemented by Seoul government in order to reduce dust. They adopted a regression analysis method to analyze the impact of traffic on fine dust, and used text mining technology to analyze the response of two traffic policies and citizens' petition, and proposed policy improvement direction according to the research results. Lee et al 14 used text mining technology and emotional text analysis technology to test the online evaluation of Japanese tourism websites after the 2011 Japanese tsunami, and studied the impact of the tsunami on Japan's tourism industry. The results show that the low exchange rate and the positive sentiment of online reviews from tourism websites have a positive impact on the number of tourists to Japan. Chen et al 15, 16 used text mining and emotion analysis methods to implement the effect of online education under the epidemic situation. Also, the experience effect was studied from the perspective of user and platform. Bucek 17 used text mining technology to investigate the twitter accounts of US President Barack Obama from March 2012 to January 2016, so as to study whether politicians' behavior on social networks would affect actual economic policy. Qi et al 18 analyzed the innovative fiscal policy texts of provinces and cities in China based on python, so as to understand the regulation and control of tax policies.

Sun 19 proposed an evaluation scheme to optimize the policy process by using sorting and clustering strategies, and proposed a combination algorithm combining the algorithm with policy priority evaluation. Finally, satisfactory policies and rules were selected to improve the matching speed. The experimental results showed that the method reduced the matching operation and improved the evaluation efficiency. Pellesova 20 discussed the technology of using an econometric method to optimize economic policy, mainly studied the target variable method, and explored the advantages and disadvantages of the selected method and its possible application in the formulation of optimal economic policy. Dash and Kajiji 21 proposed a mixed integer nonlinear objective program (MINLGP), which aimed to solve the model of multi-objective portfolio optimization decision-makers facing binary hedging decision-making between Portfolio Rebalancing periods. It was found that when percentile risk measurement was used, the expected catastrophic loss of the best diversified portfolio of hedging was obviously less than that of non hedging products. Yang et al 22 evaluated the impact of the recently implemented policy of improving gasoline quality on reducing the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM). The study illustrated that it was difficult to completely solve the particulate pollution problem in China by a single policy, and a series of policy system designs were needed to alleviate this problem. Geng and Kamal 23 analyzed the optimal policy options for two main types of price regulation in China, and found that the domestic optimal external reference pricing (ERP) policy reduced domestic prices while maintaining export incentives for enterprises. Maansi and Nomesh 24 measured the efficiency of Indian high courts using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Secondly, they studied the impact of including pending cases on judicial efficiency. Kelly et al 25 proposed a composite index to assess home-heating energy-poverty risk across 18,641 small area clusters in Ireland. The index offered the capacity to analyze changes in energy-poverty risk associated with specific policy intervention proposals, including major contemporary environmental policy transitions. Elke and Andreas 26 examined the acceptance of burden sharing rules by using multivariate binary and ordered Probit models. The rule involved the costs of the German energy transition, which was one of the most challenging and disputed national climate and energy policy measures. The results declared that polluter-pays rule had by far the highest support. Carlotta et al 27 used Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees algorithms to predict the response of freshwater ecosystems to multiple anthropogenic pressures, with the goal of informing the definition of water policy targets and management measures to recover and protect aquatic biodiversity. Ekaterina et al 28 confirmed a positive impact of the zone merger on the gas trading market's spatial equilibrium and indicated the causes of remaining market inefficiencies used by an extended parity bounds model, which provided a tool for evaluating the efficiency of policy decision-making. Dong and Liu 29 analyzed the optimal functioning power of policies and determined the direction of future policy implementation. This paper utilized the COPA framework to analyze policy evolution in respect of the new-energy vehicle industry (NEVI). Smith and Hasan 30 discussed the methods and practices involved in quantitative evaluations of implementation research studies, and analyzed available measurement methods for common quantitative implementation outcomes involved in such an evaluation-adoption, fidelity, implementation cost, reach, and sustainment, and the sources of such data for these metrics using established taxonomies and frameworks.",

The economy category refers to the policy-makers' expectation to achieve the purpose of promoting the economy through the policy, such as \"consumption coupon\". The safety category refers to the policies formulated by policy-makers to avoid crowd gathering and virus crossinfection in scenic spots from the perspective of safety, such as \"Scenic spot policy\", \"Huangshan crowded\", and \"Travel around China online\". The idle category refers to the policy made by the policymaker from the perspective of whether tourists have free time to travel, such as \"2.5 days off a week\". The feasible category refers to whether the scenic spot is open, such as \"Resuming tourism industry\", \"Resuming inter-provincial travel\". Although policymakers formulate from the above four perspectives, different netizens have different understanding of policy. Taking coupon for example, some netizens consider it from an economy perspective, and point out that \"in order to stimulate consumption, various places think about the different ways\". From a safety perspective, some netizens think \"it will lead to offline congestion, which is not safe\". Therefore, in order to understand netizens' perception of the four types of policies, we divided netizen comments into five types according to their comment content and designated tag numbers for subsequent data processing.

Under the \"economy\" policy, 46.78% of netizens held a positive attitude, while only 15.06% hold a negative attitude, indicating that most netizens held a positive attitude in support of the policy. It can be seen from the \"feasible\" policy that the number of people holding positive emotions in this policy is much higher than the number of people holding negative emotions, by more than 30%, indicating that this policy is supported by the masses.",

Here, in order to obtain the major concerns of the public under each type of policy, semantic network visual analysis was adopted to analyze the online comment data of the four policies under the background of COVID-19. The semantic network is one of the representations of an artificial intelligence program, which expresses human knowledge construction in the form of a network. It consists of arcs between nodes, where nodes represent concepts (events or things), and arcs represent relationships between them. The semantic network diagram is used to represent the degree of association between words and reflect the most concerned words in user comments. The main purpose is to find the words that are mentioned most in netizens' comments, so as to judge whether people perceive the content of the policy. By ROST CM5.8.0 analysis, a relevant semantic network diagram can be obtained. Figures 1-7 represent the semantic network diagram of user comment content under each travel topic, and represent the relationship between words in each user comment content.",

If fewer independent variables are introduced, the regression equation will not be able to explain the changes of dependent variables in an accurate manner, but it does not mean that more independent variables are absolutely better. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt some strategies to control the independent variables by introducing regression equations. The Stepwise Selection method is adopted here, that is, the introduction threshold of P-value is tested according to the significance of the set regression coefficient, independent variables are introduced into the model one by one, then P-values of all coefficients in the model are recalculated, and variables are screened according to the set elimination threshold. The Stepwise Selection method includes forward selection method and backward selection method. The forward selection method is relatively simple, but the biggest disadvantage is that if there is multicollinearity, the final model may be mixed with less important independent variables. The backward selection method is more conservative in terms of information. The backward selection method is chosen in this article. Data processing was conducted in SPSS25.0 software, and the significance level of entering the model was set at 0.05, and the significance level of removing or retaining variables was also set at 0.05. The main steps of regression analysis are as follows: using LR Likelihood Method to select the independent variables with a significant relationship between public perception effect, conduct significance test for the variable regression coefficient and model to get binary logistics regression equation between each variable and dependent (Continued) variable, and test the prediction accuracy of the overall model. The following is a detailed introduction to the regression analysis of the public perception effect under the \"economy\" tourism policy, and the regression analysis process of the remaining 13 tourism policy combinations can be similarly obtained. The regression model construction process of the public perception effect under the \"economy\" tourism policy is illustrated as an example. Based on the comment data of \"economy\" policy obtained above, SPSS was used for binary logistics regression. After eliminating the independent variable X 1 which could not be introduced, the independent variable could be selected and the results were shown in Table 7 , the value of regression coefficient of each variable was shown in Table 8 , and the model regression statistical results were shown in Tables 9 and 10. 1. Generally speaking, the significance level is to estimate the probability of wrong parameter within a certain interval. When the original hypothesis is true and represented by \u03b1, the probability of rejecting the original hypothesis is usually 0.05. When the decision to accept the original hypothesis is made, the probability of its correctness is 95%. It can be seen from Table 7 that in the selection of independent variables, the significance level Sig.<0.05 is X 2 for the timeliness of comment release, the number of attention is X 8 , and the development level of COVID-19 is X 10 . Therefore, there is a significant relationship between the public perception of \"economy\" policies and these three variables, so Step1 a 540.505",

If the \"safety policies + feasible policies\" and \"economy policies + safety policies\" can be released together, people's perceptions are 92.2%, 89.3%, followed by the \"economy + safety + feasible policies\", which is 88.5%.",

By means of online travel, people lower their travel frequency while keeping their enthusiasm for travel consumption after COVID-19. Moreover, during the epidemic period, the safety of the tourism environment is the most concerned and worried issue. The most fundamental problem for the revitalization of the tourism industry is to control the development of the domestic epidemic. After the security is guaranteed, the \"economy\" and \"feasible\" policies will be released at the same time, which can promote the revitalization of the tourism industry. As for the \"economy\" policy, it is mainly to issue tourism coupon, while the \"feasible\" policy is to open major tourist attractions or to resume inter-provincial travel. Only when the tourist attractions start to operate normally, can people use tourism coupon to recover the tourism industry through scenic spot consumption.",

This is because if the government does not release the information of epidemic development situation nor the safety measures for travel, people are not interested in traveling. Before safety is guaranteed, the effect of policy is poor. Based on this, it is suggested that the government should report the development of epidemic situation at home and abroad in real time, as well as the relevant safety measures taken in tourist attractions or the process of tourism in the content of the revitalization of tourism policy, so as to ensure more obvious social effects after the release of the policy.",

In the top five optimized policy combinations, the greater the X 9 of Internet users is, the stronger the perception about policy is, the greater the effect of policy implementation brings. The activeness of netizens is the original Weibo released by netizens. Generally speaking, the more active a netizen is on Weibo, the greater his personal influence will be, and the stronger the effect of network public opinion will be caused. For government departments, if they want to expand the social effects brought by the policies, they can forward the policies through \"opinion leaders\" on Weibo to let more people know the contents of the policies, promote tourism consumption, and drive the tourism economy. 4) From Table 11 , except for the \"idle + feasible\", \"economy\", \"economy + safety\" policy, opinion tendency degree X 3 impacts on the effect of different policy combination. X 3 regression equation coefficient shows that each type of policy combination regression coefficients is above 0.9, indicating that X 3 had a greater influence on the effect of the policy implementation. This is because after the release of policy, netizens hold positive, negative, or neutral attitudes, which affects the tendency of public opinion. If the policy is released, \"opinion leaders\" hold negative attitudes, which will not be conducive to policy implementation and cause rejection on the network platform. Therefore, after the release of policy, government should control trend of public opinion, timely stop bad happens so as to play the positive impact of policies.",

For the tourism industry, it is necessary to carry out the corresponding assessment, prevention, and treatment, and handle the tourism crisis properly, which not only requires scientific decision-making and precise measures by the government, but also requires the joint efforts of scenic spot practitioners. According to the analysis of this paper, the public's perception of \"safety\" policies is the strongest. Only when tourists perceive that it is safe to travel can the cultural and tourism industry gradually resume work and production. Based on this, the government should timely issue a \"safety\" policy after the initial stability of the epidemic. For example, on February 25, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued a \"Guide to Prevention and Control Measures for Reopening of Tourist Attractions\", which enables tourists to perceive that the government encourages the cultural and tourism industry to resume work and production, and it is relatively safe to travel in the current environment. In addition, the government can issue a series of advocacy policies, such as advocating industry associations to strengthen the safety and supervision of epidemic prevention and control, and guiding scenic spots to actively participate in relevant work; Secondly, the scenic spot should issue a series of effective and feasible prevention and control policies to ensure safety, such as implementing a series of policies in terms of limiting the capacity of tourists, keeping social distance between tourists, regularly disinfecting all scenic spots, and requiring tourists to wear face masks.",
