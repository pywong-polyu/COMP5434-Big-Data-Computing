According to a recent study by Ehwerhemuepha and colleagues, children older than five and adults aged 18e78 years with previous diagnoses of malnutrition were found to have higher odds of severe COVID-19 than those with no history of malnutrition in the same age groups [4] . Malnutrition may also prolong hospital stays, which may lead to a poor quality of life and additional morbidity [5] . Doctors are part of a multidisciplinary team that provides nutritional support and takes overall responsibility for the clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients [6] . Since there are limited effective antiviral drugs, safe cost-effective nutritional support is a helpful way to strengthen patients' immune systems and fight off the coronavirus [1,7e9] . However, medical students often do not receive adequate nutritional education, and a lack of nutritional knowledge among clinicians is recognized as a global phenomenon [10e14] . A systematic review analyzing 24 studies concluded that nutrition is insufficiently incorporated into medical education, and limited nutritional education affects medical students' knowledge, skills, and confidence in providing high-quality, effective nutritional care [10] . As one-third of COVID-19 patients experience >5% weight loss during their hospital stay [2] , failure to convert nutritional knowledge into practice may result in increased morbidity and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [15] .",

However, little is known about barriers that affect doctors' implementation of and adherence to COVID-19 nutritional guidelines and whether adherence to guidelines affects the health outcomes of COVID-19 patients. It is also unknown whether the pandemic has affected doctors' attitudes toward adherence to nutritional guidelines. For example, Indonesia is recorded as the currently the most affected country by the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, and it has the fifth highest observed case-fatality ratio (3.0% per 100 confirmed cases) [18, 19] . On the other hand, with only 1651 confirmed coronavirus cases and 35 deaths, Vietnam is ranked as one of the world's best-performing countries in its response to the pandemic. Hence, the broad aim of this study was to investigate barriers to doctors' adherence to nutritional guidelines in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Asian countries with high (Indonesia) and low (Vietnam) numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Specific aims were [1] to understand the practical challenges and concerns in providing medical nutritional therapy and [2] the prognostic potential of adherence to nutritional guidelines (guideline knowledge, attitudes, and environmental factors) on the clinical outcomes (indicated by the length of stay and mortality) of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",

Invitation emails were sent directly to the administrative leaders of ICUs and pulmonary and infectious departments of COVID-19-designated hospitals in Indonesia (n \u00bc 35 hospitals) and Vietnam (n \u00bc 19 hospitals). The administrative leaders were chosen and contacted by the research contributors (HSN, DFI) through social media groups of the Indonesia Medical Association and Vietnam Physician Association networks. In total, 24 doctors from 14 hospitals in Indonesia and 27 doctors from 6 hospitals in Vietnam completed the online questionnaire. The hospital response rate was 31.4/% (Indonesia: 31.4% and Vietnam: 31.6%), and the overall participant response rate was 17% (Indonesia: 10% and Vietnam: 23%). Out of 14 participating hospitals in Indonesia, 12 were located in Jakarta and Java Island, which had substantial higher COVID-19 cases compared to other regions in Indonesia. In addition, 7 participating hospitals were designated hospitals for COVID-19 by the Indonesia Ministry of Health. All of 11 participating hospitals in Vietnam were designated hospitals for COVID-19 by the Vietnam Ministry of Health. Out of six participating hospitals, 4 are central hospitals according to Ministry of Health administrative structure's classification and 2 are the field hospitals according to which were set up for only COVID-19 patients. Details about hospitals according to administrative structure were provided in the Supplementary Table 3 .",

These results agreed with recent studies showing that adherence to guidelines by practitioners improved the health outcomes and survival rates of cancer patients [22, 23] . Despite continuous efforts to improve doctors' guideline adherence, guideline nonadherence is still a major concern across all medical fields [24] . Guideline nonadherence is often intentional and supported by valid reasons, such as applicability of guidelines, lack of agreement with guideline recommendations, contraindications, and patient preferences [25] . Our results indicated that the key barrier for doctors' guideline adherence was a lack of nutritional knowledge, not attitudes (e.g., feeling stress) or environmental factors (e.g., budget concerns). Almost half of participants (Vietnam: 48%, Indonesia: 42%) thought there was a lack of clear COVID-19 nutritional guidelines as well as a lack of self-efficacy/selfconfidence in performing medical nutritional therapy (Vietnam: 56%, Indonesia: 42%). Hence, inadequate nutritional education and knowledge, together with a lack of agreement on guideline recommendations, are likely to explain doctors' guideline nonadherence for COVID-19 patients. The importance of adequate nutritional support cannot be underestimated, since supportive care appears as first-line treatment and COVID-19 patients may develop malnutrition during hospitalization [26, 27] . Our study highlights the need for healthcare organizations to implement nutritional education curriculum initiatives that might improve doctors' adherence to nutritional guidelines and benefit the healthy outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",

Indonesia is one of the country's most highly affected by COVID-19, with a high case-fatality ratio (3.0% per 100 confirmed cases) [18, 19] . This suggests that Indonesia is facing severe capacity constraints, and there is a continual need to enhance critical care capacity. In contrast, Vietnam has had only 1651 coronavirus cases and 35 deaths (data through December 31, 2020). It is tempting to assume that Indonesian doctors have been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, making it difficult to adhere to nutritional guidelines in clinical practice [28] . Another potential factor contributing to regional differences in guideline adherence is the specialty of the doctors, which may be related to differences in the healthcare systems. Our study found that compared to other specialties (e.g., pulmonary/infectious disease), ICU doctors exhibited the best guideline adherence due in part to better nutritional knowledge. Since 86.6% of ICU doctors who participated in the current study were Vietnamese doctors, national differences in guideline adherence and guideline knowledge are likely to be influenced by a doctor's specialization. In Indonesia's healthcare system, doctors who care for critically ill patients specialized in pulmonary or infectious disease, not ICU care, and dietitians, not physicians, are in charge of nutritional support for ICU patients. In contrast, Vietnamese doctors are the ones in charge of nutritional therapy for ICU patients. Hence, the lack of nutrition knowledge among Indonesian participants can likely be explained by differences in the institutional structures of the healthcare systems. Nutritional support is an integral part of COVID-19 treatment, especially in those who are critically ill [29] .

            "text": "Length of stay Mortality p-value support in critically ill patients requires specific knowledge and skills to prevent poor clinical outcomes [30] . This may explain our results indicating that doctors who specialized in ICU care had the highest scores of guideline adherence and guideline knowledge. However, we also found that ICU doctors had lower outcome expectations toward nutritional therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This is consistent with a study by Ami et al., which showed that there was a lack of outcome expectancy among ICU physicians regarding the initiation and management of nutrition in ICU patients, but not in the Covid-19 setting [31] . In addition, the current study found that 94% of ICU doctors reported \"feeling stress when performing nutritional care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients\". With the ongoing pandemic, healthcare workers are burned out and suffering from psychological symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, and insomnia), which may affect their motivation to implement nutritional guidelines [32, 33] . The COVID-19 pandemic has increased burnout symptoms in ICU professionals [34] . Higher burnout rates were also reported among Turkish ICU professionals, who were in the front line combating COVID-19 [35] . A lack of nutritional education in medical training has been underscored as a major obstacle for doctors performing nutritional care [36, 37] . The current study found that Indonesian and Vietnamese doctors only received one or two nutrition credits in their medical curriculum. Another study revealed that doctors are less likely to include nutritional support in their care plans if they have inadequate nutritional knowledge or low confidence in nutritional therapy [38] . We found that nearly half (49%) of doctors we questioned felt a lack of self-efficacy/self-confidence in performing medical nutritional therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients despite agreeing (100%) on the role of nutritional support in COVID-19 patients. Our results are consistent with numerous studies reporting that doctors agreed on the importance of nutritional therapy but did not feel comfortable or adequately prepared to provide nutritional counseling to their patients [39e41]. For example, it was reported that nutritional counseling occurred in only one-fourth of all office visits to Australian physicians, although most of the physicians felt it was their responsibility to provide nutritional counseling [41] . Doctors' nutritional knowledge can be improved by incorporating more nutritional education during their medical training or implementing nutrition educational curriculum initiatives at the institution level (e.g., hospitals) [20] .",

            "text": "The strength of this study includes its novelty, being the first to investigate barriers affecting doctors' nutritional guideline adherence in COVID-19 patients, and being a multinational survey of countries facing high and low numbers of COVID-19 cases. The present study also had several limitations. First, there was a relatively small sample size (n \u00bc 51) of only two countries in Southeast Asia. We recognized that our study with small sample size may not provide a complete picture of nutrition practice in Indonesia and Vietnam or other countries during Covid-19 outbreak. The low response rate in our study is, due in part, to the exclusion of doctors who never performed nutritional care for hospitalized Covid-19 patients and the high workload of doctors in the pandemic. The study was conducted at the second wave of the outbreak in Vietnam when the number of patients, symptomatic patients, and deaths was limited. Moreover, Indonesian hospitals are overwhelmed by COVID-19 that makes doctors refuse to do our survey. Second, limitations of online surveys have been noted and extensively discussed potential issues such as response bias and interpretation must be taken into account [15] . The major strengths of the online survey were its cost-effectiveness and the fact that it could be conducted in a short period of time with no regional restrictions; however, there are concerns with internet accessibility, a lack of controlled sampling, response rates, and ethical issues (e.g., consent, anonymity, confidentiality) [15] . Nonetheless, an online survey was likely the best solution to collect data in the context of social distancing and nationwide lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the limitation of qualitative research and exploratory study during pandemic, we couldn't assess the standard of care of treatment in the different clinical settings as well as which targets were used by the doctors when delivering nutritional care, hence it is not easy to give strength to the observed differences between groups. Moreover, our study provided insight into doctor's adherence to current Covid-19 nutritional guidelines, we acknowledged that this statement does not necessarily reflect implementation of nutritional care. Respondents may have interpreted the definitions of guidelines, protocols and clinical pathways differently. While we found statistically significant relationship between guideline adherence and clinical outcome, the nature and extent of these differences in practice and their influence on clinician adherence to guidelines remains uncertain. Considering the limitations of self-administered survey methods, enriched understanding of these issues could be obtained through qualitative research.",
