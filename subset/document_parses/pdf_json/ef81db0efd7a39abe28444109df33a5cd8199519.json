However, the majority of currently used apps in different universities around the world are limited in their features and not very popular among students who may suffer to get useful information using traditional guiding methods. However, the importance of these apps is constantly increasing, especially in times of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic during which people were forced to work from home and the human interaction was reduced to its minimal degree. In this paper, we present a Student Interactive Assistant Android Application with Chatbot (SIAAA-C), which is basically a personal electronic guide that is used by students to get various and effective academic services.",

Even more, SIAAA-C was designed to have Arabic and English interfaces to be used in the University of Jordan (UoJ), which has one of the biggest campuses in the Arabic area with more than 40,000 local and foreign students. Moreover, SIAAA-C was practically tested in a real-life environment by a group of UoJ students who were selected from different faculties during the pandemic peak period and the feedbacks were very promising, based on the outcomes of an evaluation survey that was answered by 102 students after a 1-month test period.",

            "text": "Being a student in a big university can sometimes be a real challenge. In fact, higher education institutes usually expect their students to show a high degree of independency and maturity by being responsible for managing their academic lives' details and performing daily tasks by themselves like finding the location of a specific lecture, reaching any facility they want to use, contacting an instructor during the designated office hours, and selecting next semester courses and lectures' times wisely during the registration period. As a matter of fact, most universities usually provide their students with a number of assisting tools to guide them through various academic situations and to answer their questions accurately [12] . Nowadays, every university has an official website to help visitors from all over the world to get any details they need about its programs, acceptance policies, fees, and other topics. Besides, the website can be used by the students to get information about the university regulations, academic staff contact info, details of different types of activities, maps for different locations inside the campus, and even answering students' questions about different issues by a dedicated team of employees [11] . However, a university's website may not be easy to navigate through due to its complicated and very detailed menus in addition to the usually late responses to students' queries, which makes its usage very limited as a student assistance tool. Also, every instructor is usually assigned as an academic supervisor or counselor to a group of students to respond to their queries and provide different academic consultations to them. This assisting tool may be very useful for students but also limited to certain areas and available during certain hours only, because every supervisor is usually connected to tens of students and cannot be available to each of them all the time [13] . Even more, it is very common in most universities that senior students volunteer in guiding teams to help freshmen during the registration period and give them tours inside the campus [1] . Although these initiatives can be very useful, they are usually seasonal and may be used by some seniors to serve certain political reasons.",

Figure 1 shows the increment in smartphone users worldwide between the years 2014 and 2020, which clearly reflects the growing importance of these gadgets in our lives. Actually, these computerized devices with their accompanying applications (apps) are being used in every life aspect you can think of to cover all age ranges and work fields [14, 31, 32] . Nowadays, we can find dedicated apps for online shopping, contacting people in other countries, and even learning a new language [3, 4, 24] . Moreover, many apps are being used to help young people to learn different skills [7, 8, 21, 30] and people with special needs to overcome their difficulties [5, 16, 17, 28, 33] . According to that, it was only a matter of time to start seeing universities around the world developing dedicated apps to be used by their students as daily assistance tools due to their availability all the time to automate the guiding process and save human resources [18] . These apps can come in different forms ranging from a general and simple students' guide with limited features to a more complex interactive learning tool with advanced features like smart chatbots and financial services [10] . In fact, most of currently used apps in universities are limited in their features with poor designs and inflexible interfaces, which makes them less popular among students than expected and reduces the benefits gained by adopting them.",

In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and then officially called this disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) in February 2020 [42] . By August 7, 2020, there were more than 18 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 709 thousand deaths, with the absence of an efficient cure, which led the whole world to deal with a delicate situation [39] . Figure 2 shows an exponential increment of infections worldwide in the period between January 1 and July 31, 2020. Actually, this pandemic has affected the whole world by putting it in a mandatory quarantine to reduce the human interaction to the least possible amount and control the rapid spread of this virus. As a result, the majority of human activities were forced to temporarily shut down and most people had to work from home. The field of higher education was not an exception where most universities around the world closed their campuses and replaced the traditional learning methods with online learning using different software tools and applications. Naturally, this sudden transfer caused a confusion for both administrative staff and students in most universities where a lot of regulations had to be modified according to the new situation. Moreover, the administrative staff was unable to response to the enormous flood of questions and queries sent by students regarding different topics. As a result, providing different automated tools that respond to different queries instantly and accurately became a necessity during the pandemic period and beyond.",

Besides, the pandemic itself has increased the necessity of presenting apps similar to ours, as the whole world has adopted the online learning path that is here to stay. Finally, our biggest motive was to try to fill the obvious gap of not having any efficient Arabic chatbots in all Arabic universities apps and websites.

Actually, smartphones allow users to access different apps at any time and from different places in the case of Internet connection availability [34] . This fits completely with our app description, which was designed to be used at any time by UoJ students inside or outside the campus. Moreover, Android is the most popular operating systems among smartphone users in Jordan, based on different studies [33] . As a result, our obvious choice was to build SIAAA-C as an Android smartphone app to reach the majority of UoJ students. However, our app is expected to be very dependable, as it is related to critical academic information and includes many important and sensitive features like reminding students regarding lectures' and exams' dates and times. As our app is meant to be used by university students, we had to carefully consider every aspect in the app's design to create a user-friendly and attractive interface. For example, the colors and button sizes were selected to deliver a feeling of comfort and relaxation. Moreover, the screens are simple, direct, and easy to use. We think that our graphical user interface is very convenient for all students who may have different skill levels regarding high technology and smartphones usage. Figure 6 shows the general design of our app where a student can use android smartphones with Internet connection to access SIAAA-C and get benefits from the features included in it. The access to all the students' personal details in addition to related courses' and instructors' information is gained through a Firebase database that does not require using any dedicated servers and does not cause any delay. Finally, the student will be able to send different types of queries to a built-in interactive chatbot, which will be discussed in detail soon. Firebase database stores data in the form of nodes [40] . Figure 7 shows a Firebase screen with a number of node types used in our database like Chatbot, Questions, Schedule, and Users. Other used nodes include courses, absence records, maps, and many more. A Users node contains a specific student's personal information, as the figure shows, like name, current grade point average (GPA), ID, email, faculty, specialty, counselor name, and current schedule.",

To build an efficient chatbot, we had to store all the expected students' questions in the database along with their expected answers to match them with any incoming queries. Figure 8 shows a flow diagram that explains the procedure followed by the chatbot in response to different students' queries. When a student sends a query to the chatbot, it will be checked first to find if it exists as a stored question in the database or not. When no matching question is found to a specific query, the chatbot sends back a message to the student, declaring that it does not have an appropriate answer for that query, which in turn will be stored in the database to be processed later. However, if an incoming query has a matching question stored in the database, it will be treated based on its type as a static or nonstatic query. A static query does not require any variables or additional entries and has the same answer for all students like, for example, asking about specific instructor office hours.",

Actually, the nonstatic query in SIAAA-C is related to suggesting a new semester course schedule for a student based on his/ her academic situation. As a response to this query, the chatbot will ask the student to enter his/her current GPA, academic year, and the number of successfully passed credit hours to suggest the most convenient schedule based on these factors. First, if a student's GPA F I G U R E 6 SIAAA-C system design F I G U R E 7 SIAAA-C nodes in a Firebase screen with a Users node example containing a student's (Abeer) personal information SWEIDAN ET AL. | 7 F I G U R E 8 SIAAA-C chatbot flow diagram is below 2.0, the chatbot will suggest a schedule that includes repeating any previously failed courses, if existing, and taking a number of basic elective courses with a maximum load of 15 credit hours or less to raise the student's GPA and avoid any possible academic penalties in the future. Second, if a student's GPA is 2.0 or more and the number of the successfully passed credit hours is less than the suggested number by the indicative plan for his/her current academic year, the chatbot will then suggest a schedule with the maximum allowed number of credit hours in one semester, which is 18 in UoJ regulations, for example. Finally, for a student with a GPA over 2.0 and a normal number of passed credit hours, the chabot will simply suggest a course schedule based on his/her current case by following the indicative plan and the current academic year.",

To build a useful and realistic chatbot, we tried to collect most of the expected queries with the help of UoJ students by asking them about the academic and daily questions they usually have. After a 1-month data collection period through visiting different UoJ faculties personally and publishing a related survey online, the students' preferences were as the following: instructors' office hours and contact info, courses study resources, courses outlines, suggested schedule for next semester, and the location of different places inside the campus. Next, we have processed the collected questions by classifying them into smaller categories, removing any possible redundancies, and finally writing an answer for every question and store it in our database.",

Key words in a stored question include all of its important words and exclude a number of conjunction words like The, And, A, An, Or, in addition to other words.

The 50% value was selected based on practical observations by noticing that the queries with this accuracy rate or less matching questions do not usually receive logical answers to them. Next, when the Chabot database node is checked by the app administrator, each of the queries with no match will be processed by forwarding it to the convenient employee to be answered. Then, all of the newly processed queries will be added to the database Questions node in the form of stored questions along with their answers, so that the chatbot will be able to respond accurately to them the next time they are being received as queries. This feature is called the context saving and it adds a lot of reliability to the chatbot. It is worth mentioning here that we have tried in our work to cover all the expected queries the students may have through the intensive data collection period. However, there is always a chance for receiving a query with no match. We believe that with the continuous usage of SIAAA-C, almost all possible queries will be answered accurately and the chance of getting a no match query will be very rare. Actually, our latest tests gained a 92% correct response rate for incoming queries in both languages after receiving more than 250 irredundant questions.

As a result, the next time a student asks about Dr. Mousa Kamel information, a matching stored question will be found and a valid response message will be sent.",

Depending on Ahmad answers, the chatbot suggests the schedule appearing in Figure 19 , which consists of 13 credit hours only. The proposed schedule includes three previously failed courses, one elective course, and one laboratory only. The reason for suggesting this schedule is obviously to help Ahmad raise his GPA over 2.0 through replacing the low grades gained in failed courses with the repetition ones. Moreover, trying to get a high grade in the elective course is usually a very doable task, which justifies suggesting it in the proposed schedule. However, reducing the number of credit hours to 13 in this schedule aims to help Ahmad concentrate efforts on raising his GPA to avoid any academic penalties. For receiving the lowest GPA, the least number of credit hours are suggested by the chatbot.",

In this case, the suggested schedule consists of 16 credit hours including five courses and one credit hour laboratory, which is a logical semester load for a normal student.

In fact, all the features provided by SIAAA-C have been carefully chosen based on the feedbacks we gained from a random group of UoJ students whom we asked to fill a description form we prepared to define a useful students' assistant app. Actually, these feedbacks were very useful to us during the design phase to come out with an initial version of the app. After that, SIAAA-C has been modified multiple times depending on the continuous responses gained by small test groups, reaching the final version described in this paper. Moreover, SIAAA-C was launched in UoJ for a 1-month test period during the second semester of the academic year 2019/2020. Actually, the students' responses to SIAAA-C were very encouraging, which has motivated us to authenticate them in a statistical way in the form of an assessment survey. In fact, the survey we prepared consisted of 13 questions that measure different aspects regarding students' assistant apps in general and SIAAA-C in particular. Moreover, the survey was distributed 2 weeks after launching the final app version to give the students a sufficient amount of time to test all the features included in it and get realistic answers to the included questions at the end of the test period. The survey was filled using MS forms by 102 students distributed over five different faculties, as revealed by the numbers in Table 2 .",

As a result, F I G U R E 17 (a) English sample queries and (b) Arabic sample queries the UoJ campus was closed for the majority of 2019-2020 second semester, which had both positive and negative sides regarding our work. On the one hand, closing of UoJ campus has affected our SIAAA-C test plans and reduced the test period length and the total number of app users along with the number of survey participants as well. On the other hand, the pandemic has created an additional motive for our work and noticeably increased the importance of providing an automated tool that is available round the clock to answer different students' queries and reduce the enormous load on the administrative staff. Interestingly, the analysis of the survey has revealed a high degree of similarity in the answers gained by different faculties' students. This observation may suggest that UoJ students in general have a good knowledge of technology, which makes SIAAA-C a very useful tool for the majority of them, regardless to their specialties. Moreover, this similarity may also suggest that our app is a user-friendly tool and can be used without any problems. Actually, having both Arabic and English interfaces may be a reason for the last conclusion, because language will not be an obstacle for users any more. Table 3 , however, shows the survey results from which we can conclude that the feedbacks were very positive in general and most of the users were satisfied with the features included in the app and its general design. In more detail, we can notice that four in every five students have used one university app at least before SIAAA-C according to Question 1, which shows that most of our participants have a previous experience in this area. Moreover, Question 2 reveals that less than 30% of our test group participants have said that the university apps they used before were useful to them, which reflects a low degree of satisfaction. However, the concept of chatbot is considered familiar to 63.7% of our participants, which may be justified with the limited usage of this component in many daily life apps. Questions 4 shows that the majority of students prefer to interact with a chatbot in Arabic, which implies that our choice to provide SIAAA-C and its chatbot in both Arabic and English languages was logical and justified. Moreover, Question 5 has revealed that the majority of our test F I G U R E 18 Two queries without valid responses F I G U R E 19 A suggested course schedule for a student with a low GPA sample has considered the notifications feature in SIAAA-C as a useful addition in general with a debatable degree of satisfaction among them. One of the most pleasant results was that 74.5% of students found the course schedule suggested by the chatbot useful to them (question 6), because it is considered as one of the most important features included in this app. Moreover, Question 7 shows also a high satisfaction degree regarding static queries responses in general. Actually, we believe that with continuous SIAAA-C usage and updating the database regularly, the users will be more and more satisfied with the responses they receive for different queries.",

Question 10 suggests that SIAAA-C is a user-friendly app with more than 90% of students having no problems at all while using it during the test period.

This result was not a surprise to us, as we planned from the beginning to present a human interaction-free tool that is able to provide instant and accurate services to students and reduce the load on administrative staff in UoJ. In fact, the previous result may be strongly related to question 12 result, which shows that more than 80% of the survey participants have preferred SIAAA-C chatbot responses to different queries over the human ones in terms of time and accuracy during UoJ campus closing period due to COVID-10 pandemic.",

SIAAA-C is a personal electronic guide that was developed to be used by the students of UoJ or any other university to help them getting different academic services. The services included in the app include showing the personal information of a student along with the current schedule, enabling different types of notifications as reminders for lectures, exams, absences, and general announcements, using a map to reach different locations inside or near UoJ campus, and providing a very useful interactive query system in the form of a built in chatbot. The chatbot was built to interact with different queries ranging from simple questions like asking about a specific instructor's email to more complex ones like asking for a suggested course schedule based on the student's academic situation. Moreover, SIAAA-C has both Arabic and English interfaces and its chatbot can respond to queries written in both languages to make the app usable by local and Arabic students in addition to thousands of foreign students who are enrolled in UoJ. The app was launched to be tested by students in a number of UoJ schools during the second semester of the academic year 2019-2020 when the campus was closed due to COVID-19 pandemic and the feedbacks of most users were very positive. We think that the current worldwide pandemic has confirmed the importance and the necessity of SIAAA-C and similar apps in all higher education institutes around the world. Moreover, we have conducted an evaluation survey that was answered by 102 active users distributed over five faculties and the responses were very encouraging with a number of useful notes to take into consideration. Finally, our future work includes expanding the app by adding new languages, creating iOS and website versions, and contacting UoJ administration to adopt it officially as a student assistant app for UoJ students.
