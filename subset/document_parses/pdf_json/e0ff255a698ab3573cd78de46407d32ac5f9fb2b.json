During the post-isolation period there was an increase in number of retrievals for diseases of the circulatory system and for neoplasms, however a reduction for respiratory disease, and skin conditions.

While many of our patients would not be considered old, with a median age of 52 years old, many of the retrievals were for endocrine disease, and specifically uncontrolled diabetes. Many of these patients come from rural and remote areas, which also have high rates of metabolic syndrome. 18 Uncontrolled diabetes, or chronic hyperglycaemia, negatively affects the immune system increasing morbidity and mortality due to increased infection risk and organic complications. 19 For example, those with Influenza A (H1N1) and diabetes, have triple the risk of hospitalization and quadruple the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission once hospitalized. 20 It is likely that COVID-19 infection coupled with diabetes would have similar rates, 20 as the mortality rates in China indicate that 42.3% of their COVID-19 deaths had diabetes. 21 A striking finding was that there were significantly more infant patients retrieved for congenital malformations of the circulatory system during the lockdown period, most requiring a IHT from a rural area to a large metropolitan hospital mainly for cardiac surgery and congenital heart defects. This was due to limitations with accessing local cardiac surgeons/ units. There is limited data that details the effects that COVID-19 has on the paediatric population, due to less than 1% of hospitalised cases to date being children younger than 10 years old. 22 While children seem less vulnerable to severe COVID-19, 23 those with congenital malformations are likely to have worse COVID-19 outcomes. 23 During the lockdown period there were less aeromedical PE and IHT transfers for cancer, increasing significantly post-lockdown.

The lockdown period provided many challenges associated with cancer patient safety, specifically that patients would need to leave their homes and thus would expose themselves to infection. 24 Cancer treatment in itself predisposes patients to the more serious effects of COVID-19. For example, a recent study found that patients with cancer are at a greater risk of death and/or intensive care unit admission (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.8-16.2). 25 Oncologists were required to weigh the risks of death and morbidity from COVID-19 against the benefits of cancer therapy. This risk is arguably amplified during aeromedical retrieval and transferring patients hundreds of kilometres from their homes into inner-regional and major city areas. The risks associated with transporting patients for cancer treatment are believed to be the main driver for a reduction in transfers during the lockdown period.",

This was mainly driven by reductions in acute respiratory disease retrievals. While influenza retrieval rates did not appear to reduce, reductions in overall respiratory disease match findings that social distancing for COVID-19 is reducing other respiratory disease transmission rates. For example, the Australian rates of confirmed influenza has significantly reduced since increased hygiene and social isolation measures have been in place, as compared to the winter months of 2019. 9 However, this trend could also be a result of a strong influenza vaccination campaign operated by the Australian Government during the early isolation periods. As per respiratory disease, skin infection retrieval rates started to decrease during the lockdown period, and significantly reduced in the post-lockdown period. As observed within Australia and internationally, nonpharmaceutical interventions, including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour, not only reduce COVID-19 transmission but also led to reductions in other diseases. 26 The vast majority of aeromedical retrievals come from rural and remote areas of Australia. 13 These areas are characterised as having healthcare workforce shortages, coupled with higher social and economic disadvantage and higher rates of chronic disease, including cardiovascular This article is protected by copyright.

As many remote Australian communities have limited access to COVID-19 testing and management facilities, coupled with higher chronic disease risk factors, it is likely that during mass infection many of these patients will require air ambulance transfer to inner-regional and major city hospitals. 16 This study highlighted interesting trends during a period of social isolation and lockdown.",
