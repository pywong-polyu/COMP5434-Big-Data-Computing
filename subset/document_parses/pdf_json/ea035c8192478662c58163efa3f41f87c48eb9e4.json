The temporal dependence accounts for the changing characteristics of testing, quarantine and treatment protocols, while diffusivity incorporates a mobile population. This model has been applied to data on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US state of Michigan. For system inference, we use recent advances; specifically our framework for Variational System Identification (Wang et al. in Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 356:44-74, 2019; arXiv:2001.04816 [cs.CE]) as well as Bayesian machine learning methods.",

            "text": "Starting from their origins in the the work of Kermack and McKendrick [1] , the use of differential equation models of the course of infectious diseases has grown to become one of the more accessible instances of the reach of mathematics. The current COVID-19 Pandemic has brought them into the common parlance. Even before this, however, the baseline Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model had been extended to include Exposed (E) and Deceased (D) compartments and applied with considerable success to influenza, ebola, malaria, cholera, tuberculosis and several other infectious diseases [2] [3] [4] [5] . (Some of this literature also includes agent-based models, which we do not consider here.) During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the widespread availability of data in the public domain [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] has served to attract methods of mathematics, computation and data science to analyzing this information, inferring the disease's dynamics and making projections. The present communication is in this spirit, and brings our recent work in large scale computations of partial differential equations (PDEs), system inference and machine learning to this problem [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Of particular interest to us are two lines of enquiry: The first is that for a rapidly evolving disease such as COVID-19, with its public health, population-based, political, travel and economic manifestations, the classical SIR model of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with constant coefficients seems inadequate. Driven by data that extends the compartments to the deceased (D), we have adopted the SIRD model. This choice is based entirely on the nature of the data available on the epidemic in the state of Michigan, where the numbers of deceased are reported on a daily basis. The classical SIR model can be extended to compartments additional to the exposed and deceased ones. These models are typically designated as SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible again, such as in the common cold); MSIR (Maternal-Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, where immunity is derived from the mother in the M compartment); SEIS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Susceptible again, also typical of the common cold); MSEIR and MSEIRD, which combine more of the compartments. However, data are not available to us on the exposed and maternally immune-protected sub-populations in the state of Michigan, and the Maternal compartment is not known to be relevant to COVID-19. We have therefore worked with the SIRD model. The interested reader is directed to Ref. [18] for details of the other SIR model variants.",

Population mobility has been addressed through metapopulation models that characterize how diseases move between population hubs, across countries, or even intercontinentally. The most widely known are gravity models (e.g. [20] ), and network and agent based models [21] . Given the prominence that quarantine protocols-adorned with the current-day euphemism of \"social distancing\"-have played in the COVID-19 Pandemic, it appears natural to seek an extension of the SIRD model to a spatio-temporal PDE model. As the world went into lockdown, but at different rates and degrees of rigor, and then began to emerge from it, the detection of patterns of mobility in space and time presents a compelling avenue for investigation. Such an extension also has been considered-chiefly in the setting of the mathematical analysis of reaction-diffusion systems [22] [23] [24] . Our contribution to this aspect of the mathematical treatment is to also allow the diffusivity of the S, I and R sub-populations to vary with time.",

Using the natural temporal unit of one day, we note that 1/\u03bc(t) is also the number of days an individual remains infectious. It follows that \u03b2(t)/\u03bc(t) is the effective reproduction number: the total number of the susceptible population that an infectious individual passes the disease to. This quantity is commonly denoted by R 0 , but we use r 0 (t) = \u03b2(t)/\u03bc(t), to distinguish it from the recovered population, and emphasizing that it, too, varies with time.",

The 7-day window was applied one, two, and three times. As seen in Fig. 2 , the method of Fig. 1 The map of Michigan delineating the counties and regions (modified from [25]) smoothing has little effect on the trends of the data. However, and as expected, there is a strong effect on the numerical time derivatives (see Fig. 3 ). It is clear that multiple passes of the filter are required to remove jumps in dR/dt and dI /dt. Since the additional smoothing is helpful for system inference in Sect. 4 and does not negatively affect the data, the 7-day moving average filter applied three times was used for data smoothing.",

We first draw attention to the conclusion that \u03b3 (t) = 0; the inference indicates that recovery from COVID-19 confers permanent immunity-an important conclusion, that remains to be confirmed by immunologists. As may be expected, the population's infection rate, \u03b2(t), declined as the initially higher rates of positive diagnoses fell with fewer infected individuals. However, it began to rise again upon the opening of construction activities (C), and continued to do so through the lifting of stay at home orders (O). The recovery rate, \u03bc(t), showed a long initial increase as growing numbers of infected individuals recovered. Our interpretation of the initially high death rate, \u03b1(t), is that many of the early cases already had advanced progression of the disease. Its rapid decline can be attributed to the ramp up of the public health campaign, hospitalization and emergency response of the medical system. The success that the state of Michigan gained by mandating an aggressive lockdown of nearly all societal, educational, commercial and industrial activity is best reflected in the rapid decline of the effective reproduction number, r 0 (t). According to the inference presented here, r 0 (t) < 1.0 for m > 32 (April 24, 2020), after which the typical infected individual passed the disease on to less than one other person. The death rate increased over the last few days for which data were obtained, perhaps as some number of individuals who had been infected for a longer time failed to recover. This affected the recovery rate as well, which fell. The close match between the simulations with the inferred ODE SIRD model and data (Fig. 5 , right plot) validate the systems inferred. Such validation against the data holds for all the inferred results presented in this communication, although the non-uniqueness of inverse problems does not preclude the existence of multiple sets of inferred coefficients. Figures 6 and 7 , respectively, illustrate the time-dependent SIRD coefficients and comparison between data and simulation using the inferred model (with the inferred ODE SIRD model) of the disease for Regions 1-8 delineated in Fig. 1 . This is an important step toward a more fine-grained understanding of the geographical distribution of the disease in the state. The Southeastern part of the state is more heavily populated, especially Regions 2 and 3, which also bore the greatest burden of the disease. The city of Detroit, at the Western tip of Region 3, was the worst affected, reflecting its well-known socio-economic challenges. By contrast, Washtenaw County, about 50 km to the West, but also in Region 3, bore among the lowest burdens, per capita. At the risk of stating the obvious, we note that Regions 1-4, which account for nearly 80% of the state's population displayed very similar characteristics in the evolution of the data, as well as in SIRD coefficients and forward simulation results. We do not enter a more detailed analysis of these results here, deferring a different approach to spatial aspects of the spread of the disease to Sect. 7.",

This represents the conferral of immunity on the recovered population, and importantly, is detected by our inference results using system identification and ODE-constrained minimization, as discussed in Sect. 6.",

The effective repro-duction number r 0 (t) < 1 for m > 30 (April 23), in good agreement with its value obtained via system inference in Fig. 5 . As polynomial approximation is used by the system inference approach, the inferred coefficients in Fig. 5 are very smooth, whereas inversion using the NN approach captures the detailed fluctuation of these coefficients, particularly, the rising infection rate after the open of the lockdown on June 1, 2020. In Fig. 9 , the band around the inferred coefficients and the NN predictions shows the mean \u00b1 one standard deviation of the corresponding results. Note the high standard deviation in parameters at early times, due to the noise in the data at small numbers. The regional results in Appendices \"DNN results for different regions\" and \"BNN results for different regions\" indicate that an accelerating infection rate for all the regions after the open of the lockdown. In particular, Region 7 and 8 have a predicted r 0 (t) value that is greater than 1.

Spatial effects have been introduced by simply resolving smaller regions and treating them individually, as demonstrated here with our inference of SIRD coefficients over the regions of Michigan's lower peninsula (Figs. 6, 7) . However, while affording a spatially finergrained treatment, this approach cannot, of course, address the mobility of the population. This is an important consideration, especially in light of the imposition and lifting of quarantines. In the COVID-19 Pandemic, the effects of social distancing, and the possibility of surges with their lifting revolve on the question of the time (and spatially) varying mobility of the population. At the finest resolution, this must be approached via agent-based models refined to resolve individuals. However, an intriguing question to explore is whether simple reaction-diffusion models can detect the evidence of mobility in these data. With our approach to model inference, we have access to methods of identifying mechanisms from data in which their action, while weak, may hold the key to important insights to the system. In this section, we embark down such a path, while noting that reaction-diffusion models of epidemiology have been considered previously from the perspective of analysis of the corresponding PDEs [22] [23] [24] . We now extend the SIRD model to PDEs in two spatial dimensions using the same compartments. However, the population variables are now replaced with spatio-temporally varying densities, S(x, t), I (x, t), R(x, t), D(x, t) defined as numbers per unit area.",

Stemand-leaf plots and the losses for Stage 1 of Variational System Identification appear in Fig. 11 . Recall that in this stage only the reaction terms \u03b2(t), \u03b3 (t), \u03bc(t), \u03b1(t) are identified. These inference results for active coefficients should be compared with the ODE SIRD model in Fig. 5 . This is followed by Stage 2 of Variational System Identification with stem-andleaf plots and losses appearing in Fig. 12 . Note that the diffusivities of the susceptible and recovered populations, D S = 0 and D R = 0. However, the infected population has a time-varying diffusivity D I that declines. Figure 13 shows the inference (two stage Variational System Identification followed by PDE-constrained optimization) for the coefficients \u03b2(t), \u03bc(t), \u03b1(t), the effective reproduction number, r 0 (t) as well as the diffusivity D I (t) in the PDE SIRD model. On comparing with Fig. 5 some differences are revealed in the time dependence of \u03b2(t), \u03bc(t), r 0 (t), \u03b1(t). This is to be expected in adopting the PDE SIRD model over the ODE form. The inference of time-dependent diffusion in the mobility of the infected sub-population, D I , naturally affects the other quantities. While the preliminary nature of these results warrants caution, it is worth noting the inference of decreasing mobility of the infected subpopulation in D I . Figure 14 compares data and the forward simulation with inferred quantities for the distribution of the infected and recovered sub-populations on days corresponding to the initial lockdown, the maximum spread of the infected sub-population (May 2), and at the end of our data collection. Notably, the restriction of the high density of the infected population, I to Southeastern Michigan reflects the success, to date, of the state's public health response. While the correspondence is reasonable, the statewide subpopulations S(t), I (t), R(t), D(t) obtained by integrating the corresponding densities over the lower peninsula, show a poorer match in Fig. 15 . While the trends are reproduced, there are notable errors over time. A major improvement is possible in the PDE SIRD model by allowing the coefficients \u03b2, \u03b3 , \u03bc, \u03b1, D S , . . . , D R to also vary over space. This would allow better representation of the system, in keeping with the inferred difference in \u03b2(t), \u03bc(t), r 0 (t), \u03b1(t) over the eight Regions in Fig. 6 , which led to the excellent agreement between data and the forward ODE SIRD simulations in Fig. 7 . From a purely data representation standpoint, the greater number of parameters will allow lower errors.

Our interest in this study has been two-fold. The first has been to seek to infer the time-dependence of the coefficients in the classical ODE SIRD model, motivated by the evolving characteristics of testing, quarantine and treatment protocols over the 97-day course of the pandemic as reflected in the data. As discussed in Sect. 6, our inference methods reveal the course of rates of infection, recovery and death over the state and its eight regions, assuming uniform mixing in each case. Notably, our methods suggest that recovery confers immunity, but we hasten to add that this is a very preliminary conclusion. More detailed and fine-grained studies need to be undertaken to verify it, and of course, immunology will have the final say here. Also of note are our conclusions that while the infection rate has increased after an initial decline, as the state relaxed restrictions, the lower numbers of infectious individuals has meant a lower overall extent of transmission. This is also seen in the effective reproduction rate, which, while below one, has trended dangerously closer to that threshold of exponential growth. The uncertainty in our inference, given the data, is reflected in the results of the Bayesian neural networks in the same section. Of some interest here are the predictions made by BNNs for 30 days beyond the end of the data we have considered; that is until July 28, 2020.",

            "text": "The second facet of our interest is to try and infer spatial dependence by extending the SIRD models to PDEs by incorporating the population's mobility via diffusion. This is a different, and potentially intriguing, approach that complements the resolution of the problem down to the smaller Regions of the state as we did with the ODE SIRD model. On this front, we note that the inference needs to be extended to our methods of two-stage Variational System Identification followed by PDE-constrained optimization. Here, it is of note that the susceptible and recovered populations were found to have vanishing diffusivities (mobilities), while the infected population had a diffusivity that declined over the 97-day extent of the data that we used. This first extension to sys-tem inference of the PDE SIRD model returned reasonable comparisons with data on distributions of the sub-population densities, although the total numbers integrated over the state were not as well reproduced. As suggested by the notable differences in the ODE SIRD model coefficients for the eight regions of the state, the PDE SIRD model with spatially varying coefficients may be a better representation. This will allow us to make connections with the well-known metapopulation variants [20, 21] of the network-based SIR model that account for the mobility of individuals or groups, and thereby represent spatially and group-wise varying diffusivity. Building on these initial results, we see many possibilities for analysis and prediction of the future course and geographical spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic using the PDE SIRD model. ",

Bands correspond to \u00b1 standard deviation over the mean fell with the public health campaign, especially driven by the lockdown orders. However, it began to rise with the first step of opening (C), and even accelerated as more aspects of public, recreational, commercial and industrial activities were relaxed (M, R, O). Yet, every one of the versions of forward simulations with corresponding and consistently inferred systems matched very well with the data, which confirm that the state has largely controlled the pandemic, and continues to do so. As the number of remaining infected individuals, I (t), has fallen steeply, there are fewer conveyors of infection, and even the higher \u03b2(t) has not yet led to another explosion of infection. This also can be seen by the sharply rising recovery rate, \u03bc(t), and is verified by the effective reproduction number r 0 (t) falling below 1.0 after April 20 or 23 (the later date according to the DNN and BNN inference methods). A warning bell, however, must be rung as the results also indicate that r 0 (t) \u2192 1.0 from below as we approach the end of our data and the time of writing.
