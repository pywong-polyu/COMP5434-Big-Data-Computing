            "text": "Background and Aims: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (commonly known as SARS-CoV-2) with multiple organ injuries. The aim of this study was to analyze COVID-19-associated liver dysfunction (LD), its association with the risk of death and prognosis after discharge. Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. LD was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between LD and the risk of death was analyzed. Results: Of the 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 had mild disease, 88 had severe disease, and 51 had critically ill disease. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients presented with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, LD was more common in critically ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male sex, older age and lymphopenia were three important independent risk factors predicting LD among COVID-19 patients. Risk of death analysis showed that the fatality rate was higher in patients with hypoproteinemia than in those without hypoproteinemia (relative risk=9.471, p<0.01). Moreover, the fatality rate was higher in patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (relative risk=2.182, p<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional index of two-third patients remained abnormal at 14 days after discharge.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus-induced respiratory infectious disease was found in Wuhan city of central China. 1 This novel coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2induced disease was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has since become a worldwide pandemic. 2 As of 31 March, 2020, a total of 700,000 people had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and more than 33,000 patients had died from COVID-19 all over the world. 1 The study has found SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes infection in humans through droplets or direct contact. 3 Recent studies have shown that the virus is also present in stool. The duration of viral shedding from the feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 7 (6-10) days, regardless of COVID-19 severity. However, the transmission infectivity through feces may be less. 4 Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed mainly in pulmonary epithelial cells and upper respiratory tract epithelium cells, was identified as a receptor of the virus. Moreover, conjunctiva, cardiomyocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells have also been identified as functional receptors for SARS-CoV-2. [5] [6] [7] [8] The main symptoms and signs of COVID-19 patients include fever, accompanied by dry cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, fatigue, and lymphopenia. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] While only a few cases of mild COVID-19 patients have died, the risk of death was found to be increased among critically ill patients with intensive care unit admission. 15 A large number of clinical data have revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 not only caused severe acute respiratory syndrome but also multiple organ injuries, including lymphocyte reduction, myocardial dysfunction, and even acute renal failure. [16] [17] [18] Previous research found abnormal liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19. 19 Liver injury was more popular in the critically ill COVID-19 patients with intensive care unit admission. 20 Nevertheless, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-associated liver dysfunction (LD) are rarely described. The prognosis of LD of COVID-19 patients remains unknown. Therefore, the clinical significance of COVID-19associated LD and its prognosis need to be clarified further.",

[16] [17] [18] Moreover, several studies found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with abnormal liver enzymes and liver injury. [20] [21] [22] In the present study, we described LD among COVID-19 patients. LD was determined by measuring biochemical indexes, such as ALT, AST, DBIL and IBIL, several hepatocellular injury markers, total protein, albumin and globulin (three protein metabolic indexes), and ALP, TBA and g-GGT (three markers of cholestasis). Our results showed that 39.6% COVID-19 patients presented with cholestasis, 51.9% with hypoproteinemia and 39.0% with hepatocellular injury on admission. We found that DBIL, IBIL, ALT and AST (four indexes of hepatocellular injury) and ALP and g-GGT (two markers of cholestasis) were higher in critically ill patients than those of mild cases. By contrast, total protein and albumin were lower in the critically ill patients than those of mild cases. These results provide evidence that LD on admission is associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients. Several studies found that elderly COVID-19 patients had more severe symptoms and signs than younger cases. 23, 24 The present study analyzed the influence of sex and age on COVID-19-associated LD. We showed that the levels of serum TBIL, ALT, ALP and g-GGT were higher in males than in females. By contrast, serum albumin level was lower in males than in females. Further analysis showed that the levels of TBIL, ALT, ALP and g-GGT were higher in older patients than younger ones. By contrast, albumin and globulin were lower in older patients than those in younger ones. According to several clinical reports, COVID-19 patients with comorbidities had a worse prognosis. 15, 25 Indeed, this study found that 40.8% COVID-19 patients presented with diabetes, 35.2% with hypertension, and 4.5% with hepatic disease. To explore the influence of comorbidities on LD, the present study analyzed hepatic functional indexes among different groups. Our results showed that ALP was slightly higher in COVID-19 patients with hypertension than those without hypertension. In addition, ALP and g-GGT were weakly higher in patients with diabetes than those without diabetes. By contrast, albumin was slightly lower in patients with either diabetes or hypertension than those without diabetes or hypertension.",

We found that almost all hepatic functional indexes were worse among patients with lymphocytopenia than without lymphocytopenia. To exclude potential confounding factors, multivariable logistic regression was used to further analyze the impact of sex, age and comorbidities on COVID-19-associated LD. We found that male, older age, comorbidities with diabetes and lymphocytopenia were independent risk factors of cholestasis. In addition, older age, lymphocytopenia and comorbidity with diabetes were independent risk factors of hypoproteinemia. Moreover, male and lymphocytopenia were independent risk factors of hepatocellular injury. Taken together, the present study provides evidence that male sex, older age, and comorbidities of diabetes and lymphocytopenia are major risk factors of LD among COVID-19 patients.",

The present study analyzed the impact of LD on the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Our results showed that the fatality rate was higher in COVID-19 patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia. Moreover, the fatality rate was higher in COVID-19 patients with cholestasis than without cholestasis. Our results suggest that hypoproteinemia and cholestasis at the early stage elevate the risk of death of COVID-19 patients. It is especially interesting to consider whether COVID-19-associated LD recovers in a short time after discharge. In the present study, the prognosis was tracked and hepatic function was measured among 150 The mechanism of which SARS-CoV-2 evokes LD remains unclear. Accumulating data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes multiple organ injuries, such as lymphopenia, myocardial dysfunction, and acute renal failure. 10, 28, 29 In the present study, we showed that oxygenation index, an index of respiratory function, was positively correlated with serum albumin. By contrast, there were weakly negative correlations between oxygenation index with ALT, AST, AST/ALT, and g-GGT among COVID-19 patients. Moreover, clinical study found that respiratory failure was associated with poor prognostic markers of liver failure. 30, 31 These results suggest that respiratory failure may contribute, at least partially, to COVID-19-associated LD. Several studies demonstrated that ACE2, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was expressed in cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. 32, 33 Moreover, ACE2 was found to be highly expressed in cholangiocytes, which may be the reason for higher levels of serum ALP being observed among COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this study does not exclude that SARS-CoV-2 evokes LD partially through infecting liver directly. It is required to further explore whether human liver is another target organ of SARS-CoV-2 injection.",

            "text": "This study mainly analyzed COVID-19-associated LD, its association with the risk of death and prognosis after discharge. Nevertheless, there are several potential limitations in this research. Firstly, the cases were enrolled from only two different regions rather than from multiple centers in China, so the results may not be generalizable to COVID-19 patients from all over the world. Secondly, the degree of LD was mild in the present study. Although, LD elevated the risk of death, we still could not exclude the possibility that other potential confounders, such as cytokine storm, acute kidney injury, myocardial injury and COVID-19 itself, may induce poor outcome of COVID-19 patients. Several animal experiments may resolve this confusion. Thirdly, the current study is the result of a prospective cohort study. COVID-19-associated LD existed between the admission day and 14 days after discharge. Liver function remained abnormal all along. This research can't exclude whether cytokine storm, side effects of the drugs used during treatment, or other comorbidities induced LD, not just a sequel of COVID-19. Therefore, animal experiments could help to further confirm the results of this investigation and determine the causal relationship. Fourthly, AST is not a specific marker of LD; it also originates from cardiomyocytes. So, AST elevation cannot fully exclude the cause of myocardial injury. Fifthly, SARS-CoV-2 injection also induced acute kidney injury. Lower albumin in older patients may contribute to acute kidney injury and other comorbidities, like diabetes. Moreover, several baseline comorbidities, such as renal impairment, diabetes and malnutrition, may always induce lower albumin. Therefore, albumin decrease cannot completely contribute to LD. In vivo experiments can help to explain the cause of lower albumin in future research work.",

Although serum albumin level had rebounded on 14 days after discharge, the level of albumin in 17% COVID-19 patients remained below the normal range.
