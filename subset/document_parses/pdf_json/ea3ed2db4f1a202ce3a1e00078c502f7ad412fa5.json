SOLIDWORKS was used to design the platform, which comprises two rod-less pneumatic cylinders, one auxiliary cylinder, and a fabric-clamping mechanism. These parts are integrated with a sewing machine. The mask sewing platform has two degrees of freedom, as indicated by a mobility analysis of its mechanism. To control the highly nonlinear and time variant pneumatic system, a mathematical model for the pneumatic servo control system was developed and then analyzed in analytical form. An intelligent parameter adjustment feature with a sliding-mode controller was formulated to control the mask sewing platform. An experimental mask sewing platform was then designed and constructed. Finally, a personal computer-based system was developed using MATLAB Simulink for real-time control of the platform. The hybrid and fifth-order paths were successfully implemented in the test rig, and this study's platform was experimentally verified as being capable of automatically producing masks.",

It is currently believed that asymptomatic patients can also spread the disease, and symptoms of COVID-19 have been mild (mostly flu-like) in most instances [1] , [2] . COVID-19 is primarily transmitted via droplets from a patient's coughs or sneezes. Precautions must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and the wearing of masks in high-risk environments-such as in hospitals or public spaces-has been a key measure. This measure, however, has stressed the mask and textile industry, particularly with regard to labor requirements; this threatens to compromise production efficiency and quality, especially considering the increase in basic wages. This strain on labor must be addressed, and various studies have formulated methods that can do so. For example, Zoumponos and Aspragathos [3] proposed using fuzzy logic to program robots for use in sewing tables. Specifically, following",

In Zoumponos and Aspragathos's experiments, this fuzzy-logical method could be used to establish a complete path system, guiding robots to designated fabric locations (on fabrics of various sizes) to complete tasks. Panagiotis et al. [4] studied the application of stretchable materials to robots. They concluded that problems with stretchable materials involved their unpredictable nonlinearity, complex mechanical properties, and bending deformation. Fabric sewing is a delicate process because fabrics can change shape, and even twist, when forces (regardless of magnitude) are applied; this sensitivity to external forces makes automated sewing systems difficult to develop. However, automated sewing systems for manufacturing flexible-apparel products are essential because of rapid changes in consumer tastes, particularly in fashion and new fabric materials. Eric and Frank [5] investigated clothing production simulation systems. Specifically, they visually guided sewing robots along motion paths, which were defined using visual information and the coordinates of fabric edges. Subsequently, they conducted experiments involving shape analyses and motion control algorithms; their results indicated that visual guidance is the most effective method for guiding robot movements. Xiaoji and Kaiyong [6] argued that the stitching process is a crucial step that directly affects the shoemaking process, particularly the appearance of the finished shoe. Therefore, they introduced an automated shoe stitching process. Furthermore, in a previous work, the authors of the present study proposed a method where shoe upper images are input into an automatic seam processor to output digital control codes. The processor then uses a charge-coupled device camera to capture upper images before performing noise removal, binarization, edge detection, and edge thinning. Basic geometric sewing parameters, such as the upper contour, are captured from the upper images. Ryder et al. [7] controlled fabrics by replacing sewing machines with a servo-controlled robot gripper. They used a mechanical visual system to track the outlines of fabrics in order to identify detailed fabric locations and prevent fabric deformation. Their high-precision and highacceleration location control system favorably controlled fabric location and tension.",

Because of improvements in computing, pneumatic systems and components have been more widely utilized in industry and in automation technology. Furthermore, control theories and methods with regard to automation have allowed pneumatic systems to behave with greater linearity and predictability. Consequently, the use of pneumatic actuators and valves, particularly in automated, robotic sewing production, has various advantagessuch as greater responsiveness, safety, stability, energy efficiency, and ease of maintenance. However, compressible fluid, pneumatic systems have the key disadvantage of being less accurate relative to electric motors.

            "text": "Considering these advances in the literature, this study designed a novel two-dimensional pneumatic servomechanism-based mask sewing platform (TDPSMSP). Mask manufacturers can incorporate this system into their automatic sewing and stitching machines to substantially reduce labor and time costs during mask fabric manufacturing; the TDPSMSP also facilitates the full automation of factory operations. Air is used to generate pressure energy to power the TDPSMSP because of its accessibility, safety, and compressibility. Consequently, the TDPSMSP has a simple and highly responsive structure, in addition to being clean, safe, cost-efficient, and energy-efficient. As for the TDPSMSP's mechanical design, a rod-less pneumatic cylinder was selected as the actuator, and the advantages of the cylindrical shape (specifically, ease of assembly and simplicity in design) were used to provide a larger work space. The TDPSMSP's mobility was analyzed using Kutzbach-Gruebler's equation. Subsequently, a specimen machine was designed using SOLIDWORKS. To control the highly nonlinear and time-varying pneumatic system, a mathematical model for controlling the pneumatic servo system was developed and then analyzed. An intelligent parameter adjustment feature with a sliding-mode control was formulated to control the mask sewing platform. Next, a personal computer (PC)based system-controlled TDPSMSP was developed using MATLAB Simulink. The experimental results indicated that masks are produced by the TDPSMSP through path generation and fifth-order polynomial trajectories for tracking and controlling with references. Figure 1 illustrates the structural design of the TDPSMSP, which mainly comprises two rod-less pneumatic cylinders, an auxiliary cylinder, a cloth-clamping platform, and a sewing machine. The proposed TDPSMSP is basically composed of two identical limbs and a moving platform. Two sliders are translated along the linear guide-ways by two one degree of freedom (DOF) prismatic joints driven by the pneumatic rodless cylinders, input links. The part marked in green is the sewing machine, that marked in red is the fabric-clamping platform, that marked in blue is the rod-less pneumatic cylinder, and that marked in purple is the auxiliary cylinder. Sliders on the cylinders could move to control fabrics fed to the fabric-clamping platform, completing the sewing process. Figure 2 is the layout of the pneumatic real-time servo control platform and the sewing machine. The M2M collaboration system is the pneumatic real-time servo control platform with the sewing machine. The rod-less pneumatic cylinder and auxiliary cylinder, model numbers DGC-25-500-GF-PPV-A and DGC-25-500-FA-P, respectively, were manufactured by FESTO. In this experiment, the machine pressure source was set at 6 bar. Furthermore, this study used pneumatic proportional servo valves (model: FESTO MPYE-5-1/8-HF-010-B) to control the pneumatic cylinders. The input and median voltage were set at 0-10 V and 5 V, respectively. An AD/DA interface card (PCI-1723) manufactured by Advantech was employed for signal control, whereas a counting card, manufactured by NI (NI-6601), was utilized for receiving optical ruler (JENA LIA 20) signals. A PC-based system was developed using MATLAB Simulink, in which the main design flow entailed using MAT-LAB's.M files to set parameters and design paths and using a program created using Simulink to obtain .M file parameters for subsequent calculations. Control signals were transmitted to the AD/DA card to control the pneumatic proportional servo valve output flows and directions, thereby enabling control of the air pressure rod-less pneumatic cylinder flows and directions. The optical ruler was then used to read the displacement of the rod-less pneumatic cylinder and issue immediate feedback. The sampling frequency was set at 1 kHz. A sewing machine was manufactured by Brother, model numbers Innovis F410. The preset and actual trajectories were then compared, and discrepancies were returned to the controller to control subsequent operation. By constantly correcting and compensating values, errors were corrected to approach target values. In this study, TDPSMSP experiments were performed using real-time trajectory-tracking control to prevent data (read using the optical ruler) losses when movement speed was excessively rapid. Table 1 shows specifications of the M2M collaboration system via the pneumatic real-time servo control platform and the sewing machine. When sewing the mask, the tooth of the sewing machine will face downward. Thus, the feed speed of fabric will be unaffected by the sewing machine. In this study's mask product experiment, the feed speed of fabric could reach 26 mm/s, which was greater than the 14.2 mm/s sewing speed of this sewing machine.",

Figure 4 presents the x-axis tracking control results of the TDPSMSP fifth-order polynomial trajectory at 100 mm and a movement time of 4 s. Real-time trajectory-tracking control yielded errors within \u00b10.8 mm. The pneumatic servo valve was continually modified and compensated during movement to ensure favorable tracking performance. Figure 5 presents the x-axis tracking control results of the TDPSMSP fifthorder polynomial trajectory at 400 mm and a movement time of 16 s for a large stroke. Real-time trajectory-tracking control yielded errors within \u00b10.7 mm. The pneumatic servo valve was continually modified and compensated during movement to ensure favorable tracking performance. To investigate the performance of the rod-less pneumatic cylinder system in both forward and reverse directions (directions of movement required by the fabric-clamping platform), this study planned hybrid path models (sinusoidal trajectories with fifth-order polynomial trajectories) at t \u2264 30 sec, fifthorder polynomial trajectories at 300 mm and 12 s, and sinusoidal trajectories at an amplitude of 100 mm and frequency of 0.2\u03c0. x-Axis control results of the two-dimensional pneumatic servomechanism-based mask sewing platform hybrid trajectories at t \u2264 30 sec, fifth-order polynomial trajectories at 300 mm and 12 s, and sinusoidal trajectories at an amplitude of 100 mm and frequency of 0.2\u03c0. Figure 6 presents the x-axis control results of the TDPSMSP, which had relatively larger errors when the rodless pneumatic cylinder alternated directions. Nevertheless, the pneumatic servo valve signals were continually modified and compensated during movement to ensure favorable system tracking results. Another axis, y-axis, is also controlled simultaneously. Figure 7 presents the y-axis tracking control results of the TDPSMSP fifth-order polynomial trajectory at 100 mm and a movement time of 4 s. Real-time trajectorytracking control yielded errors within \u00b11.2 mm larger than x-axis's errors because of the x-axis loading on the y-axis. The pneumatic servo valve was continually modified and compensated during movement to ensure favorable tracking performance under the x pneumatic cylinder loading. Figure 8 presents the y-axis tracking control results of the TDPSMSP fifth-order polynomial trajectory at 400 mm and a movement time of 16 s for a large stroke. Real-time trajectory-tracking control yielded errors within \u00b10.5 mm. The pneumatic servo valve was continually modified and compensated during movement to ensure favorable tracking performance. Figure 9 presents the y-axis control results of the TDPSMSP under hybrid trajectories at t \u2264 30 sec, fifthorder polynomial trajectories at 300 mm and 12 s, and sinusoidal trajectories at an amplitude of 100 mm and frequency of 0.2\u03c0. Relatively larger errors are \u00b11.2 mm, when the rodless pneumatic cylinder alternated directions. Nevertheless, the pneumatic servo valve signals were continually modified and compensated during movement to ensure favorable system tracking results. As evident in Figures 4-9 , changes in the control voltage can reduce errors in the trajectorytracking results. However, the applied control voltage was not switched at the maximum values of +5 V and \u22125 V. Thus, the performance and lifetime of the pneumatic servo valve were within the requisite tolerance. Table 3 compares this study's results, against those of [12] - [14] , for the intelligent parameter adjustment feature with sliding-mode controllerfor the S curve and polynomial trajectory. Relative to other controllers, this study's controller performed best, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1563 mm for the real-time path tracking servo system. Figure 10 presents the results for the circular tracking path of the fabric-clamping platform. According to the results, the fabric-clamping platform moved from (X, Y) = (0 mm, 0 mm) to (X, Y) = (100 mm, 200 mm) in 8 s along fifth-order polynomial trajectories for each axis. As for circular trajectories, the platform required 10 s to cover one revolution of a 200-mm diameter trajectory. Figure 11 and Figure 12 present the results for each pneumatic cylinder stroke of the fabric-clamping platform when a circular tracking path was taken. The sampling frequency was 1000 Hz in the experiments. The sewing process is shown in Figure 13 . The fabric-clamping platform covered the fabric by the pneumatic real-time servo control system for fabric moving and the sewing machine was for needle sewing. The pneumatic platform and the sewing machine should cooperate precisely. Otherwise, the needle will be broken. Figure 14 shows tracking path results of the fabric clamping platform for mask production. The red line is desired path for the fabric clamping platform moving and the blue line is experimental results. The fabric clamping platform moves from (X, Y) = (0mm, 0mm) to (X, Y) = (\u2212180mm, 0mm) in 10 seconds by fifthorder polynomial trajectories and then moves from (X, Y) = (\u2212180mm, 0mm) to (X, Y) = (\u2212180mm, 130mm) in 5 seconds by fifth-order polynomial trajectories. Finally, the fabric clamping platform moves from (X, Y) = (\u2212180mm, 130mm) to (X, Y) = (0mm, 130mm) in 10 seconds by fifth-order polynomial trajectories. Figure 15 presents the tracking path errors of the fabric-clamping platform. The error results indicated tracking errors that increased suddenly to >2 mm in acceleration and deceleration.",

The rod-less pneumatic servo system was experimentally shown to provide impressive trajectory-tracking precision on both fifth-order polynomial and hybrid trajectories. Furthermore, mask production was successfully implemented in the experimental test rig. This study's controller performed best relative to its counterparts; it had RMSEs of 0.1563 and 0.495 mm for the real-time path tracking servo system and the final mask product, respectively. By adopting the TDPSMSP in automated manufacturing and in sewing-related operations, mask manufacturers can substantially reduce labor costs as well as increase productivity, yield, and efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed novel TDPSMSP can be applied in conjunction with different sewing machines for mask production at various speeds. Pneumatic cylinder speeds of >30 mm/s will result in incomplete sewing results; this is because the upper and lower needle cannot match the cotton threads to be used during sewing. Conversely, pneumatic cylinder speeds of <15 mm/s result in unacceptable errors in the final product. In the mask production experiment, the feed speed of fabric could reach 26 mm/s, which was greater than the 14.2 mm/s sewing speed of the sewing machine used.",
