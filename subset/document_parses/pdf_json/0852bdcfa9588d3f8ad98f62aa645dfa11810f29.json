Overlapping syndromes of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy with consumptive coagulopathy and microangiopathy can be seen in critically ill patients as well. Blood was collected from 12 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with severe COVID-19 who were on either mechanical ventilation or on high flow oxygen with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <300 mmHg. Laboratory tests were performed for parameters of haemostasis, clot waveform analysis and anti-phospholipid antibodies. CWA parameters were raised with elevated aPTT median Min1 (clot velocity) 9.3%/s (IQR 7.1-9.9%/s), elevated PT median Min1 10.3%/s (IQR 7.1-11.1%/s), elevated aPTT median Min2 (clot acceleration) 1.5%/s 2 (IQR 1.0-1.6%/s 2 ), elevated PT median Min2 5.2%/s 2 (3.6-5.7%/s 2 ), elevated aPTT median Max2 (clot deceleration) 1.3%/s 2 (IQR 0.8-1.4%/s 2 ) elevated PT median Max2 3.8%/s 2 (IQR 2.6-4.2%/s 2 ), increased aPTT median Delta change (decreased light transmission due to increased clot formation) 87.8% (IQR 70.2-91.8%) and PT median Delta change 33.0%. This together with raised median Factor VIII levels of 262.5%, hyperfibrinogenemia (median fibrinogen levels 7.5 g/L), increased median von Willebrand factor antigen levels 320% and elevated median D-dimer levels 1.7 \u03bcg/dl support the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. A lupus anticoagulant was present in 50% of patients. Our laboratory findings further support the view that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a state of hypercoagulability.",

This is secondary to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, which is a hypercoagulable state characterized by several guidelines [3] [4] [5] as having laboratory features of raised D-dimer, Factor VIII and hyperfibrinogenemia, with the potential contributory mechanisms including vasculitis [6] , hyperinflammation (raised IL-1-Beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha), neutrophil extracellular traps and hyperviscosity, resulting in both systemic and local macro-and microthrombosis. Antiphospholipid antibodies can also be present transiently, although it is not yet proven if this translates to a clinical hypercoagulable state. Potential overlaps of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and microangiopathy can also be seen in critically ill patients.",

            "text": "Our study further supports the available evidence that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with hypercoagulability [7, 21] . Clot waveform analysis (CWA) has not been well described as a tool to evaluate a hypercoagulable state, although emerging literature shows promising evidence that this may be useful in predicting for VTE [22] and also in several procoagulable states [23, 24] . CWA showed a hypercoagulable state with increased parameters of clot maximum velocity (min1), clot maximum acceleration (min2), clot maximum deceleration (max2) and delta change (decreased light transmission reflective of increased clot thickness) characterizing a hypercoagulable state in 10 patients (with corresponding raised Factor VIII, vWF antigen, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels), with no evidence of concurrent bacterial infection at the time of assessment. Two patients did not demonstrate a hypercoagulable state on their CWA. These 2 patients had probable pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy (PIC) with bacterial sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC), and COVID-19-associated coagulopathy with depressed Factor II, X, XI levels and moderate thrombocytopenia. Patients with severe COVID-19 who develop SIC would have secondary hyperfibrinolysis with a reduction in fibrinogen levels and platelet counts [25] . Compared with the other 10 patients with a primary hypercoagulable state, they had relatively lower but still elevated levels of fibrinogen, factor VIII and vWF antigen, reflective of the underlying pro-inflammatory state and endothelial activation and dysfunction (resulting in raised vWF antigen levels) from severe COVID-19. Although their CWA showed a mildly increased delta change, the other CWA parameters were either normal or slightly depressed, likely due to the lower levels of clotting factors and fibrinogen due to consumption from both bacterial SIC and PIC when compared to raised CWA parameters (min1, min2, max2 and increased delta change) in the other 10 patients (see Fig. 1b,  c) . Collectively, in critically ill COVID-19 patients without a concurrent PIC or SIC, the CWA for both aPTT and PT demonstrate a state of hypercoagulability.",

The increased incidence of a lupus anticoagulant in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was also seen in ICU studies by other centres [20, 32] with a higher prevalence of 87.7-88%. The presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies is likely caused by an immune dysregulation and cytokine storm. Given the prolongation of aPTT due to the lupus anticoagulant, monitoring with anti-Xa levels is recommended while patients are on therapeutic anticoagulation although the significance of these antibodies predisposing to development of thrombosis in COVID-19 is unclear and requires further evaluation.",

            "text": "Lastly, the variable time of assessment since onset of illness ranging between 9 and 20 days is a significant confounder, as the hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 is observed early during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while in patients who are not on thromboprophylaxis or already on long term anticoagulation, this may then progress on to pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy (PIC), a consumptive coagulopathy, with excessive activation of the coagulation system resulting in consumption of both clotting factors and platelets, shifting the hypercoagulable state into a hypocoagulable state [35] . Hence the different timing of assessment may result in discordant findings in both haemostatic parameters and clot waveform analysis. Our 12 patients were not on thromboprophylaxis at time of assessment, and those who had their haemostatic parameters and CWA assessed in the later part of their hospitalization could have developed PIC. Pathologic evidence from autopsy series demonstrating macroscopic findings of lung edema and patchy haemorrhages, microscopic findings of pulmonary endotheliitis [36] , extensive fibrin thrombi in distended small vessels and capillaries [37, 38] , increased numbers of megakaryocytes in , D-Dimer >20 \u03bcg/ml (<0.5 \u03bcg/ml), Platelets 120 \u00d7 10 9 /L.

The result cumulates in end organ complications of thrombosis as seen in cases of lower limb ischaemia and deep venous thrombosis, acute myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents. Therefore, the treatment strategy on presentation of COVID-19 could be thromboprophylaxis with the blockade of hypercoagulation and thrombin generation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin [39, 40] . Further prospective randomized control trials are awaited to determine if intermediate or full dose anticoagulation strategy will provide a decreased incidence of thrombotic events and survival benefit in critically ill patients.",

            "text": "In summary, the use of haemostatic parameters and CWA further substantiate the evidence for a hypercoagulability state in severe COVID-19. Our analysis showed that elevated CWA parameters together with elevated D-dimer, Factor VIII, vWF antigen and fibrinogen levels, support the presence of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. CWA seems to reflect a hypercoagulable state in critically ill patients with COVID-19 as shown by elevated clot waveform parameters (min1, min2, max2 and delta change) with good correlation with elevated factor VIII, vWF antigen, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. CWA parameters may hence offer a novel approach for assessment of COVID-19-associated hypercoagulabilty apart from viscoelastic tests. It is easily performed on automated analyzers with optical detection systems using standard PT and aPTT reagents and is not associated with additional costs. Patients with concurrent PIC or SIC with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy are more likely to show less elevated or low-normal CWA parameters. Major bleeding associated with a consumptive coagulopathy from SIC, PIC or local factors from endothelial damage from SARS-CoV virus infection can occur in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Further randomized studies which include both ICU and non ICU patients and risk prediction models for venous thromboembolism and arterial thrombosis are needed to establish the utility of standard haemostatic tests and global haemostatic tests such as viscoelastic tests, CWA and thrombin generation in patients with COVID-19 infection that may help to establish appropriate thromboprophylactic regimes, and to manage prothrombotic and bleeding risks.",
