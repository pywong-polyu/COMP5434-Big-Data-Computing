Given the detrimental impact of the pandemic on mental health and the economy, more difficult days are ahead for psychiatry. The rising public health burden of mental illnesses will inevitably exceed the capacity of psychiatric services in the United States and worldwide. The pandemic has also profoundly affected psychiatric research due to safety concerns and containment efforts. Intermediate and long-term ramifications may even be more serious. In addition to the effects of the economic downturn on available research funding, existing research tools and protocols may not meet the emerging needs in the post-COVID-19 era. This paper discusses potential trends and challenges that psychiatric practice and research may encounter in this period from the viewpoint of workers in the field. We outline some measures that clinicians and researchers can implement to adapt to the emerging changes in psychiatry and to mitigate the forthcoming effects of the crisis.",

Disasters traumatize societies, typically in a timelimited event with destructive outcomes that hit one community and require others to help. The pandemic is unusual because the world faces a danger with an unknown end date. Communities that support each other in normal times are now competing for scarce resources to cope with their own crises. The impact of this crisis on individuals and societies is compounded by the experience of facing danger without help. If the pandemic lasts for an extended period, as projected by some models [1, 2] , psychiatric practice and the place of psychiatry in medicine are likely to undergo lasting changes. Here, we will (i) identify potential trends and challenges that psychiatric practice and research may encounter during this period, (ii) will suggest concrete measures that clinicians and researchers can take to mitigate the effects of this crisis at individual and institutional levels.",

The current climate is a perfect incubator for rising public health burden due to psychiatric disorders [9, 10] . The pandemic has a negative impact on mental health while stretching psychiatric services to the limit and reducing our ability to respond due to economic downturn. Although the long-term ramifications of the economic downturn are currently unclear and the downturn will affect different sectors of society differently, the pandemic threatens a prolonged economic crisis due to the costs associated with social distancing measures lasting for months [11, 12] . An economic recession, by itself, brings the risk of an increase in psychiatric disorders [13] , homelessness [14] , and suicide rates [15] . It is also likely that the rate of substance use disorders will surge [16] , adding to the major opioid crisis in the United States and worldwide [17] . This cascade of events makes it highly possible that the demand for mental health services will exceed the existing capacity of the system. We must prepare now to meet this challenge.",

A large proportion of patients with these disorders can be effectively treated in primary healthcare settings. These disorders are also the leading conditions that will be exacerbated by the pandemic [10] . Perhaps the most effective short-term solution to the looming crisis is to improve the knowledge and confidence of primary care physicians in treating these prevalent psychiatric disorders. The effectiveness of this approach, the primary care first (PCP-First) model, has been well studied and supported by randomized controlled trials over the last two decades [18] [19] [20] . The Collaborative Care Model, another primary care-based model that integrates physical and behavioral health services, is also clinically and costeffective for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders [21] [22] [23] [24] . There is an urgent need for policies that promote the implementation of these models in nonpsychiatric care settings broadly across the country. The changes in psychiatric practice following the pandemic may also stimulate improvements in these models. For example, high attrition rates and inadequate clinician/staff time are some of the major limitations to the PCP-First model [20, 25] . The undergoing transformation in telemedicine may accelerate the development of smart-phone apps or web-based surveys that would allow remote (and wider) screening and help patients interact with clinicians before and between scheduled visits. These developments may help overcome the major obstacles to the widespread adoption of these models [20, 25] .",

Institutions and mental health professionals have responded to this crisis by implementing psychological intervention services that offer mental health support hotlines and guidance on how to cope with stress and develop resilience [28] [29] [30] . Although these services have helped many frontline workers, there are significant limitations to these interventions. Commonly highlighted coping strategies such as behavioral activation and mindfulness practices [28] are habits that require time and effort to develop. Individuals who have these tools in their toolbox benefit from them at the time of a crisis. However, it is less likely to succeed in developing new habits in times of crisis. Secondly, participating in these intervention programs also requires time and effort. Chen et al. recently published their experience in implementing psychological intervention services in a tertiary hospital in China during the COVID-19 outbreak [29] . A major obstacle that they encountered was the reluctance of staff to participate in these interventions, stating that they \"did not need a psychologist, but needed more rest without interruption\". To overcome this barrier, the hospital provided the staff with an isolated place to rest, guaranteed food and daily living supplies, and made psychological counselors available onsite to provide support during break times [29] . Avoidance, a core symptom of trauma, may also prevent healthcare workers from reaching out for help and using these services. Individuals who are at lower levels of stress and less burnt out may be more likely to participate in these supportive services [31] . Team leaders should actively reach out to team members who are repeatedly not available to participate in support meetings [30] .",

Similar to their approach, there is a need for an interdisciplinary field that focuses on improving mental and physical health in healthcare professionals and first responders, in addition to providing early support at the time of a crisis and aftercare. Preventive interventions, such as teaching behavioral strategies for coping with stress, should be embedded in their professional training in a way that they can form these habits during their training (e.g., weekly practices as a part of the curriculum, instead of a single lecture on this topic). Monitoring healthcare workers for mental health illnesses and providing early support will remain crucial in the aftermath of the pandemic. The World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program sets an example that provides longitudinal physical and mental healthcare to first responders, in addition to collecting epidemiological data on the long-term health consequences of the disaster [32] . The WTC Health Program may help inform future efforts to provide continuing support to healthcare workers after the pandemic. If we fail to take on this urgent task to better support the physical and mental wellbeing of healthcare workers, the workforce shortage in healthcare will continue to grow at an increased pace after the pandemic.",

First, even though social distancing practices may ease in the near future, the fear of contamination in medical settings will likely last longer. Due to the increased sense of danger, individuals will be less willing to come into the hospitals for clinical trials. Particularly trials that do not offer treatment interventions will have greater difficulty recruiting patients. The recruitment of healthy individuals may become even more challenging. To mitigate this problem clinical research will need to adopt digital technologies into research designs. Even if clinical trials are able to implement digital technologies, connectivity may become a logistic barrier for many people with psychiatric problems. Research in some fields, such as psychotic disorders, may be more seriously impacted by these barriers due to more severe socioeconomic disadvantages seen in those populations. The difficulty in recruiting participants may also require researchers to increase the amount of monetary compensation for participation in clinical trials-as approved by Institutional Review Boards (IRB).",

Adaptation of digital technologies into clinical research will require compatible and validated research tools for digital settings. There are a number of potential challenges to the validity of online clinical assessments, largely due to the lack of control in the testing situation and environmental factors influencing responses. Studies comparing online and traditional versions of psychological tests demonstrate that online tests can have acceptable psychometric properties, but may show significant differences in factor structures [38] . For this reason, there is a need for the validation of commonly used clinical assessments for virtual settings. Similarly, cognitive assessment tools may need to be validated and re-normed for virtual visits. Online cognitive assessments may be increasingly utilized in this period. Although there are online cognitive assessments that have been validated in different patient populations [39] [40] [41] [42] , studies on unsupervised online assessments are limited [43] . The increasing need for remote assessments and IRB's rapid responses to these requests may also accelerate the developments in digital app-based research.",

Researchers will need to develop standardized protocols to address these questions. Additional clinical measures that were not considered relevant before may now be needed to account for confounding effects that the pandemic introduced. The development of standardized clinical tools that measure the impact of the pandemic on different mental health domains may help researchers develop standard methods to account for these factors across different trials. Attrition rates may also increase in this period. Dropouts may be associated with specific demographic or clinical features that are distinctively affected by the pandemic, which would introduce additional bias [44] .

Due to the urgent need and high demand for these articles, journals prioritize publishing these papers over research on other topics, even if they have a lower level of scientific evidence or promise of progress. This may also result in the blurring of traditional lines of the scopes of journals. Journals may need to develop strategies to continue to publish high-quality research within their traditional scope. As researchers may prefer to hold off on submitting new papers in this period, the use of preprint servers may become more common. Researchers may need to be increasingly careful about predatory open-access journals in this period.",

As a result, these developments may transform the culture-bound nature of research and academic publishing in the near future.",
