We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 30-mAs chest CT protocol in comparison with a 150-mAs standard-dose routine protocol for imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods Upon IRB approval, consecutive laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients aged 50 years or older who were referred for chest CT scan and had same-day normal CXR were invited to participate in this prospective study. First, a standarddose chest CT scan (150 mAs) was performed. Only if typical COVID-19 pneumonia features were identified, then a low-dose CT (30 mAs) was done immediately. Diagnostic accuracy of low-dose and standard-dose CT in the detection of typical COVID-19 pneumonia features were compared. Results Twenty patients with a mean age of 64.20 \u00b1 13.8 were enrolled in the study. There was excellent intrareader agreement in detecting typical findings of COVID-19 pneumonia between low-dose and standard-dose (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.98-0.99, P values < 0.001 all readers). The mean effective dose values in standard-and low-dose groups were 6.60 \u00b1 1.47 and 1.80 \u00b1 0.42 mSv, respectively. Also, absolute cancer risk per mean cumulative effective dose values obtained from the standard-and low-dose CT examinations were 2.71 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and 0.74 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , respectively.

In this prospective study, there is no significant difference between the low-dose and standard-dose CT images in diagnosing radiographically normal laboratory-confirmed COVID19 pneumonia cases, with excellent agreement rate among the readers. 2. The mean CTDIvol, DLP, effective patients' dose, and estimated cancer risk were reduced by more than seventy-three percent in the lowdose group, without sacrificing the diagnostic accuracy of detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. 3. Although there were differences in scoring lobar involvement between the low-dose and standard-dose for the readers, this did not affect the final diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in any case, indicating a 100% sensitivity for the low-dose chest CT scan, considering a standard-dose CT as the gold standard test.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Compliance with ethical standards"}]}
