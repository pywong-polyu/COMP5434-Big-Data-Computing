Peterson et al. define a zero energy building as \"An energy-efficient building where, on a source energy basis, the actual annual delivered energy is less than or equal to the on-site renewable exported energy\" (Peterson et al. 2016) . In this definition, the source energy refers to the embodied energy of primary fossil fuels and the energy used at the building site (D'Agostino and Mazzarella 2019). Besides, the definition explains that the essential requirements of the zero energy buildings are energy efficiency measures and power self-sufficiency on renewable energy. Among all the renewable energy sources, photovoltaic (PV) technology is the most common approach used in zero energy buildings and other energy efficient buildings due to the possibility of energy feedback into the grid (Shirazi et al. 2019; Belussi et al. 2019) . It is an indisputable fact that PV technology is a feasible solution to reduce environmental impacts caused by traditional energy sources. However, embodied emissions from PV energy systems in energy efficient buildings lead to material emissions to be compensated for (Birgisd\u00f3ttir et al. 2016) .",

The main goal of the paper is to investigate the relation between the changes in annual mean temperatures, one of the most noticeable effects of climate change, and PV system environmental profile. For this purpose, EPBT and GPBT of the examined system are estimated dividing the embodied data by the annual in operation data to investigate the effect of energy performance on carbon footprint of a PV system. Energy generation and CO 2 saving data between 2014 and 2018 are obtained from the owner. The embodied data is calculated by an appropriate approach which is selected from the current studies based on the mounting type of the PV system, the energy source used to produce the PV system, the year of PV system production and annual solar irradiation received in the location. Then, EPBT and GBPT results are evaluated for measured annual mean temperature and solar radiation data of the location. In conclusion, world future priorities are discussed since the solar PV generation, leader of renewable power capacity, does not promise to reduce emissions to zero.",

The coronavirus, COVID-19, is thought to have spread from Wuhan, China, to at least 190 countries in a three months' time. The precautions taken to fight the outbreak are forcing the world to reduce emissions with extreme slowdowns in industrial production and transportation. However, the effects of the outbreak to reduce emissions are likely to be temporary. This paper addresses EPBT and GPBT of a PV system which gives a relation between the annual power generation and total embodied energy. Table 6 and Table 8 show EPBT and GPBT calculations of the examined system for the annual generation of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. It is a fact that the performance of PV cells is directly dependent on radiation level and temperature (Chan and Phang 1987; Gow and Manning 1999; Brano et al. 2010; Bai et al. 2014; Fathi et al. 2017 ). According to the measured meteorological data, 2018 was the less efficient year among the investigation period of the study, 2014-2018, due to lower global solar radiation and annual temperature anomalies. 2018 was recorded as the second warmest year since 1971 with 1.9 \u00b0C above from 1981-2010 normal (Fig. 2) . The rise in annual mean temperature is one of the most noticeable effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions of Kocaeli city have been increasing dramatically and expected to reach 42 million tonnes CO 2eq by 2030. The local government prepared an emergency action plan called \"Kocaeli Greenhouse Gases Inventory and Climate Change Action Plan\" to turn the industry city to a green city and support the climate change goals of the country. Greenhouse Gases Inventory Report of the city shows that the city is responsible for 5% of Turkey's emissions in 2016, 25 million tonnes CO 2eq . The primary sources of these emissions are 65.3% stationary sources, 17% industry, 15% transportation, 1.4% land use and forestry and 0.9% agriculture. The urban climate change plan of the local government targets to fight 8 million tonnes of the emissions; 69% industry, 13.9% residential, 3.7% commercial, 13.1 urban transportation and 0.9% agriculture. The plan has two main targets and eight actions to reduce the energy-based emissions of all sectors.",

The results indicate that this system has saved nearly 1.2 kt CO 2eq emissions of the city and still continues to contribute savings with more than 250 ton CO 2eq /year. In recent years, net electricity consumption by commercial and industrial buildings has not been dropped below 60% of total consumption in the country (Table 9 ). If the number of the buildings with roof-type PV systems similar to the building examined in this paper increases within Target 1 of \"Kocaeli Greenhouse Gases Inventory and Climate Change Action Plan\", the city will save more than 0.9 million ton CO 2eq /year of total commercial and industrial sectors based emissions in the country. Figure 4 gives the Photovoltaic Power Potential Map of Turkey. Kocaeli, nearest neighbour of Istanbul, is in the medium potential region of the Map with a potential of nearly 1300 kWh/kWp-year. There are also many other big cities with developed commercial and/or industrial sectors in the medium and high potential region of the Map. Greenhouse Gases Inventory of the country established that emissions reached to 526.3 million ton CO 2eq / year in 2017 and 86.3% of these emissions were recorded energy based. By using net electricity consumption by sectors in Table 9 , it is likely to say that the contribution of industrial and commercial sectors was nearly 290 million ton CO 2eq /year. The map and the results of this study show that 40 million tons of these emissions can be saved by only rooftype PV system applications in industrial and commercial buildings with serious and urgent regional actions (Regional Environment Centre Turkey, 2019 and Turkish Statistical Institute, Environment and Energy 2018). From this point of view, it can be foreseen that solar energy development in all sectors and all regions to reduce energy-based emissions can improve the temperature anomalies in the red part of Fig. 2 .",

However, these systems have embodied emissions from processes of manufacturing, transportation and installation until the operation. The payback time for the embodied energy and emissions are dependent on the annual energy output in other words global solar radiation, weather conditions and PV technology. In this paper, the total embodied emissions of the roof-type PV system are estimated 549,713.68 kg CO 2eq with approximately 2.536 years of payback time, 12.68% of its lifetime. Regarding that the PV system examined in this paper was built in 2013, seven years ago, it is likely to calculate smaller embodied emissions for PV systems built with the latest solar energy technology which is in a much better shape with ongoing innovations to improve efficiency, cost and size. However, EPBT and GPBT results of the system prove the fact that temperature is a determining factor in PV system performance with longer EPBT and GPBT values due to lower annual energy output in 2018, the second warmest year of the country since 1971. This interaction between extreme temperature anomalies and solar energy which is one of the most promising renewable energy sources for a sustainable future with normal temperature anomalies and normal weather conditions shows the urgency to put local and global climate change action plans into practice without a moment's delay. Otherwise, the support of PV systems and other renewable energy systems in climate change fight may diminish with longer EPBTs and GPBTs.",

Looking at the current literature this value is reasonable for 2013 PV panel production technology when up to 3.5 years of EPBT values are considered acceptable (Bhandari et al. 2015) . Also another acceptable data (for 2013) of GPBT values-around 2.5 years-confirm the fact that the environmental benefits of PV systems are determined by annual energy generation which is strongly dependent on weather conditions and PV technology.

Evaluating this subject from this point of view, obviously adapting thin panel technologies to rooftop applications in a more efficient and an economic way will provide a better potential to save energy and prevent greenhouse gas emissions.
