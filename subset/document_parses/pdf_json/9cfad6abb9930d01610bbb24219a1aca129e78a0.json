While the evolutionary mechanisms behind tRNA gene set evolution have been investigated theoretically and computationally, direct observations of tRNA gene set evolution remain rare. Here, we report the evolution of a tRNA gene set in laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. The growth defect caused by deleting the single-copy tRNA gene, serCGA, is rapidly compensated by large-scale (45-290 kb) duplications in the chromosome. Each duplication encompasses a second, compensatory tRNA gene (serTGA) and is associated with a rise in tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool. We postulate that tRNA-Ser(CGA) elimination increases the translational demand for tRNA-Ser(UGA), a pressure relieved by increasing serTGA copy number. This work demonstrates that tRNA gene sets can evolve through duplication of existing tRNA genes, a phenomenon that may contribute to the presence of multiple, identical tRNA gene copies within genomes.",

            "text": "Even though tRNAs perform the same canonical function in all organisms -decoding 61 sense codons into 20 amino acids -tRNA gene sets vary considerably across the tree of life (Fujishima and Kanai, 2014; Marck and Grosjean, 2002) . Two aspects in which they vary are the types of tRNAs encoded and the number of gene copies encoding each type. Bacterial tRNA complements typically contain 28-46 types of tRNA, encoded by 28-120 genes (Chan and Lowe, 2016) . Elucidating the factors contributing to, and the molecular mechanisms behind, the evolution of these variations has been of long-standing interest in biology. There is general agreement that bacterial tRNA gene sets are, in conjunction with the rest of the translational machinery, shaped by selection for rapid and accurate protein synthesis ('translational efficiency'; reviewed in Gingold and Pilpel, 2011) . Efficient translation is an important determinant of bacterial growth rate, with more efficient protein production enabling faster growth and division (Kurland, 1996; Kurland and Ehrenberg, 1987) . tRNAs mainly contribute to translational efficiency during elongation, the stage of translation where codons are sequentially matched to aminoacylated (charged) tRNAs (reviewed in Gingold and Pilpel, 2011; Rodnina, 2018) . Codon-tRNA matching occurs by a trial and error process; tRNAs -in the form of ternary complexes (Bensch et al., 1991) -are stochastically sampled from the available pool. The speed with which a matching tRNA is selected depends on the absolute and relative concentration of tRNAs that match the codon; codons matched by more abundant tRNAs are expected, on average, to be translated more quickly than those matched by rarer tRNAs (reviewed in Plotkin and Kudla, 2011) . Given that the formation of codon-tRNA matches by stochastic sampling is the ratelimiting step of elongation (Varenne et al., 1984) , any factors affecting the matching process are likely to influence the evolution of bacterial tRNA gene sets. Examples include variations in codon-tRNA matching patterns and codon bias. Both of these are discussed in more detail below.",

            "text": "Codon-tRNA matching patterns are complex; some tRNAs match, and hence translate, more than one synonymous codon (Crick, 1966; Ikemura, 1981) . This expanded translational capacity is the result of relaxed base pairing between the first base of the tRNA anticodon (tRNA position 34) and third base of the codon (codon position 3). In this binding position, a number of non-standard, 'wobble' pairings are permitted (reviewed in Agris et al., 2018) . Most wobble pairings involve post-transcriptionally, enzymatically modified bases in the anticodon stem-and-loop region of tRNAs (Boccaletto et al., 2018; Machnicka et al., 2016) . These post-transcriptional modifications affect the binding capacity and/or accuracy of a large fraction of bacterial tRNAs (Bj\u00f6 rk and Hagervall, 2014; Manickam et al., 2016) . Hence, the set of post-transcriptional modification pathways active within a bacterial species affects the codon-tRNA matching pattern and, in turn, is expected to influence tRNA gene set composition. Indeed, various post-transcriptional modification pathways have been shown to co-vary with tRNA repertoires (Diwan and Agashe, 2018; Grosjean et al., 2010; .",

            "text": "Codon bias refers to the preferential use of some synonymous codons over others. A number of hypotheses exist regarding the evolutionary origins and consequences of preferred codons (reviewed in Plotkin and Kudla, 2011) , one of which is the optimization of codon-tRNA matching during elongation (Berg and Kurland, 1997; Bulmer, 1991; Bulmer, 1987; Higgs and Ran, 2008; Rocha, 2004) . There are several lines of support for this hypothesis. Firstly, different codons have been demonstrated to be translated at different rates in yeast, with more frequent codons generally being translated more quickly (Gardin et al., 2014) . Secondly, codon and tRNA abundances have been observed to co-vary across many bacterial genomes (reviewed in Ikemura, 1985) , particularly under conditions where rapid translation is required (e.g., during rapid growth [Dong et al., 1996; Emilsson and Kurland, 1990] , in highly expressed genes [Ikemura, 1981] , or among bacteria with faster growth rates [Sharp et al., 2010] ). Thirdly, a number of studies have demonstrated an increase in protein expression when codon-tRNA co-variation is strengthened, either by optimizing synonymous codon use (S\u00f8rensen et al., 1989; Zhou et al., 2004) or by the addition of exogenous tRNAs (Gu et al., 2004; Misra and Reeves, 1985) .",

Overall, theoretical and computational studies are consistent with the optimization of translational efficiency by the streamlining of tRNA gene sets; bacterial growth rate correlates with fewer tRNA types encoded by more gene copies (Ran and Higgs, 2010; Rocha, 2004) .",

Hypothetically, tRNA gene sets can evolve by several different mechanisms. Surplus tRNA genes may be lost (by deletion), while tRNA genes may be acquired from external sources (by horizontal gene transfer), or from within the genome (by duplication events). Additionally, the identity of existing tRNA genes may be altered by the acquisition of anticodon mutations (anticodon switching). Thus far, most evidence for the above routes of tRNA gene set evolution is indirect: phylogenetic analyses provide evidence of the flexibility of bacterial tRNA gene sets by loss, gain (both by horizontal gene transfer and duplication), and anticodon switch events (Diwan and Agashe, 2018; McDonald et al., 2015; Tremblay-Savard et al., 2015; Wald and Margalit, 2014; Withers et al., 2006) . An anticodon switch event has also been directly observed in laboratory yeast; Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations in which the gene encoding tRNA-Arg(CCU) had been removed were repeatedly rescued by a C!T mutation in one of eleven gene copies encoding tRNA-Arg(UCU) (Yona et al., 2013) . While the aforementioned study demonstrates the power of experimental evolution to provide insight into the evolution of tRNA gene sets, there remains a shortage of empirical studies directly investigating the evolution of bacterial tRNA gene sets and translation.",

We compensate the resulting growth defect during a 13-day serial transfer evolution experiment and show that the genetic basis of compensation is large-scale (45-290 kb), tandem duplications encompassing a second tRNA gene (serTGA). Using a bacterial adaptation of YAMAT-seq (a method of mature tRNA pool deep-sequencing originally developed for use in human cell lines [Shigematsu et al., 2017] ), we demonstrate that each duplication event is accompanied by an increase in tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool.

            "text": "The P. fluorescens SBW25 tRNA gene set Isolated from the leaf of a sugar beet plant, P. fluorescens SBW25 is a non-pathogenic bacterium that is frequently used as a model system in evolutionary biology. The SBW25 genome (Silby et al., 2009 ) is predicted by GtRNAdb 2.0 (Chan and Lowe, 2016) to contain 67 tRNA genes ( Figure 1A ; Supplementary file 1). The RNA product of one of these genes (cysGCA-2) is predicted to form a secondary structure that deviates significantly from the cloverleaf structure typical of canonical tRNAs (Chan and Lowe, 2019) . Hence, the SBW25 tRNA gene set consists of 66 canonical tRNA genes. These encode 39 different tRNA types, 14 of which are encoded by multiple (between two and five) gene copies. Of these 14 types, 12 are encoded by gene copies that are identical in sequence; only tRNA-Asn(GUU) and tRNA-fMet(CAU) are encoded by multiple gene copies with different sequences. Figure 1 . The tRNA gene set and serine translation system in P. fluorescens SBW25. (A) Genomic location of the 66 canonical (grey arrows) and one non-canonical (cysGCA-2; black arrow) tRNA genes. Four tRNA genes encode seryl-tRNAs (red arrows). One of these, serCGA, is predicted to encode a non-essential tRNA type. Six other tRNA genes encoding the remaining five non-essential tRNA types (green arrows). Replication origin and terminus are indicated. (B) The predicted translational relationship between seryl-tRNAs and serine codons. The six theoretically possible seryl-tRNA anticodons are listed on the left (red = present in SBW25, grey = absent, * = theoretically capable of translating codon UCG), and six cognate codons are listed in column 2. Connections signify a theoretical match (solid black lines = Watson Crick pairing; black dotted lines = wobble pairing through posttranscriptional modification; grey dotted line = G:U wobble pairing). Columns 3 and 4 list codon use as a percentage of serine and all codons, respectively (Chan and Lowe, 2016) . Anticodons and codons are 5'!3'. The online version of this article includes the following figure supplement(s) for figure 1: The 39 different tRNA types identified in SBW25 must together be capable of translating all 61 sense codons. To investigate SBW25 codon-tRNA matching patterns, a combination of current wobble rules (reviewed in Agris et al., 2018) and tRNA post-transcriptional modification prediction tools (Boccaletto et al., 2018; Machnicka et al., 2016; Panwar and Raghava, 2014) was applied. Evidence for the translation of multiple synonymous codons was found for 28 of 39 tRNA types (Supplementary file 1). The proposed SBW25 codon-tRNA matching patterns indicate that the 39 tRNA types consist of a core set of 33 essential types (thatwhich together are theoretically capable of translating all 61 codons) and six non-essential types (whose cognate codons are also predicted to be translated by an essential tRNA type; Figure 1A ; Supplementary file 1). The six non-essential types are candidates for suboptimal tRNA gene set construction; their apparent functional redundancy suggests that they can be eliminated, while their retention indicates that elimination may be detrimental.",

The engineering process was performed two independent times, yielding biological replicate strains DserCGA-1 and DserCGA-2. A third round of allelic exchange gave rise to an engineering control strain, SBW25-eWT. Successful deletion of serCGA demonstrates that it is not essential for survival; at least one other tRNA can translate codon UCG. serCGA deletion results in an immediately obvious growth defect on King's medium B (KB), a rich medium that supports rapid growth and hence rapid translation (King et al., 1954) . Deletion of serCGA results in visibly smaller colonies on KB agar ( Figure 2A) . Compared with SBW25, DserCGA-1 shows a reduction maximum growth rate in liquid KB (two-sample t-test p=1.18\u00c210 \u00c06 , Figure 2B and C) and elongated cells during growth in liquid KB (Figure 2-figure  supplement 1A) . Further, both independent serCGA deletion mutants lose when grown in direct, 1:1 competition with the neutrally marked SBW25-lacZ in liquid KB (one sample t-tests p<0.0001; Figure 2D ). The observed growth defect is much less pronounced in minimal media, which supports slower growth and translation; SBW25 and DserCGA-1 colonies are similar sizes on M9 agar ( Figure 2E) , and no negative effects on growth or cell morphology were detected in liquid M9 ( Figure 2F DserCGA and SBW25-lacZ indicate a slight negative effect of serCGA deletion in liquid M9 (one sample t-tests p=0.06882 and 0.00908; Figure 2H ).",

The generation of a viable, but suboptimal, tRNA gene set upon serCGA deletion from SBW25 is consistent with the predictions of the previous section: that serCGA is not essential for translation, but it contributes to translational speed. It should, however, be noted that serCGA deletion may increase intracellular serine levels, which could lead to toxic effects on growth. Indeed, significant increases in intracellular serine have been shown to affect the growth and division of E. coli cells growing in rich, serine-containing media (Kriner and Subramaniam, 2020; Zhang et al., 2010; Zhang and Newman, 2008) .",

Close manual inspection revealed no evidence of any point mutations in any copy of the serTGA gene or promoter sequence, in any of the evolved isolates (Supplementary file 5), meaning that each duplication strain contains a second, wild-type copy of serTGA.

However, there are also 44 protein-coding genes in the shared duplication segment, any of which could contribute to the compensatory effect. We therefore tested whether a plasmid-based increase in serTGA expression can compensate for serCGA loss. To this end, the serCGA and serTGA genes were individually amplified from SBW25, and each ligated into the expression vector pSXn (giving pSXn-CGA and pSXn-TGA; Supplementary file 2). This placed the expression of the tRNA gene under the control of an isopropyl-\u00df-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible tac promoter (de Boer et al., 1983; Owen and Ackerley, 2011) .",

To investigate within-lineage heterogeneity more closely, additional large colonies were isolated from day 13 of each mutant lineage and tested by PCR for the presence of the duplication junction(s) previously identified in the lineage. The results provide evidence for genotypic heterogeneity in compensated isolates from three of the four mutant lineages (M2, M3, and M4; Figure 4 -figure supplement 2). Three differently sized PCR products were detected among the four isolates from lineage M2, demonstrating the presence of at least three distinct duplication fragments in the day 13 population. A mixture of compensated genotypes was also detected in lineages M3 and M4, with duplication junctions M3junct1 and M4junct1 amplifying in only three (of four) and two (of four) isolates, respectively.

In our results, three tRNA types consistently align a very low proportion of reads (<0.0001): Phe-GAA, Glu-UUC, and Ile2-CAU.

Given their low read numbers, and non-central role in our experiment, these three tRNA types were removed from downstream statistical analyses. The strength of the YAMAT-seq procedure lies in comparing changes in mature tRNA levels across genotypes. Any issues with efficiencies are expected to remain relatively constant across the strains in this experiment, allowing changes in relative tRNA type abundances to be detected. To this end, DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) was used to compare normalized expression levels of 36 mature tRNA types -all SBW25 tRNA types except for Phe-GAA, Glu-UUC, and Ile2-CAU -in pairs of strains. Firstly, the effect of deleting serCGA was investigated by comparing tRNA sequences from each of the two independent serCGA deletion strains with those in SBW25 ( Figure 5A) . The absence of tRNA-Ser(CGA) from both deletion mutants demonstrates that (i) tRNA-Ser(CGA) is encoded solely by the deleted serCGA gene, and (ii) under the conditions tested, tRNA-Ser(CGA) is indeed a non-essential tRNA type in SBW25 (i.e., can be eliminated without causing death). The serCGA deletion mutants also showed consistently lower levels of tRNA-Thr(CGU) (DESeq2 adjusted p<0.001), a result that may reflect a close metabolic relationship between threonine and serine (Sawers, 1998) . No significant differences were detected between the two deletion mutants (DESeq2 adjusted p>0.1).",

Importantly, no differences in tRNA pools were detected in the wild type control lineage (W1-L versus SBW25; DESeq2 adjusted p>0.1). Contrastingly, a single consistent, statistically significant difference was observed across the five mutant lineage isolates: the level of tRNA-Ser(UGA) was 2.06-to 2.60-fold higher than in the DserCGA ancestor (DESeq2 adjusted p<0.0001). A number of other tRNA types co-vary with the rise in tRNA-Ser(UGA) ( Figure 5B ). While none of these differences is statistically significant in all strains, they are consistently in the same direction (i.e., increase or decrease). Thus, while the main effect of serCGA deletion and serTGA duplication is the loss of tRNA-Ser(CGA) and elevation of tRNA-Ser(UGA) respectively, other more subtle effects are likely to exist. Finally, pairwise comparisons between the duplication strains reveal some tRNA pool differences between the different duplication strains ( Figure 5-figure supplement 1) . Interestingly, no differences were detected between strain M4-L and any of the other duplication strains (DESeq2 adjusted p>0.3), indicating that the four additional tRNA genes duplicated in M4-L do not contribute to the mature tRNA pool. It is possible that the duplication junction in M4-L -which lies 112 bp upstream of the duplicated argTCT-hisGTG-leuTAG-hisGTG tRNA genes -truncates a promoter, leading to little or no expression of the duplicated copies. This result highlights that tRNA gene copy number does not always correlate with mature tRNA level.",

Overall, the average time taken to match any given codon is dependent on the availability of the corresponding charged tRNA type (s); codons matched by a higher proportion of tRNAs will, on average, be translated more quickly than those matched by rarer tRNAs (Varenne et al., 1984) . To illustrate, consider the serine codons and seryl-tRNAs from our experiments; codon UCA is translated by tRNA-Ser(UGA), while codon UCG can theoretically be translated by tRNA-Ser(CGA) or tRNA-Ser(UGA) (see Figure 1B) . When both tRNA types are present, UCG is matched by a higher proportion of tRNAs than UCA and hence is expected to be translated more quickly, on average.",

According to these calculations, serCGA deletion increases the time taken to translate UCG by a factor of four (mean UCG translation times of 49.4 and 207 in wild type and serCGA deletion tRNA gene sets, respectively). Subsequent serTGA duplication elevates the proportion of tRNA-Ser(UGA), partially restoring UCG translation time (mean UCG translation times of 207, 86.9, and 49.4 in the serCGA deletion strains, wild types, and serTGA duplication strains, respectively). The cumulative impact of changing UCG translation speeds on translation and, ultimately, growth logically depends on how frequently the UCG codon is used. In SBW25, UCG is a relatively high use codon, occurring approximately 4.5 times more frequently than UCA (see Figure 1B ; Chan and Lowe, 2016) . To account for UCG codon bias, we estimated the average time required by each strain to translate an mRNA that reflects the relative UCG/UCA codon usage of SBW25. Using the same principle as in Equation 1, Equation 2a and b, the average time taken to translate the mRNA (t mRNA ) is calculated as the sum of the time taken to translate one UCA codon plus the time taken to translate 4.5 UCG codons (Equation 3).",

            "text": "The evolutionary and molecular mechanisms by which different tRNA gene sets emerge have been of consistent, long-standing interest (periodically reviewed in Gingold and Pilpel, 2011; Ikemura, 1985; Rak et al., 2018) . A multitude of theoretical studies have focused on various aspects of tRNA gene set evolution, highlighting roles for post-transcriptional modifications and codon bias (Bulmer, 1987; Higgs and Ran, 2008; Ikemura, 1981; Ran and Higgs, 2010; Rocha, 2004; Sharp et al., 2010) . Phylogenetic analyses have provided evidence of bacterial tRNA gene set evolution by four main routes: (i) tRNA gene loss through deletion events, (ii) tRNA gene acquisition through horizontal gene transfer, (iii) tRNA gene acquisition by within-genome duplication events, and (iv) tRNA gene changes as a result of anticodon switching (Diwan and Agashe, 2018; Marck and Grosjean, 2002; McDonald et al., 2015; Tremblay-Savard et al., 2015; Wald and Margalit, 2014; Withers et al., 2006) . In this work, we provide direct, empirical evidence for one of these routes: tRNA gene acquisition by within-genome duplication events. Loss of the single-copy tRNA gene serCGA was compensated by large-scale, tandem duplications that increase the copy number of tRNA gene serTGA, leading to elevation of tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool.",

While this hypothesis is consistent with our experimental results, it raises the question of why P. fluorescens SBW25 might retain a copy of serCGA in the natural, plant environment; given that selection for translational efficiency favours fewer tRNA types encoded by more tRNA gene copies (Ran and Higgs, 2010; Rocha, 2004) , one might expect serCGA elimination in favour of multiple serTGA gene copies. However, serCGA is frequently retained in bacterial genomes; a study of 319 bacteria from different genera indicates a serCGA retention rate of~70%, with retention correlating with higher UCG usage (Wald and Margalit, 2014) . What is the advantage of retaining tRNA-Ser(CGA) over simply encoding higher levels of tRNA-Ser(UGA)?",

Indeed, changing the anticodon of E. coli tRNA-Ser(UGA) from UGA to CGA has been shown to increase the efficiency of UCG translational in vitro (Takai et al., 1999b) . Further, any difference in translational efficiencies may depend on environmental conditions; temperature, acidity, and ion concentration all alter the stability of RNA base pairings (Nikolova and Al-Hashimi, 2010; Serra et al., 2002) . Overall more efficient translation of UCG by tRNA-Ser(CGA) in some environments could conceivably offset the cost of serCGA retention, particularly in bacteria with high UCG usage.",

            "text": "The possibility that restoration of serCGA may further increase the fitness of the serTGA duplication strains could be investigated by continuing the evolution experiment past day 13. This is because, in addition to increasing fitness, the duplication of serTGA has provided a possible route by which serCGA could be regained, and thus the original P. fluorescens SBW25 tRNA gene set restored. Specifically, one of the two copies of serTGA could acquire a T!C transition at tRNA position 34, changing the gene from serTGA to serCGA (i.e., an anticodon switch event). In order for such a mutation to spread through the population, it must encode a functional tRNA. This requires the new, hypothetical tRNA-Ser(CGA) to be recognized by seryl-tRNA ligase (SerRS), the enzyme that adds serine to all types of serine-carrying tRNAs in the cell (for a review of tRNA ligase function, see Ibba and Soll, 2000) . Recognition of seryl-tRNAs by SerRS depends not on the tRNA sequence or the anticodon, but rather on the characteristic three-dimensional shape of seryl-tRNAs (Lenhard et al., 1999) . Therefore, even though serTGA and the original serCGA encode tRNAs with very different sequences (see Figure 1-figure supplement 1A) , it is plausible that the new, hypothetical serCGA could form a functional tRNA (see Figure 1-figure supplement 1B) . Indeed, a UGA!CGA anticodon switch alters the translational capacity of E. coli tRNA-Ser(UGA) from codon UCA to UCG in vitro (Takai et al., 1999a; Takai et al., 1999b) . Notably, none of the five genome sequenced, mutant lineage, day 13 isolates shows evidence of anticodon switch events in either copy of serTGA (see Supplementary file 5); whether anticodon switching occurs across a longer evolutionary time scale remains to be seen.",

Extensive work has shown that large-scale tandem duplications occur at extremely high rates in bacteria; for example, in an unselected overnight culture, around 10% of Salmonella cells reportedly carry a duplication of some sort, with 0.005-3% carrying a duplication of a particular locus (Anderson and Roth, 1981; Anderson and Roth, 1977; Reams et al., 2010) .

A variety of mechanisms have been reported to underpin duplication formation, including (i) RecA-mediated, unequal recombination, (ii) RecA independent unequal recombination, and (iii) errant topoisomerase or gyrase activity (Reams et al., 2014; Reams and Roth, 2015; Shyamala et al., 1990) .

Two of the five mutant lineage isolates in this work (M2-L, M3-L) have endpoints in~1.5 kb direct, imperfect repeats at 4.12 Mb and 4.31 Mb of the SBW25 chromosome, suggesting that the~192 kb duplication fragment they contain arose by RecA-mediated, unequal recombination between these regions. The duplication fragments in the other three mutant lineage isolates (M1-L, M2-Lop, and M4-L) show no obvious signs of homology between their endpoints (Table 1) , indicating an alternative mechanistic origin. Overall, the diversity in duplication fragment endpoints -location and degree of homology -in this study are indicative of a range of mechanistic origins.",

The P. fluorescens SBW25 genome contains many of these types of repeats dispersed around the chromosome, including five nearly identical rRNA operons and three highly similar rhs genes (Silby et al., 2009 ). In addition, there are hundreds of smaller repeats throughout the genome, including REPINs and tRNA genes (Bertels and Rainey, 2011; Silby et al., 2009) . Errant recombination between any of these repeated sequences could plausibly generate large-scale duplications, meaning that almost any region of the SBW25 chromosome -and therefore many tRNA genes -could conceivably be duplicated via homologous recombination. It has previously been noted that the region surrounding the SBW25 replication terminus appears to be more susceptible to evolutionary change than the rest of the chromosome (Silby et al., 2009) . This variable region extends approximately 1.4 Mb on either side of the terminus, engulfing 28 tRNA genes (including serTGA; see Figure 1B and Supplementary file 4). It seems probable that, while the copy number of many tRNA genes could feasibly be elevated by large-scale duplications, the tRNA genes surrounding the SBW25 replication terminus may be more prone to evolutionary change by duplication.",

Duplications are lost in~1% of cells per generation in Salmonella cultures, in the absence of selection (Anderson and Roth, 1981) . Due to their combined ease of gain and loss, it has been suggested that duplications serve as fleeting evolutionary solutions to transient phenotypic challenges (Sonti and Roth, 1989) ; they occur at high frequency without adversely affecting the long-term structure and integrity of the genome. The reported instability of large-scale duplications raises questions about the long-term fate of the duplications seen during this experiment.

One is that duplication fragments encompassing serTGA may continue to arise and be lost, with duplication strains eventually reaching a stable level within the population (Reams et al., 2010) . In this scenario, while individual large-scale duplications would continually rise and fall, they would remain the dominant evolutionary solution in the population. A second possibility is that progressively smaller (and inherently more stable) duplication fragments may arise, perhaps eventually resulting in a duplication fragment comprised only of serTGA and its promoter. Such smaller duplication fragments may arise either from a serCGA deletion mutant (by rarer duplication events between more proximate DNA sequences) or from a duplication strain (by remodelling of the existing duplication fragment). Once a smaller, more stable fragment is dominant in the population, one copy of serTGA could conceivably change to serCGA through an anticodon switch event (see earlier discussion). A third possible outcome of continuing the evolution experiment is that, over time, a more stable mutation may arise, independently of the duplication fragments. Possible examples include (i) point mutation(s) in the promoter of serTGA, leading to increased serTGA expression without requiring additional gene copies, (ii) mutation(s) that extend the translational capacity of seryl-tRNAs to translate (or, to better translate) UCG codons, and (iii) synonymous point mutation(s) in highly expressed UCG codon(s), lowering the translational demand for tRNA-Ser(UGA). Should any of these more stable mutations arise, they would be expected to displace large-scale duplications -and in some cases, the additional serTGA copy -as the dominant evolutionary strategy in the population.",

Two colonies from every strain were picked. Each of the eight chosen colonies became the founder of one evolutionary lineage. This resulted in four independent wild type lineages (W1-W4) and four mutant lineages (M1-M4).A medium control lineage was also included. The numbers of parallel lineages were chosen based on the available laboratory resources. Each colony was inoculated into 4 ml KB in a 13 ml plastic tube and incubated overnight at 28\u02daC (shaking). Each grown culture (day 0) was vortexed for 1 min, and 100 ml was used to inoculate 10 ml KB in a 50 ml Falcon tube (28\u02daC, shaking, 24 hr). Every 24 hr thereafter, 1% of each culture was transferred to a fresh 10 ml KB in a 50 ml Falcon tube, and a sample of the population frozen at \u00c080\u02daC. The experiment was continued until day 15. Populations were periodically dilution plated on KB agar to check for changes in colony size.",

Three independent replicates (based on replicate numbers reported in Shigematsu et al., 2017) of nine strains (i.e., 27 samples) were grown to mid-exponential phase in 250 ml flasks containing 20 ml KB. Total RNA was isolated from 1.5 ml aliquots (TRIzol Max Bacterial RNA isolation kit). For each sample, 10 mg of total RNA was subjected to tRNA deacylation treatment -incubation in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) for 40 min at 37\u02daC. Each deacylated RNA sample was desalted and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Y-shaped, DNA/RNA hybrid adapters (Eurofins; Shigematsu et al., 2017) were ligated to the conserved, exposed 5'-NCCA-3' and 3'-inorganic phosphate-5' ends of uncharged tRNAs using T4 RNA ligase 2. Ligation products were reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase and amplified by 11 rounds of PCR with Phusion. One of the 27 sample-specific indices listed in Supplementary file 7 was added to each of the 27 reactions. The quality and quantity of each PCR product were checked using an Agilent DNA 7500 kit on a Bioanalyzer, and samples combined in equimolar amounts into one tube. The mixture was run on a 5% native polyacrylaminde gel, and the bands between 180 and 250 bp excised. DNA was extracted in deionized water overnight, and agarose removed by centrifugation through filter paper. The final product was sequenced at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology (Ploen, Germany). Single-end, 150 bp reads were generated with an Illumina NextSeq 550 Output v2.5 kit.

Exact barcode matches were used in order to minimize the misallocation of reads as a result of barcode errors introduced during the sequencing process. The resulting 27 raw read files, each containing a minimum of 637,037 reads, were analysed using Geneious (version 11.1.4). Reads of the expected length (80-151 bp) were extracted (resulting in 99.99% read retention). The extracted reads were assembled to a set of 42 reference tRNA sequences from SBW25 (Supplementary file 6) . During assembly, up to 10% mismatches, gaps of < 3 bp, and up to five ambiguities were allowed per read. Reads that aligned equally well to more than one reference sequence were discarded in order to minimize misallocation of reads to similar reference sequences. Finally, the unused reads for each sample were de novo aligned, and the resulting contigs checked to ensure that none contained substantial numbers of tRNA reads (particularly seryl-tRNAs). The above sorting and assembly parameters were initially based on those reported by Shigematsu et al., 2017 and were subsequently refined for the SBW25 data. Following assembly, the within-sample proportion of reads aligned to each tRNA type was calculated, and mean mature tRNA proportions were calculated for each strain across the three replicates (Supplementary file 7) . DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) was used in R (version 3.6.0) to detect tRNA expression differences between pairs of strains (see source data file 5). DESeq2 corrects for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Anders and Huber, 2010) . Three tRNA types (Glu-UUC, Ile2-CAU, and Phe-GAA) were removed from the analyses due to very low read numbers (<0.01% of the total reads per strain).",

This 245 bp segment encompasses the serTGA gene and~155 bp of the upstream region, which is expected to contain the serTGA promoter. Any point mutation in either serTGA copy in the duplication strains (M1-L, M2-L, M2-Lop, M3-L, and M4-L) is expected to be reflected by a drop in the proportion of the dominant base (to around 0.5). For example, if in M1-L one serTGA copy had gained a C!T point mutation in tRNA position 34 (i.e., an anticodon switch event; see Discussion), one would expect approximately half the 214 reads covering base 4,163,669 to contain a T, and the other half to carry a C. Therefore, the dominant base proportion would be expected to drop to~0.5. No evidence was found of any mutations in any copy of serTGA or its promoter; all 245 bp were covered by a minimum of 127 reads in each duplication strain, with at least 94% of reads at each position carrying the dominant base.",

These include 42 unique primary tRNA sequences, each of which is listed in this file. These 42 sequences are used as references to align the YAMAT-seq data in this work (see Supplementary file 7). Note that the list of 42 sequences includes one likely pseudo tRNA (11_Cys-GCA-2-1). This sequence is not predicted to form a tRNA with conserved cloverleaf secondary structure (Chan and Lowe, 2019) . Further, no YAMAT-seq sequences were aligned to this reference sequence in any sample. We conclude that Cys-GCA-2-1 does not form part of the functional mature tRNA pool in SBW25. In addition, the serCGA sequence (30_Ser-CGA-1-1) is expected to be absent from 21 of 27 samples (samples 2-8, 11-17, and 20-26) ; this tRNA is encoded by serCGA (the gene that was deleted by genetic engineering in this work and remains absent in all derived strains). As expected, almost no reads were obtained for this reference sequence in these 21 samples. The very low numbers of Ser-CGA reads obtained in some of these samples (e.g., two reads in sample 20, the third replicate of DserCGA-1) are likely to be barcode misallocations from one of the six SBW25 or W1-L samples. . Supplementary file 7. YAMAT-seq data showing elimination of tRNA-Ser(CGA) followed by elevating of tRNA-Ser(UGA) expression in each of the five duplication isolates. The first tab contains index details and a summary of the raw YAMAT-seq reads (GEO accession number GSE144791; Edgar et al., 2002) for each of the 27 samples (three replicates of nine strains): a minimum of 636,995 reads of the expected size (80-151 bp) was obtained per sample. In each case, between 86.4% and 93.0% of these aligned to the list of 42x reference SBW25 tRNA sequences (provided in Supplementary file 6). The subsequent nine tabs contain the YAMAT-seq data for each of the nine strains tested (SBW25, DserCGA-1, DserCGA-2, W1-L, M1-L, M2-L, M2-Lop, M3-L, and M4-L). Each tab contains (i) the numbers of reads for 42 reference tRNAs, for three replicates (left), (ii) numbers of reference reads for 39 tRNA types in SBW25 (e.g., tRNA-Asn-GTT is the sum of reference sequences 7_Asn-GTT-1-1 and 8_Asn-GTT-2-1; middle), (iii) the proportion of each tRNA type in the mature tRNA pool for each of the three samples (right), and (iv) a scatter plot of the YAMAT-seq proportions versus the proportion of the tRNA gene set encoding the tRNA type. Blue = tRNA-Ser (CGA), green = tRNA-Ser(UGA). The final tab contains information regarding the unused reads for each sample.",

In each of the five mutant lineage isolates a large, direct, tandem duplication was identified at around 4.16 Mb in the SBW25 chromosome (Figure 4A-B, Figure 4-figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 3). No evidence of any such duplications was found in either of the wild type control isolates. In addition to the large duplications, one synonymous point mutation was identified in one mutant lineage: in the carbohydrate metabolism gene edd of M2-L, codon 17 is changed from CGC to CGA (both encoding arginine; Supplementary file 3). This mutation was not identified in any other isolate, including the second isolate from the M2 lineage (M2-Lop), and is not considered likely to contribute to the compensatory phenotype of M2-L. A combination of computational analyses, PCR, and Sanger sequencing was used to determine the precise region of duplication in four of five isolates. The duplications range in size from 45 kb (in M1-L) to 290 kb (in M4-L), and occur between 4.05 Mb and 4.34 Mb of the chromosome (",

A list of 62 theoretically possible tRNA types (61 elongator tRNAs and one initiator tRNA) is provided. Of these, 23 are absent from the SBW25 tRNA gene set. Codon-tRNA matching patterns are based on the G-U wobble rule (Crick, 1966) , and post-transcriptional modifications predicted using a combination of MODOMICS (Boccaletto et al., 2018) , tRNAmod (Panwar and Raghava, 2014) , and tRNAmodpred (Machnicka et al., 2016) . Following current wobble rules (described in Agris et al., 2018) and the predicted post-transcriptional modifications, the 39 tRNA types present in SBW25 are split into 33 theoretically essential types (pink highlighting) and six theoretically non-essential types (green highlighting). Gene copy numbers and genome-wide proportions of codon use (from GtRNAdb; Chan and Lowe, 2016) are listed for each tRNA type present. Further notes are provided where appropriate.. Supplementary file 2. List of strains, plasmids, oligonucleotides, and duplication junctions used in this study.. Supplementary file 3. Complete list of mutations predicted from the whole genome sequencing of isolates from day 13 of the evolution experiment. Whole genome sequence data (Illumina NextSeq, 150 bp, paired-end reads; SRA accession number: PRJNA558233) were obtained for seven strains from day 13 of the evolution experiment: W1-L, W3-L (each derived from two independent SBW25 control lineages), M1-L, M2-L, M2-Lop, M3-L, and M4-L (each derived from four independent serCGA deletion lineages). A minimum of 4.5 million raw reads was obtained for each sample, and these were aligned to the P. fluorescens SBW25 genome sequence (Silby et al., 2009 ) and subsequently analysed using a combination of breseq (Barrick et al., 2014) and Geneious. This file provides a summary and a full report of the mutations predicted in each isolate. In addition to the large tandem duplications detailed in Table 1 , two unique point mutations were identified: W3-L carries a non-synonymous point mutation in ytfH (encoding a probable transcriptional regulator), and M2-L carries a synonymous point mutation in edd (encoding phosphogluconate dehydratase). There is evidence for some non-ubiquitous deletions in repetitive, intergenic, DNA elements in M1-L, M2-L, M2-Lop, and M4-L. These deletions affect areas outside of the large duplication regions. Some putative mutations were identified in all (or most) isolates, many of which have also been identified in unrelated experiments (i.e., are likely to be present in the starting strain; Gallie et al., 2015 , Gallie et al., 2019 . As such, these putative mutations are not expected to be relevant for the fitness effects described in this manuscript. ",
