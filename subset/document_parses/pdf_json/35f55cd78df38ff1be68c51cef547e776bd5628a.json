Viruses have been reported to cause 2,000,000 human deaths annually world-wide [3] . To date, the optimal approach to prevent viral infections is vaccination. Unfortunately, there are not enough effective vaccines against various viruses and their variations at present, suggesting the emergency to develop highly effective drugs to prevent viruses from entering host cells for replication. Currently, several chemical drugs are available for the clinical treatment of some virus diseases. For example, acyclovir is established as a popular antiviral drug in clinical practice to treat diseases such as HBV and HCV [4] . Another commonly used antiviral drug is ganciclovir, which is effective for treating varicella and other infections in children [5] . However, research on the efficacy of these chemical drugs has revealed their unavoidable side effects on normal human cells and tissues, especially for children [6] , thus limiting their wide application in clinical treatments and suggesting the imperative need to develop new effective and safe antiviral drugs.

Specifically, viruses attach to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane using the attachment proteins in the capsid or the glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope, and this interaction specificity determines the host cells that can be infected by a particular kind of virus. Basically, only the nucleic acid of bacteriophages enters the host cell, while the capsid remains outside the cell. The viruses of animals and some plants can enter cells through endocytosis, with the entire virus being surrounded and engulfed by cell membranes. When the viral envelope fuses directly with the cell membranes, the enveloped viruses will enter their host cells. Once inside the host cells, the viral capsid is degraded, leading to the release of the viral nucleic acid, which then becomes available for replication and transcription. The replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use the enzymes and proteins of host cells to produce additional DNA, which is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), and then used for direct protein synthesis. RNA viruses usually use the RNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA as well as mRNA. The last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions produced in the host cells, allowing the infection of adjacent cells and repetition of self-replication cycles.

After an incubation period, the virus is allowed to attach to the cells, and the monolayers are covered with a nutrient medium agar. After a period of further incubation, the original infected cells release the virus progeny, and the presence of the gel restricts the spread to neighboring cells, leading to the formation of a zone of infected cells called a plaque, which becomes large enough and visible to the naked eye under room temperature conditions. The titer of a virus stock can be calculated in plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL), which is the exact value of the viral infectivity.

However, whether traditional QDs have antiviral ability is largely unknown, and our group has done some research on this issue. For instance, Du et al. have investigated the antiviral effect of glutathione (GSH) capped CdTe QDs by using pseudorabies virus (PRV) as a testing model [43] . After systematical investigation by one-step growth curve, MTT assay, and fluorescence colocalization analysis, CdTe QDs were shown to alter the structure of the viral surface proteins and inhibit the PRV from entering host cells. Meanwhile, the release of Cd 2+ from CdTe QDs was also found to decrease the virus number that infected the host cells. Both the surface charge and size of QDs were identified to have significant anti-PRV effect, with higher inhibitory efficacy for positively charged QDs than negatively charged QDs. Additionally, the bigger the QD size, the higher the antiviral ability. For the toxicity of QDs, our group further explored the antiviral effect of lower toxic QDs, such as Ag 2 S NCs and carbon dots. Du et al. have demonstrated that Ag 2 S NCs had excellent viral inhibitory ability with a different mechanism from other functional nanoparticles [44] (Fig. 1) . The viral inhibitory mechanism can be divided into two main categories based on viral infection, which starts from virion adhesion or binding to the surface receptors of host cells, followed by penetration and viral replication. Accordingly, effective blocking of viral attachment and entry can produce a remarkable prophylactic effect against viral infectious diseases, and the other strategy is focused on inhibition of viral replication and budding. Previous experimental results have shown that Ag 2 S NCs treatment can not only inhibit the synthesis of viral negativestrand RNA and viral budding, but also positively regulate the generation of IFN-stimulated genes and the expression of proinflammation cytokines, which might prevent the infection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Moreover, the Ag 2 S NCs were also shown to have comparable virus inhibitory effect on other RNA viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Consistent with the result for PEDV, Ag 2 S NCs displayed inhibitory effects on the viral protein expression level of PRRSV.

Our group has developed a facile and cost-effective method to prepare uniform and stable carbon dots (CDs) with antiviral properties [45] (Fig. 2) , and investigated their effects on viral reproduction by using PRV and PRRSV as the test models of DNA virus and RNA virus, respectively. Experimental results showed that CDs can significantly inhibit the multiplication of both PRV and PRRSV. The treatment of CDs can also dramatically induce the production of endogenous interferon and the expression of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs), both of which can inhibit virus replication. Additionally, we prepared a kind of blue and cyan fluorescent CDs, which could strongly inhibit PRV, and the antiviral mechanism was demonstrated by RNA exaction and RT-qPCR assays. The CDs were shown to greatly influence the innate immune response of host cells by stimulating them to produce more interferons (IFNs), which play a significant role in defense against viruses. Furthermore, the CDs were also found to enhance the expression of many ISGs, which is vital to the CDs-based antiviral mechanism [46] .

The treatment of CCM-CDs was shown to change the viral surface protein structure, and then inhibit the viral entry. This treatment can also suppress the synthesis of virus negative-strand RNA, virus budding, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species for PEDV. Moreover, the intervention of CCM-CDs is also found to suppress viral replication by stimulating the production of ISGs and proinflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, when curcumin was used to synthesize carbon dots against enterovirus 71 (EV71) in vivo with new-born mice as test models [51] , the carbon quantum dots derived from curcumin (Cur-CQDs) through one-step dry heating were demonstrated to have superior EV71 inhibitory characteristics.

They systematically investigated the viral suppression mechanism and found both AgNPs and zanamivir had relatively high antiviral efficacy, but with synergistic virus inactivation effects observed for the Ag@ZNV nanostructure, which not only exhibited remarkable thermodynamics and kinetics stability, but also obvious inactivation effect on influenza virus. By resisting the production of excess ROS, the Ag@ZNV nanostructure can easily regulate the neuraminidase activity, a key domain for assessing the effect of influenza viruses on infected cells. Furthermore, they found that p38 and p53 signaling pathways were related with the down-regulation of ROSmediated apoptosis induced by Ag@ZNV in MDCK cells after H1N1 virus infection. Collectively, the Ag@ZNV has great potential in controlling influenza virus infection and can be used in clinic treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 273, "end": 277, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 278, "end": 282, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 283, "end": 287, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 288, "end": 292, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 554, "end": 558, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 808, "end": 812, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 813, "end": 816, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1036, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1349, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1734, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Silver nanoparticles"}, {"text": "As mentioned above, most silver nanoparticle-based antiviral agents are prepared in a liquid atmosphere, which greatly limits their wide applications in virus control. To tackle this problem, many efforts have been made recently. One of the effective solutions is hydrogel, a semisolid preparation that can broaden the application field of silver nanoparticle-based reagents. For instance, Szyma'nska et al. have developed a multifunctional tannic acid-modified silver nanoparticle-based mucoadhesive hydrogel for improving the local treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections [63] . The silver nanoparticles modified with tannic acid (TA-AgNPs) were shown to effectively reduce the HSV-2 infectivity at the vaginal mucosal surface, suggesting the potential use of functional nanoparticles as microbicides in HSV prevention. In order to further improve the antiviral efficiency of TA-AgNPs, they fabricated a three-dimensional cross-linked polymer matrix to encapsulate the TA-AgNPs and form a hydrogel, and the hydrogel made from mucoadhesive polymers provided closer contact between the drug carrier and the mucosal tissue, thus improving the activity of TA-AgNPs. The combination of AgNPs and tannic acid (a plant metabolite) was demonstrated as a promising approach to treat HSV-2 infection. Notably, hydrogel not only serves as a carrier of antiviral agents in virus suppression, but also has a wide spectrum antiviral ability. For instance, Walid Azab's group has produced a nanogel that has been shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral properties [64] . Polymeric nanogels, the cross-linked hydrogel particles with a 3D network consisting of water-soluble and swellable polymers, represent a better and promising choice for the design of virus entry inhibitors, due to the reason that they can be degraded to smaller sized fragments and removed by renal clearance. This broadspectrum antiviral universality lies in the virus inhibitory mechanism, which prevents the virus from attaching to the heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the host cell surface, and then causes a series of events to prevent the entry of the virus. As many human viruses attach to their host cells via heparan sulfate moieties, these flexible nanogels have the potential of robust inhibitors against these virus infections.

Thus far, various methods for the preparation of gold nanoparticles have been reported and reviewed [67] [68] [69] , and many small molecule, DNA sequence, protein, bacterial, and virus detection methods have been developed based on gold nanoparticles. For example, Mirkin and his coworkers are the first team dedicated to the preparation and application of gold nanoparticles in biology and medicine, and they systematically reviewed the synthesis, modification and application of gold nanoparticles [70] . Apart from considerable contributions in biochemistry, gold nanoparticles also possess the display effect on pathogens, fungi and viruses. For instance, Chattopadhyay et al. have prepared highly mono-dispersed quasi spherical gold-nanoparticles and used them to inhibit herpes simplex viruses [71] . Using an ultrasonic strategy, gallic acid was modified onto the surface of the monodispersed gold nanoparticles and used as a stabilizer for gold nanoparticle spheres. The MTT assay revealed that uniformly sized gold nanoparticles with non-toxic debris are essential for therapeutic applications. Furthermore, plaque-reduction assay has proved that the gallic acid modified gold nanoparticles have good virus inhibitory capability against herpes simplex viruses. Compared with clinic drug acyclovir, the functionalized gold nanoparticles do not produce any drug-resistant strains and can exhibit excellent viricidal properties by interfering with the virus attachment to Vero cells and inhibiting the spread of viral infection. Furthermore, gold nanoparticles are used as an emerging delivery carrier of various pharmaceuticals. Sei Kwang Hahn and his co-workers have prepared a hyaluronic acid gold nanoparticle and interferon complex for targeted treatment of hepatitis C virus infection [72] (Fig. 4) . Compared with traditional treatment of hepatitis C infection, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated interferon \u03b1 (IFN\u03b1) and hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified gold nanoparticles (HA-AuNP/IFN\u03b1 complex) have exhibited higher stability after injection in human serum. Even at seven days after injection, the HA-AuNP/ IFN\u03b1 complex is still detectable in mouse liver, in contrast to the absence of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated interferon. This work demonstrates that the gold nanoparticle-based complex is a successful anti-HCV drug and superior to any commercially available chemical drugs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 124, "end": 128, "text": "[65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 129, "end": 132, "text": "66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 409, "end": 413, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 414, "end": 418, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 419, "end": 423, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 810, "end": 814, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1114, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2111, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2112, "end": 2120, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Gold nanoparticles"}, {"text": "Gold nanoparticles are a good scaffold for development of virus inhibitors, and functional gold nanoparticles were shown to suppress influenza virus, simplex herps virus, and HIV [73] .

They mentioned that gold nanoparticles cannot inhibit viruses alone, and when covalently bound to other molecules that bind to the viruses, gold nanoparticles can exponentially increase the antiviral effects through multivalent interactions. Additionally, Javier and his collaborators have developed a series of dendronized anionic gold nanoparticles and found that dendronized AuNPs could inhibit HIV more effectively than dendrons alone. Their results showed that the presence of extra sulfur atoms in the dendrons and the coordination of the S(CH 2 ) 3 SO 3 moiety may hinder the aggregation of gold nanoparticles, making the modified gold nanoparticles more effective against HIV [75] . Rainer Haag et al. have reported that sialic acid functionalized gold nanoparticles can inhibit influenza virus infection by multivalent interactions [76] . Zanamivir and Oseltamivir are two well-known clinical drugs used to treat influenza virus infectious diseases. However, due to the high intrinsic mutation rate, it is highly possible for the influenza virus to develop resistance against those two drugs [77] . Fortunately, sialic acid coated gold nanoparticles can prevent the influenza viruses from attaching to their host cells, thereby reducing the possibility of drug resistance development. Overall, gold nanoparticles provide both a scaffold for virus inhibition and an excellent way for developing antiviral chemical drugs. Interestingly, Rainer Haag and his collaborator have also found that the antiviral effect of gold nanoparticles is highly dependent on their sizes [78] . They demonstrated that surface area normalized polysulfated gold nanoparticles of diameters equal to or larger than the virus diameter could inhibit the binding between viruses and their host cells more efficiently than smaller particles. On average, larger sized gold nanoparticles were shown to be two orders of magnitude more efficient than smaller particles in inhibiting viral infections, probably due to different mechanisms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 183, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1044, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1201, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1461, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1932, "end": 1936, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gold nanoparticles"}, {"text": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) composed of tens and hundreds of gold atoms whose size is comparable to Fermi wavelength of the electrons, usually less than 2 nm. Au NCs with a diameter close to 1 nm or sub-nanometer size possess interesting physicochemical properties while bulk gold does not. Due to the distinguished size between isolated atoms and larger nanoparticles, Au NCs have potential applications in optoelectronics, catalysis, biochemistry and biomedicine. Recently, Au NCs have proven to be effective fungicides. For instance, Xie and his collaborators have reported that Au NCs can kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [79] . They demonstrate that this wide-spectrum antimicrobial activity is attributed to the ultra-small size of Au NCs, which allows them to better interact with bacteria and cause a metabolic imbalance in bacterial cells after devouring Au NCs, leading to increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and thus killing the bacteria. Our group has discovered that Au NCs have certain viricidal properties and can prevent viruses such as PRRSV from entering their host cells [80] . We investigated the influences of glutathione-stabilized fluorescent Au NCs on viruses by plaque assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, and Western blot assay. Interestingly, Au NCs were found to selectively inhibit the proliferation and protein expression of PRRSV, but not for PRV. It was shown that Au NCs can directly inactivate PRRSV and block viral adsorption but produce no effect on viral genome replication (Fig. 5) . In order to explore the effect of surface modification upon the antiviral performance of Au NCs, we synthesized two types of gold clusters with different surface modification: histidine stabilized Au NCs (His-Au NCs), and mercaptoethane sulfonate and histidine stabilized Au NCs (MES-Au NCs) [81] . It is His-Au NCs rather than MES-Au NCs that were found to strongly inhibit the proliferation of PRV, as indicated by the results of plaque assay, confocal microscopic analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase, Western blot assay, and chain reaction assay.

Graphene oxide and its derivatives have recently received more and more attention due to their remarkable electronical, mechanical and thermal properties [84] . Aside from their biomedical applications, the antiviral properties of graphene oxide and its derivatives have also been extensively studied. For example, Tang and his co-workers found that graphene oxide was a promising candidate for virus prevention [85] . Their study indicated that the graphene oxide could effectively inactivate the pathogenic agent of hand-foot-and-mouth disease EV71 and endemic gastrointestinal avian influenza A virus H9N2 in a temperature-dependent manner. At room temperature 25\u00b0C, the disinfection effect of graphene oxide treatment was weak; at physiological temperature 37\u00b0C, the effect increased; as the temperature increased to 56\u00b0C, the inactivation effect was much higher. They also discovered that the graphene oxide without any labeling or modification could destroy the virus by interaction. The results demonstrated that the disrupted virus was inserted into the edge and basal plane of graphene oxide, implying a general virus disruption effect based on the physicochemical interactions of graphene oxide with both capsid and envelope viruses. Furthermore, they found heating is an efficient way to enhance the capture and the denature effect due to the electron transfer and energy transfer properties of graphene oxide. The data have proved that without graphene oxide, the degradation of EV71 was not clearly visible within 15 min, while after 5 min of graphene oxide treatment, EV71 was totally undetectable. Likewise, the destruction of native H9N2 was insufficient even at 30 min whereas after only 5 min at 56\u00b0C, the graphene oxide treatment completely degraded the virus.

The curcumin loaded graphene oxide was confirmed to have a significant inhibitory effect on respiratory syncytial virus infection and high biocompatibility with host cells. The experimental data demonstrated that the composite could prevent respiratory syncytial virus from infecting the host cells by directly inactivating the virus and inhibiting the virus from attaching to host cells, coupled with prophylactic and therapeutic effects on the virus. The excellent synergistic antiviral capacity is attributed to the perfect combination of graphene oxide with curcumin, and this innovative composite has the potential use as an effective nanomedicine for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection. The possible antiviral mechanisms of graphene oxide involve the following three ways: the curcumin functionalized graphene oxide can (i) inactivate the virus directly, (ii) inhibit viruses from attaching to host cells, and (iii) finally interrupt the virus replication. The multifunctional graphene oxide-based antiviral agents provide a new insight into nanomedicine fabrication. Gedanken's group prepared a functional graphene oxide nanomaterial to inhibit herpes simplex virus type-1 from attaching to host cells [87] . Inspired by the cell surface receptor heparan sulfate, a negatively charged linear polymer composed of alternating moieties of hexuronic acid and glucosamine sulfated at various positions, the author designed a graphene oxide (GO) and partially reduced sulfonated GO (rGO \u2212 SO 3 ) composite for suppressing the herpes simplex virus type-I (HSV-I) infections through a competitive inhibition mechanism. The results have shown that the GO and rGO-SO 3 had almost the same antiviral activity as that of heparan sulfate, suggesting the multiple simultaneous polyvalent interactions between GO, rGO-SO 3 and HSV-I contribute collectively to the strength and selectivity of the interaction compared to monovalent interactions, which influences the attachment and entry of most viruses to the cells. Further investigations demonstrated that the nanocomposite is effective in reducing viral infections, blocking attachment is the main mechanism for this interaction, and the presence of nanomaterials does not affect cell-to-cell diffusion.

However, some of those drugs fail to play an essential role in treating viral infectious diseases, probably due to the problems related to drug release efficiency. Antiviral drugs are known to locate their target tissues based on human blood circulation, which usually leads to low drug releasing efficiency and serious side effects. To circumvent this issue, mesoporous silicon nanoparticles are used as antiviral drug delivery carriers [93] . Compared with silver nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles, silicon nanomaterials are less cytotoxic and more biocompatible. Due to multiple porous structure, silicon materials can load drugs more easily than other nanostructures. Ross and his collaborators prepared glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) mimetic functionalized solid and mesoporous silica nanoparticles as antiviral agents to inhibit the entry of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and type 2 viruses into host cells [94] . The HSV entry begins with the attachment of viral glycoproteins to host cells, and GAGs are rich in sulfated groups like the heparan sulfate, with a hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction mechanism between HSV and GAGs. The authors designed GAG mimetic compounds containing sulfonate and hydrophobic groups, which can competitively bind to HSV and prevent HSV from entering their susceptible cells by blocking cellular attachment with remarkable viricidal activity. The mesoporous structure provides a foundation for future modifications to achieve the controlled release of antiviral drugs, and further research will focus on the relationship of the porous silicon nanostructures with drug loading and releasing efficiency. The results of this paper support the potential application of porous silicon nanoparticles as topical intravaginal microbicides against HSV infections, such as genital herpes or other infectious diseases, which are sensitive to inhibition by GAG mimetics. Another advantage of silicon nanoparticles is their low cytotoxicity. Silver nanoparticles are reported to have considerable cytotoxicity and may destroy host cells at a silver nanoparticle concentration above 2 mg/ mL, while gold nanoparticles are more cytotoxic and may destroy host cells at a concentration above 0.2 mg/mL, in contrast to almost no cytotoxicity for silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) when used as viricidal agents. Karamov et al. have investigated the antiviral activity of silicon nanoparticles against HIV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and found the porous silicon nanoparticles exhibited excellent viricidal capacity [95] . The strong inhibitory activity was detected at the SiNPs concentration below 0.1 mg/mL, which was significantly lower than the corresponding cytotoxic concentration. The obtained results are attributed to the non-specific interaction between SiNPs and viruses, resulting in the blocking of virions by SiNPs. Due to the unique porous structure, SiNPs can bind to viral proteins, which can effectively reduce the infectious virus strains and change the virus attack behavior. Therefore, SiNPs can be used as good prophylaxis agents against viruses, especially for those without any vaccines or drugs for treatment. The systematical antiviral mechanism of SiNPs is investigated by Cardoso's group [96] (Fig. 7) . They synthesized the mesoporous silica nanoparticles with distinct surface groups and enabled the modified SiNPs to bind to viruses through hydrophobic interactions. As expected, the invasion abilities to host cells are much lower for the SiNPs-treated viruses than those untreated with SiNPs. This study indicated that that the interaction between viruses and SiNPs causes drastic changes on their surface, which will greatly alter their attack behavior when attached to host cells. The unique porous structures of SiNPs endow their surface with abundant chemical groups and easy binding to various viral proteins, which is the most important mechanism for the viricidal activities of SiNPs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 153, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 154, "end": 158, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 159, "end": 163, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 604, "end": 608, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1084, "text": "[94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 2715, "end": 2719, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 3416, "end": 3420, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3421, "end": 3429, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Mesoporous silicon nanoparticles"}, {"text": "With further study on the treatment of virus infectious diseases, many new nanoparticles have been developed to meet the challenges in clinic applications.

ML336 is a recently developed chemical inhibitor against VEEV, showing effective inhibitory effect on VEEV infection in vitro and in vivo. However, its medical translation was hindered by its limited solubility and stability. To overcome these limitations, Negrete and his coworkers have developed lipid-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (LC-MSNs) with apparently improved solubility [98] . The large surface area of the MSN core promotes hydrophobic drug loading while the liposome coating retains the drug activity and increases the circulation time and biocompatibility, offering an ideal ML336 delivery platform.

The first antiviral organotin compound was reported by Sadykh-Zade's group, who developed some organotin polymers derived from trimethyltin and triethyltin esters, which showed extraordinary antiviral activity due to hydrolysis of organotin moieties [100] . Later, Roner et al. mentioned that organotin polymers can be used as antiviral agents in a systematical review [101] . Organotin compounds were usually used as anti-tumor agents, but now many studies have shown that they have extraordinary antiviral properties. The organotin has a relative long retention time in patient blood circulation and shows even better effect than the clinical antiviral drugs of acyclovir and other antiviral drugs, which can be attributed to the following reasons: (i) polymers provide a large molecular weight and can be filtered out by kidney more slowly than small molecules, giving rise to a longer retention time for targeting the infected issues in vivo; (ii) polymers have more condense structures and can offer much higher local concentration than small mono-compounds, thus facilitating a stronger binding between polymers and targets; (iii) reported evidence has demonstrated that various kinds of cells have little resistance to polymers, which is very significant in protecting host cells from invasion by viruses when using polymer-derived drugs; (iv) polymers have flexible structures and size so that they have more binding domains to the target viruses and inhibit them from attacking host cells.

Experiments with these two polymers indicated that their excellent antiviral efficacy depends mainly on blocking viral DNA replication. Another important polymer is DNA, termed as nucleic acid polymer with a long backbone. Wedemeyer et al. have demonstrated that nucleic acid polymers can prevent the release of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles by binding to the amphipathic alpha helix in the class I surface glycoprotein, thus capable of treating the disease of type D virus infection [103] . Moreover, the author also mentioned that the nucleic acid polymers can exhibit antiviral ability before and after the entry of virus to susceptible cells both in vitro and in vivo. The antiviral ability of other polymers was investigated by Whitten et al., who evaluated the viricidal performance of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)-based cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPE) and oligo-phenylene ethynylenes (OPE), which were usually used as anti-bacterial agents [104] . Interestingly, the two polymers are also excellent candidates for antiviral applications, showing the same viricidal mechanism as the antibacterial agent. Under the UV-Visible light exposure, the CPEs and OPEs can produce singlet oxygen species, followed by the formation of more corrosive reactive oxygen intermediates, due to the \u03c0 bonding system in the backbone of the compound. The singlet oxygen and subsequent ROS intermediates are known to be highly harmful to biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, and proteins.

This polymer-carried drug can effectively treat influenza A virus infectious diseases. Compared with naked drugs, polymer-carried drugs can solve three drug-targeting problems: (i) efficiently improving the solubility of antiviral drugs; (ii) prolonging the retention time of drugs in vivo; (iii) enhancing the uptake efficiency of drugs in cells. These advantages render polymers an excellent drug carrier in antiviral clinical applications. Therefore, polymers are being used in more and more antiviral drugs as antiviral coatings. For instance, Sierra's group used the self-assembly of amphiphilic dendrimers in water to fabricate micelles for encapsulating camptothecin as a therapy against the HCV [106] . The micelles can easily address at least three drawbacks of anti-HCV drugs: reducing the toxicity of those drugs, increasing the solubility of anti-HCV drugs in aqueous environment, and more importantly, maintaining the stability of anti-HCV drugs at physiological pH to enhance their antiviral activity, because camptothecin contains a lactone ring that is hydrolyzed at physiological pH. The experimental results have shown that the camptothecin-loaded dendrimer can inhibit HCV replication and exhibit much lower toxicity at a low drug concentration. It is worth noting that Kim's group has developed a kind of novel liver-targeted cyclosporine A-encapsulated poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles, which could inhibit the replication of HCV both in vitro and in an HCV mouse model with excellent performance. The paper points out that targeting the host factor cyclophilin A (CsA) is essential for HCV replication; however, due to its immunosuppressive activity and severe side effects, the clinical applications of CsA as an antiviral agent have been limited worldwide. To overcome these drawbacks, they have successfully developed a liverspecific sustained drug delivery system by conjugating the liver-targeting peptide to PEGylated CsA-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles. The clinical trial results have shown that the delivery system is highly specific to liver, thus contributing to the reduced immunosuppressive effect and toxicity profile of CsA. Moreover, the polymer nanoparticles could effectively inhibit viral replication with a sustained and prolonged anti-HCV effect, even after treatment withdrawal [107] . Currently, major attempts are being made to improve the antiviral activity of dendrimers. Daniel et al. has developed a triple combination of carbosilane dendrimers, tenofovir, and maraviroc as a potential microbicide to prevent HIV-1 sexual transmission [108] . By systematical investigation on the HIV target cells and topical issues, they concluded that the three-drug combination increases the antiviral potency and works synergistically as a potential microbicide, which facilitates our understanding of the viricidal activity of dendrimers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 429, "end": 434, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1145, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 2778, "end": 2783, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 3041, "end": 3046, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Polymers and dendrimers"}, {"text": "Various nanoparticles have been explored in medical applications, such as cancer treatment and pathogen disease nursing, leading to the development of many new strategies against bacteria and viruses.

Cao et al. reported an artificial nanoparticle complex that can effectively mimic the function of the cellular RISC machinery for guiding target RNA cleavage [110] . They designed a nanozyme for the treatment of HCV by actively cleaving HCV RNA in a sequence specific manner. This nanozyme is less susceptible to degradation by proteinase and can be effectively occupied by cultured human hepatoma cells. Meanwhile, the nanozyme is nontoxic to the cultured cells, and in a xenotransplantation mouse model under ambient conditions, it is shown not to trigger detectable cellular interferon response but have potent antiviral activity against HCV in cultured cells as well as in the mouse. Moreover, this nanozyme is easy to synthesize by a two-step strategy.

Herein, we will classify the different mechanisms of nanoparticles by their antiviral performance. The most direct way to suppress viruses is to inactivate them, and some of the nanostructures can interact with viruses, change their capsid protein structure and then dramatically reduce the virulence, which can be attributed to both physical and chemical mechanisms for decreasing the active virus number. To our knowledge, most of viral infections start with the attachment to host cells, usually by binding to the target acceptor protein.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The antiviral mechanisms of functional nanoparticles"}, {"text": "If nanoparticles can effectively inhibit the attachment, then host cells will be free from infection. Stellacci's group has designed a series of antiviral nanoparticles with long and flexible linkers mimicking heparan sulfate proteoglycans, the highly conserved target of viral attachment ligands (VALs), which can achieve efficient viral prevention through effective viral association with a binding simulated to be strong and multivalent to the VAL repeating units [121] . These particles are not cytotoxic and show in vitro nanomolar irreversible activity against herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, respiratory syncytial virus, dengue and lenti virus. Therefore, the functional nanoparticles can be used as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent to suppress the first step of viral infection, attachment. The second way to suppress viruses is blocking their penetration and entry to host cells by changing the cell surface membrane and protein structures. Haag and his collaborators have synthesized a series of water-soluble fullerene-polyglycerol sulfates (FPS) with different fullerene and polymer weight ratios and varying numbers of polyglycerol sulfate branches [122] . The combination of polyanionic branches with a solvent exposed variable hydrophobic core in FPS proves to be superior to analogs possessing only one of these features in preventing interaction of vesicular stomatitis virus coat glycoprotein with baby hamster kidney cells. Thus, development of blockings between viruses and host cells is an effective way to suppress virus infections. In the case of virus entry into cell, destroying their replication is the third effective strategy to inhibit the virus, which is usually achieved by suppressing the expression of certain enzymes which originally helped to complete the replication of virus DNA or RNA. The final strategy is to inhibit virus budding and excrete it from host cells. The offspring of a virus may be more virulent than its mother, and if functional nanoparticles prevent the virus from budding and greatly reduce the number of offspring viruses, the virulence will be reduced to an extraordinary degree. The typical antiviral mechanisms for functional nanoparticles are listed below in Table 1 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 467, "end": 472, "text": "[121]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1180, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2234, "end": 2241, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "The antiviral mechanisms of functional nanoparticles"}, {"text": "With the advantages of large surface-to-volume ratio, high surface reaction activity, and size-dependent optical and electronic properties, functional nanoparticles are being extensively explored in the field of biosensors and biomedicines, and their viricidal activity has also been systematically investigated [125, 126] . In this topical review, we have discussed the antiviral activities of quantum dots, gold nanoparticles and clusters, silver nanoparticles, graphene oxide, silicon materials and dendrimers as well as many other recently emerging nanoparticles. These functional nanoparticles can provide a novel platform for fabrication of biosafe and effective drugs for nanoscale treatment of virus infectious diseases in the future. Among these reviewed nanoparticles, carbon quantum dots modified with traditional Chinese medicines have a broad application prospect due to their remarkable biocompatibility and low toxicity. As a viricidal agent, they have exhibited superior and broad virus inhibition efficacy in both vitro and vivo models. Additionally, the nanoparticle drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will also be very popular in future clinic markets, such as gelatin nanoparticles and PLGA nanoparticles, due to their high stability as well as convenience in storage and transport [127, 128] . Overall, more and more effective and safe nanodrugs are available to combat viruses. However, there are some important issues to be solved for nanoparticles. First, it is necessary to further improve their biocompatibility. Currently, dissolubility of nanoparticles decreases the releasing efficacy of many antiviral drugs, and effective synthesis procedure is one of the routes to enhance the biocompatibility of functional nanoparticle-based antiviral drugs. Secondly, targeting specific virus is a very challenging task, and improving the specificity of functional nanoparticles-based antiviral drugs is the key to solve this problem. Thirdly, it is essential to preserve the antiviral activity of nanoparticles when binding with viruses, and nanodrug structure design and fabrication protocol are the key to settle this issue. Fourthly, to date, the viricidal mechanism of functional nanoparticles is still largely unknown, especially for inhibition of drug-resistant viruses, despite several reports about the inhibitory effects of nanoparticles on drug-resistant virus strains. For instance, Gao and his collaborators discovered that iron oxide nanomaterial can be used as an enzyme for catalytic inactivation of drug-resistant H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 subtype [129] . Lara et al. have demonstrated that silver nanoparticles can inhibit a wide variety of circulating human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV-1) strains, including clinical isolates, T and M tropic strains, and resistant strains [130] . Fifthly, more efforts should be made to deliver the functional nanoparticles into the cells and tissues in vivo and find animal models to test the antiviral efficacy of functional nanoparticles. Sixthly, it is vitally necessary to expand the mutation range of target viruses and update nanostructures so that we can compete with any new virus strain to protect global public health. Finally, we cannot ignore the important issue of nanoparticle toxicity, thus the stability and degradation issues should be a constant research topic along with the development of functional nanoparticles [131, 132] . Although low concentration of usage is probably safe and non-toxic towards active cells and tissues, it is still necessary to investigate the concentration limits of antiviral nanoparticles to host cells and host tissues, especially in human clinical trials. As shown in the previous results, the toxicity of most nanoparticles is dose-dependent and the antiviral activity also works in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, optimization must be performed for each viricidal agent to obtain its optimal concentration. Nowadays, with the unprecedented development and industrialization of nanotechnologies, large quantities of nanoparticles are produced in laboratories and industrial production lines every year, posing a huge challenge for us to address the biocompatibility and biosafety issues. Now, the amount-related toxicity of nanoparticles is being studied and will be resolved soon. It will not be long before various biosafe and effective antiviral drugs derived from functional nanoparticles can be used to protect and treat patients in clinical applications during a global pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 312, "end": 317, "text": "[125,", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 318, "end": 322, "text": "126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1332, "text": "[127,", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1337, "text": "128]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2608, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2622, "text": "Lara et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2831, "end": 2836, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 3427, "end": 3432, "text": "[131,", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 3433, "end": 3437, "text": "132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Challenges and prospects"}, {"text": "The authors declare no conflict of interest.
