Prevalence HCAIs were found in 13.9 out of 100 patients in Malaysia [2] . Longer hospital stays, long-term injury, microorganism tolerance, increased financial pressure, high costs, and premature deaths are all consequences of HCAIs. HCAIs can affect patients in any type of treatment setting and can even appear after they have been discharged. They are the most common adverse event in healthcare, and no agency or country will claim to have solved the problem. In Geneva 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the first patient safety initiative and a multimodal hand hygiene improvement strategy in the hopes of strengthening public health action and reducing the number of people who die from HCAIs.",

Hand hygiene performance, perceptions, and knowledge must all be monitored as part of phase three of the WHO Guidelines' HH Multimodal Improvement Strategy [10] . To achieve the Malaysian government's National Patient Safety Goal, all stakeholders, including universities, are encouraged to conduct scientific research to fill gaps and expand the pool of patient safety information. The growing emphasis on reducing HCAIs in Malaysian hospitals emphasises the importance of improving treatment quality while maintaining patient safety concerns [11] [12] [13] [14] Hand hygiene promotion success necessitates not only the implementation of interventions, but also a better understanding of HCW perceptions of HCAIs and HH [15] . Individual characteristics such as behaviour and psychological determinants (knowledge, attitude, intentions, beliefs, and perceptions) may provide additional information on hand hygiene performance [16] . Hand hygiene knowledge, in particular, has been identified as a critical factor in improving compliance rates [17] . In recent findings [18] , lack of awareness has been identified as a self-reported factor and barrier that may impact hand hygiene and flow compliance. It has also been demonstrated that nurses' knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes toward HH influence their HH performance [19, 20] . In the local setting, there are activities relating to the issue, but only a handful of them result in publication. As a result, this study describes a survey that was undertaken in this place, and its addition to current knowledge may bring fresh insights into hand hygiene practises.",

The variability of our findings is probably due to differences in gender, work experience and had received HH Training. According to Asadollahi, Arshadi Bostanabad [33] , lack of nurses knowledge of hand hygiene related to work experience, type of employment and previous training of hand hygiene. Another study by Al-Mohaithef, Chandramohan [34] gender, work experience and had training course all had a significant effect on the knowledge score. Despite the fact that almost all of our respondents received training in the last three years, their knowledge does not reflect the study's findings. In other words, these programmed have had little effect on improving nurses' knowledge in this area. We should reevaluate the effectiveness of HH training courses, educational method and enhance our technique of training program instruction based on the knowledge score's findings.

As a result, nurse performance may be related to a number of factors, including motivation, the role of a peer or higherranking staff member in the room when performing HH, and the nurses' attitude. How do HCWs react when colleagues or superiors refer to them as a role model? According to Oyapero and Oyapero [31] , the superior had an impact on their decision to conduct HH. According to Lankford and Zembower [32] , a role model (peer hand-compliance) and group performance practises HH can influence hand-hygiene behaviours and performance. As a result, the attitudes of HCW role models and nurses were linked to HH self-reported performance [11] . Another reason is that nurses may overestimate their actual HH performance because they are anxious to be observed by senior staff or management [20] .",

These findings, on the other hand, contradict those of researches [19, 32] , which revealed no strong connection. Perceptions and self-reported HH performance have a significant correlation, according to the findings, which are similar to previous research [15, 19, 32, 38] . As a result of the improved perception, particularly the perception of being a role model for other co-workers, hand hygiene compliance increased [20] . We should stress being a role model and monitoring starting from stakeholder and leader nurses to increase the intention to adhere to hand hygiene. Furthermore, no significant correlations were found between knowledge scores and self-reported HH performance, demonstrating that having more knowledge does not always reflect better hand washing habits.

Infection-control behaviours are mediated not only by rational knowledge or motivation, but also by social, emotional, and frequently stereotyped behaviors [37] . In the current finding, a positive relationship between knowledge and HCAIs pre and post assessment in the hospital appears. Despite the low degree of association, knowledge remains an important component associated with hand hygiene performance, which will have a significant impact on HCAI mortality and morbidity in hospitals. Compliant is a multifaceted issue that necessitates both knowledge and behaviour. Educational awareness and regular reminders are required to maintain high rates of hand hygiene performance [38] . Perception does not appear to correlate well with HCAIs pre and post hospital assessment. This contradicts previous findings by McClung and Obasi [39] . HCWs' perceptions of patient safety and clinical consequences are motivating factors for lowering HCAIs.",

Nurses at Kelantan's tertiary care institutions had a higher overall perception and self-reported HH performance than in earlier studies. The most obvious finding was that knowledge scores were lower than in earlier trials. Poor HH practises could result from a lack of knowledge about HH during patient care, leading to an increase in HCAIs and AMR. The findings of this study point to a critical reevaluation of the effectiveness of the HH training course, as well as an improvement in our training programme. We believe that applying WHO's comprehensive multimodal HH, which includes improvement techniques ranging from one to five phases and considering future research at a national level, is the key to improving HH performance among HCWs.",
