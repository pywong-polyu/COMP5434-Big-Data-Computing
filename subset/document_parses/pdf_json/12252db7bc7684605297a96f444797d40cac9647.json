            "text": "Purpose: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) is a common disease in the elderly, and genetic factors play a key role in its occurrence. The present study was conducted to investigate the association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b2) gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of thoracolumbar OVCF. Patients and Methods: This case-control study recruited 146 patients with OVCF and 144 osteoporosis patients as the control group. Genotypes of the IL-6 rs1800796 and TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 were analyzed by sequencing. Genotype distribution and allelic frequencies were investigated by the \u03c7 2 test. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) evaluated the relationship of IL-6 or TGF-\u03b2 polymorphism and OVCF susceptibility. Results: Allele G and genotype GG of IL-6 rs1800796 was more frequent in patients with OVCF (40.07% vs.28.47%; 19.18% vs.7.64%) compared with controls. GG genotype (OR=3.394, 95% CI=1.560-7.385, P < 0.001) and G allele (OR=1.680, 95% CI=1.187-2.376, P < 0.001) of IL-6 rs1800796 was significantly associated with increased risk of OVCF. What is more, CT and TT genotypes (41.78 vs.51.39; 19.86 vs.26.39) and allele T (40.75 vs 52.08) of TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 were less frequent in OVCFs, more common in controls and protective against OVCF risk (OR=0.436, 95% CI=0.228-0.835, P = 0.012; OR=0.615, 95% CI=0.443-0.855, P = 0.004). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the G allele and GG genotype of IL-6 rs1800796 may contribute to increased susceptibility to OVCF in elderly Chinese. In contrast, CT and TT genotypes and the T allele of TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 may contribute to lower susceptibility of OVCF.",

            "text": "As the higher frequency complication of osteoporosis, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) are the most common clinical fracture, and there are nearly 1.4 million new cases per year. 1 Epidemiology shows that the thoracolumbar vertebral body is the most common site for osteoporotic fractures, and the incidence of thoracolumbar OVCF accounts for 53% of all fragility fractures. 2 It can cause severe and long-term low back pain, even disability, and seriously affect the quality of life. 3 Pathogenesis of OVCF is complicated, and individual nutrition, genetic factors, environment, and living habits are all risk factors. Genetic factors are particularly important, which determine about 70-80% of peak bone mass during individual growth. 4 Recently, with the maturity and popularization of gene sequencing technology, a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found in the gene, which is closely related to many diseases, including OVCF. 5 Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that is involved in immune regulation and inflammation and promotes B cell differentiation and T cell proliferation. 6 The human IL-6 gene is located on human chromosome 7p21 and contains 5 exons and 4 introns. The current research on IL-6 gene polymorphism mainly focuses on SNPs in the promoter region, such as \u2212597G/A (re1800797), \u2212572G/C (rs1800796), \u2212174G/C (rs1800795). They affect the expression level of IL-6 by regulating gene transcription and expression strength, and then make differences in the susceptibility of the population to diseases such as COVID-19, 7 coronary artery disease, 8 and type 2 diabetes. 9 IL-6 polymorphism has been reported to be involved in bone loss, 10 fracture, 11 and osteoarthritis. 12 In addition, the transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b2), as a multifunctional growth factor and osteogenic factor, is reported to be abundant in bone and take leading to bone formation, differentiation, absorption, remodeling, and matrix metabolism. 13 TGF-\u03b2 SNPs include +896T/C (rs1982073), +915G/C (rs1800471), +29T/C (re1800470), \u2212509C/T (rs1800469), it was associated with the susceptibility of aortic dissection, 14 hepatitis 15 and gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. 16 What's more, in bone metabolism, IL-6 can affect the metabolism of calcium and vitamin D and affect the metabolism of connective tissue, especially cartilage and bone. 17 It has also been reported that inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, a key pathway in bone metabolism, differentially regulates the inflammatory mediators IL-6 and MCP-1 thereby further regulating bone metabolism. 18 Recent studies have found that SNPs of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 are associated with susceptibility to osteoporosis. 19, 20 Clinical studies have confirmed elevated IL-6 mRNA levels in OVCF patients, 21 and IL-6 may promote RANKL levels in osteoblasts and activate its signaling pathway causing bone destruction. 22 rs1800795 and rs1800796 are the two SNPs of IL-6 most studied, and rs1800796 is strongly related to the risk of osteoporosis. 20 However, TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 was closely related to the low bone mineral density and was the main risk factor for osteopenia and osteoporosis. 19, 23 Therefore, we conducted this study to test our suspicion that IL-6 rs1800796 and TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 are potentially associated with OVCF.",

Recent studies have emphasized the regulatory role of bone and immune cells as well as immune cell products such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors on bone resorption and bone formation. In this study, we investigated the association between the polymorphisms of IL-6 rs1800796 and TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 and the occurrence of OVCF in the thoracolumbar segment. In addition to OVCF patients, osteoporosis patients were also recruited as the control group. There were no remarkedly differences in clinical basic information and BMD between the two groups. However, HDL-C was decreased and TG was significantly elevated in OVCF patients, which was consistent with previous studies. 32 This suggests that the subjects in our study are representative to a certain extent. IL-6 is a multifunctional chemotactic cytokine secreted by macrophages, Th12 cells, and endothelial cells, which take a leading role in regulating inflammation and immune response. The latest investigation has found that IL-6 is also a key regulator of osteoblast formation, bone resorption, and fracture. Studies have shown that after a hip injury, IL-6 levels can be detected within 1h, and the concentration increases to a peak within 4-6h. 33 In mice, the level of IL-6 reached the peak at 24h after fracture. 34 IL-6 gene is located on chromosome 7q21.3 and contains 5 exons and 4 introns. At present, its common promoter regions SNPs included rs1800796, rs1800795, rs1800797, and rs10499563. 35 Among them, rs1800796 confirmed to be the most common SNP in Asian populations, 36 is the 572-cytosine mutation to guanine, which promotes the transcription of IL-6 promoter and causes an abnormal increase of IL-6 level.",

In addition, TGF-\u03b2 also is synthesized by osteoblasts and is highly expressed in bone, and its level is related to the proliferation and 38 In addition, osteoblasts produce TGF-\u03b2, which is secreted in a latent form and then deposited into the bone matrix. During the resorption phase, osteoblasts release and activate TGF-\u03b2 from the bone matrix so that this molecule affects the bone microenvironment. Also TGF-\u03b2 binds to bone resorption and formation and recruits bone progenitor cells to the site of bone resorption. 39 TGF-\u03b2 gene is located in the long arm of chromosome 19, and the gene is described as 5 SNPs, which are \u2212800G/A (rs1800468) and \u2212509C/T (rs1800469) promoter region and +896T/C (rs1982073), +915G/C (rs1800471), +29T/C (re1800470) coding region, respectively. Multiple studies have confirmed that TGF-\u03b2 polymorphism is associated with disease susceptibility. Such as rs1982073 and rs1800471 were associated with psoriasis susceptibility. 40 Importantly, it was found that TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 may be related to the risk of fracture osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. 41 Genotype CT+CC of TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 is significantly reduced in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis in the lumbar spine and tibia. 42 As OVCF is a common complication and clinical outcome of osteoporosis, we focused on the correlation between the allele and genotype of TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 and OVCF. Similar to the genotypes in osteoporosis, rs1982073 CT and TT genotypes were more common in osteoporosis patients and significantly reduced in OVCF patients. The T allele was also more common in osteoporosis patients and significantly reduced in patients. And TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 T allele and CT and TT genotypes were related to low risk of OVCF. That is, CC genotype and allele C are more relevant to patients with OVCF. Finally, a major limitation of this study was the failure to examine in time the G allele and GG genotype of IL-6 re1800796 as well as the CT and TT genotypes and T allele of TGF-\u03b2 rs1982073 in predicting the potential risk of vertebral compression fractures in patients with osteoporosis. This will be addressed in our next in-depth study. In addition, to ensure that two groups were comparable, we therefore included osteoporotic patients with no significant difference in BMD as a control group, which narrowed the effect of BMD in this study, which is a limitation of this study, and this will be noted in the next studies.",
