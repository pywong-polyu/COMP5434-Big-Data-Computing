In the United States, sexual education has typically been taught within a primary public health prevention framework as a way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [1] . We have argued in other papers [2, 3] for an expansion of sex education beyond this general prevention model. Our work has proposed that sex education needs to encompass approaches that specifically seek to develop students into \"sexual citizens,\" teaching them values with regard to how the expression of individual sexual desires impacts other people and giving them the opportunity to discuss cultural issues around sex and sexualities. This latter approach is generally not viewed as essential to public health, but arguably does in fact address public health concerns relating to the prevention of sexual violence, promotion of psychological well-being, and a healthier citizenship. This rare approach works through an overarching ethics-centered, communitarian-focused approach. Sex education, as it is most often taught, focuses on individual students, asking them to understand risk to self and ways to protect themselves from sexual ills (defined for the most part as pregnancy and disease, and sometimes, simply early sexual activity) [4] . In short, this is an individualized protection approach which aims to change students one by one and create greater personal responsibility via self-care.",

            "text": "The problems inherent to an individualized approach to public health via self-protection and the subsequent focus on personal rather than group responsibility have been made increasingly salient during the recent global crisis following the surge of COVID-19. During this time, citizens have been called upon to make sacrifices for the good of their communities, and to reframe what would seem to them to be self-protective measures as ways of protecting others and community. There are many parallels between the current state sex education and the response to this pandemic, such as the education and appeals around condom and mask-wearing. There are also deeper commonalities in regard to what it means to be a part of a community, and what it means to have others' welfare in mind as one simultaneously pursues individual needs and protections. This paper focuses on the overlap between sexual education and public health responses to COVID-19 (understanding that this education has come in the form of public announcements rather than specific curricula). We discuss parallels between these two issues, particularly related to gendered responses and resistances to thinking collectively. We also call on theories regarding an \"ethic of care\" and communitarianism which run against a neoliberal approach to public health education.",

Individualism constitutes an institutionalized set of values that prioritizes autonomy, individual rights, freedom, and choice. It is contrasted to other ways of being and value systems, such as collectivism which is more valued in other countries and even cultures within the U.S. It is also contrasted to a care ethics approach [6, 7] which prioritizes care for others as a central moral motivation. In the U.S., the culture of individualism is expressed in its extreme form through libertarianism and neoliberalism wherein laws and policies are developed to benefit and protect individuals over communities, following the belief that asking for sacrifices from the community is an impingement on individual liberty and that individuals are responsible for their own outcomes. The existence of neoliberalism requires a blindness to social conditions and an unsubstantiated belief that everyone has the ability and the access to make individual decisions [8] .",

Although at the time of publication, the crisis may be controlled by the rollout of vaccines, we believe the lessons about individualism that current responses have taught us should provide important information for sexual education in the future.

Hegemonic masculinity refers to a \"set of values, established by men in power that functions to include and exclude, and to organize society in gender unequal ways\" [12] , (p. 40). The concept can encompass individualism, power over others, and an entitlement to break the rules. Rule-breaking is embedded in the U.S.'s history such that questioning and bucking authority, and celebrating mavericks have become central to U.S. masculinity [5] .",

Thomson [20] discusses how leaders, particularly Trump, have called on hegemonic masculinity to respond to the pandemic. They write that the response to the pandemic required acknowledging risk and taking measures to prevent which were seen as \"feminine\" and \"weak.\" An increasingly \"macho\" U.S. context played a role in the government's inadequate response. These authors also note that a masculinist perspective not only hurts the general population but is particularly harmful to girls and women. Women, as the primary caregivers of the young and elderly, have additional responsibilities to others; women are more likely to lose their jobs than men; and that, during \"lockdown\" phases, men's violence towards women increases.",

It is similar to the shock displayed among certain groups towards the continuing high rates of teen pregnancy in the U.S. compared to other Western countries, and rates of sexual violence that stay constant in spite of numerous changes in awareness regarding what non-consensual sex is and how it affects those who are sexually victimized. We ask, how are these issues still prevalent despite the vast amounts of knowledge amassed, as well as the myriad array of tools available to address these concerns?

Encouraging and relying on individual responses have been problematic for another reason: these are deeply personal, value-laden choices influenced by the much broader social issues the government has so ineptly and irresponsibly addressed.",

In May 2020, the CDC issued a report that outlined some lessons learned and the public health priorities and responses at the beginning of the pandemic, February through April 2020 [24] . In this report, the authors outline the factors and events related to accelerated spread during those months, including: travel, large social events, limited testing, and density in workplace settings. The CDC issued guidance (albeit contradictory initially) for the use of cloth face coverings, and for the initial acceleration phase of the virus, they advocated for stay-at-home orders and the closing of schools and non-essential businesses. The report culminates with a final guidance, stating that these initial responses might continue to be needed in later phases of the outbreak.",

But the problem does not lie with the requests for compliance with individual behaviors, but instead lies with a lack of collective responsibility that in turn holds people accountable for collective failures. As mentioned, plenty of other countries, some with self-described \"collectivist\" cultures have asked their citizens to engage in these individual behaviors. However, (a) the messaging and the purpose of engaging in these behaviors has been different (i.e., care for others), (b) engaging in these behaviors has been accompanied by social, public policies which also reinforce the work towards a \"greater good,\" and (c) some have even enforced fines for lack of compliance. Current research based on global responses to the COVID pandemic has highlighted these differences between the U.S. and other countries and offered guidance. Studies have shown that individualistic responses in times of collective crisis give way to negative public health consequences [25] .",

Politicians all over the country showed disregard for mask-wearing, the closing of non-essential businesses, and for scientific counsel. Airports remained open, tourism boards continued encouraging travel, non-essential settings remained open in order to continue to keep small businesses and the overarching economy afloat. Restaurants held and continue to offer indoor dining. Political campaigns held large rallies with little to no attention paid to protection, including the Rose Garden celebration of the appointment of Amy Coney Barret, an event Dr. Anthony Fauci has suggested was a superspreader. After the former President's own COVID-related hospitalization, his message was clear as he ripped off his mask: \"Don't be afraid of COVID . . . . Don't let it dominate your life\" [9] . All of these events implied that individuals had to make their own choices. The \"live your life\" narrative is one that implies being \"brave,\" \"adventurous,\" and not risk-averse-a narrative mostly embraced by men [29] . Rather than focusing on systemwide measures, which imply that everyone should be cared for equally, these higher-level responses suggested: \"everyone needs to take action to take care of themselves.\"",

The vulnerability of older citizens; Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities; and key workers who are commonly poorly paid with fewer welfare protections points to a truth so far barely acknowledged-namely, that no matter how effective a treatment or protective a vaccine, the pursuit of a purely biomedical solution to COVID-19 will fail [31] \" (p. 874).",

In other words, if neoliberalism doesn't encourage or acknowledge any collective or civic affiliation, or even an affiliation with their local school, parents are free to find their own way to educate their children. Third, the way neoliberalism promotes freedom around issues of sex and sexuality is not in the sense that freedom comes from a good education, and towards that end, adolescents ought to have free access to information and services. Instead, it focuses on a sense of freedom that is boiled down to no restrictions. Adolescents are thus free to learn about sex from their parents, their peers, or the internet, without restriction.

Only 17 of these states require the program content to be medically accurate [50] , which begs the question of why any state would permit false information to be conveyed in any educational program let alone sex education. This has obvious parallels to the way states have responded to the pandemic with various states mandating masks, and others ignoring scientific research supporting mask-wearing as a way to increase prevention. In the beginning, in March of 2020, journalists noted, \"The last week laid bare a dizzying patchwork of local decision-making, as the largest quarantine in recent American history occurred in a juddering, piecemeal fashion\" [51] . Some states closed bars, some restaurants, and some even prohibited walking together outside during the late fall surge of 2020. As with sex education, the choices governors made seemed to appeal to their constituency worried about work, the economy which would suffer from lockdowns, and tough images they attempted to maintain as leaders in areas where masculinist personas have greater sway (e.g., Governor Noem in South Dakota) [52] . When there is a national call for greater education and safety measures, and individual states are permitted policies that affect the entire nation, the protection of states' rights is problematic. This is thus true for sex education, although rates of STIs and pregnancy do not present a national emergency. What would it mean, we ask, if adolescents received sex education that was nationally supported, education that the President and their cabinet endorsed as a public health initiative and linked to the advancement of health, well-being, and opportunity, especially for vulnerable populations? It would convey the message that we take care of each other, as a nation, to ensure that sex is voluntary, physically healthy, and a part of well-being.",

Lessons from the pandemic call for a different kind of attitude and a different kind of sex education, namely one that looks for communal responsibility from issues like condom use to general sexual well-being. As we have been asked to wear masks to protect other people, we can ask teens with penises to wear condoms to protect someone else, states to mandate medically accurate information, individuals who hook up to try to understand what it might mean to the other person, and teens who use pornography to think about the lives of the people engaging in sex acts for their viewing. We address these four \"asks\" below.",

In spite of the recurrent claim that sex education should happen within the family, there is widespread support for public sex education and one that encourages safe practices [59] . Still, within these efforts, statements such as \"condom skills are taught to ensure that youth will be able to protect themselves (our emphasis) when they become sexually active\" [60] highlights the primacy of the personal responsibility narrative common in such sex education. What becomes confusing is that, while teens are told to protect themselves (e.g., through condom usage), the conversation typically stops there, and condoms are unlikely to be provided in the context of such recommendations. While availability of condoms in spaces such as high schools may incite fear of encouraging more or earlier sexual activity, research shows that condom access programs at worst affect little change, and at best decrease rates of STIs and teen pregnancy, and increase safety in sexual situations [58] . This suggests positive outcomes of condom availability and is encouraging, but there is a continued absence of discussion around collective responsibility in the context of condom usage.",

The community approach to condom use would suggest in the very least that we offer them in high schools. Currently, our schizophrenic messaging results in directives to use a condom, with no provision of them. We might also develop a discourse around condom use that discusses collective social goals of a society that protects and nurtures adolescents towards higher or further education and opportunities. Comfortability in discussing condom use and normalizing access to both boys and girls may also be important. Without contextualizing condom use within arguments about caring for other people, without also discussing power and gender dynamics, the reason to use condoms will always boil down to protecting oneself. This may be why Andrzejewski and colleagues [61] found that boys are more likely to take and use condoms when readily available in a school setting, whereas girls may feel uncomfortable doing so. While this may suggest boys are being thoughtful about whom they are having sex with, it is more likely that this also ties back to personal responsibility messaging, as boys are urged to use a condom in order to not get a girl pregnant. This is hardly a suggestion that encompasses a relational and non-heterosexist view of sex that we as a collective society might want to promote.",

Likewise, sex educators have long been concerned about medically inaccurate information, from falsehoods in early AOUM manuals that stated one could get HIV/AIDS from swimming pools [62, 63] , to the continued misrepresentations of the efficacy of condoms as an STI and pregnancy prevention strategy. Like the doctors speaking to the nation about COVID-19 [64] , sex educators have also been concerned regarding restricting the distribution of information. Once President Biden took office, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had been President Trump's chief medical advisor, expressed to the New York Times, \"The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know-what the evidence, what the science is-and know that's it, let the science speak... It is somewhat of a liberating feeling\" [65] . Sex education hasn't ever had a national acknowledgment and champion of the medically accurate science behind STIs and pregnancy, let alone more social issues such as rape and harassment. The closest we come to the assurance that information provided to adolescents is medically accurate is in the \"mandates\" that states have adopted [36] . Only 17 states require their program content to be medically accurate, and only nine states require the program to provide instruction that is appropriate for a student's cultural background and that is not biased against any race, sex, or ethnicity [50] . What would it mean for a populace to share an understanding of pregnancy prevention and risk as one understands that washing one's hands prevents colds and sneezing spreads them? Who has access to accurate information, and how?",

Women are charged with the responsibility for allowing or not allowing hookups to occur, through a lens of individual protection (e.g., \"say no clearly,\" \"don't drink too much,\" etc.). While men may be \"formally\" told to \"respect women,\" they also receive messaging (i.e., from friends, family, media) that is antithetical to this and positions them to approach hookups as a game or competition in which \"scoring\" is the goal. This is problematic for a number of reasons, significantly for both the pressure and responsibility that women are given, and for its blatant disregard of the gender identity spectrum.

A community approach might be instead that sex can be a powerful thing and so you want to make sure that, if you are pursuing pleasure or intimacy, you are not doing so at the expense of another. Advocating consent before hooking up reflects an individual rights contract model that assumes each person can take care of themself. But, similar to our argument around vulnerable populations, this idea implies that everyone has equal capacity and resources in order to take care of themselves. While there is nothing superficially wrong with talking about consequences and teaching consent, we are also missing an enormous piece of discourse around context: power dynamics, coercion across settings, the ethics of casual sex, and the vulnerabilities in other people that one should watch out and care for.",

Pleasure messaging would be about pleasing the other and making someone else comfortable to have pleasure. Students would be allowed to investigate topics relating to sex in society, in order to become responsible citizens. They would learn what the social concerns are about pornography, rape, consent, sex work, objectification, hookups, and sexualization of children.

Sex education has lessons to learn from the pandemic response about how gender dynamics and a focus on the individual are not only bad for prevention but actually increase risk for everyone. Thus, we call on a public health response in the U.S. for government to mandate medically accurate sex education in every state, sex education that also includes social, relational, and civics lessons, and sex education that develops students' knowledge and sense of justice around vulnerabilities of other people and groups they belong to. With new government leadership, this seems altogether possible. But neoliberalism pervades Western countries in ways that shape liberal governments, as well as the more conservative ones. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we should all be in this together-for the good of everyone; and, yet, many have a way to go before they grasp this simple truth. ",
