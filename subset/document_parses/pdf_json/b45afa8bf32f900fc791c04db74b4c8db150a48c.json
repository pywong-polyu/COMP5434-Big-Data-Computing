Here we present a follow-up analysis of a longitudinal study characterizing COVID-19 immune responses from a father and son with distinctly different clinical courses. The father required a lengthy hospital stay for severe symptoms, whereas his son had mild symptoms and no fever yet tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 29 days. Father and son, as well as another unrelated COVID-19 patient, displayed a robust increase of SERPING1, the transcript encoding C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). We further bolstered this finding by incorporating a serum proteomics dataset and found that serum C1-INH was consistently increased in COVID-19 patients. C1-INH is a central regulator of the contact and complement systems, potentially linking COVID-19 to complement hyperactivation, fibrin clot formation, and immune depression. Furthermore, despite distinct clinical cases, significant parallels were observed in transcripts involved in interferon and B cell signaling. As symptoms were resolving, widespread decreases were seen in immune-related transcripts to levels below those of healthy controls. Our study provides insight into the immune responses of likely millions of people with extremely mild symptoms who may not be aware of their infection with SARS-CoV-2 and implies a potential for long-lasting consequences that could contribute to reinfection risk.",

SARS-CoV-2 infections spread through contact with symptomatic, as well as pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic, cases [7] .

Case 2 reported having a single day of diarrhea and, two days later, a cough and mild sore throat. Ong et al. deemed day 1 of his clinical course as the day that the sore throat and cough symptoms began [8] . The concept of DSO is subjective and, in cases 1 and 2, symptom onset was so closely reported that it is likely that father and son became inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at, or closely around, the same time. The son self-reported a mild sore throat and cough on January 19, and the father self-reported a fever on January 20 [8] . A fever is a quantitative measurement and indicates a systemic inflammatory response, and this was set as 1 DSO, in the case of the father. Complicating the situation, the son never reported or developed a fever. Assignment of 1 DSO was set at the time the son developed a mild sore throat and cough, one day prior to the father's reported fever. The overall timing and relationship of father and son suggests these samples were closely matched in time of infection, regardless of the DSO reported in Ong et al. [8] . Case 2's cough persisted until 19 DSO, yet he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during 1-21 DSO and again on 23, 26, and 29 DSO, the latter being a full 10 days after symptom resolution. For these analyses, case 2 was deemed to be a mild case, as he was afebrile and never required medical support.",

The decrease in CIITA in group 1 was observed despite increases in several upstream inducers (PML, IRF1, BCL6, STAT 1-3); however, this increase was not seen in the upstream inducer PAX5 ( Figure 3B ). PAX5 is a signature B cell gene that is required for B cell lineage commitment, lineage restriction, and maturation [16, 17] , and inhibition of PAX5 transcription reduces its target gene, CD19, and reprograms mature B cells into macrophages [18] . Although not observed in Hadjadj et al. [10] , both PAX5 and CD19 were significantly decreased in all of the COVID-19 sample groups, regardless of genetic background or clinical severity, and levels had not recovered by 18 or 19 DSO in cases 1 and 2 (group 5 (case 2 d12, d13, d19) and group 6 (case 1 d11, d12, d18 and case 2 d11)) ( Figure 3C-H) . Consistent with the patterns of expression of PAX5 and CD19, there was a striking depletion of estimated numbers of B cells in all COVID-19 groups comprising clinical samples from all three cases, implying that B cell populations were negatively affected regardless of COVID-19 infection severity ( Figure 4A ). Considering that in the mild COVID-19 case 2 the estimated B cell abundance had not recovered by 19 DSO, it would have been of great clinical interest to have determined whether B cell populations had recovered by 29 DSO. Pathway scores for B cell signaling were negative compared to HC over all groups ( Figure 4B ). Although increases in adaptive and innate immune system-related transcripts occurred in groups 1 and 2, these gene sets were significantly decreased compared to HC in the later phases of recovery for groups 5, 6, and X, implying global suppression of innate and adaptive immune responses as SARS-CoV-2 infection resolves ( Figure 4C, D) .",

Under other circumstances, case 2 may have dismissed his mild cough and sore throat as seasonal allergies, a cold, or air-quality issues in the absence of a fever and never realized he was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Currently there is an extreme paucity of information regarding the immune response over the course of infection in individuals that have very mild symptoms, as other related clinical studies have inclusion criteria that include fever or hospitalization [10, 19, 20, 21] .

C1-INH suppresses activation of complement, coagulation, inflammation, and fibrinolysis through inhibition of the contact system [22] . This system is termed the contact system because the serine protease, factor XII (FXII) is activated by contact with anionic surfaces resulting in 1) the activation of the Kallikrein-Kinin pathway that drives bradykinin-associated inflammation, 2) cleavage of FXI, resulting in increased thrombin, fibrin formation, and fibrin clot formation, 3) activation of complement through C1r and C1s, and 4) promotion of fibrinolysis [22] . C1-INH is the primary inhibitor of FXIIa in the plasma and is the only known natural inhibitor of the classical complement proteins C1r and C1s, such that they are unable to form the C1 complement activating complex [23, 24] . Further C1-INH inhibits the other two complement activation pathways by binding to maltose-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)-1 and -2 and C3b, activators of the lectin and alternative complement pathways, respectively. Deposition of complement proteins on the surface of SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to inhibit infection in vitro [25] as complement activation is a first line of defense against viral infection [26] .",

Activated complement-associated microvascular injury by fibrin deposition and neutrophil permeation has been observed in severe COVID-19 patients that experienced respiratory failure and purpuric skin rashes [2] . A recent pre-print showed that in vitro C1-INH attenuates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-mediated complement activation [28] , and treatment of COVID-19 patients with complement inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option [28, 29, 30] . Recent clinical data showed promising results when severe COVID-19 patients were administered recombinant C1-INH [31, 32] . Nonetheless, considering that C1-INH acts to broadly suppress innate and adaptive immune responses, caution must be considered prior to implementing widespread use C1-INH in COVID-19 patients [25, 27] . Further, interrogation of data from Overmyer et al. using the online resource, covid-omics.app, shows that there is a significant association between increased SERPING1 and C1-INH in COVID-19 hospitalized patients versus non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients (see Table S10 for more information) [20] , and thus, further increases in C1-INH may have detrimental effects.",

If C1-INH is also increased in asymptomatic patients it may be a contributing factor to the observed prolonged SARS-CoV-2 viral load and decreased levels of viral specific IgG versus those that were symptomatic [33] . Identifying truly asymptomatic versus pre-symptomatic versus mild COVID-19 patients is a complex process as has been outlined in Long et al. [33] . Execution of such a clinical study is currently outside our focus of treating severe COVID-19 patients within our facilities. We think that our study provides important insight into patients that may otherwise go untested and uncharacterized due to the benign nature of their symptoms. Our purpose is to bring forth these data to the scientific community and spur ongoing studies of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with little to no COVID-19 symptoms.",

A hyper-response to aberrant complement activation by the extreme upregulation of SERPING1-encoded C1-INH may lead to widespread immunodepression, similar to what is observed in patients with systemic inflammatory syndrome [34] . Consideration must be given to the long-term effects, such as decreased humoral immunity, of the dysregulation of these pathways in COVID-19 patients, especially those with potentiating comorbidities that may contribute to higher re-infection risk.",
