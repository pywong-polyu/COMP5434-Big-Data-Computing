Work is a social determinant of health and nationwide, a half-million workers staff approximately 3,500 animal slaughtering and meatprocessing facilities (collectively, meat-processing facilities) (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2019; United States Census Bureau 2018). The U.S. food supply is heavily reliant on meat. Temporary meat-processing plant shutdowns in early 2020 created disruptions and loss across the food supply chain (Hobbs 2021) . This led to calls from the industry to maintain production despite outbreaks, culminating with former President Trump's April 2020 executive order declaring the meat supply critical to national infrastructure (Office of the White House 2020). As a result, meat-processing was treated like an essential industry and plants remained operational despite high numbers of COVID-19 positive workers.",

This was unsurprising in part because the executive order was not accompanied by any mandates for worker safety, and there are no national requirements for infection prevention for nonhealthcare workers (Yearby and Mohapatra 2020a) . Continued plant operations supported the food supply chain (Hobbs 2021) , benefited state and local economies, and provided income to workers; but it came with serious health risks for workers who, while working in an industry deemed \"essential,\" are too often treated as expendable.",

Outbreaks are exacerbated by prolonged exposure to the virus in indoor, crowded settings-such as meat-processing facilities with people working long shifts in close proximity. Several public health strategies can mitigate the risks of COVID-19 for workers and were reportedly implemented successfully in meat-processing plants in other countries, such as the Netherlands (de Rooij et al. 2021) and Germany (G\u00fcnther, et al. 2020) . For example, after outbreaks in German meat-processing plants, the government quickly introduced legal reforms addressing on-site protections as well as structural conditions that contributed to exploitation of migrant workers (Young 2020) . In the United States, however, implementation was and remains challenging both because of a societal orientation toward individualism rather than solidarity and the pro-industry, antiregulation political environment that has prioritized industries' economic interests over public health. By January 4, 2021 over 45,000 infections and nearly 250 deaths among meat-processing workers had been reported (Chadde 2021) .",

Attending to each of these core values entails balancing attention to several interrelated ethical principles. For instance, attending to health and safety, which are necessary conditions for human flourishing, requires effective measures that promote health and well-being (principle of beneficence) while preventing and minimizing harms (principle of non-maleficence). The core value of health justice and equity implicates both procedural and distributive considerations. Procedural health justice requires attention to principles of transparency, accountability, and reliability to enhance trust by those burdened by keeping essential industries operating during the pandemic (Thomas and Dasgupta 2020) . Distributive health justice requires the equitable distribution of resources and burdens, recognizing that COVID-19 disproportionately burdens some groups, including meat-processing workers, who belong to historically disenfranchised communities with compound disadvantages (APHA 2019; Goldberg 2017).",

This framework is based on our work to supplement IPC recommendations for meatprocessing facilities, whose workers were effectively deemed essential by the President's executive order. It is relevant for other industries that rely on low-wage workers that are or may be deemed \"essential\" during this or future pandemics. Although we addressed the issues in the context of conditions in spring 2020, this is also a case study in the harms of structural discrimination.

Going forward, OSHA should amend the existing PPE regulation to clarify its applicability to infectious disease pathogens in workplaces beyond healthcare and promulgate a new regulation for worker protections from infectious diseases spread by droplet and airborne transmission, such as COVID-19 for those in high-risk industries.",

To date, limited vaccine mandates exist is several states with a focus on government and healthcare workers (NASHP 2021); in contrast, some states have passed laws prohibiting COVID-19 vaccine mandates in certain circumstances (Hawkins and Campa 2021) . However, previous vaccine mandates at the state and local levels have been consistently upheld as lawful (Parmet 2018) . Those cases typically involve vaccines with well-established safety and effectiveness, arguably justifying mandates based on the context specific likelihood of reducing harm to the individual and others (Wynia 2007).",

These uncertainties, along with strain on already fragile trust in public health authorities and facility leadership, may have contributed to delays in vaccine uptake among workers (Bunge 2021) . Full FDA approval is imminent for all three available vaccines in the United States and safety data are robust, which may change decisions going forward. In the meantime, some meat-processing companies have offered financial incentives in return for vaccination (Polansek 2021) , a strategy that holds some promise (Volpp and Cannuscio 2021) but must be undertaken in conjunction with efforts to understand the root causes of vaccination resistance, provide transparent communication, and address structural factors (like lack of paid sick leave) that can hinder vaccine uptake among meat processing workers. Others moved to mandates that coincided with the FDA's grant of full approval to the Pfizer vaccine (Olberding 2021 ) and numerous other private employers are adopting vaccine mandates, including Google, Facebook, Uber, Disney, and Walmart (Hirsch 2021).",

            "text": "Increased rates of vaccination will most certainly decrease the rates of infection among workers. At the same time, it might also lead facility management and workers to overestimate vaccine protections and erode workplace IPC strategies and PPE provision-a phenomenon described as risk compensation, negative spillover, or moral licensing (Maxin et al. 2016; Mantzari et al. 2020) . This is especially concerning considering likely future variants for which existing vaccines may prove less effective and may require re-implementation of strict IPC measures to reduce transmission. Concerns about risk compensation do not justify withholding effective public health interventions (Mantzari et al. 2020) ; however, we raise this issue in the context of organizational decisions as vaccines are allocated to workers, since it emphasizes the importance of establishing and maintaining the capacity to rapidly re-implement worker IPC measures even as vaccination campaigns proceed. Providing rapid access to no-cost care for workers who contract COVID-19, regardless of insurance coverage or immigration status, is warranted in a pandemic. This is a distinct argument from ongoing national conversations about universal healthcare access and coverage. This is especially critical given the variability of workers' compensation coverage, which in some states does not cover pandemic diseases contracted in the workplace and in others is complicated by multiple issues, such as causation (Hyman et al. 2020) . This can severely delay or preclude altogether coverage for treatment, rehabilitation, and wage replacement. As a matter of equity, reciprocity, and respect, as well as to incentivize workers to seek early treatment for symptomatic infections, the cost of covering care for workers should be borne by those who profit from uninterrupted meat processing operations, including the industry and the government.",

Industries like meat-processing facilities-with congregate and highdensity workplaces staffed by workers who are already disadvantaged by structural discrimination-present challenges for those charged with IPC recommendations. During a public health crisis our interdependence and commitments to equity and reciprocity become paramount (Gellert 2020) . Businesses that benefit financially from essential industry status must shoulder burdens in a way that acknowledges the disadvantages and sacrifices of their workers. Namely, if an industry is deemed essential, the workers in the industry should be treated as essential, too. We have focused on meatprocessing, but the ethical values and principles we used throughout this analysis are applicable to other workers in essential industries, such as agriculture (Ramos et al. 2021c) , retail and public service workers, and attendants in long-term care. Implementation of IPC recommendations must be anchored in the public health values of health and safety, justice and equity, and interdependence and solidarity with an obligation to principles of harm reduction, minimizing risks, and promoting health for workers and their communities.",
