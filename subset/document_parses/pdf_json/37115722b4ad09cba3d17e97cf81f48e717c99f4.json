The study participants had more females (53.8%) than males (46.1%). The highest qualification ranked from school level to Ph.D. level. Geographically, participants were from 14 different countries; however, the maximum number of participants were of Asian race (88.4%) ( Figure 2 ). Based on pre-survey (week 0) questionnaires, 41 (5%) participants had severe insomnia (SI), 92 (11.22%) had moderate insomnia (MI), 149 (18.17%) had subthreshold insomnia (STI) ( Table 2 and Figure 3 ). Following YOI intervention, a marked reduction in the mean ISI score was noted in all categories, 23.88 \u00b1 0.25 to 10.46 \u00b1 1.27 in the severe group; 17.71 \u00b1 0.21 to 6.51 \u00b1 0.64 in the moderate group, and 10.87 \u00b1 0.17 to 4.95 \u00b1 0.38 in the subthreshold group (Table 2) . 17.71 \u00b1 0.21 8.21 \u00b1 0.57 **** 6.51 \u00b1 0.64 **** STI (n = 149) 10 .87 \u00b1 0.17 5.94 \u00b1 0.39 **** 4.95 \u00b1 0.38 **** NI (n = 538) 2.16 \u00b1 0.10 1.91 \u00b1 0.13 1.58 \u00b1 0.13 **** SI: severe insomnia; MI: moderate insomnia; STI: subthreshold insomnia; NI: no clinically significant insomnia. '*' is significance level compared to pre, where, **** p \u2264 0.0001. At baseline, 41 participants had severe insomnia; 92, moderate insomnia; and 149 had subthreshold insomnia. At 8 weeks, these numbers were reduced to 9 in the severe group, 33 in the moderate group, and 74 in the subthreshold group, with an increase in the number of participants in the 'no clinically significant insomnia' category (537 at baseline; increased to 703 at 8 weeks). Compared to baseline, in the severe group, there was 92.68% reduction in the number of participants at 4 weeks and 78.05% reduction at 8 weeks. Likewise, the number of participants with moderate insomnia reduced by 70.65% at 4 weeks and 64.13% at 8 weeks. The number of participants with subthreshold insomnia reduced by 30.87% at 4 weeks and further reduced by 50.34% at 8 weeks (Table 3) . On the contrary, the number of participants with 'no clinically significant insomnia' increased by 27.75% at 4 weeks and 30.91% at 8 weeks (Table 3 ), indicating that those participants in the severe, moderate, and subthreshold categories moved into the 'no clinically significant insomnia' category after YOI intervention.",

The higher percentage of participants with daily practice could be a sign of participant acceptance of YOI intervention, which could be due to benefits received to participants through daily practice. The mean ISI score was lowest for the participants who practiced the YOI everyday (Table 4 ; Figure 5 ). The scores for daily practitioners were one-half (3.05 \u00b1 0.16) compared to those who practiced YOI 2-3 times (6.63 \u00b1 0.95), or 4-6 times per week 4.58 \u00b1 0.42.

After YOI intervention, we found a significant reduction in the mean ISI score in the multiple disorder group (13.53 \u00b1 1.16 to 7.28 \u00b1 0.97, p \u2264 0.0001). The other group with a significant reduction in the mean ISI score was GAD (10.96 \u00b1 1.60 to 5.26 \u00b1 1.00, p \u2264 0.01). Compared to baseline, the reduction in the mean scores at 8 weeks was ~50% in both. Table 6 . Changes in mean ISI scores in participants with different psychiatric disorders (n = 115). One-way repeated measures ANOVA with multiple comparisons using Tukey's test was used for comparison with 95% confidence interval. ",

It is a basic requirement for the normal functioning of metabolic, endocrine, neurological, and cognitive functions; it is vital for one's health and general well-being. Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-I) and pharmacological intervention constitute the mainstay treatments of insomnia. Clinical practice guidelines published by the American College of Physicians (2016) recommended CBT-I as the initial treatment for insomnia [11] . Although CBT-I is considered the treatment of choice, the availability of trained personnel is the limiting factor for the effective implementation of a structured CBT-I program. In addition, CBT-I is not widely used, partly due to the cost of treatment by trained CBT-I providers and lack of insurance coverage for these services [19] . Furthermore, psychological and behavioral interventions are complex, have various protocols, and may have varying degrees of success for different individuals [20] . These issues with CBT-I carry even greater significance in the current setting of the COVID 19 pandemic.",
