            "text": "Since the aerosol cloud persists continuously in a dental setting where patients and procedures come in succession and overlap within a day, the use of personal protective equipment is highly recommended, and most of the oro-nasal mask [6] . Among them, respirators known as Filtering Face Pieces (FFP) have a clear protective superiority compared to surgical masks because they are created and specifically tested to obtain the maximum protection in both respiratory directions [6] . Respirators are therefore a mandatory and logical device necessary to protect dental professionals from aerosol inhalation and blood spatter. Italian legislation defines FFPs as, \"an equipment...worn by the worker capable of protecting him from health risks...in the performance of his duties\" (Art. 74 dlg 81-2008). European legislation provides two different respirators classification standards, and both fall among the standards recognized by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). According to European standards (EN 149: 2001) FFPs are classified in three distinct subclasses depending on their aerosol filtration efficiency towards powders with granulometry between 0.02 and 2 \u00b5. These subclasses are as follows: FFP1, with total filtering efficiency of at least 80%; FFP2, with a minimum total filtering efficiency of 94% (specifications close to N95 respirators in the USA); and FFP3 with a minimum total filtering efficiency of 99% [7, 8] . EN 143: 2007 subdivides respirators in P1/P2/P3 (with an efficiency, respectively, of 80%, 94% and 99.95%) [6] . Besides the protection class, a further and important distinction is the recognition of two classes based on the nature of the aerosol, which are class S for water-based mists and class SL for organic mists. Given the prevailing aqueous base of the dental aerosol, FFP2 class S are recommended [9] .",

There are different methods to measure the filtration efficiency, such as the particulate filtration efficiency (PFE), bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), and viral filtration efficiency (VFE) [12] . BFE requires aqueous bacterial aerosol droplets (with the diameter size of 3 \u00b5m) and measures the capability of the masks to stop the large particles from speech, coughing and sneezing, with the size distribution from 0.6 \u00b5m up to thousands of microns expelled by the mask's wearer [13] . The BFE test offers a number of advantages over other filtration efficiency tests. It has been used with little or no modification for years and provides a standard reference for comparison of filtration materials [6, 12] . The mean particle size can be cautiously controlled permitting stage-by-stage analysis. This allows filtration efficiencies to be reported up to >99.9%.",

Even if this test is focused on bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), the filtering ability is based on droplets of about 3 \u00b5m in size (3.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m), a dimension which better represents inhaled particles that can reach the lower respiratory system.

These FFP2 presented an ergonomic, flat-fold, 3-panel design featuring a low breathing resistance filter media, a chin tab and an embossed, fluid resistance, sculpted upper panel to help reduce eyewear fogging. These respirators are recommended and marked as non-reusable (NR), meaning that they can be used for only one single shift (according to EN 149:2001 + A1:2009). Although the manufacturer refused to reveal us the specific composition of the layers of the respirator 3M1862+, the only official indication provided by email from 3 M described four layers made of non-cellulose synthetic fibers based on nonwoven polypropylene spunbond and meltblown.",

This examination, expressed as a per-centage, is indicative of how much part of the mask or respirator represents an effective and efficient barrier for the operator towards a bacterial aerosol. This test is performed on the center of the internal side of the respirator (Figure 1 ). Initially, the test bacterial solution was inserted into a nebulizer using a disposable pipette and a positive check without any specimen (initial blank) was ran. Triptic Soy Agar (TSA) plates were named with date, stage position and sample number. They were then were placed inside the cascading impactor, one plate on each stage. The test bacterial solution (Staphylococcus aureus aerosol) was released by turning on the vacuum pump for a duration of 2 min, adjusting the flow rate based on the speed value continuously measured by the flow meter, so as to have a flow rate of 28.3 L/min ( Figure 2 ). Plates, numbered to indicate their position in the impactor, were then removed from the cascade impactor and stored in the incubator at 37 \u00b1 2 \u2022 C from 20 to 52 h. All stages of the impactor were washed and sterilized. Bacterial solution was then reinserted into the nebulizer. Other plates were placed on the respective stages of the impactor, fixing the specimens in the stand between the first stage and the aerosol inlet cone operating the equipment (Figure 3) . All plates were removed from the impactor, washed and sterilized at all stages. These procedures were repeated for all specimens, and when the last sample was tested, an additional positive check was performed (final blank). Finally, all plates were incubated at 37 \u00b1 2 \u2022 C for 20-52 h. Each tested area was at least 49 cm 2 .",

Isopropanol treatment caused significant deterioration of filtration efficacy on three different respirators, whereas ultraviolet germicidal irradiation preserved the filtration efficacy after up to 10 treatments in all the tested respirators [20] . Due to the widespread application of alcohol-based disinfectants, it is important to emphasize that FFP respirators should not be sprayed with alcohol, as it can remove the electrostatic charge from the respirator filter material, severely decreasing the filter's effectiveness at collecting particles [21] . Microwave-generated steam was shown to be effective in FFP2 decontamination but also incompatible with some kind of respirators, due to arcing observed around some types of metal nose clips and by loss of adhesion of clips to the mask [22] . One-hour treatment in a climate chamber at 70 \u2022 C with 75% humidity rate was shown to be adequate for enabling substantial decontamination of FFP2s [7] . Recent literature reviews concluded that the evidence supporting appropriate decontamination strategies for FFP2 respirators remains scarce, although ultraviolet irradiation and vaporized hydrogen peroxide seem to be the current recommended standard [23] .",

Furthermore, the possibility of using an FFP2 NR respirator for several shifts seems acceptable, which means the clinician can make the personal choice of considering FFPs as reusable. Future studies with a higher number of samples, respirators of different brands and with different protection levels and different filtration tests are recommended and are currently ongoing. ",
