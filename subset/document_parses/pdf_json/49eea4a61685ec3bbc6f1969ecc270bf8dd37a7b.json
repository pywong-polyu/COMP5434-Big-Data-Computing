While NAFLD is perceived as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome (MetS), the relationship between components of metabolic syndrome is bidirectional and interactive, making it complex to fully comprehend its mechanisms [9] . The heterogenous nature of the disease accounts for the lack of approved pharmacotherapy for NAFLD, and therefore current management strategies of NAFLD focus on lifestyle modifications (e.g., weight loss, healthy diet and increased physical activity) and the mitigation of comorbidities associated with metabolic syndrome [10] [11] [12] .",

Additionally, dyslipidemia is defined as the presence of one or more abnormal serum lipid concentrations, and it is the main risk factor related to cardiovascular disease. In these patients, antihyperlipidemic agents are a crucial component along with lifestyle modification in the treatment of dyslipidemia. The benefits and safety of antihyperlipidemic agents in NAFLD patients with dyslipidemia were established by previous studies [13] . However, its beneficiary effects were evaluated mostly from a cardiovascular perspective rather than the improvement of hepatic steatosis or fibrosis itself.",

However, defining \"healthy diet\" is a challenging process. Cultural and regional differences in diet intake further add difficulty in applying guideline-supported diets such as the Mediterranean diet or the hypocaloric diet [14] . Even so, the role of nutritional management and its effect is further established in other chronic diseases, notably in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and T2DM. Both CKD and T2DM guidelines suggest that evidence-based medical nutritional therapy (MNT) is of substantial importance [15, 16] . MNT in T2DM and CKD is accepted as medical practice and is covering by insurance in Korea. Similarly, consistent nutritional education and dietary recommendation may contribute to improved clinical outcomes in NAFLD patients with dyslipidemia when combined with pharmacologic treatment. Although previous studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of MNT in NAFLD patients, the long-term effects of MNT remain unknown because most of the studies had relatively short duration within 3 to 6 months [17, 18] .",

            "text": "While the ideal macronutrient composition of diet for NAFLD patients is not established, the importance of a healthy diet in NAFLD and MetS is widely acknowledged. In particular, carbohydrate restriction and the Mediterranean diet are the two most recognized options to be effective for NAFLD patients [29] . This regimen contributes to the reduction in not only NAFLD but also many metabolic contexts such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and even cancer [30] The Mediterranean diet is based on rich monounsaturated fats, plant-derived foods and fruit with limited carbohydrate, red meat and dairy. In particular, the effect of the Mediterranean diet has been widely studied and has been to be proven beneficial in regard to metabolic diseases, NAFLD, morbidity and overall mortality by several previous studies [30] [31] [32] . However, applying the Mediterranean diet to non-Western populations is a challenging process due to cultural differences in various regions [33] . The traditional Korean diet pattern is composed of salted vegetables, seafood, low saturated fat food, and cereals. However, adaptations to Western lifestyles and diet patterns have increased the prevalence of conditions related to MetS in the past decades.",

There was no significant difference between the MNT and control groups after 48 weeks of education in serum ALT. Similar to our study, existing research on specific nutrients and dietary habits have failed to improve steatosis, fibrosis or inflammation. A few reasons may account for this negative result. First, the study participants might have been motivated to comply with the provided nutrition education at the beginning of the study, but their adherence to education contents may have declined over time. As noted on Table 3 , certain values (CAP score, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, body fat percentage and HOMA-IR) in the MNT group showed favorable results, which were more profound at 24 weeks relative to 48 weeks while without statistical significance. This finding may suggest that continuous adherence to MNT throughout the study period was difficult. Second, the effect of the diet and nutrition education may differ depending on the genetic predisposition such as PNPLA3 or TM6SF2 mutation, so it is necessary to customize it for each individual. However, the same protocol was applied for all the participants in our study [34] . Finally, our study group comprised a relatively small sample size after dropout. This may have affected the study results.",

Nevertheless, serum AST, ALT, CAP score and FIB-4 index showed significant improvements in the MNT group after 48 weeks compared to baseline. A possible explanation for this discordance may include increased attention to the disease and interest in dietary modification by the participants. Additionally, regular visits to the clinic along with MNT may have served as a reminder, encouraging the participants to comply with the recommended diet patterns. These improvements in some variables provide a rationale supporting the potential benefits and necessity of MNT in NAFLD patients.",

Despite the attempts of several previous studies to address the effect of MNT in NAFLD patients, randomized controlled trials are scarce and the majority of the reports consist of single-arm, observational studies [35] . Moreover, our study was conducted in Korea, which is a non-Western area. While most of the previous nutrition studies tend to be based on Western countries, the modification of MNT based on regional culture should be considered, since applying the Mediterranean diet without regard for regional difference is not an optimal approach. Additionally, the antihyperlipidemic agent used in this study was statin combined with ezetimibe. Previous studies of antihyperlipidemic agents in NAFLD patients mainly focus on the effect of statin. Existing studies showed relatively little interest in ezetimibe or combined agents.",

Due to the high variation among subjects in liver pathology and disease stage, the effects of a 48-week lifestyle intervention were difficult to analyze in this relatively small cohort. In addition, MNT superimposed on a pharmaceutical intervention affected liver enzyme results, which also contributed to such difficulties. Hence, the simultaneous initiation of a relatively weak intervention with a relatively strong (pharmaceutical) intervention is a major limitation of this study. Second, the total number of study participants was 48 patients, which is not a large sample size. In a study of this size, it may be difficult to discover the effects of lifestyle change due to the heterogenous nature of NAFLD. Additionally, the overall results may vary even with small changes in patient outcomes. Third, adherence to MNT depended on self-reports by participants in the form of a questionnaire and diary. Such tools are difficult to quantify and rely heavily on patient recall. Finally, the evaluation of steatosis or fibrosis was performed by batteries of non-invasive modalities instead of liver biopsy, which is the most reliable diagnostic tool for hepatic steatosis or fibrosis.",
