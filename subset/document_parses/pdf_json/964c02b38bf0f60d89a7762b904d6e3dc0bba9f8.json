Information technology (IT) and electronic immunization can be effective in accelerating and improving vaccine coverage. The aim of this paper is to develop multi-dimensional framework of e-health roadmap to response Covod-19 pandemic and examine the role of IT for improving vaccine distribution in Iran. Methods: The study methodology was based on a two-stage Delphi method which included literature studies at the beginning. Key steps in creating a roadmap in this study include definition, development and evaluation. The initial conceptual model was developed after literature review. Proposed roadmap was reviewed and evaluated in two stages based on the Delphi method by experts in the fields of E-health.",

In this study, 14 strategic axes of COVID-19 vaccination coverage were presented in three phases before, during and after vaccination. IT interventions in three phases were including: EHR, SMS reminders, GPS, GIS, social media, E-mail, registration system, screening system, clinical Integration of technologies facilitates the vaccination coverage process. GIS big data analyzing and IOT data can help managers and policy makers for prioritizing [23] . Spatial analysts can help vaccine distribution by gathering comprehensive information [36] .",
