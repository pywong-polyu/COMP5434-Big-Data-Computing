Instead, RADx Tech leveraged methodologies developed by CIMIT and utilized by POCTRN as described further in this special issue. RADx Tech uses a multi-stage review with two review panels, a Viability Panel and a Steering Panel, that are supported by subject matter experts and a Deep Dive team. Members of the panels have extensive commercialization and business experience in addition to scientific and technical knowledge. The Viability Panel is responsible for assessing whether the proposal is a good fit with the RADx Tech Program and whether it should be recommended to move into a Deep Dive. Less detailed information is requested in the application than a typical SBIR application since the application is refined and details added during the Deep Dive. The Steering Panel reviews the results from the Deep Dive and decides whether to recommend further funding. Everyone on the Viability Panel and Steering Panel reviews every application, thereby providing consistency and context for the reviewers. Utilization of an \"assess, improve, and then select\" process with review panels comprised of highly experienced review panel members has resulted in improved timing, efficiency, and effectiveness of reviews and has the potential to be extensible beyond RADx Tech.",

The charter of RADx Tech is to accelerate the development, validation, and commercialization of innovative point-of-care and home-based tests, as well as improvements to clinical laboratory tests, that can directly detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, with the goal of making SARS-CoV-2 testing readily available to every American. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering's (NIBIB) Point-of-Care Technology Research Network (POCTRN), which is led by the Coordinating Center at the Consortia for Improving Medicine with Innovation & Technology (CIMIT) [1] , was selected to run the extramural aspects of the RADx Tech program. CIMIT was an early pioneer in translational research with over 20 years of experience in refining translational methods, processes, and tools and had been coordinating POCTRN for over two years. The CIMIT/POCTRN methodology was the basis for the RADx Tech grant review and management processes, as described further throughout this special issue.",

For applications that seem meritorious but are lacking information, the Viability Panel can request that the applicant resubmit the application with clarifications and/or additional information in specific areas requested by the Viability Panel. Resubmitted applications are reviewed using the same process outlined above and are typically re-reviewed within 48 hours of being resubmitted. In instances where the Viability Panel feels an application contains adequate information, but the Viability Panel could use additional expert review, the application is forwarded to a Rolling Assessment. Rolling Assessments are conducted by SMEs selected with specific expertise to address the questions posed by the Viability Panel. Based on the assessment received from the SMEs, the Viability Panel discusses the application and makes a recommendation to the NIH. The Viability Panel can make one of three recommendations; move the application to Deep Dive, redirect the application to another funding mechanism, or reject the application. Viability Panel members can change their comments and personal recommendation in CoLab after the panel discussions, but they are not encouraged to \"harmonize\" their vote with the consensus of the group. Rather, they are encouraged to maintain their individual perspectives and opinions, if they persist after the discussions, so that NIH could take in the perspectives of all the panel members when making their decisions.",

WP1 is similar to SBIR Phase 1 and WP2 is similar to SBIR Phase 2 and 3 combined.
