In this study, we retrieved 800 SARS-CoV-2 full-length sequences from GISAID database on 14 December 2021 (Alpha 110, Beta 101, Gamma 108, Delta 110, Omicron 107, Lambda 98, Mu 101, GH/490R 65).

Notably, we identified 25 unique AA mutations in Omicron, which may affect the transmission and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we analyzed the effect of Omicron on epitope peptide. As expected, 64.1% mutations (25/39) of Omicron variants were in epitopes, which was significantly higher than in other variants. These mutations may cause a poor response to vaccines to Omicron variants. In conclusion, Omicron variants, as an emerging mutation, should be alerted for us due that it may lead to poor vaccine response, and more data is needed to evaluate the virulence and vaccines responses to this variants.",

It appears to be rapidly spreading, and the WHO classified it as a variant of concern (VOC) designating it as Omicron. The Omicron variant has been reported in travel-related cases in several European countries and Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Nigeria, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In this study, 6,092,003 sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from GISAID 1 on 14 December 2021 (https://www.gisaid.org/). To the more convenient analysis of the mutation patterns among different variants, 800 latest high-coverage complete genomes SARS-CoV-2 strains (Alpha 110, Beta 101, Gamma 108, Delta 110, Omicron 107, Lambda 98, Mu 101, GH/490R 65) were included in this study and listed in Supplementary Table1. The complete genome sequences were aligned with the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512) by MAFFT (version 7.0, https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). The aligned genomes were then edited manually according to the reference sequence by BioEdit software. Finally, a total of 1320 amino acid (AA) sites in all open reading frames (ORFs) were detected mutations from all the 800 sequences (",
