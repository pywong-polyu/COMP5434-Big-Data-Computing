For this analysis, the primary objectives were to evaluate the VE of 2 doses of mRNA-1273 in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the VE of 2 doses of mRNA-1273 in preventing SARS--CoV-2 infection by age, sex, and race/ethnicity groups. We also evaluated the waning of VE over time to assess the durability of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization. To specifically assess VE against Delta in the absence of waning, we also evaluated VE against Delta infection in individuals newly vaccinated in June 2021 and followed through September 30, 2021 .

VE against COVID-19 hospitalization and hospital death was higher than the VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection, corroborating previous evidence that mRNA vaccines offer greater protection against more severe disease [1, 25, 26] . We previously found mRNA-1273 to have a high VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection before the Delta variant spread in the US [1] . The Delta variant started emerging in the US in late May 2021 and quickly became the dominant variant during June through August 2021 [27] . A study in Qatar evaluated VE of mRNA-1273 against the Delta variant [28] , and found a VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection of 73.1% (95% CI: 67.5%-77.8%). In the current study, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated for the Delta period in a subset of individuals newly vaccinated during June 2021 and followed up through September 2021; VE against Delta after three months of follow-up was 86.5%, similar to the VE observed in our prior interim analysis (87.4%) [1] . This finding is less subject to waning and suggests that mRNA-1273 generates protection against the Delta variant.",

The same VE waning effects were apparent across age categories (18-64 years and \ufffd65 years). These findings are consistent with the findings of our previous studies that used a test-negative design [13, 29] , the most recent of which found VE against Delta infection decreased from 80.2% to 61.3% within 12 months of follow-up.

Another strength is KPSC's diverse member population. The study also utilized KPSC's EHR and was able to gather comprehensive data on millions of members; the data included COVID-19 vaccine information, demographics, medical history, and health care utilization. However, residual confounding from unmeasured factors might have still been present. Some health seeking behaviors such as adherence to masking guidelines and occupation are not captured by the EHR; these may contribute to differences in COVID-19 risk and testing behaviors between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Misclassification of SARS-CoV-2 infection from false positive or false negative test results or from inaccurate diagnosis codes from outside claims may have been another limitation. This non-differential misclassification could have underestimated the VE. In addition, individuals vaccinated during the Delta period were younger as vaccines had recently become available to the general population and may have had fewer COVID-19 risk factors, which could have led to overestimation of VE during the Delta period. Lastly, since follow-up for this study ended in September 2021, VE during the Omicron period was not assessed.",
