Worldwide, allergic rhinitis affects between 10 and 30% of the population and an overall increase in prevalence has been shown in recent studies [2] . Epidemiological studies have identified environmental risk factors, such as air pollutant exposure and climate change, as potentially associated with this trend [3, 4] .",

The study was conducted outside of the typical ragweed pollen season in the locale of the environmental exposure unit (EEU). Details of the EEU methodology are available in the Supplementary Material. Figure 1 At Visit 1, ragweed sensitivity was determined via skin testing. Additionally, skin prick tests were performed to assess sensitivity to other common allergens (dog, cat, Alternaria, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, grass, trees). During Visit 2 (Period 1), eligible subjects were exposed to ragweed pollen alone in the EEU and TNSS was self-assessed every 30 min during the first 3 h of exposure (in the EEU). Subjects were then discharged and recorded hourly TNSS scores for the following 9 h; those who reported at least one TNSS score of \u2a7e3 during the first 3 h of Visit 2 were eligible for Visit 3 (Period 2). In Period 2 eligible subjects were exposed to ragweed+DEP in the EEU for 3 h and then discharged. The timing of TNSS assessments was identical to that in Period 1. At Visit 4 (Period 3) subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive either fexofenadine HCl 180 mg or placebo. Subjects were exposed to ragweed+DEP for 3 h and study medication was administered at hour 2. TNSS was rated every 30 min during the first 3 h of ragweed+DEP exposure and then hourly up to hour 12. Each challenge period was separated by at least a two-week washout.

Four subjects were excluded from the evaluable population due to the absence of baseline TNSS in Period 1 or Period 2, leaving 257 subjects. In total, 13 eligible subjects discontinued the study before entering Period 3 due to: scheduling conflicts (five), adverse events (two), meeting an exclusion criterion (two), withdrawal of consent (one), poor compliance to protocol (one), EEU challenge intolerance (one) and withdrawal from study (one).

A study of 18 atopic individuals found increased allergen-induced inflammation of the lower respiratory tract following diesel exhaust exposure [21] . A co-exposure to allergens and diesel exhaust augments inflammatory cells and TH2-related cytokines, while lowering host defence peptides and altering DNA methylation and protein responses in the lungs [22] [23] [24] . DIAZ-SANCHEZ et al. [25] documented a significant increase in IgG4 in nasal lavage samples from ragweed-sensitised individuals after ragweed+DEP exposure versus ragweed alone, which was believed to be mediated via an increase in ragweed-specific IgE.

In an 11-country survey, the majority of participants attributed climate changes (81.1%) and pollutants (51.2%) as contributors to their allergic rhinitis symptoms [27] . In another survey conducted in four regions including Europe, 71.15% of participants attributed the increasing prevalence of allergic rhinitis to \"increased exposure to allergens, irritants and pollutants\" [28] . Another recent study showed a harmful effect of air pollution ( particularly ozone) on allergic rhinitis control, especially during grass pollen season. Positive associations were found between air pollutants (ozone and PM 2.5 ) and allergic rhinitis symptoms. Differences between pollen seasons were also found, suggesting an interaction between air pollution and pollen exposure (e.g. the dose-dependent deleterious effects of pollen exposure were magnified by air pollutant exposure) [29] . While a growing body of evidence supports a link between allergic diseases and air pollution [3, 30] , other studies show mixed results [31, 32] . M\u00d6LTER et al. [32] found no significant association between asthma prevalence and exposure to selected air pollutants in a meta-analysis of five European birth cohorts. Similarly, BURTE et al. [31] found no association between long-term air pollution exposure and the incidence of self-reported rhinitis among the same European cohorts analysed by M\u00d6LTER et al. [32] . Reasons for these heterogeneous observations may include differences in study design, exposure assessment, air pollutants included and air pollution monitoring site locations. Ultimately, air pollution has an important role in the development and prevalence of allergic symptoms, but its precise influences have not been fully established [2, 26, 33, 34] .",

A review of the studies investigating allergic rhinitis symptoms aggravated by air pollutants showed that fexofenadine HCl is the only allergic rhinitis medication with demonstrated efficacy and tolerability for the management of DEP-aggravated symptoms [26, 30] . DEP exposure has been shown to trigger numerous pro-inflammatory signalling pathways other than histamine-mediated ones [30] . DEP increases circulating neutrophils, eosinophils, and cytokines, and induces the expression of adhesion molecules as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) which are critical for T cell activation [9, 21] . Additionally, an exacerbation of the inflammatory response may result from the generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidant overload [26] . Noteworthy, it has been demonstrated that fexofenadine HCl has additional anti-inflammatory properties besides the anti-histaminergic activity [36] . Fexofenadine HCl decreases cytokine levels, including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 among others, inhibits eosinophil adherence and chemotaxis, inhibits cyclo-oxygenase 2, and reduces the production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins [36] . These additional effects of fexofenadine could further contribute to the improvement of allergic rhinitis symptoms aggravated by the inflammatory response induced by DEP; however, more research is needed to demonstrate this hypothesis.",
