SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has caused detrimental effects not only on the global healthcare systems but also on social and economic aspect of human life [2] . The pandemic has affected various sectors including agriculture, manufacturing industry, education and finance industry, tourism and so on [2] . As vaccination is one of the most effective response to such outbreak, many scientists across the world got involved in the race to develop successful anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Among the different vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2, Covishield was the first vaccine approved for emergency use in Nepal. Covishield, also known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222), is a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenoviral vector vaccine that contains SARS-CoV-2 structural surface glycoprotein antigen gene and was developed at Oxford University [3] . The different clinical trials that were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Covishield showed that the vaccine was safe and efficacious in the trial population [3, 4] . Nepal started its first phase vaccination drive starting on Jan 27, 2021, with the COVISHIELD vaccine for frontline health workers [5] . According to a cross-sectional study conducted at Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS), Nepal to calculate the incidence of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) observed after the first dose of Covishield vaccine minor AEFIs were seen in 85.1 % of recipients whereas serious AEFI and severe minor AEFI were in 0.06 % and 0.03% recipients, respectively [5] . In this study, one case of anaphylaxis was observed, however no deaths were reported [5] . In the EudraVigilance drug safety database there has been reported 62 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, 24 cases of spanchnic vein thrombosis, 18 cases of the fatal thrombotic events among 25 million recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine [6] . There have been 2 reported cases of deep vein thrombosis and one case of bilateral superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination [7, 8] . Here in this article, we report two cases of Superficial Vein Thrombosis (SVT) for the first time in the literature after vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.",

Initially, the pain was mild but later on the intensity of the pain gradually increased and it became severe on the fourth week of immunization. This case presented to emergency department on April 4, 2021. On evaluation, the patient complained of mild to moderate intensity pain that was non-radiating localized to left leg below the knee and aggravated by movements. The patient did not present any history of fever or swelling of the leg. The patient had no history of trauma to the leg in the area of pain. He had no similar presentation in the past. He did not use to smoke. He was living with his parents. He was a student. His family is middle income family. The patient was taking acetaminophen as analgesic. On vitals assessment, his pulse was 64 beats/min, blood pressure was 110/80 mm of Hg, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min and oxygen saturation was 97%. On local examination there was neither Highlights/Take-away message 1 . The Chimpanzee Adenovirus-vectored Vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine) has been widely used in Himalayan Country, Nepal and India. 2. Apart from other minor side effects, delayed thromboses in superficial vein have been reported after vaccination of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and they may be the consequences of vaccination though larger study is needed to verify them. 3. Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) should be an additional adverse effect to be mentioned in the list of adverse events associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Covishield, vaccine. 4. The benefits of the vaccine in breaking the chain of COVID 19 spread are certainly greater than the risk of thromboses. Details: Echogenic thrombus causing complete narrowing of proximal 1/3rd of SSV was noted, with almost similar findings in previous Doppler report. The thickening of the proximal part of SSV was 3.5 mm in diameter (Fig. 1) whereas that of the distal part of SSV was 2.4 mm in diameter (Fig. 2) .",

These two cases had a negative d-dimer test and a low Wells score but were diagnosed with DVT. Similarly in our cases the patients had no swelling or skin discoloration at the pain site but we could diagnose it SVT of left SSV with the help of ultrasound examination. There has been a case reported in literature where a 55-year-old woman developed bilateral superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination [8] . In a case series that studied 11 patients in Germany and Austria, 9 patients had cerebral venous thromboses, 3 had splanchnic-vein thrombosis, 3 had pulmonary embolism and 4 had other thromboses like Aortoiliac, right intraventricular, iliofemoral vein, widespread microvascular thrombi, multiple organ thrombi [11] . The authors of this case series also clearly pointed out that immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) is responsible for clot formation after vaccination [11] . This new phenomenon of thromboses after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination is termed as vaccine induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) [12] . Thrombocytopenia was however not seen in both of our cases.",
