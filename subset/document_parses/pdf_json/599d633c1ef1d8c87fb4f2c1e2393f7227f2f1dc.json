Companies were instructed, where possible, to start with remote work or home office. This was analyzed and estimated to be feasible and implemented for educational schools and universities.

It has also shown in this time, where human population was endangered across the entire planet, education was not stopped nor paused. Teachers together with their pupils and students have managed to use cloud technologies and Internet applications in the most effective way, which usually in large IT companies would require significant resources of IT experts to make everything work with no issues.
