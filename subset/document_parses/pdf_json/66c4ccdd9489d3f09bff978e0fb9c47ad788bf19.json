Brazil's social, health and economic crises are aggravated by strong societal inequities and persisting political disarray. This complex scenario motivates careful study of the clinical, socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors contributing to increased risk of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil specifically. We consider the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe catalog, a very rich respiratory infection dataset which allows us to estimate the importance of several non-laboratorial and socio-geographic factors on COVID-19 mortality. We analyze the catalog using machine learning algorithms to account for likely complex interdependence between metrics. The XGBoost algorithm achieved excellent performance, producing an AUC-ROC of 0.813 (95% CI 0.810-0.817), and outperforming logistic regression. Using our model we found that, in Brazil, socioeconomic, geographical and structural factors are more important than individual comorbidities. Particularly important factors were: The state of residence and its development index; the distance to the hospital (especially for rural and less developed areas); the level of education; hospital funding model and strain. Ethnicity is also confirmed to be more important than comorbidities but less than the aforementioned factors. In conclusion, socioeconomic and structural factors are as important as biological factors in determining the outcome of COVID-19. This has important consequences for policy making, especially on vaccination/non-pharmacological preventative measures, hospital management and healthcare network organization.",

Brazil's social, health and economic crises are aggravated by strong societal inequities 2 and political disarray 3 . COVID-19 outcomes are likely to be the result of the interplay between patient and environmental factors. Age is now well established as the dominant determinant of mortality [4] [5] [6] [7] . We have previously demonstrated the important effect of ethnicity and socioeconomic status in determining outcome in Brazil 2 . A number of institutional and organizational effects may also be important. It has been shown that treatment site seems to have a substantial association with mortality, comparable to the effect of comorbidity, at least for intensive care outcomes 8 . This suggests that institutional and organizational factors may be important. This is reasonable as it is likely that different hospitals may vary in their ability to respond to a surge in cases either because they are locally overwhelmed, experience an early influx of patients before surge capacity can be put into place or because they are inherently less able to expand capacity. A limited number of studies have attempted to look at this. A recent study in the United States did find evidence to support an association between hospital strain and increased mortality 9 for critical care patients, but not ward patients, and that this relationship changed over time. A similar negative impact of intensive care capacity was seen in Belgium 10 . A full understanding of the interplay between patient and healthcare system factors is crucial www.nature.com/scientificreports/ for rational, dynamic allocation of hospital resources as well as the targeting of both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. Healthcare systems vary substantially around the world, making local evaluation important. To our knowledge, this has not previously been undertaken in Brazil. Healthcare organizational factors are likely to be, to some extent, co-linear with other socioeconomic predictors and their effects may be non-linear: The extent to which organizational effects are real or the result of a failure to completely adjust for other factors in a linear model is not known. This observation motivates the use of explainable machine learning models able to deal with complex interactions and non-linear relationships.",

Model calibration is shown in Fig. 3 . While the difference in AUC-ROC between XGBoost and logistic regression may seem not large, it is in fact significant. For instance, holding specificity at 80.0%, XGBoost correctly predicted death by COVID-19 (positive condition) for 1,466 more patients (8.4% of the 17,357 patients) and, holding sensitivity at 80%, XGBoost correctly predicted survival for 1,971 more patients (6.8% of the 28,866 patients), in comparison with logistic regression. Equivalently, at 80% of specificity, XGBoost and logistic regression featured a sensitivity of 64.7% and 56.2%, respectively, while at 80% of sensitivity, they featured a specificity of 66.5% and 59.7%, respectively. Figure 4 shows the importance of the features considered in this analysis, excluding symptoms as they are not related to the patients' pre-infection conditions. The XCOVID-BR model shows that, in Brazil, comorbidities showed less association with outcome than socioeconomic, structural and ethnic factors, and confirms the well-known importance of age.",

Table 1 shows the demographic and socio-geographic characteristics and coexisting conditions among survivors and non-survivors. We also show the AUC-ROC relative to the XGB algorithm for patients belonging to each category, the odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding p-values. Within categories, we find qualitative agreement between the OR values and the relative feature importance shown in Fig. 4 . However, OR and feature importance weigh differently the various categories. For example, the OR analysis gives more significance to comorbidities. This highlights the beneficial use of the XGB model in coping with correlations between the covariates.",

We highlight the following factors: the state of residence and its development index, the distance to the hospital (very important for rural and less developed areas), the level of education, and hospital funding and strain. Social factors such as the level of education, correlated to income, are related to access to trustworthy information that may impact the susceptibility to COVID-19 16 . Our analysis, however, does not consider data from social media and news about COVID-19.

We also confirm the higher proportion of non-survivors in the North and Northeast macro-regions 2 .

The most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease and diabetes. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Of course many of these variables are correlated: Patients with access to private healthcare tend to have a higher education and better living conditions (city development index).

The lower performance relative to these sub-groups indicates that it is more difficult to forecast the evolution of the disease within certain sections of Brazilian society, possibly because there is not enough data for these sub-groups which may be characterized by a higher heterogeneity. In other words, these groups are more susceptible to COVID-19, and it is also harder to study factors underlying their COVID-19 mortality risk. We hope this result will be useful in motivating federal authorities in adopting effective action in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic for these groups. survival probability Figure 7 . Distribution of survival probability-ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (recovery)-as estimated by the XCOVID-BR model. We contrast typical publicly and privately funded hospitals from Pernambuco, an example of a region in the more socioeconomically challenged Northeast, with examples from the richer Paran\u00e1 region in the South. Stratifying by age, the dominant clinical predictor of mortality, it is apparent that the probability distribution is skewed with lower mortality in the wealthier (Paran\u00e1) region and this is particularly apparent in younger patients and in privately-funded hospitals. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Hospital funding model (private or public) was found to be a very important feature (Fig. 4) . We indeed clearly observe that public healthcare suffers from a higher mortality rate across all ages (Fig. 6) . This is not unexpected as private healthcare serves only 25% of the Brazilian population and total spending is similar to that of public healthcare, implying that, on average, a patient in a private hospital costs three times more than one in a public hospital 18 . In particular, public hospitals have 1.4 ICU beds per 10 thousand inhabitants, while private hospitals have 4.9. This difference is more pronounced in the North and Northeast regions, with 0.9 and 1.5 beds per 10 thousand inhabitants in public hospitals against 4.7 and 5.5 beds per 10 thousand inhabitants for private hospitals, respectively 19 . Complementary to a hospital's funding is its level of strain. Our findings are in line with the findings of previous studies 20, 21 and suggest the importance of funding public hospitals and better managing the healthcare network, with profound implications for policy making in Brazil.",
