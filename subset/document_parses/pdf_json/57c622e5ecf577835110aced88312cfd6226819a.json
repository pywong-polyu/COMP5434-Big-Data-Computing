The correlations between entrepreneurial psychological quality of college students, IEE in colleges, IPE, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy are analyzed with the Spearman correlation and linear regression. The hierarchical regression analysis is used to analyze the intermediary role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in IEE, IPE in colleges, and entrepreneurial psychological quality of college students. The results show that the entrepreneurial psychological quality of college students is significantly different in gender, family location, and grade level (p < 0.05); the main channels of IPE and daily IPE have significant positive effects on the positive entrepreneurship psychological quality (p < 0.05), and have extremely significant positive effects on the entrepreneurial self-efficacy (p < 0.001); innovation and entrepreneurship course, innovation and entrepreneurship practices, innovation and entrepreneurship environment, and total score of IEE have significant positive correlations with positive entrepreneurship psychological quality and entrepreneurial self-efficacy of college students (p < 0.05); and the intermediary effect of entrepreneurial self-efficacy accounts for 33.49% on the IPE and entrepreneurial psychological quality, and 41.85% on IEE and entrepreneurial psychological quality. In short, IPE and IEE can effectively improve the positive psychological quality and self-efficacy of college students, and the joint construction of the two can have a more significant effect.",

IEE in colleges has always been a matter of great concern to the Chinese government. The Ministry of Education stated in the \"Opinions on Promoting IEE in Colleges and Universities and Entrepreneurship Work for College Students\" that developing IEE in colleges and universities and actively encouraging college student to start up business is a major strategic measure for the education system to take deep learning and practice of the scientific development concept and serving the construction of an innovative country (Tritt et al., 2016) . With the development of the diversified situation of social transformation in China, the pattern of Marxism occupying the main belief position is gradually broken, which makes entrepreneurship college students inevitably fall into the dilemma of lack of political beliefs and confused value orientations . Ideological and political theory course is the main way for IPE in colleges and universities in China, so it should keep the pace with times to ensure the political direction of strengthening moral education and cultivating people of the IEE, and lead the value orientation of the IEE (Wnuk et al., 2020) . It is a crucial part of the new era to integrate the IPE with IEE for college students to train socialist builders and successors for the comprehensive development of moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetics, and labor skills.",

Based on the positive psychology, it believes that psychology should not only study the damages, defects, and injuries but also research the powers and excellent qualities; not only repair and compensate for damages and defects but also explore the potential and power of human beings; not only be the science about disease or health but also be the science about work, education, love, growth, and entertainment (Li et al., 2020) . For college students in entrepreneurship, it is not enough to learn rich theoretical knowledge of entrepreneurship, and they have to pay more attention to their own mental health, obtain positive entrepreneurial intentions and tenacious entrepreneurial will, so that the entrepreneurial ideas can be invested in the entrepreneurship practice (Wagemans et al., 2016) . Therefore, the positive psychological quality advocated by the positive psychology can better help college students face some difficulties in entrepreneurship, achieve successful entrepreneurship and life value, and acquire the subjective wellbeing (Fodor and Pintea, 2017) . Therefore, it intends to explore the correlation between positive psychological quality and IPE and IEE for college students from the perspective of positive psychology in this study.",

(2019) discussed the impacts and possible intermediary roles of network self-efficacy of non-information technology student on their core entrepreneurial capabilities, and found that the positive psychological thinking did regulate the correlation between the network entrepreneurial self-efficacy and network entrepreneurship intentions. Hu and Ye (2017) conducted a study on whether the entrepreneurial self-efficacies and entrepreneurial alertness of 364 Chinese students in sports majors could predict their entrepreneurial intentions, and found that the positive psychological reaction was a key cognitive predictor of self-efficacy, entrepreneurial alertness, and entrepreneurial intention of participant. Fern\u00e1ndez-P\u00e9rez et al. (2019) analyzed the Spanish college students participating in compulsory entrepreneurship course by using the structural equation modeling and found that emotional ability had a positive impact on the formation of entrepreneurial intention and cognitive antecedents (entrepreneurial attitude and self-efficacy); students with higher emotional abilities who accept the entrepreneurship education had more positive attitudes toward entrepreneurship and believed that they were more capable to become entrepreneurs. Swartz et al. (2018) discussed the correlation between psychological independence and entrepreneurial intention and the importance of entrepreneurship of the college students, and found that psychological independence had a positive effect on entrepreneurship, but had no direct impact on the entrepreneurial intention; entrepreneurial spirit had a full intermediary role between the psychological independence and entrepreneurial intention. Auerbach et al. (2018) explored the social entrepreneurship intentions of high school and college students through the partial least squares structural equation model, and found that the correlation between self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intention was regulated by positive emotions and the perceived social support. Mahendra et al. (2017) used the descriptive correlation design to analyze 230 students randomly selected from 540 students participating in three research projects, and found that the entrepreneurial intention was indirectly affected by entrepreneurial education, and the entrepreneurial motivation and attitude of the student were two important intermediary variables. Gozukara and Colakoglu (2016) explored the intermediary role of entrepreneurial alertness in the correlation between innovation ability and entrepreneurial intention of Turkish college students, and found that innovation had a positive impact on entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial alertness. Son et al. (2020) put forward the connotations and main characteristics of self-employment literacy of college students from the perspective of IPE, and expounded the practical value of self-employment literacy, aiming to help explore the development path of entrepreneurial quality of college students. Jun (2016) described the organic combination of IPE and IEE, indicating that the combination of the two was the key to meeting the comprehensive development needs of college students and improving their comprehensive abilities and qualities under the new situation.",

In terms of grades, the number of junior students is the largest (208), followed by sophomores (139) and seniors (98). Because juniors and seniors are about to graduate, they face greater employment pressure than freshmen and sophomores, so the sample selection has a certain bias. From the perspective of major, science students account for the largest proportion (341), followed by literature and history students (131). Besides, the colleges where the samples from are generally science and engineering colleges, so most samples are science and engineering students.

(2018) , suggesting that IPE has a significant impact on the cultivation of innovation efficiency and opportunity recognition ability of college students, so the H3 is true (Hu, 2016) . Innovation and entrepreneurship course, innovation and entrepreneurship practice, innovation and entrepreneurship environment, and total score of IEE have significantly positive effects on positive entrepreneurship psychological quality and entrepreneurial self-efficacy of college students (p < 0.05), suggesting that the IEE can effectively promote the cultivation of positive entrepreneurship psychological quality and entrepreneurial self-efficacy, so the H2 and H4 are true (Pearson et al., 2017) . It can be known by using the hierarchical regression analysis that the intermediary roles of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in IPE and entrepreneurship psychological quality are 33.49%, and that in IEE and entrepreneurship psychological quality is 41.85%, which is similar to the findings of Basinska and D\u00e5derman (2018) . Entrepreneurial self-efficacy plays a full intermediary role in IPE, IEE, and entrepreneurship psychological quality, so the H5 and H6 are true. The integrated construction of IPE and IEE can improve the innovation efficiency of college students and establish the positive entrepreneurship psychological quality.",

The results reveal that the entrepreneurship psychological quality of college students differs significantly in gender, family location, and grade. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy plays a full intermediary role in IPE, IEE, and entrepreneurship psychological quality. The integrated construction of IPE and IEE can improve the innovation efficiency of college students, and cultivate the positive entrepreneurship psychological quality. However, due to the limitation of practical conditions, the size of college students in this study is small, which has certain regional limitations and common general promotion. It will consider increasing the selection of student samples and introducing the entrepreneurship teaching of university teachers to further explore the correlation between the IPE and entrepreneurship education for college students. In conclusion, it provides a theoretical basis for the joint development of IPE and IEE for college students.",
