Here, using human and mouse models, we demonstrate that IFITM3 regulates MyD88-dependent TLR-mediated cytokine production following dendritic cell exposure to cytomegalovirus (CMV), and this process limits viral pathogenesis in vivo. IFITM3 also restricted proinflammatory (IL-6) cytokine production in response to influenza. IFITM3 bound to and promoted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the reticulon 4 isoform Nogo-B. We reveal that Nogo-B mediates TLR-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promotes viral pathogenesis in vivo, and this process involved alteration of TLR dynamics. The anti-inflammatory function of IFITM3 was intrinsically linked to its ability to regulate Nogo-B. Thus, we uncover Nogo-B as an unappreciated driver of viral pathogenesis and highlight a novel immune regulatory pathway where IFITM3 fine-tunes TLR responsiveness of myeloid cells to viral stimulation.",

            "text": "Interferon (IFN) induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) plays a major role in antiviral cellular defence, directly limiting cellular entry of a number of pathogenic viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), HIV, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and SARS-CoV (Everitt et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; Weidner et al., 2010) . Some studies have demonstrated that IFITM3, along with other members of the IFITM family of proteins, may decrease cell membrane fluidity, possibly affecting viral fusion (Li et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013) . In one study, alteration in membrane fluidity was attributed to upregulation of cellular cholesterol (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) . However, subsequent studies have failed to demonstrate a mechanistic link between cholesterol levels and IFITM3 activity (Desai et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2013; Wrensch et al., 2014) . IFITM3 has also been shown to act downstream of viral attachment, endocytosis and subsequent viral hemifusion, directly restricting full viral fusion and trapping virus particles in endosomes (Suddala et al., 2019) . IFITM3 may also prevent virus entry by altering rates of virus-endosome fusion and/or accelerating the trafficking of endosomal cargo to lysosomes for destruction (Spence et al., 2019) . Furthermore, IFITM3 and other IFITM proteins can directly interact with viral proteins such as HIV-1 Env and inhibit their processing, restricting virus fusion with target host cell membranes (Yu et al., 2015) . Thus, IFITM3 can exert antiviral effects by influencing a broad range of cellular mechanisms.",

Interestingly, however, severe IAV disease in individuals with the CC genotype of the rs12252 SNP is associated with high CCL2 levels that drive pathogenic monocyte responses and hypercytokinemia characterized by elevated levels of cytokines including IL-6 (Everitt et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) . This hypercytokinemia is associated with fatal H7N9 infection in individuals with the rs12252 CC genotype (Wang et al., 2014) . Similarly, in mouse models of viral infection, Ifitm3 deficiency alters cytokine and chemokine profiles and leukocyte influx to sites of infection Gorman et al., 2016; Poddar et al., 2016) . Importantly, in the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) model of infection, Ifitm3 restricts infection-induced IL-6 mediated viral disease, lymphopenia and loss of NK and T cells without directly impacting CMV replication (Stacey et al., 2017) . In Sendai virus infection, IFITM3 inhibits IFN-\u03b2 induction by promoting degradation of IRF3 within IFITM3-associated autophagosomes (Jiang et al., 2018) . Moreover, mice lacking Ifitm1-3 produce elevated proinflammatory cytokines in response to chronic Poly I:C stimulation (Patoine et al., 2017) . Thus, the biology of how IFITM3 limits viral pathogenesis may be complex and requires a better understanding.",

We reveal that IFITM3 limits MyD88-dependent viral pathogenesis and that its anti-inflammatory properties are intrinsically linked with its ability to regulate the reticulon 4 isoform, Nogo-B. IFITM3 promoted Nogo-B turnover via ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We demonstrate in mice, and in human cellular models, that Nogo-B promotes TLR-and virus-induced inflammatory cytokine production and, in mice, pathogenesis. Finally, using human TLR2 as a model, we show that IFITM3-Nogo-B interactions alter TLR dynamics post-viral exposure, highlighting a potential mechanism for IFITM3-Nogo-B regulation of the inflammatory response during viral infection.",

In addition to cytoplasmic DNA sensing (DeFilippis et al., 2010; Lio et al., 2016) , endosomal TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 are important in the recognition of MCMV and subsequent activation of innate immune responses (Tabeta et al., 2004; Zucchini et al., 2008) . Thus, to understand whether endosomal TLRs mediated MCMV-induced IL-6 production in DCs, Tlr3 -/-, Tlr7 -/and Tlr9 -/-BM-DCs were infected with MCMV and IL-6 was measured (Fig. 1E) . Tlr7 -/and Tlr9 -/-BM-DCs were particularly defective in IL-6 production, suggesting a dominant role for these pattern recognition receptors in MCMV-induced proinflammatory cytokine production. In accordance, blocking Tlr7 (Fig. 1F) and Tlr9 (Fig. 1G) signalling significantly reduced IL-6 in both wt and Ifitm3 -/cells to similar levels following infection with MCMV, suggesting that Ifitm3-mediated regulation of these responses restricts MCMV-induced cytokine production.",

Two clones (IFITM3 -/-F01 and IFITM3 -/-H12) were selected for downstream assays, to control for risk of off-target mutations. Kolf2, IFITM3 -/-H12 and IFITM3 -/-F01 were differentiated into iPS-DCs using previously published methodology (Forbester et al., 2020) . DC morphology in culture was similar for all three lines ( Fig. S2A) , and IFITM3 deficiency did not affect the efficiency of DC differentiation, with similar numbers of DC precursors harvested from each line (Fig. S2B) , and similar surface expression of DC markers CD11c and CD141 (Fig. S2C) . Furthermore, as IFITM1 and IFITM2 have significant sequence homology with IFITM3, we determined that mRNA (Fig. S2D) and protein ( Fig. S2E ) levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2 were not significantly decreased in iPSCs in comparison to Kolf2 control cells in either IFITM3 -/clone used in this study. After differentiation into iPS-DCs and challenge with HCMV (merlin strain), IFITM3 protein was detected only in Kolf2 iPS-DCs and not in either IFITM3 -/line, using a previously validated IFITM3-specific antibody (Makvandi-Nejad et al., 2018; Wellington et al., 2021) (Fig. 2A) . In accordance with data generated in the mouse/MCMV system, IL-6 responses were elevated after HCMV stimulation of iPS-DCs that lacked IFITM3 (Fig. 2B) . iPS-DCs were nonpermissive to productive HCMV infection after low multiplicity of infection (MOI=5), irrespective of IFITM3 expression ( Fig. S3B & S3C) . Thus, IFITM3 suppresses IL-6 production in DCs to both HCMV and MCMV without impacting virus entry.",

This NFkB inhibition had no effect on IL-6 in WT cells, suggesting that in cells expressing IFITM3 IL-6 production is not NFkB-dependent. TLR2 is important for triggering the inflammatory cytokine response to HCMV (Compton et al., 2003) following binding to viral surface glycoproteins gB and gH (Boehme et al., 2006) . Neutralizing antibody to TLR2 significantly reduced the IL-6 response that was otherwise amplified in IFITM3 -/-iPS-DCs following exposure to either HCMV or a TLR2 ligand (Fig. 2E) .",

These data thus suggested that in human DCs TLR2-mediated recognition of HCMV is particularly important for driving the inflammatory response by these cells, and that this inflammatory process was limited by IFITM3. Finally, we generated primary blood monocyte-derived DCs from human donors genotyped for the IFITM3 SNP rs12252 and stimulated cells with HCMV, with these cells being non-permissive to HCMV infection similarly to iPS-DCs (Fig. S3D) . Donors with the CC allele that associate with reduced IFITM3 function (Zhang et al., 2013) also demonstrated increased IL-6 and TNF-a responses following viral stimulation (Fig. 2G) , suggesting that variation within the human IFITM3 locus could influence differential cytokine responses by myeloid cells in humans.",

Given that 1) our data implied a critical role for TLRs in this process and 2) Nogo-B has been implicated in impacting TLR locality within cells (Kimura et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017) , we examined the impact of IFITM3 deficiency on TLR localization. As TLR2-mediated cytokine responses were regulated by IFITM3 and TLR2 is expressed on the cell surface, we decided to use human cells and TLR2 as a model to investigate whether IFITM3 alters TLR dynamics in response to virus. We performed immunostaining in Kolf2 and IFITM3 -/-H12 iPS-DCs to visualize TLR2 and Nogo-B expression (Fig. 6A ). Our observations suggested colocalization (yellow) between TLR2 and Nogo-B after HCMV exposure ( Fig. 6A & Fig.   S6A ); and that TLR2 and Nogo-B cellular localization was influenced by IFITM3, with more TLR2/Nogo-B localization visible as cytoplasmic puncta in IFITM3 -/-iPS-DCs 24h post infection (Fig. 6A) . The distribution of most Nogo-B protein in these cells did not match a peripheral endoplasmic reticulum pattern. By flow cytometry, we observed significantly more cell surface TLR2 expression by HCMV-exposed Kolf2 iPS-DCs in comparison to mock treated cells (Fig. 6B) . In contrast, surface TLR2 expression on IFITM3 -/-DCs does not increase after HCMV exposure and was significantly reduced when compared directly to wt DCs (Fig. 6B) . Interestingly, following exposure to the TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4, surface TLR2 expression reduced rapidly and dramatically in IFITM3 -/-DCs 1h post-Pam3CSK4 exposure, whereas TLR2 surface levels in wildtype Kolf2 cells only reduced later at 4h before rising again by 6h post-exposure (Fig. 6C) . We next used our siRNA THP-1 system to assess TLR2 dynamics post-HCMV exposure in response to NogoB/IFITM3 knockdown (Fig.   6D&E ). Here, we observed decreased TLR2 surface expression with IFITM3 knockdown at early time-points (1h and 3h) post-virus exposure. In contrast, in cells after Nogo-B knockdown, we observed a less dramatic reduction in surface TLR2 1h and 3h post-HCMV exposure as compared to both non-transfected and IFIMT3 siRNA-treated cells, and markedly increased TLR2 surface expression 24h post-viral exposure. In cells where both Nogo-B and IFITM3 were knocked down, TLR2 surface expression was comparable to control-treated cells ( Fig. 6D&E) .",

            "text": "Our data imply that Nogo-B regulates TLR2 internalisation and that this process may be regulated by IFITM3. Internalisation of TLR2 and its ligand into endosomes may be important for determining inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN responses, with several studies suggesting that TLR2 generates different signals from different locations within the endosomal pathway, depending on the specific TLR2 ligand used (Barbalat et al., 2009; Brandt et al., 2013; Dietrich et al., 2010; Nilsen et al., 2008) . Upon ligand binding, TLR2 is rapidly internalized and trafficked to the Golgi Apparatus (Triantafilou et al., 2006) , with evidence in some cell types that signaling from the cell surface could be important for inflammatory cytokine induction whereas endosomal signaling is important for type I IFN induction (Oosenbrug et al., 2017) . However, in human monocytes NFkB activation requires, internalisation of TLR2 into endosomal compartments (Brandt et al., 2013) . Importantly, when iPS-DCs were treated with the endocytosis inhibitor ES9-17 (Dejonghe et al., 2019) , HCMVinduced IL-6 was reduced only in IFITM3 -/cells (Fig. 6F) . Furthermore, concurrent treatment of IFITM3 -/-iPS-DCs with ES9-17 and the NFkB inhibitor IKK-16 had minimal additive effect on HCMV-induced cytokine production, suggesting that in IFITM3-deficient cells enhanced IL-6 is driven by an endocytosis and TLR2-dependent mechanism that is mediated by NFkB signaling. In contrast, treatment with Bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), which inhibit the late stages of autophagy and the acidification of the late endosome, did not impact on IL-6 production in either healthy control Kolf2 or IFITM3 -/-H12 iPS-DCs after HCMV exposure (Fig. 6G) . Thus, these data imply that IFITM3 regulates virus-induced inflammatory cytokine production by influencing Nogo-B orchestrated movement of TLR that, in the case of TLR2, is an endocytosis-dependent event.",

Furthermore, Nogo-B promotes surface expression of TLR4 (Zhu et al., 2017) and TLR-induced cytokine production in macrophages (Zhu et al., 2017) . In our study, we observed co-localization of TLR2 and Nogo-B, and knockdown of Nogo-B led to alterations in TLR2 movement within the cell after viral stimulation. Thus, it is possible that Nogo-B influenced virus-induced cytokine production by directly altering TLR movement. However, TLR2 is internalized following activation (Triantafilou et al., 2004) and altered TLR2 dynamics in our experiments may reflect alterations in initial activation rather than trafficking per se.",

Thus, the regulation of TLR function is consistent with other non-ER Rtn roles. Our immunoprecipitation studies revealed the presence of both Rtn3 and Rtn4 in IFITM3 complexes. While functional studies of Rtn4 deletion yielded prominent effects on CMV induced cytokine production, the role of Rtn3 may be partially redundant and combined Rtn3/4 deletion may yield even greater effect. While the current study focuses on viral infection and dendritic cells, the prominent expression of Rtn's in the brain suggests that the mechanisms defined here may contribute in the regulation of TLR function for a range of neuro-inflammatory diseases.",

However, it is clear from our studies that in IFITM3-deficient cells where we observed increased Nogo-B expression, we also observed heightened inflammatory cytokine production and internalisation of TLR2. It was initially thought that TLRs were partitioned into surface or endosomal TLRs, with all signalling occurring in either location. However more recent studies have demonstrated activation of different inflammatory mediators, dependent on differential TLR locality within the cell (Kagan et al., 2008; Sasai et al., 2010) . Interestingly, internalisation of cell-surface TLR2 into endosomal compartments in human monocytes is required for NFkB activation (Brandt et al., 2013) , and TLR2-induced IL-6 expression can be restricted by endocytosis inhibition (Petnicki-Ocwieja et al., 2015) . Our observation that inhibition of endocytosis or NFkB induces a similar reduction of IL-6 production only in IFITM3-deficient cells implies that a similar process may be suppressed in IFITM3-expressing DCs to reduce virus-induced inflammation.",

Our study reveals Nogo-B as a novel interacting binding partner of IFITM3 and highlights the previously unappreciated role for both IFITM3 and Nogo-B in influencing virus-induced inflammatory events. Targeting this interaction and dissecting the downstream impacts of this on innate immune recognition may help to expand strategies for controlling pathologic viral induced-inflammation. ",

For other proteins, 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per condition/cell line were homogenized using RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo-Fisher). Protein extracts were prepared for gel electrophoresis by addition of 1:1 Novex TM Tris-Glycine SDS Sample Buffer (Thermo-Fisher) and heating at 85\u00b0C for 5min, followed by addition of sample to 12% or 8-16% (dependent on predicted band size) Novex wedgewell Tris Glycine mini gels (Thermo-Fisher) for electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted onto PDVF membrane using the mini-gel wet-transfer XCell II Blot Module (Thermo-Fisher) in transfer buffer (20% methanol, . Membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in TBS-T (Sigma-Aldrich), then transferred to primary antibody for anti-Nogo-B (0.2\u03bcg/ml; Bio-Techne), anti-GAPDH (1\u03bcg/ml; Merck Millipore), anti-IFITM1 (3\u03bcg/ml; Proteintech), anti-IFITM2 (3\u03bcg/ml; Proteintech) or anti-Nogo-A (1\u03bcg/ml; Abcam) in 5% milk/TBS-T and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies were probed with IRDye 680LT goat anti-mouse , IRDye 800LT goat anti-rabbit (Li-Cor, 925-32210) or Alexa Fluor 680 donkey anti-sheep IgG (H+L; Invitrogen), and visualized using the Li-Cor Odyssey Imaging System. Protein band intensity was determined using ImageJ, with values calculated relative to GAPDH with background removed for the same sample lane. In murine cells, 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells per condition/cell line were homogenized using 1 \u00d7 NuPAGE TM LDS sample buffer (Thermo-Fisher) supplemented with 100mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma-Aldrich) and boiled at 100\u00b0C for 10min. Samples were run using a NuPAGE TM 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gels (Thermo-Fisher) for electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted onto PDVF membrane using the mini-gel wet-transfer XCell II Blot Module (Thermo-Fisher) in transfer buffer (1 \u00d7 NuPAGE TM Transfer Buffer (Thermo-Fisher)). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS-T (Sigma-Aldrich), then transferred to primary antibody for anti-Nogo-B (0.2\u03bcg/ml; Bio-Techne), anti-fragilis (IFITM3, 1\u03bcg/ml; Abcam) anti-Ubiquitin (1\u03bcg/ml; Abcam), and anti-ACTIN (1\u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5% milk/PBS-T and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies were probed with either rabbit-anti-sheep IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugate, goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugate (both Biorad) or Veriblot IP detection reagent (Abcam) and visualised using a Syngene G:Box imaging system. Protein band intensity was determined using ImageJ, with values calculated relative to ACTIN with background removed for the same sample lane.",
