Here we took a systematic and iterative approach by testing several SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens and adjuvants to identify a combination that elicits neutralizing antibodies and protection in young and aged mice. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 receptorbinding domain (RBD) displayed as a protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP) was a highly effective antigen, and when formulated with an oil-in-water emulsion containing Carbohydrate fatty acid MonoSulphate derivative (CMS) induced the highest levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies compared to other oil-in-water emulsions or AS01B. Mechanistically, CMS induced antigen retention in the draining lymph node (dLN) and expression of cytokines, chemokines and type I interferon-stimulated genes at both injection site and dLN. Overall, CMS:RBD-NP is effective across multiple age groups and is an exemplar of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine tailored to the elderly.",

This pandemic has generated a global health crisis that will likely be ended only by widespread deployment of effective vaccines across all ages. Historically, the process of vaccine development spans several years. Basic research into prototype betacoronavirus pathogens coupled with advancements in structure-based antigen design, protein engineering and new manufacturing platforms such as mRNA and adenoviral virus vectors have enabled development of effective vaccines at an unprecedented speed Graham, 2020) . Nevertheless, controlling the spread of the virus worldwide and especially in low-and middle-income countries will likely require global deployment of safe, effective, affordable, scalable, and practical vaccines that can also protect highly vulnerable populations including elderly individuals against COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality (Katz et al., 2021; Koff et al., 2021; Lancet Commission on and Therapeutics Task Force, 2021; Mejia et al., 2020) .",

The RBD protein would be an ideal candidate for a subunit vaccine since it is targeted by neutralizing antibodies (Abs) that exert a protective role against SARS-CoV-2 infection and it is readily produced at scale Dalvie et al., 2021a; Dalvie et al., 2021b; Piccoli et al., 2020; Premkumar et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . However, RBD is poorly immunogenic and therefore its use as a candidate antigen poses limitations for vaccine development. To overcome this issue, two non-mutually exclusive approaches can be employed: 1) addition of adjuvant formulations, which are vaccine components that can enhance antigen immunogenicity by activating the innate immune system and/or modulating antigen pharmacokinetics Nanishi et al., 2020; O'Hagan et al., 2020; Pulendran et al., 2021) and 2) structure-based antigen design (Brune and Howarth, 2018; Graham et al., 2019; Irvine and Read, 2020; Kwong et al., 2020; Lopez-Sagaseta et al., 2016; Singh, 2021; Ward and Wilson, 2020) .",

The RBD nanoparticle (RBD-NP) demonstrated higher immunogenicity compared to pre-fusion stabilized Spike trimer (Wrapp et al., 2020) (hereafter Spike) or monomeric RBD. By comparing multiple adjuvant formulations in combination with RBD-NP we found that a squalene-based oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion containing synthetic Carbohydrate fatty acid MonoSulphate derivative (CMS) (Hilgers et al., 2017) further enhanced anti-RBD serum Ab titers and SARS-CoV-2 cross-neutralizing titers in both young and aged mice. Mechanistically, CMS induced antigen retention in the dLN and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines at the injection sites and type I interferon (IFN)-dependent IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) in the dLN. Overall, our study demonstrates the utility of a systematic and iterative approach to develop and optimize an adjuvanted RBD-NP effective across multiple age groups and provides further insights into the development of affordable SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines tailored to be active in the most vulnerable -i.e., the elderly.",

            "text": "High density display of antigens onto protein NPs increases their immunogenicity and has been employed in several vaccine candidates against viral infections to elicit robust serum antigen-specific Ab titers (Singh, 2021) . In order to assemble SARS-CoV-2 RBD onto a protein NP scaffold we took advantage of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation system in which proteins fused with SpyTag and SpyCatcher spontaneously form stable isopeptide bonds (Brune et al., 2016) . Briefly, we used the self-assembling lumazine synthase (LuS) from the hyperthermophile \"Aquifex aeolicus\" as protein NP scaffold (Zhang et al., 2001) , and respectively expressed RBD and LuS with SpyCatcher (RBD-Catch) and SpyTag (LuS-Tag). SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions of RBD-Catch, LuS-Tag, RBD-NP (generated by conjugating RBD-Catch and LuS-Tag) as well as native RBD and Spike proteins confirmed expected molecular weights (Fig. 1A) . Transmission electron microscopy analysis of RBD-NP revealed a ruffled border, suggesting efficient conjugation and display of RBD onto the protein scaffold, and homogeneous size (Fig. 1B) . This impression was further confirmed by dynamic light scattering analysis, showing an average size of ~30 nm ( Fig. 1C) . To confirm proper display of RBD onto NPs, we coated ELISA plates with RBD, Spike, RBD-NP, LuS-Tag, and assessed binding to recombinant human ACE2 (hACE2) and two anti-RBD monoclonal Abs (mAbs: clones H4 and CR3022). RBD-NP binding to hACE2, clones H4 and CR3022 was comparable to RBD and Spike while no binding to LuS-Tag was observed (Fig. 1D, E) . RBD-NP binding profiles remained unaltered under multiple storage conditions, namely five freeze/thaw cycles or storage for 1 week at 4\u00b0C or room temperature ( Supplementary Fig. 1) . Interestingly, by assessing binding to mAb clones H4 and CR3022 under lower coating concentrations of RBD, Spike and RBD-NP we observed preferential binding to RBD-NP (Fig. 1F) , suggesting that high density display of RBD onto NP increases Ab avidity. To explore another functional correlate of RBD-NP structure, we performed a competition assay in which Vero cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 in the absence or presence of multiple concentrations of RBD, Spike or RBD-NP. RBD-NP significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection as assessed by IC50 and AUC (Supplementary Fig. 2) , further supporting high-density display of RBD onto NP.",

As expected, formulation with AddaVax enhanced anti-RBD Ab titers compared to immunizations with non-formulated antigens. In all experimental conditions, RBD-NP induced highest titers of anti-RBD IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a especially at the lowest tested dose (0.3 \u03bcg), thus showing a robust dose-sparing effect. Of note, anti-RBD Abs elicited by immunization with RBD-NP also recognized native RBD on Spike (Supplementary Fig. 3) , which is key for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. To confirm this point, we performed a surrogate of virus neutralization test (sVNT) that measure the degree of inhibition of RBD binding to hACE2 by immune sera, as well as a neutralization assay with live SARS-CoV-2 virus. In both assays, immunization with RBD-NP formulated with AddaVax induced higher levels of neutralization compared to immunization with Spike ( Fig. 3A, B) , while immunization with monomeric RBD failed to elicit significant levels of neutralization in the sVNT (Fig. 3A) . Of note, immunization with RBD-NP formulated with AddaVax elicited high levels of anti-RBD neutralizing Abs in one additional inbred (C57BL/6) and one outbred (CD-1) mouse strains (Supplementary Fig. 4) .",

Although it is possible to generalize desirable properties for an adjuvant, a proper match between an adjuvant and a specific antigen has to be empirically evaluated. For example, comparisons of O/W-and aluminum hydroxide-based adjuvant formulations with RBD-NP demonstrated that the alpha-tocopherol-containing squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion AS03 is particularly effective at enhancing RBD-NP immunogenicity in non-human primates (Arunachalam et al., 2021) . We therefore evaluated the immunogenicity of our RBD-NP with several O/W emulsions, namely AddaVax, the AS03-like adjuvant AddaS03, and a novel squalene-based O/W emulsion containing Carbohydrate fatty acid MonoSulphate derivative (CMS) (Hilgers et al., 2017) . As a key benchmark, we also included AS01B (a liposome-based adjuvant containing monophosphoryl lipid A and saponin QS-21) as a clinical-grade benchmark adjuvant with potent immunostimulatory activity (Cunningham et al., 2016; Lal et al., 2015) .",

Cytokine and chemokine production at the injection site can promote innate immune cell recruitment, activation and subsequent antigen presentation (Mosca et al., 2008) . However, only CMS enhanced type I IFN-dependent ISG expression in the dLN which can promote differentiation of CD4 + T follicular helper cells and therefore antigen-specific antibody response (De Giovanni et al., 2020) .

While our results show significant neutralization of B.1.17 and B.1.351 pseudoviruses by serum samples of mice immunized with RBD-NP and CMS, it is likely that novel vaccines specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern may need to be rapidly developed . In addition, the risk posed by emerging zoonotic coronaviruses calls for the development of pan-coronavirus vaccines that can protect against circulating variants as well as strains currently circulating only in non-human animals but that can generate future human outbreaks and pandemics. The SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation platform employed in our study has recently been used to generate mosaic NP displaying RBD proteins derived from 1 4 up to 8 strains . Whether different adjuvant formulations (e.g. AddaVax, CMS) can modulate the breadth of the Ab response elicited by mosaic RBD-NP is an important area for future research.",

Our work may inform further pre-clinical and clinical development of precision adjuvanted RBD-NP-based SARS-CoV-2 and pan-coronavirus vaccines tailored for robust immunogencity and protection in the vulnerable elderly. Both contructs contain a signal peptide (MKHLWFFLLLVAAPRWVLS) at N-terminus and HRV3C protease site, followed by a TwinStrepTag at C-terminus. These mammalian expression vectors were used to transfect Expi293F suspension cells (Thermo Fisher) using polyethylenimine (Polysciences). Cells were allowed to grow in 37\u00b0C, 8% CO 2 for additional 5 days before harvesting for purification. Protein was purified in a PBS buffer (pH 7.4) from filtered supernatants by using either StrepTactin resin (IBA) or Cobalt-TALON resin (Takara). Affinity tags were cleaved off from eluted protein samples by HRV 3C protease, and tag removed proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 10/300 column (Cytiva) for full length Spike and a Superdex 200 10/300",

The gel was rinsed with DI water and incubated with QC Colloidal Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad) on a rotating shaker for 1 hour at RT. The gel was rinsed twice with DI water and incubated on a rotating shaker for 75 min, changing the water every 15 min, and then imaged.Negative staining electron microscopy. Purified RBD-nanoparticle samples were diluted to 0.01-0.05 mg/mL with a PBS (pH 7.4) buffer. A 4-\u00b5l drop of the diluted sample was applied to a freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid (400-mesh, EMS) for approximately one minute. The drop was removed using blotting paper, and the grid was washed three times with 5-\u00b5l drops of the same buffer. Adsorbed proteins were negatively stained by soaking in 4-\u00b5l drops of 2% uranyl acetate for approximately 10 s and removing drop with filter paper. Micrographs were collected using JEM-1400 Plus electron microscope (JEOL, USA) operated at 80 kV, resulting in ~0.15nm/pixel at 80,000x magnification.Dynamic light scattering. Purified protein samples (250 \u03bc g/ml) were loaded into disposable microcuvette and measured at 25 \u00b0C using a Zetasizer Ultra instrument (Malvern Panalytical) equipped with a 633-nm laser with 3 scans of 60 sec each. Each sample was measured in triplicate, and the intensity of the size distribution was plotted in GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software).Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). ELISA was employed to examine the binding ability of the purified proteins to hACE2 and RBD-specific monoclonal Abs (mAbs).Briefly, RBD monomer, Spike trimer, RBD-Catch, LuS-Tag, and RBD-NPs were respectively diluted to concentrations of 0were added to coat 96-well high-binding flat-bottom plate (Corning) overnight at 4 \u00b0C.

After 2 h of incubation, the plates were washed with PBS-T three times, and incubated with HRPconjugated detection Abs (mouse anti-human IgG1 Fc-HRP, Southern Biotec). Plates were washed five times and developed with tetramethylbenzidine (OptEIA Substrate Solution, BD Biosciences) for 5 min, then stopped with 2 N H 2 SO 4 . Optical densities (ODs) were read at 450 nm with SpectraMax iD3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices).RBD-NP stability analysis. RBD-NP samples (1 mg/ml) were subjected to one to five cycles of freeze-thaw cycles by storing in a -80 \u00b0C freezer for at least 1 day, followed by incubation at RT for 30 min. For the storage temperature study, RBD-NP samples (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 4 \u00b0C or RT for 5-7 days. The RBD-NP samples were then analyzed by ELISA.Live SARS-CoV-2 in vitrocompetition assay. The day prior to infection, 5e3 VeroE6 cells were plated per well in DMEM (Quality Biological) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1% v/v Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gemini-Bio), and 1% v/v L-Glutamine (Gibco). 1 mg/ml stock concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 Spike, SARS-CoVeach dilution was then transferred to the cells and left to incubate at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 for 2 hours. After incubation, each well was infected with a 0.1 M.O.I. of SARS-uninfected to monitor cytotoxicity. After 48 hours, the infected plates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour, Hoechst-stained, and read on a plate reader (Nexcelom Biosciences, Lawrence, MA). The percentage of GFP+ cells in each well was counted and compared to an untreated, infected control to give an inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50 ) for each protein. The parallel cytotoxicity plate was analyzed with Cell Titer Glo (Promega, Madison, WI) and read on a BioTek Synergy HTX plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Cell viability was compared to an untreated control. Animals. Female, 3 month old BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Female, 12-13 months old BALB/c mice purchased from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY) were used for aged mice experiments. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at Boston Children's Hospital, and all procedures were approved under the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and operated under the supervision of the Department of Animal Resources at Children's Hospital (ARCH) (Protocol number 19-02-3897R). At the University of Maryland School of Medicine, mice were housed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility for all SARS-CoV-2 infections with all procedures approved under the IACUC (Protocol number #1120004). Mouse immunization. All formulations for immunization were prepared under sterile conditions. Mice were injected with antigens (RBD monomer, Spike trimer, and RBD-NPs), with or without adjuvants. Mock treatment mice received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone. Injections (50 \u00b5l) were administered intramuscularly in the caudal thigh on Days 0 and 14. The adjuvants and their doses used were: AddaVax (25 \u00b5l), AddaS03 (25 \u00b5l) (InvivoGen), AS01B (40 \u00b5l) (obtained from the Shingrix vaccine, GSK Biologicals SA, Belgium), and CMS adjuvant (25 \u00b5l corresponding with 1 mg of CMS) (LiteVax, The Netherlands)..",

N = 10 mice per group. ** indicates p \u2264 0.01. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons after Log-transformation of the raw data. Comparisons among experimental groups are indicated by the color code. Supplementary Figure 4. RBD nanoparticle is immunogenic in multiple mouse strains. 3-month-old C57BL/6 (A) and CD-1 (B) mice were injected with PBS or immunized with 0.3 \u03bcg RBD nanoparticle (RBD-NP), alone or formulated with AddaVax on Day 0 (prime) and Day 14 (boost). Anti-RBD IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibody titers were assessed in serum samples collected on Day 28. Dotted lines indicate lower limit of detection. N = 5 mcie per group. * and ** respectively indicate p \u2264 0.05 and 0.01. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons after Log-transformation of the raw data. Comparisons among experimental groups are indicated by the color code. Supplementary Figure 5. Aged mice demonstrate reduced anti-RBD antibody response upon immunization. Comparisons of anti-RBD IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibody titers between immunized young and aged mice as reported in Figure 4. N = 10 mice per group * and ** respectively indicate p \u2264 0.05 and 0.01. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons after Log-transformation of the raw data. Comparisons among experimental groups are indicated by the color code. AddaVax and CMS adjuvant promote antigen retention in the draining lymph node. 3-month-old BALB/c mice were injected intramuscularly with PBS, R-PE, R-PE formulated with AddaVax or CMS adjuvant. 24 hours later draining lymph node were collected, homogenized in water and fluorescence was measured in cleared supernatants. Results are expressed as arbitrary units (A.U.) of fluorescence. N = 12 mice per group. ** indicates p \u2264 0.01. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons after Log-transformation of the raw data. Comparisons among experimental groups are indicated by the color code.",
