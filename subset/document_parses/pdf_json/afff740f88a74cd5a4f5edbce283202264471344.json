Because both the U.K.-and U.S.-traded ETFs track the same underlying index, we effectively control for any common changes to liquidity in these ETFs due to changes in the fundamental value of the S&P 500.

We argue that high-frequency market makers (HFMMs), who are heavily reliant on leverage for liquidity provision, are more sensitive to margin requirements than traditional investors, and thus, more likely to withdraw from the market following large increases in margin requirements. Further, HFMMs are more likely to be present in index stocks, relative to non-index stocks, which have lower HFMM participation (Brogaard et al., 2014; Shkilko and Sokolov, 2020). Because of these factors, as margin requirements increase, we expect a larger decline in the liquidity of index stocks in which HFMM are more active, relative to non-index stocks. Last, using the order to trade ratio to proxy for HFMM activity in global equities, we test whether HFMMs withdraw their activity more from index stocks than non-index stocks, following an increase in margin requirements.",

First, for our analysis 3 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof on the ETFs tracking the S&P 500 Index, we show that market liquidity deteriorates more for the U.K.-traded ETF, which experienced a larger increase in margin, relative to the U.S.-traded ETF, for which margins remained relatively static. Further, we find the reverse effect when the margin differential narrows. Specifically, while U.K. margins increased precipitously when U.S. margins remained relatively stable, the U.S. subsequently experienced a large jump in margin requirements, thereby narrowing the margin differential. Corresponding to this subsequent jump in U.S. margins, we show that the market liquidity of the U.S.-traded ETF deteriorates relative to that of the U.K.-traded ETF.",

To control for a falling stock price, we identify a period in 2015 when stock prices declined significantly without a corresponding change to exchange margin requirements.

This margininduced shock to funding liquidity impacted the available market liquidity exactly at the time equity market price levels were falling, due to the unprecedented global risk COVID-19 posed to company cash flows. Our findings suggest that traders must de-leverage their positions precisely at the point in time when prices are declining, thereby potentially further depressing prices and increasing margin, consistent with the theoretical findings of Morris and Shin (2004) .

Procyclical increases in margins in response to volatility limit the ability of participants to provide liquidity, particularly when such constraints become binding. Similar models are proposed with funding constrained arbitrageurs as liquidity providers (Gromb and Vayanos, 2002) or with short-term traders unable to take on inventory due to funding constraints (Morris and Shin, 2004) . In a model proposed by G\u00e2rleanu and Pedersen (2011) , the impact of binding margin requirements becomes \"priced,\" resulting in discounts on high-margin assets. This procyclicality has been studied extensively in previous banking studies in response to the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), both theoretically (Repullo and Suarez, 2013; Hugonnier and Morellec, 2017) and empirically (Behn et al., 2016; Berger et al., 2016) . Empirically, studies of the margin requirements for equity market makers 6 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof have been hindered by the availability of such data. In some markets, the link between liquidity provision and margin constraints have been explicitly documented. For example, in bond markets, Adrian et al. (2017) document larger reductions in liquidity after the GFC in bonds traded by firms with more leverage, indicating the binding nature of their margin requirements. Aramonte and Szersze\u0144 (2020) use a supervisory dataset to examine U.S. corporate bonds and credit default swaps and show that dealer profitability plays a significant role in secondary market liquidity. Daskalaki and Skiadopoulos (2016) examine the commodity futures markets and show that an increase in margins following the Dodd-Frank Act increases transactions costs and reduces depth. Finally, Dudley and Nimalendran (2011) show that increases in the funding margins for futures markets increase the illiquidity and contagion risk of mutual hedge funds.",

In a global study, Karolyi et al.

For example, a $100 buy order may require an IM of 5% (or $5). Appreciation in the bought asset, say to $110, results in the value of the margin account increasing by $10.

Second, a jump in the margin requirements for equity index futures is likely to affect leveraged sophisticated investors and cross-market arbitrageurs, who typically hedge their underlying equity positions via equity derivative products, such as index futures. Thus, these sophisticated investors could also withdraw from equity markets if they are unable to effectively manage their risk via the futures markets.",

Accordingly, their positions are unlikely to precipitate a margin call, as large adverse price moves are unlikely to occur during their short holding periods. For this reason, HFMMs require less \"buffer\" in their margin accounts and can effectively trade on higher leverage ratios closer to the binding margin limits than other market participants.

All other markets show a similar response, with significant increases from pre-pandemic levels. This sharp increase in quoted spreads supports the notion that liquidity providers became more cautious in their liquidity provision once it became clear that COVID-19 would become a global issue.

While these ETFs track the same underlying asset, the ETFs trade on different markets, which experience different changes in their margin requirements during March 2020. We exploit this unique setting to test the relation between margin requirements and market liquidity. In Subsection 6.2, we extend the analysis to the world's major equity markets. We argue that changes to margin requirements affect stocks that are index constituents more than stocks that are outside the index due to a higher concentration of margin sensitive high-frequency market makers (HFMM) in index constituents. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find a larger fall in liquidity for stocks that are index constituents than non-index constituents, following a margin increase. Last, in Subsection 6.3, using the order to trade ratio as a proxy for HFMM activity, we test whether HFMMs withdraw more from index stocks, relative to non-index stocks, when margin requirements increase.",

Accordingly, these two ETFs trade on different exchanges and are subject to their respective exchange margins, but track the same underlying asset. Thus, while not fungible, the ETFs are synthetically identical and primarily differ only by the margin required to trade them. Because the ETFs are synthetically identical, any shock to the fundamental value of the S&P 500 should equally affect both ETFs. For this reason, we can control for any common changes to liquidity in 14 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f these ETFs due to falling prices or increased volatility of the S&P 500 using a differencein-differences framework.",

Given we use a difference-in-differences framework, we need only the average margin in the post-period to be different to the average margin in the pre-period and do not need the exact daily movements of margin.

We choose the contract whose underlying best reflects the market's equity index. For the U.S., we consider the margin requirement on S&P 500 Index futurestraded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. For the U.K., we consider the margin requirements for the FTSE 100 Index futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Similarly, for Hong Kong and Canada, we choose the Hang Seng Index futures and TSX 60 Index Futures traded on the Hong Kong Futures Exchange (HKX) and the Montreal Exchange, respectively. Table B.1 illustrates the monthly evolution of selected margins and provides the links to the data sources. 47 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f To conduct these tests, we use Hong Kong Exchange margin data, which contains margins for both index futures and individual stock futures. Our aim is to create the margin for a \"synthetic\" Hang Seng Index using the margins for the individual stock futures of the index constituents. 24 To create the synthetic Hang Seng Index margin, we weight the percentage margin of each index constituent by market capitalization. On the days the margin changes, we observe a correlation of 0.956 between the synthetic index percentage margin and the percentage margin requirements for the Hang Seng Index futures, as reported by the Hong Kong Exchange. This finding provides confidence that changes in margin on index futures is a reasonable proxy for changes in the margin on individual stocks. Next, we show that the correlation of 0.956 is driven by a systematic margin change for all stock futures in the index, rather than by a change in margin for a small number of stock futures. Specifically, on the days margin changes for the future consist of at least one index constituent, we calculate the correlation between the margins of all stock futures for the constituents of the Hang Seng Index. During our sample period, we find that the margin of all stocks move in unison with a mean correlation of 0.93. Figure C.2 provides a histogram of all correlations between the index constituents. The figure shows high correlations between all constituents, with only 0.6% of the sample reporting a correlation below 0.8. 24 The Hang Seng Index is the most widely quoted index for the Hong Kong equities market and contains approximately 60 constituents.
