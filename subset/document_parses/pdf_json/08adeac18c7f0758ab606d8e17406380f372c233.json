This survey of first-time synchronous teledermatology patients (n = 100) seen by providers of the University of Mississippi Medical Center during Spring 2020 was designed to learn more about patient experiences associated with the technical challenges of synchronous teledermatology. Our patient population had considerable experience with various social media including Facebook (82%) and hardware platforms, such as Apple devices (66%). We found that the majority of patients were satisfied (88.9%) with their synchronous teledermatology encounter and 81.8% of patients did not experience a technical difficulty with their consult. About 15% of patients lost connection with their provider during their consultation. Furthermore, about 30% of patients rated \"showing their skin\" to their provider as \"hardest\" on a ten scale. However, about 34% of patients sent \"store-and-forward\"-type images to supplement their encounter. Despite overwhelming satisfaction with synchronous teledermatology, a majority prefer an in-person consultation for their next visit (68.7%). Synchronous teledermatology offers a critical service to patients to expand access to specialty consultation. It is well-received by patients despite technical barriers, especially during a global health crisis.",

Telehealth services have become critical to maintaining patient access to health care services. As the supply of telehealth providers increased, the focus of these services expanded to include cost-savings, convenience, and chronic illness management. Adoption of various platforms including smartphone and tablet applications increased accessibility and simplified connection between patients and providers [2] . In dermatology, telehealth services are provided via store-and-forward technology, synchronous telehealth, or a mix of both modalities [3] . Store-and-forward technology uses a still camera to photograph rashes or lesions. The photograph is then transmitted to the provider who evaluates the image and makes subsequent recommendations to the patient. This technique is typically asynchronous, meaning the patient receives recommendations at a later time after the consultant has evaluated the image. Synchronous telehealth, also known as live interactive, involves live audiovisual connection between patients and providers to simulate a virtual in-office experience. Recommendations are provided live during the video consult. The choice of which teledermatology modality to employ is dependent on the availability of technology and skill of both provider and patient. Teledermatology services have generally been well-received among both patients and clinicians [3] . Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients are generally satisfied with store-and-forward teledermatology services, but evaluation of live synchronous services is much more limited [4, 5] .",

Teledermatology use has increased over the past decade prompting investigation into quality assessment and patient satisfaction. Recent results question the equivalency of inperson dermatologic assessment versus teledermatology, finding that biopsy was recommended significantly more often in synchronous teledermatology encounters than in-person [6] . Despite questions of equivalency between in-person consultation and teledermatology, surveys have demonstrated high levels of patient and provider satisfaction with teledermatology services. A recent systemic review found that 89% of surveys reviewed suggested patient satisfaction with synchronous teledermatology [7] .",

A previous study of both store-and-forward and synchronous teledermatology reported that 65% of clinicians experienced challenges resolving technology-related issues. These clinicians cited inefficient software programs, lack of integration with electronic medical records, and poor image quality as areas of concern [10].",

Next, the patients were asked questions involving the manner of their engagement with technology including the types of devices they own (e.g. Windows computer, Apple iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc.) and their use of social media platforms. Participants were then asked if their recent teledermatology encounter had been their first experience with teledermatology. Any respondents who had used teledermatology previously were excluded. Next, patients answered questions regarding their recent experience with technology used in their teledermatology encounter including whether they experienced loss of connection or any other technical problems along with rating the quality of the audio and visual connection. Patients were asked whether they provided supplemental digital photographs, which were either requested by the provider or sent by the patient independently. Finally, patients answered questions about the quality of their encounter and to rate their experience with teledermatology. Descriptive statistics were computed to describe and summarize data. Chi-square test was conducted to determine if satisfaction was different among different age groups. All data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 27.

In 2016, a Department of Veterans Affairs program provided veterans with tablets for synchronous primary care telehealth appointments and studied patient satisfaction with their appointments. The majority of participants identified as living in a rural area. The authors found that nearly half of the participants indicated experiencing a technical difficulty during their video call [11] . Many of the technical difficulties associated with synchronous primary care telehealth translate to synchronous teledermatology. The proportion of patients in study population encountering technical difficulties was far lower than the VA study. This disparity likely represents a difference in the populations studied but demonstrates further proof of concept that, even in 2020, technology used for synchronous telehealth has room for improvement. The addition of store-and-forward option for our patients and providers likely improved rates of satisfaction with our service. The proportion of our patients that sent accompanying store-and-forward-type photographs (about 1/3) calls into question whether these encounters would have been satisfactory or successful without these supplements. Digital photographs were sent if either patient or provider believed they were necessary to make an adequate diagnosis. The addition of still photography likely decreased the threshold for minimally acceptable video resolution for both patients and providers. In our current technologic epoch, the resolution of digital photography remains superior to video, and this maxim is demonstrable in teledermatology [12] . These results suggest that a hybrid approach to teledermatology may be beneficial until video resolution can rival that of digital photography on a consumer level. Other authors have noted that hybrid teledermatology blends the advantages of storeand-forward and synchronous teledermatology and should be considered for second opinions and difficult case [13] .",

Some degree of selection bias is likely present given that only patients with sufficient technological capabilities engaged in teledermatology encounters and subsequently responded to the online study form. Similarly, surveys conducted through online platforms, such as e-mail, routinely demonstrate low patient participation rates, and this study is no exception.",
