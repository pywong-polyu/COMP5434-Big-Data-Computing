Among the total population of patients with diabetes, 93 (79.5%) patients had poor-controlled diabetes and 24 (20.5%) patients had wellcontrolled diabetes. Approximately 79% of the included patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The clinical and laboratory findings of patients are demonstrated in Table 1 . As shown, patients with well-controlled DM were significantly older than those with poorlycontrolled DM (p<0.001). Also, the distribution of male and female patients differed significantly between the two groups (p=0.04). While the majority of patients in the well-controlled DM group were females, male patients constituted a higher percentage among patients with poorly-controlled DM. The median HbA1c value among all patients with diabetes was 8.6% (IQR, 7.5-11). When comparing comorbidities between the two groups, no significant difference was observed. Among all patients with coexistent diabetes and COVID-19, 62 (53%) patients had hypertension. Duration of diabetes was not statistically different between patients with well-controlled and poorlycontrolled DM (p=0.77). Approximately half of the patients recovered from COVID-19, but 22.2% of the patients died during hospitalization. In addition, about 18% experienced ARDS during the course of disease. Clinical outcomes, however, were not significantly different between patients with well-controlled and poorly-controlled DM (p>0.05). Considering the medications used by patients for their underlying diabetes, the use of ACEI/ARBs or insulin did not differ between the two groups (p=0.25 and p=0.18, respectively). Among laboratory parameters, 56 (61.5%) patients of the total population had lymphocytopenia on admission.

They found that 53.6% of patients with diabetes were male, which is similar to the results of our study (56.4%). Also, they reported a prevalence of 13% for diabetes among the total population of patients with COVID-19, whereas our study found a slightly lower prevalence of 8.6%. In Iran, diabetes has an estimated prevalence of 11.4% among 25-70-year-olds (30) . In another study in Italy, the prevalence of diabetes among patients with COVID-19 was 8.9% (31) . A recent metaanalysis also reported a pooled prevalence of 9% for diabetes among patients with COVID-19 (32) . In the study by Zhu et al, patients with diabetes had a relatively lower median age compared with our study (62 versus 66 years, respectively). This could be due to the exclusion of patients older than 75 years in the mentioned study. In line with our study, a higher percentage of patients with well-controlled DM were female, while in patients with poorly-controlled DM male patients constituted a higher percentage. Besides, in parallel with our study, they showed that findings on chest CT imaging were similar between the two groups. However, chest CT imaging evaluations were only limited to bilateral/unilateral lesions in that study. About 18% of the patients with diabetes developed ARDS in our study; similarly, Zhu et al. reported that ARDS occurred in 17% of patients with diabetes. A major difference between these two studies, however, remains in the definition of well-controlled and poorly-controlled DM. Zhu and colleagues divided patients with diabetes into two groups based on the glycemic variability range; while, in our study, patients with diabetes were classified by long-term glycemic control (HbA1c values). This varying definition might explain the differences in the outcomes found between the study by Zhu et al. and this study.",

Acute viral respiratory tract infections are associated with diminished insulin sensitivity (34, 35) .

Our results demonstrated that patients with diabetes who were receiving ACEI/ARBs had markedly higher rates of death and lower rates of recovery compared with those who did not take these medications. Although these finding are intriguing, caution should be used in the interpretation of these results and more comprehensive studies on larger populations are needed.",
