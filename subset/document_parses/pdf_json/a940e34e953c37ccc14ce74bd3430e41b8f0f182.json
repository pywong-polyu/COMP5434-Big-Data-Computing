In this study, we investigated the factors that influence the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs for heart rate measurement, physical activity (PA), and sleep monitoring using a systematic literature review. Forty-seven papers were analyzed from five electronic databases based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. All 47 papers that we analyzed were published by authors from developed countries. Using thematic analysis, we classified the factors that influence the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs into three main groups, namely (i) the tracker and sensor type, (ii) the algorithm used in the device, and (iii) the limitation in the design, energy consumption, and processing capability of the device.

The adoption and use of consumer wearable health device (CWHD) for PA tracking is increasing.

Inaccurate data from wearable health devices could lead to dire consequences, especially when the device is integrated with healthcare applications [12] . Manufacturers of CWDHs often make strong claims about the accuracy and reliability of their devices [13] . However, there are genuine concerns over the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs [14] . For example accelerometer and pedometer-based CWHDs are known to be inaccurate in their estimation of energy expended (EE), and are unable to accurately track the number of steps in PA like cycling [6, 7] . Users of CWHDs expect, and are increasingly demanding that manufacturers deliver on their promises. The two class action lawsuits filed by users against one of the major manufacturers of CWHD in 2016 underscore the importance of accurate and reliable data collected by CWHDs [15] . Hence, it is no surprise that many researchers from developed countries [16] [17] [18] are focusing on the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs. As discussed later in Sect. 3, all the papers analyzed in this systematic literature review (SLR) were published by authors from developed countries. This points to an apparent dearth of studies that focus on the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs by researchers from developed countries, including Africa. To address this gap, this research investigates the factors that influence the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs.

However, red light PPG (rPPG) sensors (i.e. pulse oximeters) are commonly used in clinical environments [12, [25] [26] [27] . rPPG sensors have a number of advantages over gPPG sensors. The green light in gPPG sensors emits shorter wavelengths and does not penetrate deeper into the innermost layer of the skin. In contrast, rPPG sensors can penetrate deeper into the skin because the human body does not absorb the red light [25, 26] . This property enables rPPG sensors to detect other biological signals like the arterial oxygen saturation, respiration, and blood pressure [24, 26, 27] . In addition, rPPG light is not absorbed by melanin (the pigmentation that is responsible for the colour of the human skin) but gPPG light absorbs melanin. Therefore, the skin colour does not influence the accuracy of heart rate measurements when using rPPG sensors.
