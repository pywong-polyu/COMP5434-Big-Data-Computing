IL-1 has also been identified as a therapeutic target for patients with attributes of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which is characterized by excessive activation and expansion of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells and macrophages, generating a cytokine storm [2] . Research has demonstrated that the expression and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-9, can be upregulated via IL-1 in various cell types [3, 4] . MMP-9 is known to regulate acute lung injury by disrupting the function of the airway epithelial barrier and degrading a broad spectrum of extracellular matrix proteins [5] [6] [7] [8] . A recent study in mice showed that MMP-9 deficiency in lung structural cells protected the animals from virus-induced mortality [9] . The enzymatic activities of MMPs are strictly controlled by the 4 members of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) family of endogenous inhibitors: TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4 [10] . TIMPs are secreted proteins that generally have a positive effect on cell growth and survival [11] . Each TIMP protein has a distinct role in regulating MMP enzymes; for instance, MMP-3 and MMP-9 are inhibited more effectively by TIMP-1 than TIMP-2, whereas MMP-2 is more effectively inhibited by TIMP-2 than TIMP-1 [12, 13] .",

We therefore reasoned that a therapeutic intervention directed at MMP9 and IL-1 suppression using natural endogenous TIMPs and the IL-1 inhibitor IL-1ra could have a positive synergistic effect on the prevention of COVID-19-induced cytokine storm by blocking inflammatory (IL-1) and catabolic (MMPs) pathways. This intervention is also extremely likely to generate a positive synergistic effect on the regulation of the inflammatory process in severe COVID-19 cases. At the moment, effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2 are very limited; therefore, additional therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.",

Clinical trials have been approved for the CP treatment of COVID-19, including by Health Canada; however, recent research has demonstrated some uncertainty regarding the therapeutic efficacy of CP as a COVID-19 treatment [14, 15] . Consequently, there is increased urgency for additional COVID-19 treatments, especially in countries where access to the vaccines and supportive care for people infected with the virus are limited. This paper reports on a novel method for the creation of an autologous acellular blood product that contains anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic components enriched by TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and IL-1ra. This method generates a novel immunomodulatory product capable of targeting cytokine storm, including that caused by COVID-19, through IL-1 and MMP-9 downregulation. The product can likely minimize the progression of COVID-19 infections and improve patient outcomes.",

Incubation was carried out aseptically at 37\u00b0C for either 24 h or various time intervals (see results section). After the incubation time (3.5, 6, e934365-2 and 24 h), samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm, passed through a Millipore filter (0.22 \u03bcm, SLGP033RS), aliquoted, and stored at -80\u00b0C. The final cytokine and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations were measured using a multiplex assay (Immunology Multiplex Assay for TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, and MMP-9, EMD Millipore; Bio-Plex Pro\u2122 Human Cytokine 27-plex Assay, Bio-Rad) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method (High-sensitivity SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG Quantitative ELISA, BioVendor) according to the suppliers' protocols.

Rocking platforms are widely used in small-scale cell cultures to distribute nutrients evenly [20] . We theorized that this platform could also be used to increase the exposure of incubated blood cells with the internal glass surface. We incubated human blood in glass vacutainer tubes at 37\u00b0C for 3.5 h or 24 h, with and without agitation on a rocker platform. We identified the optimal incubation time and evaluated the effect of agitation on cell activation and IL-1ra production. A 2-way ANOVA test revealed a significant increase of IL-1ra production in the blood after 24 h of incubation only; no significant increase in IL-1ra concentration was observed at 3.5 h ( Figure 1B) . Surprisingly, agitated cultures produced significantly lower levels of IL-1ra ( Figure 1B) , possibly due to the prevention of cell-cell contacts or insufficient adhesion to the glass surface, presumably adversely affecting monocyte activation and downregulating IL-1ra synthesis. An alternative explanation for this decrease could be that agitation may stimulate the production of IL-1ra inhibitors. ",

In contrast, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-7 did not display any significant change in concentration (Figure 2A) . Since MMP-9 has been suggested to play a proactive role in lung epithelium inflammation, it is necessary to block its production in the final ABP. The secretion of MMPs from white blood cells is stimulated by the process of fibrinolysis [24] , and MMP-9 levels are strongly affected by the presence of anticoagulants [25] . A well-known and safe anticoagulant is SC, which binds to calcium in the blood in a soluble complex and depresses prothrombin activity in a dose-dependent manner [26] . We reasoned that adding SC to incubated blood may affect the extracellular and intracellular calcium-dependent cell regulatory pathways, preventing MMP-9 production. This would allow us to avoid the potential MMP-9-induced negative catabolic effect in our prospective ABP treatment. To test this hypothesis, we examined the MMP-9 concentration in untreated blood and blood incubated in the presence of SC at a 1: 19 ratio (4%). We observed an increase in MMP-9 concentration after 24 h of incubation ( Figure 2B ), but the production of MMP-9 was significantly downregulated with the addition of SC (Figure 2B) . The final ABP containing incubated blood and SC was found to contain similar MMP-9 levels to the nonincubated control.",

To optimize our existing protocol and analyze how this protocol would be efficient for blood cells previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, we measured IL-1ra, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 concentrations in samples from recovered COVID-19 patients after incubations of 6 or 24 h (at 37\u00b0C with 4% SC). One-way ANOVA tests revealed significant IL-1ra enrichment in the samples of immunized patients starting at 6 h of incubation ( Figure 5A) . Increased concentrations of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in unincubated control samples from recovered COVID-19 patients were observed compared with the nonexposed healthy donors (Figure 4B , 4C vs Figure 5B , 5C; TIMP-1 in healthy blood was 6000 pg/mL vs 20 962.3 pg/mL in COVID recovered blood, and TIMP-2 in healthy blood was 3900 pg/mL vs 24 204.1 pg/mL in COVID-19 recovered blood). Significant TIMP-1 enrichment was detected after 6 h of incubation in recovered COVID-19 patients' blood samples ( Figure 5B) ; however, the concentration of TIMP-2 did not change compared to the baseline (Figure 5C) . We were also able to confirm that the protocol to produce an ABP enriched in IL-1ra and TIMP-1 from donor patients recovered from COVID-19 does not upregulate the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 or TNF-a or the production of catabolic MMP-9 ( Figure 6A-6C) . Since it is important to consider the potential of using this protocol to create an ABP capable of preventing a cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, it is essential to confirm that this method does not affect the concentration of already formed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",

Thus, an autologous blood treatment product Orthokine [37] exploits the ability of incubated blood cells to produce an increasing concentration of IL-1ra in the absence of pro-inflammatory cytokine enrichment. Orthokine was recently introduced to the osteoarthritis market and was found to be effective in clinical trials [37] . However, others have reported a large variability in the concentration of growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines measured in this product, with significantly high levels of IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6 detected in the final product [28, 38] that would negatively affect the safety of using it therapeutically. Here we report a novel method for creating an ABP containing an anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic component (conditioned blood serum enriched with IL-1ra, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2) based on detailed cytokine analysis. Our experimental data also revealed that an approximately 10-fold enrichment of IL-1ra is achieved by incubating whole human blood in a closed vacutainer system at 37\u00b0C for 24 h (Figures 1, 2) . Although previous reports argue that the therapeutic concentration of IL-1ra is sufficient to saturate IL-1 receptors and block the IL-1 pathway [39, 40] , the results of our preliminary clinical trial (data not shown) indicate that the 10-fold enrichment we achieve is effective enough to reduce inflammation symptoms in osteoarthritic knees, presumably due to the synergistic effect of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 proteins.",

Approximately 10-fold IL-1ra enrichment was shown after 6 h of incubation, presenting a great advantage in reducing incubation time ( Figure 5) . Surprisingly, elevated TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 concentrations were detected in control samples from recovered COVID-19 patients versus healthy volunteer donors. Evidently, viral infections can stimulate long-term TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 production by human blood cells. Additionally, the incubation process upregulated the concentration of TIMP-1 but not that of TIMP-2. We provide evidence that the optimal blood incubation conditions for IL-1ra, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 production facilitate the synthesis of pro-inflammatory IL-1b, TNF-a, and catabolic MMP-9; however, this can be simply rectified by addition of SC. In comparison, our process did not demonstrate any effect on the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Our data have demonstrated a simple protocol for creating ABP for the potential treatment of cytokine storms, including those caused by COVID-19, which is now extremely important globally.",

Similar inflammatory pathways are also involved in the pathogenesis of other immune pathological conditions, such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/MAS-like syndrome, as well as septic shock. Hence, it is likely that this method and ABP will be beneficial in the treatment of various pathologies. Imminent future research is critical to facilitate the use of this ABP in treatment; large, double-blind controlled clinical studies will be required to confirm the clinical benefits for a new ABP treatment.",
