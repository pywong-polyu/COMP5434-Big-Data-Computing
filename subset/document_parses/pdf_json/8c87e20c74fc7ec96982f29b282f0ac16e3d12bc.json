The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as pandemic. The causal pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a newly isolated coronavirus, which first massively spread in the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan. This is the third large-scale epidemic caused by coronaviruses in the last two decades after There is still uncertainty about the transmission route of the SARS-CoV-2. According to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 7) published by Chinese National Health Commission on March 3, 2020, 1 the main human-to-human transmission routes are close contacts (direct/indirect) and large respiratory droplets by coughs or sneezes or droplets of saliva, but the aerosol and fecal-oral transmission could not be excluded and need further investigation. Different from large droplets, the aerosols are particles small enough to suspend in the air for prolonged time, normally with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 \u03bcm, and often referred to as \"droplet nuclei.\" 2 It was shown that 87% of the exhaled particles were below 1 \u03bcm. 3 There was potential evidence for the aerosol transmission route of SARS. 4 Studies have suggested that aerosols could be an important mode of transmission for influenza over both short and longer distances. 5\u22127 However, the issue of long-range infection is still contentious, since the risk of long-range transmission by aerosols is dependent on the amount of the virus-containing particles, biologic decay, and infectious dose. 6, 8 In the current situation, great efforts have already been taken to prevent the transmission by contacts and droplets, e.g., washing hands and social distancing. A recent study has detected SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. 9 However, the role of the aerosol transmission is still uncertain. A thorough assessment of aerosol transmission risk is required to better understand and control its influences. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) is an effective methodology to estimate the risk of infectious diseases. QMRA has been utilized to investigate the inhalation health risk of pathogens generated Special Issue: Environmental Transmission and Control of COVID-19 from reused water 10, 11 and waste management facilities for livestock farms. 12, 13 Recently, the QMRA method has been adopted to investigate the airborne infection risk of MERS-CoV in a hospital, which indicated that the daily mean risk of infection for the nurses and healthcare workers was relatively high (>10 \u22124 ). 14 Atmospheric dispersion models were utilized in the QMRA studies 15 for foot-and-mouth-disease virus, 16\u221221 avian influenza virus, 22, 23 Legionella, 24 the spore-forming bacterium B.anthracis, 25\u221227 and the C. burnetii bacterium for Q fever. 28, 29 The atmospheric dispersion models 30\u221232 estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of hazardous pollutants for a large scale and long period, which is difficult to achieve by field sampling and measurements. 33\u221236 Biologic decays were normally included in the models. 15 In this study, we evaluated the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 induced by aerosol transmission during the initial phase of the spread in the South China Seafood Market in December 2019 based on the QMRA method, by assuming one infected shopkeeper working inside Street No. 7 and by integrating the best available information about the virus as well as their uncertainties. A zone model 37 and a three-dimensional Lagrangian dispersion model 38 were utilized to estimate the airborne virus concentration and exposure in the market and outdoor environments. The key processes were integrated into the assessment, including viral shedding, dispersion in air, deposition, biologic decay, and lung deposition. The infection risk was assessed using the dose\u2212response model developed for SARS-CoV. 39 Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to take into account the uncertainties in viral shedding, biologic decay, and the dose\u2212response parameters. The infection risk by aerosol transmission was quantified for people in various scenarios, e.g., costumers and shopkeepers inside the market and pedestrians near the market and at the neighboring area hundreds of meters away from the market. The infection risks due to close contact (direct/indirect) and large respiratory droplets by coughs or sneezes or droplets of saliva were not included in this study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1236, "end": 1237, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1312, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1448, "text": "5\u22127", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1667, "end": 1669, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1671, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1885, "end": 1886, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2359, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2362, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2416, "end": 2419, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2422, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2659, "end": 2661, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2728, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2763, "end": 2768, "text": "16\u221221", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2792, "end": 2795, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2796, "end": 2798, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2855, "end": 2860, "text": "25\u221227", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2904, "end": 2907, "text": "28,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2908, "end": 2910, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3123, "end": 3128, "text": "33\u221236", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3183, "end": 3185, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3625, "end": 3627, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3975, "end": 3977, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "2.1.

Air Concentrations inside Street No. 7 and Release into the Ambient Environment. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were conducted to investigate the airborne virus concentration inside Street No. 7 and the release into the outdoor environment using polydisperse particles, considering the uncertainties in the viral shedding and the biologic decay. Figure 4a shows the MC results of the airborne virus concentrations inside the market. The data for the whole month are shown in Figure S3 in the SI. The median Environmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Article concentrations were close to those of large particles (3.5 and 5.5 \u03bcm) as shown in Figure 3 . It was suggested that breath aerosols were generated by fluid film ruptures in lungs during inhalation due to the expansion of the bronchiole, 67 so the viral shedding was proportional to the particle volume as shown in eq 1. The viral shedding within the investigated range (<5.5 \u03bcm) was dominated by the large particles due to the high volume, in spite of their low number concentrations, based on the assumption of homogeneous viral concentration in respiratory fluid. It should be noted that the assumption maybe was not valid for large droplets (>5.5 \u03bcm), which could have different generation mechanisms.

The estimated release of virus into the ambient environment was utilized as the source term for the atmospheric dispersion calculations in the GRAL model. The source was at the outlet of the indoor flow, either the western or the eastern exit of the market street, which was dependent on the ambient wind direction. The area was dominated by north and northeast wind as shown in Figure 2a , so the virus was primarily released from the western exit. Figure 5a displays the three-dimensional isosurface of 10 \u22126 PFU m \u22123 , to show the interaction between the plume and the surrounding buildings, in the most dominant wind scenario shown in Figure 2 . The plume was initially horizontally transported above the parking lot by the wind among the buildings. The expanding width of the plume indicated rapid dilution. The virus was confined Environmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Article near the ground level during the early phase due to the absence of vertical air flow. The plume was then elevated by the building and vertically transported to high altitudes, which decreased the ground level concentration. Figure 5b shows the plume emitted from the eastern exit with 2.5 m s \u22121 southwest wind (210\u00b0). The results also indicated that the virus containing plume was near the ground level close to the market. Figure 6a shows the time averaged (between 6:00 to 18:00 in December 2019) spatial distribution of the virus concentration at 1.5 m above ground and the ground deposition. The outdoor concentration was orders of magnitude lower than that inside the market due to the strong dilution by the ambient air.
