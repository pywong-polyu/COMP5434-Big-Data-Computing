High hospitalization levels due to the pandemic outbreak have caused the intensive care units to work above capacity. Purpose: A data envelopment analysis (DEA) based modelling approach was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of regions (i.e. city, country or clinical commissioning groups) against the pandemic outbreak. The objective is to enable related authorities better manage the struggle against the outbreak and put in place the emergency action plans immediately. Methodology/Approach: DEA method was used to measure the efficiency scores of countries. Super efficiency DEA method was also applied to countries based on the level of efficiencies they have achieved. Sixteen countries were selected that have been facing with Covid19 pandemic outbreak for at least 5 consecutive weeks after their 100th confirmed case. Results: A total of 80 DEA models were developed, that is, 16 DEA models for each week. The percentage of efficient countries decreased dramatically over time, from 43.75% in the first week to 25% in the fifth week. Unlike most European countries, China and South Korea increased their effectiveness after first week of implementing all the necessary measures.",

A sudden influx of patients to hospitals within a very short period of time, meant that even the most advanced healthcare systems around the world were unable to cope with the demand, and resources were stretched to its limit (e.g., beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment's, intensive care beds, doctors and nurses), forcing some countries to construct new Covid19 hospitals and departments within days and weeks.",

In this study, we developed a data envelopment analysis (DEA) based modelling to determine the efficiency levels of countries (out of the selected 16 nations) with respect to healthcare systems preparedness (in the form of availability of resources, i.e. number of physicians and hospital beds), demography (i.e. population, elderly people and age) and Covid19 confirmed cases.",

However, this may not be sufficient alone and the filiation teams investigating the source of Covid19 can be required to be established. The filiation teams to be established by the Ministries of Health determine the patients with Covid19 and reach out to those who are in contact with them. In this way, virus carriers have been identified before proceeding to the advanced stages of the disease, but the treatment process is started immediately. These people are also prevented from getting around in the community.In regions where the Covid19 outbreak is partially or fully controlled, if positive cases are observed, the relevant regions (i.e. town, district and province) can be quarantined in a short time. Thus, mobility is prevented.There may be reports of new signs about Covid19 in the printed and visual media. As the virus mutates, it may show different characteristics. In this process, countries, which are active in treatment and tracking, constantly update the algorithms in Covid19 Treatment protocols. Thus, they can be successful in reducing mortality rates and minimizing the number of intensive care and intubated patients. Until today, from the beginning of Covid19",
