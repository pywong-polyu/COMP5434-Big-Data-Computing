Notably, we include demographics, modelling 12 three groups: vulnerable, front-line workers, and non-vulnerable. We investigate the sequence of 13 vaccination. One counter-intuitive finding is that even though the vulnerable group is high risk, 14 demographically, this is a small group (per person, vaccination occurs more slowly) so vaccinating 15 this group first achieves limited gains in overall disease control. Better disease control occurs by 16 vaccinating the non-vulnerable group with longer and/or more severe lockdowns. 17 18 Although these non-pharmaceutical approaches have some success in reducing virus spread, they 34 are not a sustainable strategy, and other treatment-based approaches are required [10]. Several 35 candidate vaccines are in Phase III trials reporting efficacies from 70% to more than 90% [11].

Furthermore, these sort of lockdowns or circuit 222 breakers can be used to offset weakly efficacious vaccine rates to ensure that disease-related mor- To understand more fully vaccine delivery strategies between different parts of society, we begin by 226 determining how focusing initial vaccine delivery on single groups affects the likelihood of keeping 227 levels of mortality below the (optimal) threshold. If vaccines are delivered singly to vulnerable or 228 key worker groups then lockdowns would still be necessary and they would need to be reasonably 229 severe (> 60% reduction in transmission) to reduce cumulative mortality below key thresholds 230 ( Figure 4 ). Notable is that less severe lockdowns when vaccinating either of these two groups are 231 not sufficient to keep cumulative mortality below a critical threshold. This key finding is critical, and 232 requires consideration in light of the decision by many countries to vaccinate the most vulnerable 233 first. The reason for this finding is due to the demographic differences between these two groups 234 (where population sizes in these groups are relatively small) compared to the non-vulnerable group 235 (which contains the majority of the population). For example, consider a vulnerable (V) group of 236 500,000 people, and a non-vulnerable (NV) group of 10,000,000 people. If we vaccinate roughly 5% 237 of each group each day this would lead to vaccinating either 25,000 vulnerable people, or 500,000 238 non-vulnerable people, daily. Hence, even if the vulnerable people are an order of magnitude more 239 likely to die of COVID-19, more lives will be saved by vaccinating the 500,000 non-vulnerable group.",

The function exp(\u03b1I(t) \u2212 Z) describes the 102 difference between the number of disease-induced deaths at time point t and a considered threshold 103 value Z.

This summary figure 248 shows how different combinations of vaccination and lockdown interventions can lead to successful 249 disease control (in terms of minimizing cumulative mortalities) (Figure 4). With low vaccination 250 rate (e.g. \u03bd = 0.005), and depending on the severity of lockdown, lockdown durations could be 251 as short as 20 days (for a 80% reduction in \u03b2). Alternatively, a lockdown may be 30 days (for 252 60% reduction in \u03b2) or 50 days (for 40% reduction in \u03b2) for successful virus control. However, 253 under this level of vaccination (\u03bd = 0.005), it is simply not feasible for a lockdown where \u03b2 is only 254 reduced by 20% to keep cumulative mortality below the (nominal) 80, 000 threshold. 255 256 We illustrate how vaccinating different groups in different sequences can influence strategies to 257 achieve the optimal outcome, and most notably impact the time required in lockdown. If a strat-258 egy is adopted to vaccinate different groups over sequential 30 day periods (and continuing this 259 vaccination strategy once initiated for each group), then the choice of longitudinal sequences in-260 fluences the choice of lockdown duration and/or severity to achieve optimal disease control. For 261 the majority of sequences, moderate to severe lockdowns are needed to achieve the optimal goal of 262 keeping cumulative mortality below a critical threshold (Figure 5). However, adopting a strategy 263 in which the non-vulnerable group is vaccinated first, followed by the front line worker group fol-264 lowed by the vulnerable group (\"NV-FR-V\"; Figure 5) allows lockdowns of weaker severity (where 265 disease transmission is reduced by only 20%), albeit these might be of longer duration, to be used 266 to achieve the optimal goal. Apart from this sequence of vaccine delivery, there is again no feasible 267 vaccination strategy where weak lockdowns (transmission is reduced by 20%) would allow mortality 268 levels to be kept below 50,000 people.
