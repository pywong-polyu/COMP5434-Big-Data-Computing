However, we also have to admit that in the process of development, there are still many problems that need to be summarized and resolved, such as environmental protection issues, population structure issues, urban-rural gap issues, development balance issues, industrial structure adjustment issues, and so on. Among them, the problem of population structure is particularly prominent, and as an important part of our country's population, the problems of the elderly are worthy of in-depth study. In particular, with the increasing aging of our country, the resulting problems and actual impacts have become more and more obvious so that social development has been restricted on many occasions. erefore, it is urgent to solve the aging problem [1] . In today's society, a common phenomenon is that families are miniaturized, there are more and more only children, and the burden of caring for disabled elderly people is getting heavier. erefore, children urgently need new technologies and new things that can help them take care of the elderly, and disabled elderly people urgently need new things and new technologies that can assist them in their daily lives. If the control of external devices can be combined with the EEG signals of the elderly, it will not only regain their confidence in life and reduce the burden on children but also make meaningful explorations and attempts for the application and promotion of EEG research and development in real life [2] . Health literacy is the ability of individuals to acquire, process, and understand basic health care knowledge and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Moreover, as an important part of health education and health promotion, health literacy has gradually attracted attention from domestic and foreign scholars in recent years [3] . e framework of this article is as follows: With the rapid economic development, all levels of Chinese society have new faces; people's living standards are rising rapidly; and the overall development is developing in a prosperous environment. But we must also admit that there are many problems in the development process, which need to be summarized and solved, such as environmental problems, demographic structure, differences between cities and network problems of balanced development, industrial structure changes, and other especially important parts of the population problem of the elderly population, worthy of in-depth study. In particular, as our country ages, problems and practical consequences become increasingly apparent, and social development is in many cases hindered. erefore, the solution to the aging problem is inevitable (1).",

            "text": "In the past research work, people mostly used traditional sensing methods such as wearable devices and cameras to recognize indoor movements. Among them, the more typical example is the use of accelerometers, gyroscopes, or their fusion system to recognize action behavior [4] . e advantage of this type of wearable device is that it is highly robust to changes in the external environment. Secondly, researchers also use various types of cameras, such as depth cameras, to track and reconstruct human nonrigid motion [5] . is method can capture a large amount of external information, and the upper limit of performance is very high. e investigation in literature [6] shows the rejection of invasive devices by the elderly. Moreover, the camera has high requirements for lighting conditions, is easy to leak privacy, and is not suitable for use in an environment with high privacy requirements such as home. e main principle of using radar for action recognition is the micro-Doppler feature [7] . e action of the target will change the characteristics of the radar echo, and the activities of various parts of the body are different when different actions occur. If the human body is regarded as a collection of a series of reflection points, the overall frequency distribution finally reflected by these reflection points will correspondingly differ around the main modulation band. Researchers used to extract the required micro-Doppler features mainly based on the time-Doppler map (TDM). e most common are artificially predefined physical characteristics, including changes in the time-frequency spectrum envelope caused by the physical characteristics of the action [8] . is physical feature is easily affected by changes in the external environment (such as human height, weight, etc.) and often requires experts in related fields to design, which is timeconsuming and labor-intensive. In order to solve these problems, a series of feature definition methods in other similar fields are transplanted into this task, including classic wavelet-based features [9] and Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) [10] commonly used in speech analysis. e existence of these features simplifies the step of manually defining features but relatively also makes a certain compromise in classification performance. Since the different representations of radar data [11] can also be regarded as a category of generalized images, advanced deep learning techniques in the image field can be used to automatically extract low-dimensional abstract features from it. Literature [12] used an unsupervised pretrained sparse autoencoder to extract features from TDM and achieved an 87% recognition rate in fall detection. Literature [13] used a convolutional autoencoder to replace the traditional sparse autoencoder, borrowed the idea of inception to design the network structure, and obtained a classification accuracy of 94.2% on 12 types of actions. In addition, there is also a more comprehensive use of optimized networks for human-actionrecognition-related work [14] . However, one of the problems in these studies is that the signal representation domains used exist in a two-dimensional form, which cannot simultaneously characterize the time, space, distance, and Doppler frequency information contained in the radar signal, and it is bound to lose part of the information during action recognition.",

At present, the existing representative work includes the AAL behavior inference system that uses the depth camera to recognize actions and analyze context information [15] and the scheme of synchronizing the depth camera and wearable inertial sensor data proposed in literature [16] . Literature [17] used a variety of sensors (passive infrared sensors, door frame magnetic strips, and flow sensors) placed in various locations in the house to perceive the behavior of the monitored person in the entire indoor environment. is solution combines the prior knowledge of the sensor installation position to determine the behavior. For example, the doorframe magnetic stripe data can be used to infer the target's going out behavior, and the bathroom flow sensor data can be used to infer the target's bathing behavior. At the same time, some work focuses on the use of data mining methods to analyze mixed time series from multiple sensors and establish a person's daily behavior 2 Contrast Media & Molecular Imaging characteristics through the time changes of several quantitative or qualitative parameters [18] . Although such programs have achieved good results, their respective shortcomings are also obvious. For example, information-rich cameras and wearable sensors can cause privacy and intrusive issues when used for behavior inference and motion recognition. Moreover, the multisensor fusion scheme is very cumbersome to install in practical applications and requires specific protocols to coordinate with each other. is has led to this type of research can only be limited to the laboratory environment and far from being applied and promoted in the actual family [19] .",
