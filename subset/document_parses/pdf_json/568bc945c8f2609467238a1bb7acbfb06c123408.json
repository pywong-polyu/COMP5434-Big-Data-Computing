These guidelines are intended for a number of purposes, including as a guide for designers of new digital technologies, to identify and address issues arising from the deployment of such technologies, and as a basis for developing standards and regulation (2) .",

The convergence on these principles is often touted as evidence of an emerging consensus which can serve as a basis for implementing ethics into the design, regulation, and application of digital technologies. Yet how this is to be done largely remains an open question (11) . Consequently, digital ethicists have increasingly turned their attention to how such principles can best be translated into practice, whether through new design practices (5, 12, 13) or new forms of legislation and regulation (14, 15) .",

Second, they provide little guidance for how to resolve tensions and trade-offs that can arise between different (interpretations of) principles. To overcome these limitations, I argue, efforts to develop more responsible digital health practices should pay closer attention to a different branch of medical ethics: public health ethics.",

But many digital technologies deployed in clinical settings also resemble public health interventions. Take machine learning tools for diagnostic decision-support (24, 25) . These are usually designed for screening purposes, to monitor data from a given patient population and flag risk factors to human clinicians, and decisions to deploy them are made at the institutional level (e.g., hospitals or health service trusts). Even in patient-facing applications, e.g., conversational agents to assist with lifestyle decisions (26) , many of the pertinent ethical decisions have to be made at the population/institutional level-by designers and regulators-rather than in the individual clinical encounter.",

For example, it was recently shown that an algorithm that uses healthcare costs as a proxy for healthcare needs systematically underestimated the needs of Black patients, because less resources are already spent on their care (34) . Ruha Benjamin (35) argues that labeling this \"algorithmic bias, \" makes it seem a purely technical issue and sanitizes the social context that produced the problem in the first place, namely persistent structural and interpersonal racism in healthcare. More generally, as Leila Marie Hampton (30) argues, using generic concepts such as \"fairness\" or \"transparency\" to analyze technologies, without considering broader socio-political issues, risks legitimizing, and entrenching fundamentally unjust institutions.",

By contrast, public health interventions raise a much wider set of political issues (20) , similar to those commentators have started to discuss for digital health. For instance, is it permissible for interventions to impose risks or burdens on some individuals, even if they are not the main beneficiaries (e.g., mandatory vaccination programs)? Is it justifiable for interventions to exploit or reinforce structural patterns of disadvantage (e.g., using the communicative power of the state to stigmatize smoking)? More generally, when can institutional actors legitimately impose interventions despite widespread disagreement about relevant ethical values?",

Such principles still serve a useful purpose in articulating the values at stake in digital ethics (cf. Section What rationales should be considered relevant?). Similarly, public health ethics will not, in itself, answer all of the socio-political issues that Benjamin, Hampton and others raise. Clearly, many of these require political action and structural change, not (just) better theory. Even in terms of theory, other literatures will be relevant too, especially emancipatory philosophies such as the Black Feminist tradition Hampton highlights. Nonetheless, public health ethics is a well-developed literature addressing practical political issues in healthcare, often closely informed by the empirical realities of healthcare policy and decision-making. It can thus help broaden the range of questions digital health ethics addresses.",

It might be tempting to apply the same approach to digital health. However, informed consent is only plausible when the tradeoffs occur within a single patient's value-set. One of the ways digital health resembles public health is that the trade-offs often cut across populations. Rather than each patient deciding for themselves how to balance trade-offs, which values get priority depends on population-level aggregate decisions. Contact tracing apps, and centralized data collection more generally, can only produce the relevant social goods if there is sufficient uptake (39) . Conversely, if enough people consent to share their personal data, this can often be used to train machine learning algorithms capable of inferring highly personal information even about those who withhold consent (40) .",

Proposed by Norman Daniels and James Sabin, the key idea in A4R is to implement decisionprocedures for reaching compromises which fair-minded people can accept as legitimate, despite their underlying ethical disagreements. This relies on a distinction between ethical rightness and ethical legitimacy. To regard a decision as right is to regard it as the morally correct thing to do in a given situation. To regard it as legitimate is to regard it as appropriately made, i.e., by a decision-maker or procedure whose moral authority to make such decisions should be accepted. The two can come apart: we can accept a verdict of \"not guilty\" in a fair trial as legitimate, even if we believe the defendant should have been convicted. Conversely, an unelected dictator may sometimes do the right thing, e.g., donate food to relieve a famine. Nonetheless, rightness and legitimacy are also entangled: if a procedure consistently generates abhorrent outcomes, we have reason to question its legitimacy; and if we can see that a decision-maker has carefully considered the relevant concerns, there is prima facie reason to accept their decision as right.",

This challenge will also affect proposals to implement digital ethics principles through (a modified version of) VSD (12) . A4R suggests a way to overcome it: by structuring their decisionmaking processes according to the right kinds of procedural values, designers will be able to reach decisions that stakeholders can recognize as legitimate and therefore acceptable. To be clear, A4R is a normative theory of legitimacy. It does not commit the naturalistic fallacy by assuming that whatever stakeholders find acceptable is therefore right. If a decision counts as legitimate, according to A4R, stakeholders ought to find it acceptable.",

Similarly, it may be necessary to encourage scrutiny of the aims and presuppositions of the technology itself, asking for example whether it targets the right problem or whether the proposed solution is at all appropriate.

As A4R was originally developed for debates about rationing, most discussions focus on rationales framed in terms of Fairness or related distributive values (e.g., Solidarity (52)). Presumably, a broader range of values will be relevant to debates about digital health technologies (e.g., Privacy). Exploring in more detail what those values should be is a substantive research task. To ensure that decision-makers are responsive to all relevant reasons, this research should aim to identify a broad range of plausible concerns and help elucidate and articulate these, so that stakeholders can present them in their most compelling form.

It is noticeable, for instance, that many commonly cited principles (e.g., transparency, fairness, responsibility) also feature prominently within liberal political philosophy. Values more characteristic of other political traditions, such as solidarity, belonging, authenticity, harmony, non-exploitation, non-domination or emancipation are rarely discussed or even mentioned (9, 29, 30) .
