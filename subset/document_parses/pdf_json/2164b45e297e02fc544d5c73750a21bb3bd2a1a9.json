Brent R Stockwell, a Professor of Columbia University, firstly proposed that this from of cell death was named ferroptosis in 2012. The main characteristics of ferroptosis is increasing iron loading and driving a lot of lipid peroxide generated and ultimately lead to cell death. In this paper, the mechanism of ferroptosis, relationship between ferroptosis and common diseases and immune state of body are reviewed, and the inhibitors and inducers related to ferroptosis that have been found are summarized to provide medicine exploration targeted of ferroptosis and reference for the research in the future.",

            "text": "Cell death is definitely concern about mammalian growth, homeostasis regulation and development of various diseases. As is known to all, cell autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis are the traditional form of regulating cell death, in addition, ferroptosis is a fresh mode of iron-dependent death induced by small molecules such as Erastin and RSL3 proposed by Dixon in 2012, whose morphology, mechanism, induction and inhibition is different from traditional form of cell death [1] . The morphology of ferroptosis mainly shows that smaller mitochondria appear in the fine structure of the cell, and the mitochondrial membrane is shrunk, the mitochondrial cristae is reduced or disappeared, and the outer membrane is broken, but the morphological changes in the nucleus are not obvious. In the mechanism of occurrence, it does not depend on the Caspase9 family, but is closely related to lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, iron metabolism and gene regulation in vivo. Due to ferroptosis in recent years has been more and more gotten the attention of people, through deep researches in mechanism of ferroptosis, it was found ferroptosis and a variety of human diseases have inseparable relationship, including cardiac ischemic disease, kidney disease, liver damage, and degenerative disease, for example, ferroptosis of tumor cells can be induced to achieve the purpose of tumor treatment, and ferroptosis is also closely related to immunotherapy. Therefore, more and more drugs with ferroptosis as the therapeutic target can be studied. The compounds Erastin discovered by Dolma et al. [2] as early as 2003 are equivalent to the new compounds RSL3 and RSL5 that have similar functions to Erastin found in 2008 by Yang et al. [3] , Yang et al. [3] also found that ferroptosis chelating agents, DFOM and vitamin E could inhibit this non-apoptotic cell death modeferroptosis. In this paper, mechanism of ferroptosis and its relationship with diseases and human immune state are described in detail, and the inhibitors and activators targeting of ferroptosis that have been found so far are summarized, hoping to provide a new perspective for the study of ferroptosis and explore other target medicine as a potential therapeutic target. NADPH reduction reaction in its cytoplasm. Therefore, Glutamate (GSH) is a key target for controlling ferroptosis, and its synthesis processes (cysteine, GCLC enzyme and GSS enzyme), uptake processes (transporters system Xc -), and transport processes (GPX4) can regulate ferroptosis.",

The TXN enzyme system of malignant tumor cell lines is usually very active, and inhibition of GSH and TXN pathways can effectively trigger tumor cell death.

Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-GPX4 is a selenoprotein [6] . As we all known, decoding selenocysteine requires special tRNA-selenocysteine tRNA (sec-tRNA), and synthesis of the isoprene group of sec-tRNA requires the intermediate isoprene pyrophosphate (IPP) from the MVA pathway, because IPP is one of the most significant products of the MVA approach [7] ; hence, inhibitors of the MVA pathway can induce ferroptosis by inhibiting the synthesis of GPX4. Zhang et al. [8] found that GPX4 was largely expressed in tumor in comparison with normal tissues, and high expression of GPX4 was not conducive to the prognosis of patients.",

Excess Fe 2 + oxidize lipids through Fenton reaction to produce ROS and lipid peroxides ultimately bring about ferroptosis. Therefore, the expression of iron overload, transferrin, transferrin receptor, ferritin and nuclear receptor coactivator4 ( NCOA4) can all be used as targets for regulating ferroptosis, ALOX or eGln proline hydroxylase (also known as PHD) are taking effect for the activity of lipid peroxidation and iron homeostasis, expression of hepcidin and FPN1 can also act as targets to regulate ferroptosis. Therefore, iron metabolism is one of the important pathways to inhibit or induce ferroptosis.",

On the one hand, ferroptosis inducers such as Erastin can cause ferroptosis and thus inhibit progression of tumor; on the other hand, ferroptosis can induce inflammation-related immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to promote tumor growth. It is well known that the content of iron and glutathione in tumor microenvironment is higher than that in normal cells, so tumor cells should easily trigger ferroptosis. However, how do tumor cells regulate ferroptosis-sensitive microenvironment to protect themselves from being cleared by immune cells? Certainly the extent of ferroptosis's influence on tumor biology remains to be further studied.",

Mitochondrial DNA deletion widely exists in aging, degenerative diseases and other genetic diseases, so it has a wide range of potential pathological and therapeutic significance [44] . At least nine genetic mutations have been identified that cause MDS [45] . Deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) role is largely synthetic purine nucleotide in the mitochondria, the mutation type most often lead to bone MDS [46] , patients often died of severe liver failure within a year, in addition to liver transplantation, there is no other effective treatments [47] , its important clinical phenotype is liver iron deposit, serological examination showed elevated serum ferritin and transferrin [48] . Studies have shown that hepatocytes of MDS patients are more sensitive to ferroptosis caused by iron deposition, first, mitochondrial DNA deletion in hepatocytes leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased mitochondrial ATP synthesis, increased reactive oxygen species and glutathione depletion, and the iron in ferritin is released into the cytoplasm, causing lipid peroxidation to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), and finally leading to ferroptosis of liver cells.

[55] for the first time systematically elucidates the characteristics of ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons in a mouse model of AD and identifies pathologic down regulation of Ferroportin (FPN) in both AD patients and mice, it has been confirmed that FPN deficiency can induce ferroptosis and lead to learning and memory impairment, restoration of FPN expression can improve ferroptosis characteristics of neurons and learning and memory impairment. The role of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases has been widely concerned.",

The unsaturated fatty acid chain of phospholipid in biofilm is continuously oxidized and repaired, if the repair is not timely, the accumulation of phospholipid peroxides may lead to ferroptosis of cells. Calcium-independent phospholipase A2\u03b2 (IPLA2\u03b2, corresponding gene name pNPLA9), a Sn-2 acyl binding protein that specifically hydrolyzes phospholipids, take effect in the removal of oxidized phospholipids and the remodeling of phospholipids. One of the important pathological mechanisms, the accumulation of phospholipid oxidation in dopaminergic neurons, is caused by the loss of IPLA2\u03b2. Kagan VE et al. [33] found that 15-Lox can anchor to cell membrane under the action of companion molecule PEBP1, specifically oxidize phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to produce oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (ox-PE), among which PE oxidation product 15-HPET-PE is an important signal molecule for ferroptosis of cells. The anti-ferroptosis function of IPLA2\u03b2 is mainly through scavenging ferroptosis signaling molecule 1-SA-2-15-HPET-P. The mutation of IPLA2\u03b2 makes it conformational and cannot bind to the phospholipids of the cell membrane, thus reducing the enzymatic hydrolysis and oxidative capacity of the phospholipids.",

In addition, it also provides a way of thinking for the use of the inducers and inhibitors of ferroptosis that have been discovered at present; therefore, it is necessary to summarize the existing inducers and inhibitors of ferroptosis.",

It is expected that there will be more and more related studies in the future, which will provide new ideas for the treatment plan with ferroptosis as the therapeutic target, and also will provide references for the development of more ferroptosis inhibitors and inducers. In addition, it will be a meaningful work to screen targeted drugs that regulate the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, reactive oxygen species and iron for the treatment of common human diseases such as tumor and heart disease. Through a detailed review of the mechanism of ferroptosis and its inhibitors and inducers, we hope to screen out targeted drugs that can effectively intervene ferroptosis to treat common human diseases, and provide reference for the future research and exploration of ferroptosis. It may also be a meaningful work that combining drug therapy with common treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation is a promising job. ",
