Remarkably, RBD Omicron has much weaker binding affinity to the two launched mAbs Etesevimab (\u0394G = \u221237.95 \u00b1 1.63 kcal/mol) and Bamlanivimab (\u221222.42 \u00b1 1.61 kcal/mol) than WT (\u221267.78 \u00b1 2.12 and \u221252.90 \u00b1 0.29 kcal/mol, respectively), indicating a high risk of immune evasion of Omicron to the two launched mAbs. Another marketed mAb, Regdanvimab, has a weak trend of decreased binding affinity but without significance to either WT or Delta. The newly reported experimental data reveal that the neutralization capability of the 3 marketed mAbs to RBD Omicron decrease by 3 orders of magnitude, which is in agreement with our prediction in general (details shown in Supplementary Text). 4 Impressively, Bebtelovimab in clinic study has strong affinity to either WT or Delta and Omicron variants, indicating this mAb may have high neutralization efficacy to WT and the 2 variants. The very weak RBD binding affinity of BD-368-2, a mAb in clinic trial, to both variants suggests its poor neutralization efficacy. Therefore, the new variant Omicron may have high immune evasion risk to most of the existing mAbs.",

The opposite effects make the change of interaction between RBD Omicron and ACE2 very complicated, but finally resulting in a similar binding affinity of RBD Omicron -ACE2 to that of RBD WT -ACE2. The detailed interaction mechanism and contributions are summarized in Supplementary Figs. S5 and S7 and discussed in. In overall, it is a combinatorial effect of the multiple mutations of Omicron on its similar binding free energy to RBD WT , while the strong binding free energies of RBD Delta to ACE2 could be attributed to the hydrophobic interaction from the residues of F486, Y489 and F490 (Supplementary Fig. S8 ).",
