We retrospectively analyzed 203 patients newly diagnosed with sHLH from July 2015 to July 2019 according to the HLH-2004 protocol. Baseline characteristics, laboratory results, and imaging were reviewed. Pleural effusion was found in 58.6% of the studied sHLH population, and characteristic imaging findings were minimal volume and bilaterality. Patients with pleural effusion had lower PLT counts, HB levels and ALB levels as well as higher sCD25 levels than those without pleural effusion (all p values < 0.05). Multivariate analyses showed that lg(sCD25) and PLT \u2264 65 \u00d7 10 9 /L were significant risk factors for developing pleural effusion in sHLH. Regarding prognostic value, survival analysis showed a lower survival probability for patients with pleural effusion than for those without pleural effusion (median OS, 90 vs. 164 days, p = 0.028). In multivariate analysis, pleural effusion was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) (HR 2.68; 95% CI 1.18-6.11, p = 0.019). Pleural effusion is frequently found in patients with sHLH and is associated with greater inflammation and worse outcomes.",

            "text": "Pleural effusion was found in 58.6% of the studied sHLH population at diagnosis, a higher percentage than the range of previously reported data for critical illness and haematologic malignancies [11, 12] . The incidence of pleural effusion in sHLH patients was high, which was consistent with previous studies [13, 14] . Our findings suggest that pleural effusion developed more often in patients with lower PLT counts, HB and ALB levels and higher sCD25 levels. Moreover, through multivariate analyses, we determined that PLT \u2264 65 \u00d7 10 9 /L and high levels of sCD25 were associated with an increased risk of pleural effusion. It is well known [15] . Cytopenia, especially persistent severe thrombocytopenia, is a key laboratory marker of HLH and is mainly related to severe cytokine-mediated inflammation [6, 16] . Reportedly, the rapid onset of cytopenia suggests a consumptive process critically driven by TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3. Uncontrolled activation of macrophages will result in phagocytosis of platelets and other haematopoietic components by macrophages [16] [17] [18] . Indeed, a high level of sCD25 linked the diagnosis of adult HLH with the defining features of hypercytokinemia [19, 20] . It is reasonable to presume that pleural effusion may be associated with a higher inflammation state. Therefore, maintaining awareness of the possibility of pleural effusion is important, especially in sHLH patients with significantly decreased haemoglobin, platelet, and albumin and significantly elevated sCD25. The pathogenesis of sHLH-induced pleural effusion is still not clear. One theory holds that the onset of pleural effusion is caused by excessive inflammatory cytokines resulting from HLH. The release of a large number of inflammatory factors leads to widespread increases in vascular permeability that can result in progressive subcutaneous and body cavity oedema, including pleural effusion [21] . Previous studies have suggested that cytokines and other inflammatory mediators could induce gaps between endothelial cells by disassembling intercellular junctions, altering the cellular cytoskeletal structure, or directly damaging the cell monolayer. This creation of gaps can result in microvascular leak and pleural effusion [21] [22] [23] . Moreover, HLH was also described in severely ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting with vascular injury resulting from hyperinflammation in the alveoli [24] . Weaver et al. [25] reported that hyperinflammation, rather than hemophagocytosis, appears to be the driving cause of HLH pathology. In our study, we obtained evidence that the incidence of pleural effusion in patients with different aetiologies of sHLH was not statistically significant. An immune-mediated mechanism is more likely responsible for the sHLH-related pleural effusion, as our multivariate analysis has reported. We reviewed the radiological reports at diagnosis of 162 patients with sHLH, noting presence of pleural effusion and its characteristic. A notable observation in our study was that the incidence of early-onset effusion (58.6%) was higher than that of late-onset effusion (11.7%). Pleural effusion may be the first presentation of sHLH. The early onset of pleural effusion and its association with HLH severity support a direct link to HLH or suggest that pleural effusion is in part due to HLH itself. Moreover, pleural effusion is characterized by minimal amounts and bilateral in the diagnosis of sHLH, consistent with two paediatric HLH studies [13, 26] .",

            "text": "More recent studies have shown that pleural effusion is an important prognostic factor for overall survival in critically ill patients and those with haematologic malignancies [27, 28] . It is generally believed that the prognosis of sHLH is known to be heavily dependent on the aetiology and treatment. Based on some case reports, it appears that pleural effusion was an ominous sign [29, 30] . Our study showed that the cumulative death rate was significantly higher in sHLH patients with pleural effusion than in those without (p = 0.028), and the presence of pleural effusion was independently associated with worse survival among patients with sHLH. In the etiology analysis, 79 LHLH patients also found the same results. However, the mechanism leading to this higher mortality rate remains unclear. One hypothesis could be that the pleural effusion could sometimes only be the reflection of a more severe form of HLH (with a more intense cytokine storm and a more intense hemophagocytic activity). Therefore, deeper knowledge of pleural effusion in sHLH is important for guiding physicians to evaluate the condition and formulate treatment in these patients. Additionally, our present results strongly imply that patients with moderate to massive amounts of pleural effusion have worse survival than patients with minimal amounts of pleural effusion, and the increase of pleural effusion is accompanied the severity of the disease. There was no difference in prognosis between patients with bilateral pleural effusion and patients with unilateral pleural effusion. Currently, there is no specific treatment for pleural effusion in sHLH, and active treatment of primary disease based on fluid therapy is a key measure. After the initial effective treatment of HLH, the pleural effusion can be completely alleviated.",
