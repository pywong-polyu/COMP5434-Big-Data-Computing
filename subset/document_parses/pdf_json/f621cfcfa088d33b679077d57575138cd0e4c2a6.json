To this end, in this chapter, we present the research work that we conducted to study the impact of COVID-19 on public transport at different stages in different areas across a large metropolitan area from Sydney, Australia, particularly in terms of bus delay. The public transport infrastructure in Sydney is very important, as it connects radially the inner and east regions of the city to the large extended regional suburbs. As the city does not have an underground subway system like other large metropolitan cities from Europe or the United States, the bus public transport system is critical in delivering the daily home-towork journeys. The results not only help understand the changes of travel behaviors caused by the pandemic across the entire city but also benefit the public transport operators to enhance services after the pandemic is over, by providing a benchmark of potential improvement.",

            "text": "In Australia, a few cases of COVID-19 were initially reported before March 2020. However, the number of confirmed cases has rapidly increased during the month of March. There was a signalized spike of reported cases during March 22, 2020 , to March 27, 2020 , in the state of New South Wales (NSW). Based on this observation, we hypothesize that under the situation of rapid increase of confirmed cases, people will largely reduce their usage of private cars and public transport by working from home and avoiding unnecessary travel. The decision of reducing daily trips was also recommended by government authorities to keep social distancing and work from home where possible [2] . The travel behavior shift has led to a change of traffic conditions, which had no precedent. Therefore the impact of such travel restrictions can be quantified in terms of bus delay, which is an important indicator of the overall urban traffic condition. With this hypothesis, we decide to scope our study on the bus delay change in the Sydney region within the time window from February to March 2020. As an observation, previous years of bus delay analysis have been captured continuously by the research team, but for the purpose of this work and case study, we keep the data analysis restricted around the most affected months by the global COVID-19 pandemic. We do make the observation that while great importance has been previously given in the literature to the prediction of bus delays in the network, the current large-scale disruption of COVID-19 represents a unique event that has not been studied before; therefore the challenge is to model and understand the impact of such disruption on not only bus operations but also the traveler's behavior.",

In Sydney, the central business district (CBD) and eastern suburbs are the very popular locations for business, traveling, transport multimodal hubs, and tourism attractions due to their proximity to beaches. This makes the travel behavior in these areas distinct from that in other areas in the city, which have different economical and urban characteristics (several warehouses, depots, remote industrial headquarters, local suburban houses). Consequently, the impact of COVID-19 on these areas is expected to be different from the remote areas, especially during peak hours.",

            "text": "In order to quantify the bus delay changes, the biggest challenge is to correctly and timely estimate the bus arrival times at various bus stops in the network. The information of bus arrival time is currently unavailable, as the bus stations are not interconnected or monitored digitally. However, the real-time positioning of each bus across the network is available via real-time transmitted GPS (Global Positioning System) location points. We therefore need to estimate the bus arrival times by using the realtime transmitted GPS data, which contains the geolocations of buses in the city with their associated time stamps. Nowadays the GPS devices mounted on buses are continuously generating data within a very short time interval of a few seconds, with the purpose to better monitor bus movements. This makes the accurate estimation of bus arrival time possible. On the other hand, due to the extensive and large bus network, this requires having in place a big data processing and analysis framework to run on such a large-volume of geolocation dataset; for example, more than 3 GB of GPS data is generated every day for the entire Sydney bus network. Furthermore, due to the wellknown issue of GPS accuracy [3] , the GPS data is always associated with an error (a deviation from what the real position of the bus vehicle is in reality). Therefore we are facing the challenge of mapping the GPS data points to the correct geolocations in order to be able to calculate accurately the individual bus delays and aggregate the results for impact analysis.",

The real-time bus positions are captured by the GPS devices mounted on the buses. As mentioned before, there are always errors associated with the GPS data. We need to correct the GPS data by a map matching algorithm, which we introduce in Section 3. As the bus GTFS data is published in real time, we need to develop a data crawling service that is continuously collecting the data through RESTful data application programming interface (API) provided by the local transport agency: Transport for NSW [21] . Fig. 14.6 illustrates the workflow of data crawling. To collect the real-time bus position data, the data crawling service sends a data pulling request to the data APIs every 5 s. After receiving the data returned from the data API the service then parses the data and checks whether it is exactly the same as the previous data points by examining the hash values. If so then it discards the data, otherwise we append the data to stored data files. The purpose of removing the duplicate records is to save space as well as to reduce the computation cost in the step of delay calculation introduced in Section 3. In the entire Sydney metropolitan region, there are around 24,000 bus stops and more than 25,000 bus trips are being scheduled during a 24-h day, which leads to more than 3 GB of real-time bus position data being collected every day. Apart from the bus position data, the data crawling service also collects timetable and network data daily in a similar fashion, in order to have up-to-date timetable and network data. ",

For each bus trip that is being collected, bus GPS points are matched to the actual geolocations in the bus network by using our proposed map matching algorithm. This step represents a true research challenge as the GPS points' deviation can be quite high especially in central urban areas where various complex intersections can be found. Matching the bus GPS locations not only needs to consider the proximity to the road centerline, but more specifically, the direction of the bus trips, the turnings available at each intersection, the last GPS points, the overlaying with other bus trips sharing the same lanes, etc. The method is further described in Section 3.2.

One native way is the point-to-curve method, which projects GPS points to their closest edges. This method is simplistic and lacks robustness especially when the road network has a complicated structure such as inside the CBD. An improved method is the curve-to-curve method, which considers the closeness and similarity between the curve formed by GPS points and the candidate path. However, it still has the same problems under the circumstances of large GPS errors and complicated overlay networks. Other approaches include using the geometry and topology of the road network [27] , Kalman filters [28] , and Fuzzy rules [29] . Generally, map matching algorithms can be divided into two groups: offline and online algorithms. Offline algorithms have an advantage of processing all GPS points after a trip is finished. On the other hand, online algorithms need to process currently available GPS points before a given time, which makes them have less data to be used and potentially leading to a compromise of accuracy.",
