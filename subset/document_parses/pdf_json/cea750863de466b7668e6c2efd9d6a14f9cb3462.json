            "text": "Context: Tangwang Mingmu granule (TWMM), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely used in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR), the most common microvascular complication in diabetes mellitus. Objective: To establish a method to select target compounds from herbs for a pharmacokinetic study using network pharmacology, which could be applied in clinical settings. Materials and methods: First, UPLC/Q Exactive Q-Orbitrap and GCMS 2010 were used to determine the non-volatile and volatile ingredients of TWMM. Based on the identified compounds, network pharmacology was used to screen the key compounds and targets of TWMM in the treatment of DR. Based on the compound-target-pathway network and identification of components emigrant into blood, the potential compound markers in vivo were chosen. Then, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administrated of TWMM at a 9.6 g/kg dose to investigating pharmacokinetic parameters using the UPLC-QQQ-MS. Results: Ninety and forty-five compounds were identified by UPLC-MS and GC-MS, respectively. Based on the network pharmacology, nine compounds with a degree value above 15 were screened and implied that these compounds are the most active in DR treatment. Moreover, criteria of degree value greater than 7 were applied, and PTGS2, NOS2, AKT1, ESR1, TNF, and MAPK14 were inferred as the core targets in treating DR. After identification of components absorbed into blood, luteolin and formononetin were selected and used to investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of TWMM after its oral administration. Conclusions: The reported strategy provides a method that combines ingredient profiling, network pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics to determine luteolin and formononetin as the pharmacokinetic markers of TWMM. This strategy provides a clinically relevant methodology that allows for the screening of pharmacokinetic markers in Chinese medicines.",

To understand the pharmacokinetic parameters of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of a drug product, the highcontent-ingredients that emigrate into the circulatory system are generally selected as target compounds in a pharmacokinetic study (Jiang et al. 2020; . In certain instances, the activity of the high content ingredients does not match the clinical application of the herbal medicine, resulting in difficulties in obtaining pharmacokinetic indicators to guide clinical use. Occasionally, broad action(s) of detected compounds, such as immune-stimulatory and antioxidative activities are reported without provision of any proof to support their specific clinical contribution in the herb or prescription medicine for the management of diseases such as DR (Yuan et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2019) . For example, the clinical symptoms of chronic nephritis have been reported to be alleviated by shenyanyihao oral solution. Ten high-content compounds including stachyBine, danshensu, chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, plantamajoside, aesculetin, isoquercitrin, ferulic acid, baicalin, and baicalein were selected for a pharmacokinetic study which resulted in little clinical relevance (Jiang et al. 2020) . Similarly, reported that Chaihu-Shugan-San could be used to treat depression. In this study, nine high content ingredients were selected as markers and determined in plasma samples. However, most of these compounds were not interrelated to the treatment of depression. Thus, establishing a method that can determine clinically relevant compounds in pharmacokinetic studies of complex drugs is warranted.",

It can demonstrate compound-target-pathway networks, which can be used to explore the mechanism of various compounds in treating multi-target diseases from a perspective of systems biology and biological network balance ). In addition, this comprehensive analysis can be applied in the screening of active ingredients and therapeutic targets as well as in determining the compound mechanism of action (Pan et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020 ). Zhang et al. (2021) reported that Shuang-Huang-Lian water extract (SHL) considerably improves the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. In their study, baicalin, sweroside, chlorogenic acid, forsythoside A, and phillyrin were selected as the potential active compounds through network pharmacology. Consequently, H1N1-infected mice were administered these five compounds to verify their therapeutic effects. They found that these five compounds had the same therapeutical effects as SHL, causing the release of cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6, and ultimately contributing to an increased survival rate. Therefore, network pharmacology is capable of identifying active ingredients responsible for pharmacological activity in mixed medicines.",

Since visual sense involves all aspects of our daily lives, the deterioration of vision is likely to seriously affect the quality of life in these patients. However, the pathogenesis of DR is not clear, and current symptomatic therapy of the disease is ineffective (Whitehead et al. 2018; Nawaz et al. 2019) . Furthermore, the available drugs for the treatment of DR are deficient and unilateral (Stitt et al. 2016 ). The commonly used treatment for DR, an intraocular injection containing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neither works in early DR nor restrains the development of DR (Dulull et al. 2019 ). In addition, multiple intraocular injections raise the risk of serious intraocular infection. Other treatments such as fundus laser photocoagulation involve the risk of destroying the normal function of the retina (Shalchi et al. 2020; Mones et al. 2021) . Currently, all the available treatment options for DR may result in poor treatment compliance and disease prognosis (Fajnkuchen et al. 2020) . Therefore, novel orally administered therapy is an urgent need in attempting to manage DR.",

To determine intra-and inter-day precision and accuracy, six replicate quality control (QC) samples at three concentrations were prepared. Inter-and intra-day precision was evaluated by determining relative standard deviation (RSD) values, while accuracy was expressed in terms of the relative error (RE). The extraction recoveries were determined using three concentration levels and calculated by comparing the peak area of extracted samples with post-extracted spiked samples.

In addition, it was found to inhibit the advanced glycation end product (AGE)forming of sorbitol and DPPH radical scavenging in rat lens (Hwang et al. 2019) . Formononetin was reported to possess hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, which can improve the clinical symptoms of DR. In addition, formononetin was shown to attenuate inflammatory responses by inhibiting the expression of interleukin (IL)-1b and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (IcaM-1) at both protein and gene levels (Yang et al. 2005) . Furthermore, treatment using formononetin for 16 weeks could ameliorate the clinical symptoms of hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance in diabetic animals. Moreover, Figure 4 .

Luteolin and formononetin were determined as the target compounds in explaining the pharmacokinetic properties of TWMM. This study provides a suitable combination strategy to unveil pharmacokinetic markers based on clinical application with high efficiency and clinical focus.",
