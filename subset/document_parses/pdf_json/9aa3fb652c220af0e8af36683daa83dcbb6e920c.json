            "text": "Socio-economic disparities quite often have a central role in the unfolding of large-scale catastrophic events. One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics [1] is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds [2-6], creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts [12] , but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.",

This is why the first measures attempting at containing the spread of the virus included the introduction of travel restrictions, social distancing, curfews, and stay-at-home orders [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, the distribution of the number of contacts per person is known to be fat-tailed [17] , so that most of the infections are actually caused by a relatively small set of individuals, called super-spreaders [18, 19] , who normally have a disproportionately high number of face-to-face contacts. Intuitively enough, super-spreaders are most commonly found among service workers -cashiers, postmen, clerks, cooks, bus drivers, waiters, etc.-since their job involves being in direct contact with a large number of people on a regular basis. This fact makes super-spreaders more prone to catch diseases that propagate preferentially through direct contacts, like COVID-19 does, and -involuntarily-more efficient at spreading them.",

Indeed, ethnic segregation is long-standing problem across the US [28] , so the idea that the abnormal proportion of COVID-19 infections among African Americans could be due to spatial segregation does not sound unreasonable. However, the results available so far confirm that, although there is a correlation between ethnic segregation and overall incidence of COVID-19 in the population, there seems to be little evidence of an association with infection gap in African Americans [29] .",

In particular, we argue that these super-spreading behaviours are connected to the presence of what we call dynamic segregation. By dynamic segregation we mean the extent to which individuals of a certain class or group are either preferentially exposed to other groups, or internally clustered, as a result of their mobility patterns. In this sense, dynamic segregation is somehow complementary to the classical notion of segregation based on residential data, and is instead related with similar measures of segregation based on the concept of activity space [30] . In principle, the fact that a certain residential neighbourhood has an overabundance of people belonging to a single ethnic group might have per se little or no role in increasing the probability that those people catch COVID-19. Conversely, the fact that a group of people works preferentially in specific sectors, or in specific areas of a city, almost automatically increases the typical number of face-to-face contacts they have during a day, e.g., by forcing them to commute long distances in packed public transport services.",

Then, we consider a random walk on the graph G, and we look at the statistics of Class Mean First Passage Times (CMFPT) and Class Coverage Times (CCT). The former is the number of steps needed to a walker starting on a node of a certain class \u03b1 to end up for the first time on a node of class \u03b2, while the latter is related to the time needed to a random walk to visit all the classes in the system (see Methods for details). The underlying idea is that a random walk through the graph preserves most of the information about correlations and heterogeneity of node classes [31] . Consequently, if a system is dynamically segregated, the statistics of CMFPT and CCT will be substantially different from those observed on a nullmodel graph having exactly the same set of nodes and edges, but where a node is assigned a class at random from the underlying ethnicity distribution.",

Here each node is associated to one of the seven high-level ethnic groups defined by the US Census Borough [34] , with a probability proportional to the abundance of that ethnicity in the corresponding census tract. The variables of interest are \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3 \u03b1 . These are, respectively, the ratio of the CMFPT from class \u03b1 to class \u03b2 in the real system and in the null-model, and the ratio of the CCT when the walker starts from class \u03b1 in the real system and in the null model (see Eq. 8 and Eq. 10 in Methods). In short, the farther away \u03c4 \u03b1,\u03b2 is from 1, the higher the dynamic segregation from class \u03b1 to class \u03b2. Similarly, the higher the value of \u03b3 \u03b1 the more isolated ethnicity \u03b1 is from all the other ones. The top panels of Fig. 1 correspond to the unweighted network A of physical adjacency between census tracts, while the bottom panels are obtained on the weighted network C of typical daily commute flows among the same set of census tracts [35] (see Methods for details). Notice that the two graphs have quite different structures: the adjacency graph is planar and each edge connects only nodes that are physically close, while in the commuting graph long edges between physically separated tracts are not only possible, but quite frequent. As a consequence, the adjacency graph provides information about short trips, e.g., for daily shopping and access to local services, while the commuting graph represents long-range trips, e.g., related to commuting to and from work. It is clear that each ethnicity has a peculiar pattern of passage times to the other ethnicities, and this pattern varies across cities. For instance, in Chicago the two largest values of \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 on the adjacency graph are observed between African Americans and White, and between Asian and African Americans. Conversely, in Los Angeles the two largest values of \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 are between African American and Asian and between Other and Asian. As expected, the profile of \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 for a given class is quite different if we consider the commuting network instead of the adjacency graph. In Chicago, the largest value of \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 is from White to African American, while in Los Angeles there are a lot of pairs of classes with pretty similar values of \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 , indicating that in this city dynamic segregation for African Americans is less prominent than in Chicago. The value of \u03b3 \u03b1 for African Americans is especially low in Chicago, but noticeably different from that of the other ethnicities in Los Angeles. Results for other cities are discussed in Appendix A Supplementary Figures 1-4 . As we shall see in a moment, \u03b3 \u03b1 is related to the isolation of a class, so that lower values correspond to increased exposure to all the other classes. The distribution of the fraction of African American population living in each census tract (panels a,f ) is mostly unrelated to the local clustering index \u03bei (panels b,d,g,i) and to the local isolation index \u03c8i (panels c,e,h,j). The figure shows the result for Chicago (top panels) and for Los Angeles (bottom panels). Overall, there is little correlation between the density of African American residents and the dynamic segregation of African Americans in an area. This explains why dynamic segregation indices in a city correlate quite strongly with the COVID-19 infection gap, while no strong association with residential segregation has been found so far.",

We considered two temporal data sets of weekly percentage of African Americans infected by and deceased due to COVID-19 for each state in the US [32, 33] (more details available in Methods), and we calculated the incidence gap \u2206A inf in each state as the difference between the percentage of infected of that state that are African Americans and the percentage of African American population in the same state.

The top panels report the results on the adjacency networks of census tracts, while the bottom panels are for the commuting graphs. Interestingly, there exists a quite strong correlation between dynamic segregation and the disproportionate number of infected in African American communities. In particular, the dynamic clustering of African Americans in a state correlates positively and quite strongly with the infection gap observed in that state in the first two weeks of the data set, both on the adjacency (respectively R 2 = 0.58 and R 2 = 0.44 in the first two weeks) and in the commuting network (respectively R 2 = 0.60 and R 2 = 0.50).

Conversely, the dynamic isolation of African Americans in the adjacency graph is negatively correlated with incidence gap in the early stages of the epidemics (R 2 = 0.31). Similar results are obtained when we consider the correlation with the death gap \u2206A dec , and the ratios of infection/deaths incidence instead of the difference (see .

It is true that in Chicago \u03be i in the adjacency graph is still somehow correlated with the fraction of African American population (see Supplementary Figure 16 ). But the distribution of \u03be i in the commuting graph is totally different. In particular, the regions characterised by residential clusters of African Americans exhibit lower values of \u03be i , meaning that the commuting patterns make those neighbourhoods overall less isolated. Conversely, new hot-spots are identified in the South-Eastern region of Gary, likely due to the fact that people in this region do not commute much to the city centre anyway. Similarly, the areas of Los Angeles with the largest local isolation are not the neighbourhoods with a higher percentage of African Americans residents, rather the suburbs characterised by high commuting.",

Combined effects of dynamic segregation and use of public transport Finally, in Fig. 4a -d we show the correlation between the infection gap and the different segregation measures as the pandemic progresses.

Similar results are found for the correlation with death gap and with ratios of incidence and deaths in African Americans (see Appendix D and Supplementary Figures 20-22 ) as well as with a second dataset we had access to [33] (see Supplementary Figures [23] [24] [25] [26] . The main reason for the observed decreases is that once large-scale mobility restrictions are put in place -as it happened between the end of March and the beginning of April across all the US states with stayat-home orders and curfews-the overall mobility structure of each city is massively disrupted. As a result, super-spreading behaviours due to usual commuting patterns are massively reduced, and the contagion progresses mainly through face-to-face interactions happening close to the residential place of each individual, and are not captured well by CMFPT and CCT on the commuting graph.",

The combination of dynamic segregation and use of public transport correlates quite consistently with the incidence gap.

The presence of a COVID-19 incidence gap in Black and African American population is somehow unexpected, since no specific biological risk factor has been strongly associated with an increased vulnerability to the virus of any specific ethnic group. Hence, the most unbiased assumption to explain such a disproportionate incidence, which in some areas is three to five times higher than the fraction of African American population, is that it should be related to behavioural and social factors, rather than to biological ones. The most frequently whispered theory is that African Americans are more exposed to COVID-19 because they are more frequently employed in service works. This explanation is indeed reasonable, since service workers normally have hundreds of face-to-face interactions during a day. Indeed, some recent studies have estimated that the switching to remote-working was mainly available to people employed in non-essential services, and amounted to 22%-25% of the work force before April [37] . As expected, service workers are one of those categories to which the option to switching to remote-working during the lock-down was not available at all, especially in sectors deemed vital for the functioning of a country during lock-down, including food production and retailers, healthcare, transportation, and logistics. According to the US Labor Force Statistics [38], the occupations with the highest concentration of African Americans are indeed jobs characterised by face-to-face interaction, and most of them fall in the area of essential jobs: postal service sorters/processors (42%), nursing (37%), postal service clerks (35%), protective service workers (34%) and barbers (32%). It would not then come as a surprise to discover that one of the major early COVID-19 outbreaks happened in South Dakota, in a meat-processing plant, whose workers were mainly of African American background [39] .",

Indeed, before lock-downs are put in place, African Americans are found to be more exposed to the virus, mainly due to the structure of their daily commuting patterns. After lock-downs are enforced, instead, they are more likely to pass the virus over to other African Americans, as a result of the high levels of clustering and isolation of these communities measured in the adjacency graphs of census tracts, which are a more reliable proxy for faceto-face interactions when long-distance commuting is disrupted. In general, the states where African Americans are more exposed with respect to long-distance trips are also those where they are more clustered with respect to short-range mobility (the rank correlation between the two measures is 0.62, as shown in Supplementary Table I) .",

In this sense, it is quite interesting that the simple diffusion model we used here to quantify the presence of dynamic segregation, and the corresponding indices of clustering, exposure, and isolation, are able to unveil a relatively strong correlation between the structure of mobility in a metropolitan area and the excess incidence of COVID-19 infections and deaths in African Americans. Although the model we consider uses relatively small and coarsegrained information about a city -placement of census tracts, local ethnicity distribution, and commuting trips among them-the strong correlation between dynamic segregation and incidence gap allows to conclude that when it comes to predicting the exposure of a group to a non-airborne virus, knowing the places where the members of that group commute for work is more important and more relevant than knowing where they actually live. This is also confirmed by the quite poor association of incidence gap with other classical measures of racial segregation (see Supplementary .",

Ethnic segregation is quantified here through random walks, and more precisely, class mean first passage times (CMFPT). Given a set of classes present in a city -ethnicities in this case-we are interested in the number of steps you need to reach one as a function of the ethnicity at the origin. Random walks start from each of the city cells -or tracts-and move until they have visited each of the distinct classes or ethnicities present in a city. If we average the passage times across all the city cells and then divide by the same quantity from the null model we obtain the normalised CMFPT between class \u03b1 and \u03b2 \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 . It is important to note that this matrix is not necessarily symmetric and depends on the spatial distribution of classes. We show in Supplementary Figure S-1 the CMFPT on the adjacency graph for four cities: Detroit, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles. On a first look, strong differences can be detected between those cities on the left and those on the right. The normalised CMFPT are substantially higher in Detroit and Chicago when compared to Houston and Los Angeles. Despite the difference in the maximum values, the shape of the matrix and curves is not so different across cities, with African Americans much more isolated than the rest of ethnicities. Reaching African Americans is much harder for any other class, while it is considerably low for other African Americans. As can be seen, there are not only strong differences between both cities but also between the type of network used (See Supplementary Figure S-2) . One significant change that appears in some cities when \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 is computed over the adjacency graph is that for African Americans, Whites are more easy to reach than themselves, which means that mobility plays a crucial role on approaching African Americans to the rest of the population and exposing them. Additionally, the normalised CMFPT seems to be less dependent on the ethnicity of the origin and more on the ethnicity of the destination. Likely as a consequence of the higher mixing produced by the long-range links present in the mobility network. Not only that, but the differences between each ethnicity are also reduced. Overall, to properly quantify segregation we need to take into account not only the residences but also how the ethnicities move in cities.",

For the sake of brevity, we focus here only on the data set used in the main manuscript as well as in the difference in the percentage of infections which is the case where correlations are higher. The set of indicators we have studied are the median household income, the percentage of the population below the poverty level, the percentage of insured and uninsured African Americans, the usage of public transportation by both African Americans and the overall population, the percentage of African American population in a state, the average commuting distance and the ratio between the average commuting distance of African Americans and the overall population. All of the metrics are provided at the level of the African American population and the results are shown in Supplementary Figure S-30 . The median household income, the percentage of the population below the poverty level, the percentage of insured and uninsured African Americans were obtained from the 2018 American Community Survey elaborated by the U.S. Census Bureau [34] . Most of the variables yield low or very low correlations except for the usage of public transportation by African Americans. Economic indicators such as median income or percentage of poverty seem to slightly correlate with the incidence of COVID-19, which could because because a more deprived African American community puts them in a more risky situation. Regarding the health indicators related to the degree of insurance of African Americans, it seems there is no direct relation with the number of infected. Not so surprising results since we are analysing the percentage of infected and, therefore, the fact of having insurance might not change significantly the risk of getting the illness. Finally, the usage of public transportation seems to play a crucial role in the spread of the disease, especially if we compare the use done by the African American population and the overall population where no correlation appears. The fact that African Americans use more public transportation might put them on a more dangerous position as well as might a reflection of their economic status. Moreover, it could happen that in those cities in which African Americans are more segregated they also have to use more the public transportation.",

We also computed on our commuting networks the average commuting distance of the African American population as well as the ratio with the commuting distance of the overall population. As displayed in Supplementary Figure S-31, the overall percentage of African American population seems to be related to the difference in the percentage of infected. However, there is a striking difference between the Pearson and the Spearman correlation coefficients, which means that the rank is more or less conserved yet there are strong outliers. In other words, a state with more percentage of African American population will more easily have a higher difference on the infected yet the population does not align the points in a straight trend. Regarding the mobility indicators, none of them yields a significant correlation, meaning that it is not so relevant how far African Americans travel and where they travel and whom they meet. ",
