Inclusive education has developed from a single-layered concept, focused on \"mainstreaming\" students with disabilities or \"special needs\" into regular schools (UNESCO 1994) , to a multi-layered concept which implies developing equitable quality education systems by removing barriers to the \"presence, participation and achievement of all students in education\" (Ainscow 2005, p. 119) . Presently, the United Nations defines inclusive education as \"access to and progress in high-quality education without discrimination\" (UN 2016, p. 3), which requires \"a process of systemic reform\u2026to provide all students of the relevant age range with an equitable and participatory learning experience and environment that best corresponds to their requirements and preferences\" (UN 2016, p. 4) .",

The first concept is access. Moving beyond the notion of presence proposed by Ainscow (2005) , which provided a first indicator of the level of \"mainstreaming\" in a specific context, access includes physical access but recognizes other potential sensory, intellectual, economic, and attitudinal barriers to education. For example, students with Portuguese as an additional language might be in a mainstream classroom, but if they have recently arrived in the country with little fluency in Portuguese, they might struggle to access education due to language or attitudinal barriers. Participation is the second key concept; it can relate to a student's frequency of attendance but also to the student's subjective perceptions of involvement and active engagement (Maxwell et al. 2012; Granlund 2013) . The third pillar of inclusive education is achievement, which must transcend traditional notions of academic achievement (grades in literacy and numeracy). In this sense, it should not only measure \"learner performance and achievement on standardised national or international tests\" (EAS-NIE 2017, p. 19 ) but also encompass the development of a \"deeper understanding of the world\" and of knowledge that persists after the completion of the schooling years, such as \"critical thinking, collaborative skills, creativity, independence and problemsolving ability\" (EASNIE 2017, p. 19) . Notions of achievement are thus related to the curriculum, and to what types and forms of knowledge are valued.",

The alignment of message systems might be easier at some levels than others. However, if these message systems send competing or conflicting messages to practitioners, it which makes it difficult to develop more inclusive education systems. For example, if schools are encouraged to be inclusive, but there is a prescriptive curriculum that does not allow teachers to adapt contents, pedagogical approaches, or assessment to different student characteristics and needs, then the resulting paradox can prevent genuine inclusiveness.",

Encouragingly, Portuguese policies make a strong attempt to create an inclusive education system, an effort which seems to be accepted by most stakeholders in terms of values. However, the challenges of implementation, especially a perceived lack of resources and the concern that sharing scarce resources amongst a larger group of students might disadvantage those who are the most vulnerable (e.g., disabled students with complex needs), creates an inextricable challenge for current Portuguese inclusive education policy and practice. In our article, we aim to examine this paradox. First, we discuss the key aspects of the present education policy framework. Then, drawing from available statistical data and media representations, we provide an overview of the main outcomes and debates around the development of inclusive education in Portugal. We conclude by revisiting the three pillars of inclusive education, to discuss the achievements and the challenges that remain in implementing inclusive education in Portugal.",

Many were transformed into \"Resource Centres for Inclusion\" and tasked with supporting their former students, who were placed in mainstream regular schools. More recently, following the ratification in Portugal of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this pathway was furthered with the Inclusive Education Act of 2018, Decree-Law 54/2018, which set up a new regime of inclusive education (see Alves 2019) .",

Thus, the methodological options underlying this decree-law are based on universal design for learning and a multilevel approach to access the curriculum. The tiered multilevel approach encompasses the implementation of three types of measures, identified in the legislation as: universal measures, targeted to all students in order \"to promote participation and improved learning\" (Decree-Law 54/2018, Art. 8); selective measures, aimed to fill the need for learning supports not addressed by universal measures; and additional measures, set in place \"to respond to intense and persistent communication, interaction, cognitive or learning difficulties that require specialised resources of support to learning and inclusion\" (Decree-Law 54/2018, Art. 10).",

Therefore, it views flexible curricular models, systematic monitoring of the effectiveness of the implemented interventions, and an ongoing dialogue between teachers and parents or other caregivers as \"the educational responses necessary for each student to acquire a common base of competences, valuing their potential and interests\" (Decree-Law 54/2018, Introduction). This approach is similar to the Response to Intervention approach used in the USA in its attempt to \"eschew categorisation\" (Liasidou 2015, p. 70) , which, as discussed by Ferri and Ashby, does not necessarily result in more inclusion. Instead, it often translates in practice to \"Tier 1 as the general classroom, Tier 2 as small group instruction, and Tier 3 as one-on-one instruction\" (Ferri and Ashby 2017, p. 26) .",

Nevertheless, in order to make schools accountable for all students, the law stipulates the use of Individual Education Plans (IEPs). Even though the responsibility for coordinating the IEP process falls on the mainstream teacher, there are considerable limitations of using IEPs, which often accumulate a number of roles and become bureaucratic instruments rather than educational ones (Millward et al. 2002; Alves 2017) . Among the changes introduced to support the education of students with disabilities, the new decree-law creates Learning Support Centres that replace the former Specialised Units. Defined as \"dynamic, plural spaces, which assemble both human and material resources\" (Decree-Law 54/2018, Introduction), these centres will work with students with disabilities and teachers to support inclusion and promote learning.

If we consider the three pillars of inclusion, this definition omits the notion of success or achievement. Moreover, Anastasiou et al. (2020) point out that this definition conveys a \"spirit of sameness\" which may indeed put at risk the chances of all students with disabilities to get the quality education they are entitled to, and in particular regarding students with learning difficulties. The present policies leave a wide space for the processes of \"social, cultural and emotional construction and interpretation\" of policy (Maguire et al. 2015, p. 486) , which are part of any process of policy enactment. While recognising that inclusion must be a principle of any quality education system, the lack of clarity regarding the processes may be providing the flexibility Priestley and colleagues conclude that is needed to change the \"social practices of teaching\", but these changes require \"teacher agency\" (Priestley et al. 2012, p. 211) . However, in a global context marked by \"competitive school cultures in neoliberal, marketised, school systems\" (Walton 2018) , the imprecision regarding the processes of implementing inclusive education may in fact compromise educational success in some schools with lower commitment to the success of all pupils.",

The amendment brought about greater power to parents and caregivers, who are now recognised as \"variable members of the multidisciplinary teams\" (Law 116/2019, Art. 4a) and entitled to participate in the elaboration and evaluation of technical-pedagogical reports, in addition to the IEPs as the previous decree-law already allowed. On the other hand, schools (through their interdisciplinary teams) are now required to define indicators to assess the efficacy of the measures implemented (Law 116/2019, Art. 5). Additionally, the government took on the responsibility to develop \"within 90 days\" the statistical indicators for evaluating its inclusive education policy (Law 116/2019, Art. 33.7). As of today, a policy defining this system of evaluation is yet to be adopted. Additionally, the government is required to ensure the necessary means so that education staff in public schools can access free specific training to support inclusion and learning (Law 116/2019, Art. 27). These are examples of the complex process of policy enactment which Maguire et al. (2015, p. 485 ) have described as being a \"jumbled, sometimes ambiguous, messy process that is experienced on the ground by policy actors\".",

Portugal is a country with beautiful laws, good specialists and professionals who are solidary and able to improvise, so we have reached unprecedented results in special education in Portugal. In 2017/2018, students with special educational needs represented 7% of the public school population. Schools changed to accommodate these students and nothing else was expected. Specialist cluster schools were created for students with specific disabilities: hearing and visual impairments, autism and profound and multiple disabilities. Our situation is unique and inclusion in public schools nowadays covers most children and youth with disabilities. (Soares 2018, p. 2) This quote suggests not only an increase in the access to mainstream schools but also changes to the educational system to realise the participation of students with disabilities. However, the present policy framework encompasses a wider target population, not only students with disabilities. This perspective is reflected in the media, which also reported that the policy has broadened its scope to all students-not only those with permanent needs-and that the change was praised by parents, teachers, and specialists (Silva 2017) . In 2019, another nationwide daily newspaper, Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias, based on the data collected through the FNE's questionnaire, reported that many teachers agree with the change of approach in the new policy from \"only students with SEN\" to \"all students\" (Reis 2019).",

However, the variation in the enactment of policy is well documented in the literature: policies are always enacted in specific ways in each context, depending on \"situated contexts (e.g., local school histories and intakes), professional cultures (e.g., values, teacher commitments and experiences and \"policy management\" in schools), material contexts (e.g., staffing, budgets, buildings, technology, infrastructure), external contexts (e.g., degree and quality of LA support; pressures and expectations from broader policy context, such as [\u2026] league table positions, legal requirements and responsibilities)\" (Ball et al. 2012, p. 21) .",

For a true inclusion we need resources, and that cannot be achieved when we expect to use only resources already existing at school level\". David Rodrigues, representing a national organisation of special education teachers (Pr\u00f3-Inclus\u00e3o), similarly noted that without resources, the implementation of the policy would be uncertain. And finally, Luisa Beltr\u00e3o, from an organisation of parents of children and young people with disabilities (Pais em Rede), stated that \"the proposal makes sense, but we need to be realistic. The policy hasn't been adopted in most schools. There isn't a single school in Portugal that we consider inclusive. So having a policy which is even more demanding applied to a system which wasn't able to do basic things and continues to exclude these children is problematic\" (Silva 2017) .",

This could be linked to the process of schools having to file a request with the Ministry of Education when additional resources are required, which might delay the response even when the resources are made available. Research from Scotland reported competing discourses between children's desires (e.g., to be seated beside their friends) and teacher's perspectives (need for extra support), emphasising the need to engage with student voices when assessing a system's achievements and needs (Allan 2008) .",

While smaller class sizes might benefit all students and teachers, students with complex needs represent less than 0.8% of the entire school population, and if they spend most of their time outside the mainstream classroom, there is little justification for reducing the number of students in their mainstream classes.",

Perhaps this more positive approach from school leadership teams could be related to closer communication with the Ministry of Education, as it has been stated that \"the Ministry of Education meets headteachers every 3 months since the new policy was published in order to clarify concepts in the first year\" (Viana 2019b) . The attempt to keep communication channels open seems to be a priority in this process of policy change: for example, a parliamentary public hearing was organised 5 months after the new policy came into effect in schools, featuring over 200 participants. Researcher Marisa Carvalho (2019) reported in the media that based on a study with 800 teachers, the main challenges were a lack of human and material resources, lack of teacher education, and organisational structures unfit for the purpose. Conversely, Carvalho (2019) noted that school leadership teams, when asked about the role of school leadership in inclusion, suggested that the focus should be on finding and developing solutions for their school in a collaborative, participative, and proactive way, rather than looking for the answer in policy or waiting for central guidelines.",

Rouse (2008) proposed that bypassing labels to access support, as proposed in the current legislation, requires practitioners to develop knowledge about inclusive pedagogy (Black-Hawkins and Florian 2012). Moreover, practitioners must \"believe that they have the capacity to make a difference to children's lives\" (Rouse 2008, p. 14) and that developing inclusive education is \"not only a task for specialists working with special education needs students\" (Rouse 2008, p. 14) . Instead, it requires mainstream teachers to collaborate with others (including students, colleagues, other professionals, parents) with the aim of removing barriers to inclusion, and to use evidence to improve practice (Messiou 2019) . These aspects will only be achieved through a reorganisation of schools' time and spaces, to allow for collaborative approaches, as well as through initial teacher education and continuous professional development, which should involve opportunities to research barriers to inclusion and engage with pupil voices.",

            "text": "While foreseen in the new legislation, so far these goals have been difficult to achieve. This brings our attention back to the issue of policy enactment, and how \"policy practices are specific and contextualised. They are framed by the ethos and history of each school and by the positioning and personalities of the key policy actors involved\" (Braun et al. 2010, p. 558 ). In the Portuguese context there seems to be some resistance from a considerable number of former Special Education teachers regarding their new role, as well as dissatisfaction among teachers in general with the new requirements placed on them, mostly due to lack of resources and training. The change in paradigm for supporting students with additional needs has also been perceived by some as a disinvestment in education and a devaluation of Special Education Teachers, as expressed by parliamentarian Diana Ferreira. However, the variation between schools in policy enactment and in developing context-sensitive and inclusive responses is clear, acknowledged, and even supported by the Ministry of Education, through the existence of \"lighthouse\" schools. Similar findings were reported earlier (Darling-Hammond 2017, p. 305), albeit with a different focus.",

This has allowed us, on one hand, to realise the multiple roles of school, including a welfare aspect: schools are important institutions for students from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g., free school meals). The move to distance education has also opened new channels of communication with learners (e.g., #estudoemcasa-a study-at-home television programme developed by the Ministry of Education). However, this situation has also revealed some accessibility challenges: certain students were \"left behind\" or excluded due to lack technology access or activities that are not appropriate for students with certain disabilities. Perhaps more to the point, it has shown that relationships are at the core of teaching, underscoring the challenge of creating and maintaining online relationships between teachers and students, especially students with severe and complex needs. Overall, the present situation has brought to the surface the challenge of reducing barriers to and reducing inequalities in education. It is also a strong illustration of the fragility of inclusive education and the need for a secure commitment to equity, dedicated to the right to education of all children. In closing, the main justification for developing inclusive education systems is to realise the basic human right to education of all children and young people, which will only be achieved through a continuing commitment to promoting the access, participation, and success of all students.",
