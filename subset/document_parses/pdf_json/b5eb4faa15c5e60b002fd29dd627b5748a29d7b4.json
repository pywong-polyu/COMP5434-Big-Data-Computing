It maintains epithelial barrier integrity by restoring tight junctions, gap junctions, and adherens junctions [2] . In addition to this, Vitamin D enhances innate immunity by increasing the production of Antimicrobial Peptides such as cathelicidin (LL-37) in respiratory epithelial cells which has the ability to disrupt bacterial membranes via electrostatic interactions [3] . It also induces cellular immunity by increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha and interferon-gamma. This prevents the generation of cytokine storm which is the underlying mechanism of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Moreover it also affects the adaptive immunity by decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during both TH1 and TH2 response and suppresses the pro-inflammatory Th17 cells. In addition to this, it binds to the non-coding region of FoxP3 increasing the production of regulatory Treg cells and IL-10, thus reducing inflammation.",

This can be attributed to less sunlight exposure in countries in northern latitudes predisposing them to higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, since vitamin D deficiency increases with age, older population is likely to suffer from severe ARDs due to SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that while the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is 1.4%, it is much higher in patients with pre-existing co morbidities such as Cardiovascular disease (13.2%), Diabetes (9.2%), Hypertension (8.4%), Respiratory disease (8.0) [5] .
