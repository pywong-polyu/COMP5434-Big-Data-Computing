            "text": "About 56 percent of the world's population lives in urban environments. In more economically developed countries, this percentage is considerably higher. Increasingly, cities' more vulnerable and culturally diverse neighbourhoods are the context of violent conflicts linked to interconnected socio-economic (inequality), ethnocultural (discrimination) and public-institutional (delegitimation) causal factors. Social outbursts such as London (2011) or Husby's (Stockholm, 2013) riots are amongst the most notorious recent examples of these. Both the frequency and intensity of these conflicts are only expected to worsen as the economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic takes hold. This article introduces the 'Theory of Rupture Frames (TRF)', which offers a new three-dimensional explanatory model of violent conflicts in vulnerable neighbourhoods with high socio-cultural diversity. The 'TRF', it is argued, offers a novel and suitable framework for founding and guiding social work's preventative and healing-oriented interventions facing these. This is in relation to the TRF's dual potential for (i) contributing to the theoretical understanding in the social work profession of this type of conflict and for (ii) offering a tool for guiding the assessment of needs and strategic planning of social work-led actions in the context of the neighbourhoods affected by the conflicts or at risk of their outburst.",

Their positive or negative outcomes, however, will depend on how these are managed, and, ultimately, on the results for the parties involved.

More recently, the ECRI (2020, p. 7) has highlighted a concerning growing trend of 'xenophobic populism' in Europe (amongst other forms of racism and discrimination). This coincides at a global level with the call for the need 'to combat the glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and related intolerance' made by the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary racism, Ms E. Tendayi Achiume (OHCHR, 2020). The battle against racism and xenophobia in countries with a longer migratory tradition, such as the USA, has not ended either. In the USA, despite the renewed political landscape after the results of the 2020 presidential election, the sparks of conflict fanned by outgoing president Donald Trump's racist speech and the legislative measures adopted by his Executive since 2017 will prove challenging to undo. This situation is replicated across Europe (and other countries worldwide), where Trump's counterpart right-wing nationalist politicians are gaining influence and, increasingly, reaching power (BBC, 2019).",

These situations will lead to a global increase in unemployment, lower wages, lower income and consumption levels, as well as to a chronification of inequalities, which will result in increased social problems (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2010) and will maintain social instability.",

Conflict's destructive potential is materialised in the different faces of violence (direct, structural and cultural), which can be understood as signals of deeper underlying conflicts; 'if violence is the smoke, then conflict it is the fire' (Galtung and Webel, 2007, p. 18 ).",

An emphasis on 'grievance': one of the parties feels aggrieved compared with the other. The offence may relate to ethnocultural, socio-economic or public-institutional aspects. Likewise, Vinyamata (2001) notes two necessary conditions for conflicts to emerge: (i) experiences of physical or psychological pain and (ii) a causal projection with respect to the other party. We add a 'lack of acceptance' of the situation-a manifest disagreement with the parties' relationship-by those affected as a trigger for the conflict.

In other words, urban vulnerability results from a lack of appropriate action of public administrations to stop the degradation of these areas; from this approach, the state has a key role in granting all citizens equal access to housing, health, education and employment.

However, to achieve these effects, contact must not be superficial, and it needs to meet some essential conditions, as proposed by Allport (1954) : (i) institutional and social support for integration; (ii) high relationship potential; (iii) equal status of participants; and (iv) intergroup co-operation. Subsequent studies have added other optimal conditions, such as (v) pleasant communication and (iv) the opportunity to establish long-term relationships (Amir, 1994) or (vii) a willingness to start lasting friendships (Pettigrew, 1998) .

The strength of the political component will depend on the political response to claims for redistribution, recognition or representation of those involved. Thus, the political component is very high when conflicts arise, but the inattention of political demand leads to a decrease in this political component and an increase in the violent one (materialised in a wide-ranging repertoire of explicit violent actions), until a point is reached where conflicts turn into episodes of widespread uncontrolled violence. Figure 2 maps the outcomes of the evolving relationship between these two variables. However, it needs to be noted that conflicts may progress throughout the different levels in less linear ways, depending on aspects, such as the specific political responses, time lapses, specific violent events, involvement of different stakeholders, etc., although uncontrolled conflicts are always preceded by unattended political demands according to the TRF.",

This indicated a clear knowledge gap in relation to the topic. However, this knowledge gap does not imply that social work lacks a track record of theory and intervention relevant to this field. As we discuss next, social work professionals have carried out functions and developed and applied intervention techniques for the prevention and management of conflict situations that arise in the various areas of daily life, such as family relationships, participation in the community or conflicts in the workplace (Munuera, 2013) . And there is a growing body of literature on social work practice in contexts marked by state violence/oppression, or by socio-political, interracial or inter-cultural conflicts (e.g. Howard, 2017; Campbell et al., 2019) . In addition, several multi-layered models for social work analysis and intervention aiming to redress social injustice and oppression at the different levels of society have been developed. Amongst the most influential of these models are Dominelli's work on anti-oppressive social work theory and practice (Dominelli, 2002) and social work under globalisation (Dominelli, 2010) and Thompson's (1992) 'Personal, Cultural, Structural (PCS)' model for anti-oppressive social work practice. More recent work by authors, such as Cocker and Hafford-Letchfield (2014) , offers renewed insights into the multiplicity and intersectionality of social work service users' experiences of oppression and highlights the importance of self-awareness and the use of self in anti-oppressive practice. Hence, we acknowledge, the TRF's holistic and three-dimensional understanding of social problems is not wholly new in social work, with some aspects of anti-oppressive social work practice models (notably Thompson's PCS) resonating closely with this.",

Facing social conflicts in these neighbourhoods, it becomes fundamental that public and professional responses to these are founded in an in-depth holistic understanding of the conflicts and promote early and appropriate interventions to prevent their destructive potential, taking in turn advantage of conflicts' potential to guide needed redistributions of power and an improvement of life in society, towards greater social justice. Social work, we believe and have argued, has an important part to play in this and the 'TRF' offers a measured, inclusive avenue from which to engage with conflict, its causes and being part of the solution.",
