            "text": "The development and dissemination of new technologies has brought forward a rise in flexible work arrangements, such as mobile work. In the literature, mobile work has mostly been discussed from a microergonomic perspective, considering detachment, stress, strain, and life-domain balance. However, the macroergonomic or institutional perspectives have often been neglected, although for occupational health and safety (OHS) management, as well as occupational health and safety systems, many questions remain unanswered. Therefore, in the present paper, information and communication technologies (ICT)-enabled mobile work is described taking into account institutional and regulative, as well as company-related, requirements. As the literature-based analysis was able to show, existing regulations cover many aspects of mobile work arrangements but also offer starting points for a more concrete protection of mobile workers. Furthermore, there are challenges regarding the enforcement of regulation. In this regard, new technologies might offer the chance to improve the interactions between institutional and company-related occupational health and safety systems. Additionally, 278 co-funded research projects in Germany were categorized, yielding 18 projects on new ways of work, of which another eleven projects addressed different aspects of mobile work. The project analysis revealed that current research focuses on tools and strategies for designing communication and cooperation. In conclusion, the examination of research trends can be used to generate new knowledge for better OHS management and effective OHS systems.",

For industry 4.0, the central technology is not the computer but the internet. Along with worldwide networking across company or country borders, the digitization of production is taking on a new quality that triggers and enables new forms of work organization [1] . For many employees, this means being able to work more detached from physical workplaces. Especially jobs in the service industry or highly qualified jobs are being transferred off the worksite, an evolving trend [2] that very recently has been reinforced by the spread of the Coronavirus. About 70% of HR managers from almost 500 companies indicated in a survey that their \"office workers\" worked at least partially from home [3] . According to a survey initiated by Eurofound, 36 .9% of respondents from Germany reported that they started to work from home as a result of the situation, while only 16.7% of respondents indicated to have already worked from home before the outbreak [4] .",

Furthermore, we will present a new approach to identifying what knowledge is available and needed to provide an effective means of protection. Therefore, the paper firstly describes the development of a framework for OHS, as well as the methodological approach used for the project analysis. Following this, the current regulations regarding mobile work from an institutional and company-level point of view are described based on the framework, and the results of the qualitative analysis of research projects conducted in Germany are presented in order to deduce approaches for the design of mobile work with regards to health and safety. Both aspects are jointly discussed, and recommendations for the design of OSH systems are proposed.",

The social accident insurance institutions-organized according to industriesenact and implement accident prevention regulations (Unfallverh\u00fctungsvorschriften). Another task of accident insurance institutions is rehabilitation and compensation, as well as advising employees and employers on work-related risks [28] .",

As the results from a qualitative study show, in traditional work arrangements, institutional OHS agents found their way into businesses, even if it was challenging. With increasingly flexible work arrangements, the problem of access is amplified, and knowledge about labor practices gets lost. OHS actors such as inspectors need to find new ways to get access to employees [6] . During inspections, OHS inspectors should be informed about the number of employees working from workplaces other than the business premises. It is doubted that current modes of inspection are able to provide the necessary level of protection, since new risks often cannot be detected by the examination of records or inspection of single workplaces [29] . As most OHS inspectors have acquired additional skills on psychosocial demands and risk assessment [30] , an expansion of training in order to capture flexible work arrangements and to gain a shared understanding seems promising.",

The EdA project worked on questions of empowerment in a digitized world of work shaped by increasing agility. An important aspect taken into consideration referred to worker participation and the understanding that employee representation can be a stabilizing factor for increasingly flexible work [55] . Although ReProNa mainly deals with project work, the tool for reflexive learning that is being developed can also be seen as a way to establish sustainable structures for organizational learning. As stated in the projects' objectives, lessons learned are supposed to be used to counteract the obstacles of project work, such as problematic team structures, resource planning, or the dissatisfaction of employees [56] . In a similar vein, knowledge management in (virtual) teams can be a challenge. Therefore, WiViTe developed an IT framework and analyzed the organizational perspective [57] . In SANDRA, a smart assistant is supposed to be responsible for e-mail and phone call management on mobile phones in order to delay or block messages and adapt availability settings in leisure time by using natural language processing [58] . Thus, the smart assistant system is an organizational response to deal with increasing boundarylessness. In prentimo, the risk assessment methods were adapted to mobile work, thus representing the organizational level by referring to the employers' responsibility to adequately assess threats to employees' health and safety. Success factors for the risk assessments of mobile work included, among others, early information of employees and the applicability on mobile devices [59] . Furthermore, in diGAP, it was pointed out that framework conditions regarding structures, roles, equipment, and qualification must be met for agile and trans-local teams. Company agreements are another instrument that might support healthy agile work [60] . ",

ReProNa, WiViTe, and SANDRA can also be understood in terms of the social level, since they provide important information for teamwork if all or some team members are working mobile. Focusing on agile work, the project diGAP recommended for health-oriented agile project work to strengthen the self-organization of the team, e.g., by providing adequate resources [60] . diGAP also addressed the challenge of using agile methods not as a locally organized (office-based) form of work but, rather, in trans-local teams. It was found that, consequently, both process-and subject-relatedness between team members decreased. Proposed strategies to deal with this challenge referred to socializing events, joint kick-offs, distributed roles, and the usage of chat groups. Especially the latter might be seen as a way of trying to reproduce a local room digitally [61] . Comparably, case studies conducted within the project CollaboTeam showed that digital, collaborative applications have a potential for reducing the corrosive effects of distance. Enterprise Social Media seems promising for low-threshold communication-provided by the firm, the usage of nonprofessional and potentially insecure products can be avoided [62] . However, as proposed in vLead, a team mental model on media-including a shared understanding of media characteristics, media use, and the respective rules of conduct-might support task-, team-, and time-related team mental models [63] . Similarly, praevierull recommended the requirement to establish rules on communication and media use. Regarding mobile work and distributed teams, an important part of leaders' roles will be to guide the connection and interaction between team members and experts, as well as to provide an overview and process-related knowledge [64, 65] . Leadership plays an important role for mobile work and also relates to the social level. In this regard, the objective of the project teamIn was to use artificial intelligence (AI) as a means to support leaders in organizational tasks such as personnel planning in order to enable more time for leadership functions such as motivating [66] . The development of qualification modules for conversational leadership in socio-digital systems was targeted by eLLa4.0 [67] .",

Therefore, competences regarding technology use and social-communicative competences are gaining importance [64] . As time schedules in mobile work arrangements become less predictable, SANDRA can also be seen as a project referring to the individual level of the company, since the assistance system contributes to individual availability management. The project prentimo analyzed mobile work in various facets (including service technicians, as well as IT consultants), including an individual point of view. Examining different occupations and forms of mobility, certain characteristics were found to be similarly demanding, including time pressure, limited social support, and recreational possibilities across the respective occupations [59] . In conclusion, the projects analyzed addressed different aspects of mobile work. The social level prevailed but was intricately linked to the organizational and individual levels.",

The examined line of research is interdisciplinary and encompasses strong efforts to include psychosocial, ethical, or legal issues into the analysis.

Generally, it can be assumed that an expansion of regulation could contribute to a higher level of protection [49] .

This problem is exacerbated by a continuous downscaling of OHS inspectors during the last years [69] . Additionally, thus far, the use of technical equipment in inspectorates is limited [70] . However, reports of positive experiences concerning e-government functions or the provision of risk assessment tools have been described [71] . Increased ICT use or the use of new technologies such as AI have also been suggested to be related to potential benefits, such as savings and the increased effectiveness of inspections and enforcements, although implementation costs should not be underrated [71, 72] . In the project analysis, there were no projects focusing specifically on institutional OHS, which can be explained by the funding program chosen for the analysis. Nevertheless, technological approaches such as platform-enabled interconnections might offer starting points for collaboration and communication between institutional OHS agents and companies, although rigorous requirements on data protection must be fulfilled. In a similar vein, using digital tools such as augmented or virtual reality for OHS planning [73] could also facilitate cooperation between organizational and institutional agents.",

In this regard, conducting adequate risk assessments is a major obligation, which is highlighted by the results on psychosocial demands related to mobile work. The project analysis was able to show that research on risk assessment methods specifically designed for mobile work is being conducted. However, there is a general lack of compliance related to the implementation of risk assessments in companies [10] . A possible reason why companies refrain from conducting risk assessments is a rather physical understanding of the risk factors and the alleged absence of such [74] . However, there is a gap between the use of digital technologies and the consideration of their possible health-related impacts on workers, as findings from a survey on new and emerging risks in enterprises indicates [9] . In the light of cautious findings on a positive relation between technostress and decreased mental health [75, 76] , psychosocial risk assessments are an important means of occupational prevention. Therefore, raising awareness for the impact of work equipment and work organization on OHS in a psychosocial and physical understanding already is, and will be remaining, a challenge. Furthermore, knowledge management plays an important role on a company level. While the projects examined put emphasis on a content-and task-related focus, OHS-related aspects could also be addressed, such as instructions and support for the implementation of mobile work or workstation design. As a study on telework indicated, almost 60% of participants did not receive advice or training on the installation of home-based equipment [43] . In this regard, digital tools might prove to be helpful in order to implement a participatory approach to ergonomics. Digital tools for cooperation and availability management were also addressed in the projects. Especially the latter is gaining importance, since mobile workers (telework and home office) were found to indicate longer working hours and more overtime [15, 49] . Compulsory rest periods of eleven hours between the end of a working day and the start of new one are more often neglected than indicated by employees not working from home [15] .",

Thus, tools for collaboration, as well as adequate ICT equipment, are essential. However, outside of telework agreements, employees often have to rely on their private ICT, which is a grey area not only in terms of product safety but, also, in terms of information security. The latter might be limited if employees are forced to fall back onto less professional options. The company-driven provision of ICT for mobile work should offer advantages regarding product safety and information security. In sum, interventions, such as the implementation of new technologies or new ways of work organization, cannot only be considered in isolation but cover the entire company [77] and should, therefore, be carefully monitored.",

Regarding the institutional level, to this date, the use of new technologies is limited in German labor inspectorates. Therefore, future research should address labor inspector's demands and needs regarding technologies supporting their tasks (e.g., using mobile devices, AI, and digital access of company data). At the same time, inspector's technology acceptance and technostress should be investigated, as both play an important role for successful implementation on an institutional level. Furthermore, efforts for improving the interplay between organizational and institutional agents (e.g., using platforms), as well as their backflow of information, should be made in order to gain a better understanding of the task and function design.",

However, experiences of the current situation are helpful in order to define the processes and structures necessary for OHS-appropriate mobile work arrangements in the long term.

However, a higher level of protection could be achieved by explicitly considering mobile work in the regulations. From the point of view of the institutional OHS system, mobile work poses a particular challenge for policy and agents. Answers to the question of what an appropriate enforcement of rules looks like must be found. From the point of view of the companies, however, clearer guidelines can be helpful. On the company level, new technologies and flexible work arrangements inherit a new quality of demands for employees, as well as challenges for corporate occupational health and safety actors, but they also hold the potential to be turned into new solutions. All in all, several challenges for occupational and institutional OHS systems to be prepared for a more mobile and digitized world of work remain. Nevertheless, using the project analysis, we were able to show that the current research offers a lot of potential for solutions and can provide new knowledge for better occupational health safety management. Promisingly, various approaches are referring to technical solutions, as well as organizational, social, or individual considerations. New technologies have enabled employees to step out of the boundaries of the traditional office. However, now is the time to make use of new technologies to make this step a health-oriented one.",
