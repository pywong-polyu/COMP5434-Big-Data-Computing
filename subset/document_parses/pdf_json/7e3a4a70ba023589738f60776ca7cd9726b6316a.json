Methods to evaluate wastewater contamination and the efficacy of water remediation treatments generally focus on detection and enumeration of human enteric microorganisms including fecal coliform bacteria and enteric viruses as well other human fecal indicator viruses such as pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) [1] . However, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has also been employed for human pathogens in cases there was interest in the viral pathogens in wastewater itself rather than in the contamination of an environmental water source. The presence and/or levels of these organisms can help to monitor outbreak progression or, conversely, the dissemination of vaccines within a population. During the 2013 norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) outbreaks in Scandinavia, three unique HAV strains were detected, two of which were linked to clinical cases; NoV detection preceded clinical case occurrence by up to three weeks [2] . Throughout the Poliomyelitis epidemics of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, poliovirus (PV) serotypes I-III were monitored and compared to the poliovirus vaccines, live oral (OPV) or inactivated (IPV), Sabin-strains. In Japan, all three serotypes of PV were detected in human wastewater between 2010 and 2013 along with the OPV and IPV strains [3] . Likewise, a fourteen-year study was performed in Moscow, Russia, between 2004 and 2017 in which all three serotypes were detected in at least one of the 5450 human wastewater samples collected throughout that time [4] . These studies highlight the importance of wastewater surveillance and have been successfully implemented alongside clinical measures during the poliomyelitis vaccination transitional period as well as through Russia's National Poliomyelitis Eradication Program, established in 1996.",

            "text": "Although SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory viral pathogen, its genomic material has been detected in fecal material [5, 6] , and its presence in human wastewater may serve as an early indicator of viral shedding within communities. Coronaviruses and enteric pathogens or their indicator organisms vary considerably in structural features important for establishing experimental protocols for their recovery and quantification. Protocols for recovering virus from wastewater involve various filtration and concentration steps to separate virus from larger microorganisms and solids [1, 5] that could limit downstream detection of viral genomic material. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. The diameter of coronaviruses ranges from 60 to 220 nm [7] , with SARS-CoV-2 ranging in size from 60 to 140 nm in diameter [8] . The closely related SARS-CoV-1 is spherical or ellipsoidal in shape, with an average diameter of 80 to 90 nm [9] . Regarding other microorganisms of interest in human wastewater, SARS-CoV-2 is smaller than the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli, which is approximately 1 \u00b5m (1000 nm), but larger than enteric viruses, norovirus [10] , and hepatitis A virus [11] , which are approximately 30 nm in diameter. Thus, current filtration testing protocols designed to recover enteric viruses from wastewater samples based on size-exclusion are applicable to recovery of SARS-CoV-2.",

The hydrophobicity of the viral envelope could impact viral recovery with potential for greater viral adherence to solids and greater susceptibility to degradation by solvents and detergents in wastewater as compared to nonenveloped viruses [7] . Prior studies demonstrated that concentration and filtration protocols involving PEG precipitation, acidic adsorption, and alkaline elution commonly used for enveloped viruses may have comparatively lower recovery rates for bovine, porcine, and murine coronaviruses [5, [12] [13] [14] [15] , whereas ultrafiltration improved coronavirus recovery [15] . Ultrafiltration with membranes of molecular weight cut offs of 1 to 100 kDa were previously demonstrated to remove enteric viruses from water [1] . A review of the limited data on coronavirus recovery from wastewater and environmental water concluded that robust methods are needed for concentrating coronaviruses and other enveloped viruses from large volumes of various types of water [5] .",

The method is based on size-exclusive filtration of wastewater through a hydrophilic, low-protein binding 0.22 \u00b5m polyethersulfone membrane to capture solids, protozoa, and most bacteria but allow passage of virus into the filtrate. This membrane filtration step is followed by viral capture and concentration with a 10 kDa molecular size-exclusion membrane via centrifugal ultrafiltration. Subsequent nucleic acid extraction, detection, and quantification through RT-qPCR molecular assay were performed and microbial concentrations per liter of wastewater were determined. The reliable and efficient quantification of SARS-CoV-2, among other organisms of concern, from wastewater provided by the adoption of this method allows for widespread and consistent monitoring of populations to be performed.",

Moreover, a single sample can be processed to target multiple organisms, and automated nucleic acid extraction techniques and disposable vacuum filter houses can be replaced with manual extraction and filter membranes in re-usable labware apparatuses. The adaptability of this protocol will allow it to be of continued use with Methods Protoc. 2021, 4, 32 3 of 9 the global infrastructure established through COVID-19 research after the conclusion of the pandemic.",

Wastewater was composited over 24-h-periods, collected, and transported to the Center for Environmental and Wastewater-based Epidemiological Research (CEWER) (University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA) for processing.

More than seven-hundred samples have been processed to date (August 2020-March 2021), with SARS-CoV-2 levels ranging between less than the LOQ to approximately 10 7 viral copies/L. Viral concentrations above the LOQ were analyzed by averaging the N1 and N2 detection data for replicates of each sample.

Results from this study of more than seven-hundred samples ranged from below the limit of quantification (10 4 copies/L) to greater than 10 7 copies/L. RT-qPCR data are relatively quantified, compared to digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assays which provide absolute quantification. This limitation is commonly experienced as ddPCR is a relatively new technology that is still limited in availability and requires additional method development for use with these types of samples. Care should be taken when comparing data across laboratories to ensure they are appropriately represented, and claims are justified. Additionally, in smaller populations the identification of new SARS-CoV-2 infections is complicated by the presence of recovering individuals within the population. Due to the limited data available at this time, the shedding rates of newly infected and recovered individuals and the timeframe of shedding remains unknown. Moreover, the impacts of population demographics including age, vaccination rates, and re-infection are unknown and may increase the complexity of data analysis as the pandemic progresses. Before the vaccinations and variant surges in Delaware began, the analyses of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations from large populations was performed using the baseline, established when case levels were low, and evaluating the increasing and decreasing trends. Greater fluctuation of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations observed in smaller populations means that adjustments for population size, wastewater flow rates, and housing and plumbing situations need to be implemented for greater understanding of the data. Moving forward, changes are expected in SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and the relationship with COVID-19 clinical cases as vaccination rates and variant strains of the virus develop. Adjustments to analyses will need to be considered as the data is evaluated.",
