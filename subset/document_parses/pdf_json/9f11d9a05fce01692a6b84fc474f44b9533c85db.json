However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined three independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cigs led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes. Specifically, chemokines including CCL20 and CXCL8 are upregulated in smokers, and CCL5 and CCR1 are upregulated in flavor/nicotine-containing e-cig users. We also found genes implicated in inflammasomes, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, NOD2, and ASC, to be upregulated in smokers and these e-cig users. Vaping flavor and nicotine-less e-cigs, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases.

In nicotine-less and flavor-less e-cig users, we observed only one cytokine, IFNA8, being slightly dysregulated ( Figure 2B ). However, we observed the dysregulation of six pro-inflammatory cytokines, including CCL5, CCL3, and CXCL3, and two anti-inflammatory cytokines in those who used nicotine/flavor-containing e-cigs ( Figure 2C ). CCL5 and CCL3 are both chemotactic cytokines that specifically attract T-cells and macrophages to the site of infection [36, 37] . CCL5 is also critical to inhibiting macrophages from undergoing apoptosis after the activation of adaptive immunity, potentially leading to prolonged inflammation [37] . CXCL3 is a chemokine released by macrophages and may indicate increased airway inflammation [38] . In total, we found 15 cytokines that were dysregulated when comparing between e-cig smokers, current and former tobacco smokers, and air controls ( Table 1 ). In summary, our data suggest that use of nicotine or flavor-containing e-cigs may lead to greater expression of inflammatory genes.

Inflammasomes are large protein structures primarily located in macrophages that respond to inflammatory signals, namely molecular patterns from pathogens. When activated, inflammasomes cleave pro-IL-1B and pro-IL18 into IL-1B and IL18, allowing them to signal the presence of pathogens to nearby cells and initiate the inflammatory response [39] . The discovery that IL-1B is upregulated by both smoking and COVID-19 suggests the possibility that inflammasomes are activated. We discovered that many key inflammasome genes and regulators besides IL-1B were upregulated in smokers vs. former smokers, including CXCL1 and CXCL2 (Figure 3) . These genes are all upregulated in smokers vs. former smokers. Both CXCL1 and CXCL2 promote the activation of inflammasomes [40, 41] . In the e-cig studies, we found that flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig users showed no markers of inflammasome activation (Figure 3) . However, users of nicotine/flavor-containing e-cigs also exhibited highly significant upregulation of inflammasome-related genes, including NOD2, CCL5, and ASC (also known as PYCARD) (Figure 3 ). ASC is one of the three main components of inflammasomes. NOD2 can directly bind to NLRP1 inflammasomes to upregulate IL-1B release [42] . CCL5 expression may be induced by inflammasome activation, as IL-1B has been shown to induce CCL5 expression in lower airway cells [43] . Our data thus suggest that smoking and nicotine or flavor-containing e-cigs, but not nicotine/flavor-less e-cigs, could upregulate inflammasomes and potentially exacerbate COVID-19-induced inflammation.

For SARS-CoV-2, host recognition is carried out by the spike protein on the surface of the viral envelope. The spike protein binds the ACE2 receptor protein in human cells. After this, the spike protein can be cleaved by the serine protease TMPRSS2 [49] . SARS-CoV uses a similar mechanism for host recognition, after which, fusion of the viral envelope with membranes in the host cell will allow the virus entry into the cell [50] . This process is vital for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human host cells, and therefore plays an integral role in COVID-19 infection and disease progression. Cigarette smoke was found in some studies to increase ACE2 expression in lungs in mammals [17, 51, 52] . We have previously found that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are upregulated in smokers using TCGA samples, although we did not examine e-cig users in that study, and the study focused on the association between ACE2 expression and the androgen pathway [24] .

Additionally, short-term e-cig exposure has been shown to induce changes to small airways in the lung and decreased levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) [57] . This latter decrease is associated with changes to inflammation and COPD development, two factors tied to COVID-19-related morbidity [58] . It is still controversial whether vaping definitively contributes to worse disease states for respiratory diseases [59, 60] .

Development of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in individuals not previously infected could indicate another variable controlling infection rate [61] . Epigenetic mechanisms have also been correlated to the ability of the virus to infiltrate the lungs and fuse with epithelial cell membranes. Specifically, syncytium formation by host cells facilitates viral endocytosis but is inhibited via CpG methylation that prevents transcriptional activity of the syncytin-1 protein [62, 63] . This mechanism has been studied further in SARS-CoV-2. These studies show that syncytium formation is significantly higher in this strain of coronavirus compared to other coronaviridiae, allowing for a high virulence factor due to higher endocytosis rates [64, 65] . Therefore, despite the lack of a correlation between vaping and ACE2 activity, it is possible that vaping may affect COVID-19 infections via an ACE2-independent mechanism. Indeed, vaping has been correlated to a loss of methylation and immune activation [66] . We investigated whether the ACE2-independent mechanism is cytokine dysregulation. Although our findings indicate that e-cigs without flavors and nicotine may only modestly dysregulate cytokine expression, we want to emphasize a cautionary note that most vapers use formulations that contain nicotine and flavorings.
