In the field of rheumatic diseases, HRQoL measures drive clinical decisions and add value to cost-utility analyses [10, 11] . Despite this, few rheumatologists use QoL measures in their clinical practices, even though surveys indicate that most perceive these measures as valuable [7, 12] . Previous models of outcomes for rheumatic conditions have a strong biomedical focus, having the implicit assumption that there is a linear relationship between disease processes and patient's QoL [8] . However, newer approaches to examining patient-reported outcomes acknowledge the roles of demographic, physiological, psychological, social, and environmental factors acting as buffers and triggers of poor outcomes [13, 14] . In such context, generic measures of QoL identify associations between physical conditions and mental health and highlight the need to address psychological functioning to ultimately acquire a comprehensive knowledge of individuals' QoL [8] .",

Engel's development of a biopsychosocial model of medicine heralded the emergence of the scientific application of psychosocial concepts in medicine, and led to medical research embracing the QoL concept as a legitimate avenue of study [3, 39] . In rheumatic diseases, measurement of the QoL-related constructs has become increasingly important in clinical research and bedside clinic [9] . QoL measures have moved from secondary to primary endpoints in clinical trials and are currently considered predictors of relevant outcomes such as death [9, 40] . Published clinical practice guidelines recommend routinely evaluating patients' QoL measures and using their assessment to modify and guide patient care [41] , which has led to medical interventions currently designed to improve QoL rather than prolong the life [42, 43] .",

The WHOQOL--BREF has good psychometric properties and is designed for a generic evaluation of four relevant dimensions of the QoL across many cultures; accordingly, it enables comparison with a wide range of diseases and conditions [44] . The WHOQOL-BREF encompasses a more significant number of domains that are integral to the assessment of the QoL. Notably, the social relationships and environment domains are not always included in other assessments; both domains/dimensions are crucial to assessing the overwhelming burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals, including those with chronic conditions [45, 46] . First, the study showed that all the dimensions and facets of the patients' QoL were compromised at patient's reincorporation to the outpatient clinic, particularly the physical health dimension, followed by the social relationship and environment dimensions. In contrast, the psychological health dimension showed a better score. In addition, the negative impact of HCI on the disease activity course of the underlying rheumatic disease, which has been reported by different groups, including ours [19, 23, 29] , extended to the different patient's QoL dimensions and facets, but the environment dimension. The potential consequences of rheumatic diseases are so pervasive that every QoL dimension can be affected and might have an additive effect on those derived from the COVID-19 pandemic [45, 46] . Meanwhile, the environment dimension might have been deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic itself and the virus containment measures [45, 46] , and the additional negative effect of HCI on the dimension might have been diluted.",

Patients from the former group were more worried and stressed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, although their level of mental wellbeing was not reduced (compared to 2018); authors assessed mental wellbeing with the Dutch version of the RAND 36-item Short Form health survey and described a similar percentage to ours of their patients self-referred being worried/very worried with the peak period of COVID-19 pandemic. The association found between a negative emotion (feeling confused) and QoL dimension scores deserves some comments. Feeling confused might be considered a normal reaction in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where \"infodemic\" has characterized social media information. However, in some (very) confused patients, confusion might become excessive and impact mental health [47] . People use emotion-regulation strategies more regularly when they perceive an event as highly stressful, such as the case of a pandemic, where it may serve as a survival strategy [48] . Nonetheless, there are several mechanisms through which emotion-regulation occurs, and the selection of these strategies is a complex and non-uniform process that might impact mental disorders and wellbeing [49] ; for example, the reappraisal of situations has been associated with positive emotion, general wellbeing and better interpersonal functioning, while suppressing them leads to more powerful negative emotions, worse social functioning and mental illness [50] .",

Guillemin et al [51] stated that disparities in care exist and affect people with chronic musculoskeletal conditions all around the world. Previous studies had also documented that people in society are exposed to inequity by demographic characteristics, societal factors, and living conditions, which determine to some degree the risk of disease, disability, and lower QoL; however, these factors are common to the general population, and therefore also apply to people with chronic rheumatic diseases, independently of other more specific factors [51] . Education has been traditionally described as a strong determinant of differences in health and to determine a remarkably homogeneous gradient of prevalence at the disadvantage of low educated people across age classes for many chronic diseases, in Europe [52] . In France, four social indicators have been identified, independent of age and gender, as determinants of HRQoL, including married or living with a common-law partner, the level of education, the occupational status, and the net household income [53] . Finally, access to subspecialty care (a surrogate for HCI) contributes to the known disparities in morbidity and mortality observed in some rheumatic diseases, while expediting the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatic diseases reduces disparities [54, 55] .",

We used the DASS21 to assess emotional comorbidity, which was not confirmed by a psychiatric interview; in addition, prevalence rates of depression and anxiety may be due to scale-specific case definition [64] ; also, HCI was selfreferred, and the outcome was not corroborated. RAPID-3 was used to assess disease activity/ severity among patients with a wide variety of rheumatic diagnoses, while the scale has been validated only in RA patients. We studied a limited number of factors associated with the QoL, while others like exercise and nutritional state [59] , previous COVID-19 vaccination [65] , and coping skills [66] were not assessed; also, our results might be influenced by the variable selection method used. The underlying rheumatic diagnosis has been shown to be an independent predictor of HRQoL, with inflammatory myopathies patients with early disease showing the most severe impairment in both physical and mental HRQoL [67] . Control over negative emotions was not assessed, while poor control over the negative (and positive) emotions, rather than emotions themselves, had been considered a significant risk factor for a broad range of psychopathologies [68] . We conceived the patient's QoL as an outcome, rather than a process, and the application of the WHOQOL-BREF was intended to screen and to monitor progress in individual patient care; different applications of QoL-related instruments need to be distinguished because instruments that work very well for one purpose need not necessarily be helpful when used in another context [69] . Finally, recent literature has discussed the difficulty in applying the biopsychosocial model to some clinical conditions and the need for a re-formulation [70, 71] .",
