Conclusion: Integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing is seen as a viable option that policymakers, health practitioners and IT technocrats need to seriously consider in mitigating the spread of coronavirus. Further research is also required on how best to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the utilisation of emerging technologies in contact tracing while observing the security and privacy of people in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused detrimental effects in many health systems globally [1] . The spread of COVID-19 overwhelmed health sectors globally and continue to affect all aspects of life including education, entertainment, businesses, tourism and manufacturing. As of August 12, 2020, there were 20, 542, 758 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 746,337 deaths and 13, 460, 643 recoveries [2] . COVID-19 is contagious and spreads rapidly from person-to-person, physical contact with infected objects [3] and aerosols transmission [4] among others. Some infected persons show symptoms while others are asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic. It is often difficult to detect COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals hence the need to keep registers of affected persons' contacts. World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on January 30, 2020, because of high COVID-19 transmission and death rates [5, 47] . With no approved vaccines, COVID-19 paralysed many health systems while governments implemented prevention and containment methods such as case management, surveillance, infection prevention and control. COVID-19 infection prevention and control strategies include maintaining physical distancing (individual and community), contact tracing social distancing, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce exposure, decontamination and disinfection of contaminated areas and objects using sanitizers, restrictions on travelling, closure of schools and universities [6] . Since there is no approved COVID-19 vaccine, health systems rely on case management which involves contact tracing, quarantine, selfisolation of infected and suspected individuals. The dynamic nature of people movements within their communities makes it difficult to achieve accurate contact tracing. This presents unprecedented opportunities for research activities, collaboration and integration of modern technologies to strengthen contact tracing efforts. Studies by Wang [7] Ting [8] , Vaishya [9] , Iyengar [10] , Vafea [11] , Mohd [12] and Elavarasan [13] shows that emerging technologies including 5G technology, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Internet of Medical Things, additive manufacturing, robotics and nanotechnologies can play a paramount role in tackling COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed at analyzing possible opportunities for incorporating emerging technologies to enhance COVID-19 contact tracing activities. Also, the study identified the challenges of integrating emerging technologies into contact tracing activities.",

Since COVID-19 symptoms are nonspecific, asymptomatic and sometimes undetected in many people, testing alone does not stop the spread but requires contact tracing to speed the discovery of an affected person's contacts to prevent further transmission. To effectively enhance contact tracing, the World Health Organization recommends a combination of measures such as rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of recently exposed close-contacts [15] . To prevent onward transmission, the person who tests positive for COVID-19 is either quarantined or self-isolated. After that, the person's close contacts are followed up and advised to go into precautionary selfisolation. This process is called contact tracing, and its purpose is to prevent possible transmission chains. Contact tracing as a control measure identifies exposed contact-persons that need 14 days of precautionary self-isolation [16] . A close contact or contact-person is a person who had face-to-face contact with an infected person or confirmed case [17] . Implementation of contact tracing activities requires collective efforts from the health workers, community, researchers, telecommunication companies and government authorities.",

However, Ahmed [18] highlighted that there have been instances when the infected person cannot remember his/her close contact-persons and does not have contact details of the contact-persons [18] . For example, the infected person might have had contact with unknown persons in the retail outlets which might be difficult to trace contacts. In cases like this, technology-based contact tracing applications can facilitate and automate the process, enabling contact tracers to inform users who a COVID-19 victim's contact persons are. This can be enabled by using global positioning system (GPS), Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology Bluetooth technology, Social graph, network-based API, mobile tracking data, card transaction data, and system physical address [15] .",

These countries use several devices communicating together through Bluetooth technology, Global Positioning System (GPS), wireless technology, mobile phone applications, wearable technology and sensors. For instance, Germany implemented a contact tracing application that executes on smartwatches and screens the user for COVID-19 using pulse, temperature, and sleep pattern [19] . The data from the contact tracing application is mapped to the country's interactive map for further analysis and allocation of resources. Singapore implemented a Bluetooth-based mobile phone application, TraceTogether to boost COVID-19 contact tracing efforts. TraceTogether mobile application works by pushing notifications and location permissions to devices in close-proximity as two meters apart and sharing information [20] . TraceTogether mobile application can store data for up to 21 days and transfer it to the national health information systems. More examples of contact tracing applications are depicted in Table 2 .",

The app is not yet rolled out nationwide, as some populace are monitored using digital travel permits. In the United States of America (USA) development of contact tracing apps is decentralized to states in collaboration with Apple and Google because of security and privacy issues [24] . Contact tracing apps in the USA are still at the pilot phase and not yet rolled out and connected to health systems [25] . With the growing number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, India launched the Aarogya Setu contact tracing app that uses mobile phones' Bluetooth and location data to track users [26] . India made it mandatory for government and employees to use the Aarogya Setu contact tracing app despite the security and privacy issues to boost contact tracing activities [26] . Instead of implementing contact tracing apps, Brazil adopted surveillance technology that uses geolocation tracking to minimize COVID-19 transmission chains [27] . Contact tracing is highly effective in the early control of COVID-19 but places a heavy burden on the health services because each case would require an average of 36 individuals to be traced.

Specifically, IoT-based contact tracing apps collect data for the entire population on real-time which further analyzed to map COVID-19 hotspots. Such data can include, ethnic information (race, clan, region), demographic details (gender, age, level of education, marital status) and socioeconomic status which can influence the allocation and distribution of COVID-19 resources and ultimately lead to discrimination and riotous [42] .",

The integration of contact tracing apps assumes that the whole population has access to modern technologies, yet the gap still exists between ICT access and utilisation amongst the population. For example, Jubie et al. [43] state that 51% of the world's population does not have internet access. This means that in some resources constrained areas, people do not have mobile phones, no or inconsistent electricity supply and access to network signal which makes the use of contact tracing apps threatened [44, 45] and inevitable consequence of fuelling health inequality amid COVID-19.",

These technologies have drawbacks, for example, the proximity of Bluetooth technology is very short which can be obstructed by buildings and walls hence affect its adoption rate. Also, Bluetooth technology consumes a lot of smartphone battery power. On the other hand, GPS technology is not secure and is vulnerable to spoofing attacks [43, 44] . With the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases and deaths especially in severely affected countries such as the United State of America, Brazil, India, Russia and South Africa [45, 46] , integration of emerging technology into contact tracing activities is inevitable. However, security [48] , privacy [51] , consent, health policy among other issues should be critically observed in the development of contact tracing apps and data sharing stage.",
