We describe the feasibility of a short-term (8-10 sessions) psychological crisis intervention (CI) protocol for children and adolescents aged 8-17 years (n = 30, mean \u00b1 standard deviation 12.9 \u00b1 2.4 years) who were referred to an outpatient mental health clinic due to suicidal ideation, aggression, severe anxiety, or extreme family conflict. The participants were assessed before and after the CI, and at a 3-6-months follow-up visit. The psychiatric assessments included clinical evaluation by a senior psychiatrist, and the completion of self-report questionnaires by both the participants and their parents. Following the establishment of the CI unit, the waiting lists for urgent cases were reduced from a median of 84 days in the two preceding years to 23 days in the following 3 years (H[2] = 18.5, p < 0.0001) for patients of the CI unit. A 1-year psychiatric follow-up after the end of the CI revealed that 72% did not require additional psychotherapy. The overall clinical evaluation measures (clinical evaluation, parents-report and child report) improved and had been preserved at the 3-6-months follow-up. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a short-term CI protocol for expediting admission to treatment for urgent psychiatric cases.",

            "text": "One of the main challenges faced by child and adolescent mental health systems is the limited resources of available psycho-social interventions [1, 2] . In recent years, the number of emergency department (ED) visits for psychiatric illness has been rising worldwide [1, 3, 4] . Part of this rise includes youths with common psychiatric crises, such as suicidal ideation, aggression, severe anxiety, or extreme family conflict, that are referred urgently to emergency departments (ED) or to psychiatric clinics, where they are invariably confronted by very long waiting-lists for intervention [5] . A \"mental health crisis\" is a broad term used to describe a variety of psychiatric and psychological conditions, and is defined as \"an acute disturbance of thought, mood, or behavior, that requires immediate intervention and the resources available to manage the situation are not available at the time and place of occurrence\" [6] . Community-based models have recently been described for the care of youth in mental health crisis that present to the ED [7] . Similar to the world trend, a rise in psychiatric emergencies, such as suicidal behaviors, presenting to pediatric EDs, is well documented in Israel [8] . However, community-based services are scarce. Since the reform in Israeli mental health services in 2015, all psychiatric services are now provided exclusively by Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). The majority of these services are provided in outpatient clinic settings that are overloaded. In case of psychiatric emergency patients are referred to EDs. At the Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital-Sheba Medical Center-Tel Hashomer, a tertiary pediatric hospital in Israel, the annual number of psychiatric emergencies presenting to the ED increased in recent years and now stands at about 350 cases annually. This increase has led to an overload of the psychiatric outpatient clinic at our hospital, with an average of a 6 months wait time to treatment overall, and about 4 months for urgent cases referred from the ED.",

The main objectives were to reduce waiting time for urgent treatment as well as to evaluate treatment dropout rates and the need for additional treatment during the first year following CI. We employed standard clinical assessments to measure clinical improvement. We hypothesized that a short (8-10 sessions) psychotherapeutic intervention will result in improvement of psychiatric symptoms that will be maintained at a 3-6-months follow-up, and that the instigation of this protocol will lead to a reduction in waiting time for therapy for urgent cases.",

We developed four brief intervention protocols based upon principles from well-established types of psychotherapy: 1) cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for adolescents with anxiety disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorder, and parent training based upon the Supportive parenting for anxious childhood emotions (SPACE) protocol for anxious children under 12 years; 2) CBT-suicide prevention for suicidality; 3) parents training for aggression, violent outbursts, or school refusal based upon non-violent resistance treatment; and 4) time-limited psychotherapy for adolescents based upon James Mann's time-limited psychotherapy principles for adolescents facing major life events leading to severe adjustment disorders [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . A multi-disciplinary team, consisting of a senior child psychiatrist, social workers and a psychologist, planned an 8-session intervention for each case after the initial psychiatric assessment. A focus for intervention was defined based on the information collected in the initial assessment, and the treatment protocol was selected accordingly. The focus of intervention was communicated to the patient and family in the first therapy session. In addition, psychiatric follow-up visits were scheduled as needed: in cases treated with pharmacotherapy and/or in cases with suicidal behaviors, psychiatric visits were scheduled in 2-4-week intervals. In other cases, psychiatric follow-up was conducted at the termination of the psychotherapeutic intervention, and in 3-months intervals thereafter.",

Post-hoc comparisons using Mann-Whitney test (corrected for multiple comparisons with FDR correction [21] ) revealed that the time on waiting list among CI patients was significantly shorter compared with the waiting list time of patients treated prior to the unit's establishment (during 2014-2015) (U = 854, p < 0.001) as well as the waiting list time of patients who declined CI treatment (U = 586.5, p = 0.005). The time on waiting list for patients who declined CI treatment was similar to that of patients treated prior to the CI unit establishment (U = 172.5, p = 0.64). The distribution of time on waiting list before and after the implementation of the CI unit is depicted in Fig. 2 .",

            "text": "As urgent pediatric mental health issues and subsequently pediatric ED visits for mental health problems are on the rise worldwide, healthcare systems struggle to meet the increasing demand for pediatric psychiatric services [1] . In many cases, pediatric psychiatric outpatient resources are limited and as a result, urgent cases face exceedingly long waiting lists for intervention, leaving children in acute crisis untreated for long periods of time. This phenomenon is becoming a real public health concern, leading to a rise in morbidity, increase in complexity and eventually requiring longer intervention and even more resources [1, 22] . Therefore, brief interventions aimed at stabilizing and reducing risk in these acute situations are crucial. The findings of this study demonstrate the feasibility and utility of a novel psychiatric CI model for children and adolescents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that offers short-term intervention for diverse common psychiatric emergencies in the setting of a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic. Our intervention integrated principles from wellestablished treatment protocols, and dramatically reduced the waitlist time for treatment of acute cases. Furthermore, dropout rates were low, and most of the patients (72%) did We also found significant improvement in the patients' symptoms that were mostly maintained at 3-6 months after CI treatment ended based upon clinician assessment, and parental and patient reports. In recent years, accumulating research in children and adolescents support the utilization of models of intervention during crisis that are implemented early and prevent the escalation of mental health issues through community-based approaches [23] . However, most of the recently published brief interventions are aimed at specific psychiatric emergencies, such as suicidality [8, 24] and trauma exposure [25, 26] . Others focus exclusively on youth in acute crisis and are not for younger children [27] . To the best of our knowledge our model is unique as it addresses a variety of common emergencies in children and adolescents and does not exclude complicated cases with psychiatric comorbidities.",

Specifically, CI principles of a family-focused, strength-based approach, are comprehensively incorporated starting at the first stage of the initial psychiatric assessment. Then, an effort is made to identify the principal problem, not only by inquiring about the precipitating event for the crisis (the proverbial ''last straw'') but also prioritizing problems in terms of which to work on in the short intervention offered. After the focus of the intervention is defined, a suitable protocol is selected, choosing essential and suitable tools according to the case formulation. For example, a case of severe violent outbursts in a 9-year-old diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In this child the major problem was defined as the violent outbursts which are secondary to his continuous demand for parents' cooperation with his obsessive rituals. Principles from the SPACE [10] intervention were implemented, with particular emphasis on minimizing parental accommodating behaviors and resisting his demands nonviolently.",

Hence, children with acute crises can be treated immediately with a short treatment that may prevent \"stepping up\" to treatments of higher intensity. Roberts et al. stated that \"Crisis intervention provides a challenge, an opportunity and a turning point within an individual's life\" [29] . We believe that when a family which is struggling with their child's acute crisis is offered immediate professional help, the motivation for treatment and the hope for change are high. In this time frame, it is possible that the therapeutic alliance, central in the success of a therapeutic intervention [30] , is built rapidly and perhaps assists in achieving treatment goals in such a short intervention. Therefore, we suggest that the relatively low drop-out rate seen in this study is related to the short interval between the crises and the initiation of treatment.",

Furthermore, not all cases referred to an initial evaluation were well documented and not all cases that had been treated in the CI unit were included in the final sample due to incomplete data. However, we feel that this setting still allows presenting a pragmatic model. In addition, it is possible that unmeasured characteristics affected individuals' willingness to comply with the treatment/experimental protocol, thereby biasing our results [31] . For example, patients who completed the treatment protocol may have been more motivated participants, who adhered more closely to the recommended treatment. Family disorganization may also be an artifact that affects dropout from treatment; children or parents who were not able to attend the treatment sessions on a regular basis were more likely to drop out, therefore, creating a survivorship bias.",
