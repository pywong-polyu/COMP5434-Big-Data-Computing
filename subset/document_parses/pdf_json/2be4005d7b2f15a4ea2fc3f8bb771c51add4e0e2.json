            "text": "The contribution of bacterial superinfection to outcomes of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is unclear. Autopsy studies from patients with pneumonia caused by other viral pathogens, most notably influenza, suggest that bacterial pneumonia contributes to the risk of death. 1, 2 These autopsy studies included a minority of the patients with severe viral pneumonia and were skewed toward patients with severe disease and late findings. Serum biomarkers to reliably exclude bacterial superinfection in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are lacking. As a result, the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) CAP guidelines recommend empirical antibiotic treatment for documented viral pneumonia despite weak evidence. 3 Other influential panels have also recommended empirical antibiotics for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, appropriate for the syndrome (CAP vs. Hospitalacquired pneumonia [HAP] ). 4, 5 Indeed, greater than 90% of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia receive antibiotics. 6 Insensitivity of culture-based diagnosis of concomitant bacterial CAP is the major cause for uncertainty regarding antibiotic management in severe viral pneumonia. Molecular tools significantly increase detection of respiratory pathogens 7-10 and have been used to safely discontinue antibiotics in patients with severe CAP requiring mechanical ventilation. 10 Samples collected by nasopharyngeal swab or endotracheal aspiration are inferior to sampling of the alveolar space by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for the detection of respiratory pathogens. [11] [12] [13] [14] However, concerns regarding the operator-safety of performing BAL in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have precluded its use in many centers. 15 Hence, the prevalence of initial bacterial superinfection and subsequent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are not known. 16, 17 Moreover, the spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility of superinfecting pathogens remains undefined.
