Despite these often debated and societally significant issues, we will focus here on a different perspective on vaccination which is largely neglected in the public debate: Vaccination can also be interpreted as a powerful means of Human Enhancement.",

It becomes evident that all of these approaches differ in important aspects like the means of enhancement and the desired end state. Whilst Buchanan [10] , Coeckelbergh [7] , and the President's Council on Bioethics [8] explicitly mention science and its application by technology, in particular, Daniels [11] , Allhoff et al. [12] , and Juengst [13] do not limit their definitions to specific means of application. Another demarcation point is the desired outcome and its realization. The question that arises here is whether the intervention must be successful to be considered Human Enhancement or whether the mere goal of improvement is sufficient. The general terms \"better, \" \"improvement, \" or \"enhancement\" always refer to an end state, not realized yet, which is always contrasted against the undesired status quo. Noteworthy is that the end state is often not fully defined except for the vague implicit reference of improvement.",

Buchanan [10] , Daniels [11] , and in some sense, the President's Council on Bioethics [8] suggest the normal abilities of a prototypical human being as the reference frame, while Buchanan [10] does not specify any specific threshold inside this functioning. However, the \"normal functioning\" approach is highly flawed due to the inability to clearly identify the defining features of what it means to be \"human\" or \"normal\" [15] [16] [17] . Lastly, Coeckelbergh [6, 7] does not mention any definitory restrictions regarding outcome parameters or a benchmark. Allhoff et al. [12] are very non-specific in their mention of general improvement in abilities or overall well-being. However, besides the quest for Allhoff et al. [12] Strictly speaking, \"human enhancement\" includes any activity by which we improve our bodies, minds, or abilities-things we do to enhance our well-being.",

Such challenges might be general physical or intellectual barriers, such as overcoming natural limits of our bodily capabilities or mental capacities.

The means by which this control over nature is commonly exercised is technology [7, [22] [23] [24] . But what is technology? Carroll [22] carried out a careful and comprehensive ethological analysis of the timeless essence of technology. She argued that any technology consists of three core aspects: the possession or ascription of a function (I.) related to a specifically designed or afterward identified purpose (II.) that will eventually lead to some sort of benefit (III.). Another important aspect is the ability to comprehend and appreciate the notion of technology, described as reflexivity. Accordingly, this ability is contingent on and carried out through these essential features [22] . Technology -according to Carroll -comprises anything identifiable by humans as having a specific function to fulfill a certain purpose that will lead to a beneficial outcome, whether or not material or simply knowledge-based. In other words, if it can be used to create a favorable outcome, it is technology, regardless of its origin and physical status. While the latter might sound controversial, it is essential to note that Carroll [22] emphasizes the role of creation and organization in the emergence of technology. However, she does claim that it is irrelevant if human beings themselves created this organization. The only uniquely human element is in the identification of the function and purpose.",

Hence, the creational process of identifying the relevant mechanism within the functional biological interplay of pathogen and immune response, exploiting and provoking it in order to fulfill the intended purpose, qualifies any application of vaccination as technology. In this sense, vaccinations are also technologies in the notion of Allenby and Sarewitz [23] : \"cause-and-effect machines, linking a human intent to a particular consequence via the embedded function of the technology\" (p. 36), with the function being the creation of individual immune protection.",

The purpose of enhancing a human capacity is the defining feature of any Human Enhancement technology. Concretely, the application of vaccination technology is about human adaptation to an environment hazardous to health.

This intervention is carried out through bio-technology, directly acting on the human body and its species-typical functioning. The latter part is important. If the human immune system responded adequately to the COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 infection, there would be no need for enhancement. Hence the \"normal functioning\" allows no conclusion about the adaptiveness of the same function in the face of different environmental threats. The human immune system may work completely inside its normal parameters but may be unable to neutralize a pathogen. There are, furthermore, serious difficulties in determining the \"normal\" or the \"human\" [15, 17] . Immune reactions to SARS-CoV-2 display a significant variability as severe medical conditions resulting from this disease depend heavily on age and pre-existing conditions [31, 32] . This means that the ability to mitigate the threat from this particular virus is not sufficiently distributed to eliminate its danger. That is, humans' normal capability to repel SARS-CoV-2 pathogens is in desperate need of enhancement. This improvement is realized by technology, here biotechnology. Vaccination teaches the human immune system about specific characteristics of the pathogenic agent. This strategy does build on already known mechanisms of the body and improves it by adding new capacities. In their approach, Allhoff et al. [12] differentiate enhancement technologies based on an internal-external distinction. Accordingly, only technology integrated inside our bodies would qualify as an enhancement. Needless to say, any vaccination must be applied inside the human body in some way, typically intra-muscularly, nasally, or by oral application.",

However, in order to cure or treat an adverse condition, this condition has to be present. Juengst [13] noted that any preventive measure is used with the same disease controlling intention as a treatment. Certainly, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is intended to control a disease, not only on the individual but also on a societal level. But ultimately importantly, this enhancement strategy is done a priori to a potential infection but not as a response to an actual infection. Thus, vaccination should not be categorized as an immediate treatment but as a general enhancement for the unfortunate case of needing such enhanced capabilities.",

Buchanan [10] names agriculture and literacy as examples, while Allhoff et al. [12] add a healthy diet to their definition of \"natural\" enhancements. With the first extensive vaccination campaign dating back to the transition between the 18th and 19th centuries, this technology is a product of human societies' increasing scientific and technological progress [34, 35] . But at what point does a technology cease to qualify as \"unconventional\" and changes to \"conventional\" or \"natural\"? Since conventional vaccination technology enables the human body itself to produce a successful immune response, this type of vaccination could easily be classified as natural, similar to strengthening one's immune system by having a balanced diet, getting more sleep, or eating vitamin-rich fruit. But such simplification would neglect the important public debate on people who are scared or at least concerned or skeptical about becoming vaccinated because they fear a variety of possible negative consequences [36] [37] [38] [39] .

This was impressively shown by recent news coverage of the German protest group \"Querdenker\" (\"Lateral Thinkers\"), who oppose not only public health measures but also reject vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 [46] . It was clearly evident that this group's arguments in their opposition to vaccination resembled familiar arguments in the general Human Enhancement debate. Protagonists stated that their rejection of vaccinations was grounded on their notion of a fundamental conflict between science and nature. They rejected the implicit notion that the human immune system was insufficient to deal with a natural threat and thus must be enhanced. Demonstrators feared that human nature was at stake. Other concerns were expressed regarding an alleged \"transhumanist agenda\" and the dangers of genetic monocultures. A survey of this protest movement's political attitudes showed that its supporters were largely convinced about the potential of our natural healing powers and a supposed divergance from nature [47] . Not only the metaphor of a monoculture but also the danger of transhumanism and the need for the preservation of human nature are arguments common to so-called bioconservatives [9, [48] [49] [50] . This group opposes Human Enhancement for various reasons beyond the scope of this paper. However, these ideological movements' superficial resemblance is an important observation and should be focused on in future research [51] .",

It is crucial not only to consider the direct effect on the individual human immune system but also proximal outcomes of various kinds [23] . Here, herd immunity or fewer infections, in general, may allow unvaccinated individuals to benefit from the widespread administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination as a so-called free rider. Strictly speaking, this enhancement-by-others or \"network effect\" [10] does not count as Human Enhancement, as there is no direct link between the enhancement technology and the free-riding individual. Yet, this emphasizes the importance of recognizing the different levels of effects of bio-technology and Human Enhancement. Under the notion of restored freedoms for vaccinated people, one could consider vaccinations as a \"positional good, \" meaning that its benefit results from unequal distribution and the fact of other people not having this enhancement [27] . However, as Buchanan [10] has discussed, due to the concept of herd immunity, vaccinations may result in one of the aforementioned \"network-effects, \" meaning that the more people are enhanced, the greater the positive outcome. If vaccination ends the pandemic, the application of technology to a majority of people has resulted in collective and group-related beneficial outcomes. But it is essential to recognize that any positive societal or economic effect due to mass vaccination is constituted by a bottom-up process, i.e., as many vaccinated individuals as possible. Hence, it is essential to consider the long-term perspective and moderate the restoration of freedoms to minimize social tensions among vaccinated and non-vaccinated people and simultaneously foster the emergence of network effects, i.e., by ensuring a high vaccination rate all around the globe.",

Vaccination can be a fruitful intervention here, yet besides its beneficial effects on individual health, it would also be a medical solution against social problems. This type of approach was warned against by Juengst [13] , who rejected the idea that biomedicine should intervene inside the realm of social policy. While Juengst [13] comprehensively discusses his approach's limitations, it becomes evident that medical issues and their accompanying social equivalents within a global pandemic are inseparable. Thus, vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 are not only a medical enhancement but also a social one.

Afterward, they had the opportunity to fill a free-text question, answering what types of Human Enhancement they were already using. Participants were then asked to state their attitude to a variety of human practices, i.e., genetic engineering of plants, animals, or humans, vaccinations, Human Enhancement, human interference with nature (dams, mining, etc.), and space colonization (Likert-scale, 1 -Strong rejection to 7 -Strong approval). We limited our analysis to the attitude on Human Enhancement and vaccinations. We intend to use the data for further analysis and share them on OSF. Lastly, participants answered if they were already vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 or were willing to do so and are generally concerned about keeping their vaccination status against other pathogens updated.

Yet, they are not viewed as much as prototypically cybernetic prostheses or cochlear implants. Out of the answers to the free text question on which examples of Human Enhancement participants already were using, only 3 out of 62 given examples mentioned vaccinations, even though this question was asked after the survey put vaccinations in a possible Human Enhancement context and the majority of participants stated a general engagement with at least some sorts of vaccinations (For comparison, \"Glasses\" were mentioned fifteen times). This suggests that even vaccinations are generally not perceived as Human Enhancement by people in their daily lives. Attitudes on Human Enhancement vaccinations, in general, did not correlate significantly. This may be because of the ethical complexity of these issues. Nevertheless, as we have shown, there are some similarities in the debate of these technologies. However, this does not mean that those who oppose vaccinations do so because they see it as a form of Human Enhancement. Yet, people who saw vaccinations as an example of Human Enhancement showed a more positive attitude to this phenomenon. This may be significant for promoting positive attitudes toward other/future forms of Human Enhancement, as this finding suggests that a widespread and useful example of Human Enhancement that is explicitly viewed as such may promote general attitudes toward these technologies. Our data provide a first empirical perspective on the public notion of vaccinations as Human Enhancement. The media extensively covered vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and its beneficial effects in mitigating the pandemic by applying modern biotechnology. This contextual effect may have shaped the evaluation of vaccinations, making its functional status as a form of Human Enhancement more salient. Yet the overall rating and free texts answers suggest that even under these circumstances, vaccinations are not perceived as a prime example of Human Enhancement. The functional status of capability enhancement of vaccination technology remains ethically controversial. It is therefore important to conduct future research into this topic, especially after the current pandemic. Our sample mainly consisted of people willing to receive a vaccination shot against SARS-CoV-2 and showed a very positive attitude towards this topic. Future research must address a heterogeneous population and include people who are skeptical towards vaccination and Human Enhancement in general, especially considering the framing of vaccination as modern biotechnological enhancements. beyond what is necessary to maintain a \"normal\" healthy condition. In other words, the application of Human Enhancement technology seems to be mandatory. In a medically and technologically advanced world, excluding Human Enhancement ideas from measures to mitigate a deadly pandemic is an ethical problem. The history of epidemiology shows that several pandemics with very different pandemic severity indices were all survived by humankind, even without vaccination technology available [64, 65] . Yet, because science possesses the capability to develop and successfully apply vaccines, this option should not be prematurely excluded just because it is a form of Human Enhancement. Many bad medical conditions can be prevented, lives can be saved, and pandemics can effectively be mitigated to be able to much sooner switch back to more normal states of everyday life. Within this approach, and always carefully ensuring that individuals' safety and autonomy are guaranteed as good as possible, Human Enhancement via vaccination is justified.",

Here Mitrov\u00edc [51] states that: \"in the pandemic [\u2026] enhancement, otherwise ethically difficult to accept, may find its way to users (groups and individuals) and become socially acceptable and ethically justifiable. \" (p. 624). However, we argue that there is no reason to be worried about this and other examples of enhancement technology in re. Ethical issues regarding vaccination merely arise from individual attitudes, non-sufficient scientific communication, and distributive justice concerns, not from an inherently vicious nature. Overall, policymakers and scientists will get some helpful input from studying the general ethical debate on Human Enhancement.",

            "text": "When developing or researching technologies and their ethical implications, one should always ask whether that technology might be a form of Human Enhancement and, if so, how might ethical discomfort be grounded due to that status. This is especially of concern when the target audience of that technology is vast. Scholars and policymakers are well-advised to examine the ethical debate surrounding so many ground-breaking technologies such as smartphones, psychopharmaceuticals or emerging biotechnologies from an explicit Human Enhancement point of view. This also affects medical professionals as they often act as gatekeepers who are expected to regulate the access to various enhancements and respond to the demand of enhancements in different contexts [66, 67] . Empirically showing possible connections between the specific opposition arguments and the general Human Enhancement debate may enhance our understanding of why people are afraid of or affirm certain types of technology by simultaneously sharpening our ethical stand on this manifold phenomenon. However, this requires large, multinational samples and a combination of quantitative and qualitative data. Examining vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 as a practical example of Human Enhancement shows the difficulties in defining the latter kinds of technologies. However, it provides an excellent example for the debate as to whether or not we should pursue these technologies. Moreover, this example demonstrates the need to take a step back and consider not only the technology in its own right but also its potential social and political impact [23] . Note that we are not arguing for a general laissezfaire approach to Human Enhancement, just because one example of this technology seems to be relatively morally unencumbered. Instead, we are calling for a case-bycase examination of enhancement technologies. Indeed, some technologies need regulation and an intense ethical debate about their impacts. However, the formal status of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 as Human Enhancement provides no closing argument here. As Daniels [11] has noted, the status as enhancement or treatment does not allow for any definitive conclusion on whether or not an intervention is morally obligated. In the light of the global health crisis, the administration of an enhancement technology is a promising strategy to restore and improve a pre-COVID state. Thus, it may be not only morally obligatory to get vaccinated but also obligatory to any policymaker to ensure a fair distribution of vaccinations inside and beyond state borders.",
