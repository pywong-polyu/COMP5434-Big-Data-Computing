One of the primary challenges is rapid, reliable, and accurate detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) virus among the suspected COVID-19-infected individuals. At present, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a widely used diagnostic method. However, it requires expensive instruments and expertise in the interpretation of results. These constraints reflect the significant need for the development of alternative diagnostic options.",

For this purpose, a cohort of 297 suspected COVID-19 patients was tested using both the RT-LAMP assay and the conventional RT-PCR method. For the RT-LAMP assay, three genes (orf-1ab, N, and S) were identified as the target sites for the detection of COVID-19. Based on a comparative assessment, 117 out of 124 positive COVID-19 cases were observed using the RT-LAMP technique with an overall 91.45% sensitivity. Interestingly, where a consensus on 163 individuals free of SARS-Cov-2 was observed, RT-LAMP specificity was 90%. Based on these findings, the robustness of the technique, and the reduced dependency on expensive instrumentation, RT-LAMP-based COVID-19 detection is strongly recommended as a potential alternative assay.",

The global mortality rate of the disease is high at approximately 4%. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic because of its high-risk factors and the multiple challenges to global health care systems (Spinelli and Pellino, 2020) . Because the spread of the virus is very rapid, it is causing havoc in countries worldwide, especially in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.10.064 1319-562X/\u00d3 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

Further, because of the sudden infective outbreak, efficient and timely diagnosis of the disease remains a major challenge (Satyanarayana, 2020) . To address this challenge, extensive screening and effective testing are recommended . The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction PCR (qRT-PCR)-based diagnostic method is widely used for COVID-19 detection (Xiao et al., 2020) . However, based on a massive influx of patients, studies have reported several cases in which false negatives are being detected using the qRT-PCR method .",

To overcome these issues, some studies have suggested using qRT-PCR in combination with Chest computerized tomography (CT) scans (Bernheim et al., 2020) . Although the diagnostic performance of the chest CT is good in terms of sensitivity, its specificity is still very low . Similarly, the results obtained through the combination of both of the assays were also largely inconsistent in one-time testing (Xie et al., 2020) . Hence, there is an urgent need for an alternative assay for early COVID-19 screening. Before the global impact of COVID-19 and its underlying challenges, several molecular assays were in the process of development and optimization. They included the loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based method (La Marca et al., 2020) .",

Significantly, several modifications leading to the earliest identification of concatemers improved and significantly reduced the assay's dependency on expensive instruments. LAMP products could also be detected using agarose gel electrophoreses after one hour of incubation at a high temperature (Notomi et al., 2000) . Later, the formation of a white precipitate (magnesium pyrophosphate) in the reaction tube could be traced with the naked eye or spectrophotometry (Mori et al., 2001) . The binding of pyrophosphate with a divalent metallic magnesium ion (Mg++) was the principle underlying the development of turbidity directly correlated with synthesized DNA.

During the amplification of the targeted reaction, pyrophosphate was generated, forming a complex with Mn2+. This facilitated the release of calcein, resulting in fluorescence detected under UV (Tomita et al., 2008) . Similarly, ethidium bromide and Malachite Green dyes have been used to detect the products of LAMP amplification (Pham et al., 2005) . In the WarmStart mastermix, a Post-test probability (positive test result) = (0.7 \u00c2 9.6)/(1 + (0.7 \u00c2 9.6)) = 0.9. Post-test probability (negative test result) = (0.7 \u00c2 0.1)/(1 + (0.7 \u00c2 0.1)) = 0.1. pH-based approach was used in which the release of pyrophosphate resulted in lowering the pH from pink to yellow. This colorimetric assay is potentially the easiest method, reducing dependency on expensive instruments and highly trained technicians. Currently, few LAMP-based kits like the ID NOW COVID-19 and iAMP COVID-19 have been approved by the FDA or are commercially available for SARS-Cov-2 detection. ID NOW COVID-19 (Abbott Diagnostics) targets isothermal amplification of a single gene (RdRP) with a fast processing time (~13 min). However, it can process only one sample per run with close dependency on reagents and consumables according to manufacturer instructions. iAMP COVID-19 (Atila BioSystems) targets isothermal amplification of the ORF1ab and N genes with a processing time of 1.5 h.",
