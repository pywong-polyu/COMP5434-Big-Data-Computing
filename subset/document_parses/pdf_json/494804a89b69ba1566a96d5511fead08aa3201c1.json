The first symptomatic case of a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany was reported at the end of January 2020.

However, it was clear from very early on that older adults and those with serious underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Older people are more likely to present severe symptoms, fever, and breathing problems than younger people [3] . Comorbidity and lymphocyte count are the strongest predictors of progression to severity [2] , with hypertension, diabetes, and higher body mass index as the most frequent comorbidities among patients with severe symptoms [1] . Accordingly, people who need extra precautions are, among others, elderly people with chronic diseases. A clinical review on testing, treatment and prognosis of COVID-19 in the elderly supports the association of age and presence of comorbidities with increased severity and mortality [4] .",

            "text": "With no causal or symptomatic treatment being available, the aim of all protective measures has been to stop or slow down the pandemic and prevent people from becoming infected. This has been especially challenging as many of those infected remain asymptomatic or are infectious before symptoms appear. However, public health measures have been associated with the epidemiology of the disease [5] . General measures to encounter the pandemic were introduced in Germany starting March 22nd 2020 when the federal government in agreement with the governments of all federal states enacted limitations in social contacts (i.e. \"social distancing\") throughout the country. Targeted social distancing is the standard practice to influence infection spread, especially for vulnerable groups because spread is strongest through social contact network [6] . While quarantine of infected people is a type of social distancing useful for many infectious diseases, social distancing on a broader community level aims at achieving minimal interaction between people in the population and is ethically more challenging [7] . Social distancing, also referred to as \"physical distancing\", is described by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as \"keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home\" https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/201 9-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html. The CDC recommends to a) stay at least a certain distance from other people, b) not gather in groups, and c) stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings. Worldwide children were barred from going to schools; university classes, religious services, major events in sports, film industry, music festivals and concerts, conferences, and fashion shows were canceled [8] . In line with this definition, the German government recommended to reduce spatial closeness and decrease individual mobility as much as possible. In public places, a minimal distance between individuals of 1.50 m was introduced. Public gatherings of up to two people continued to be allowed (this rule, however, did not apply to people residing in the same household, e.g. families with more members could move freely in the public), public and private gatherings were forbidden, but people were generally \"asked\" to stay at home. In contrast to other countries, there was no strict, legally binding \"lock down\". Furthermore, shops selling nonessential products, restaurants, clubs, schools, universities, public buildings, recreational facilities and other institutions of public life were closed. On April 15th some of the restrictions were eased (e.g. selected shops were allowed to open under specific restrictions), but social distancing was recommended to be kept in place until May 6th. Latter measure has now been extended until further notice. Due to the federal nature of state organization in Germany, recommendations and regulations were introduced jointly as a result of an inter-governmental agreement, but nonetheless posed only a non-binding framework for the federal states (the entities previously legally responsible for pandemic measures). Each federal state was able to develop specific plans, set different deadlines and interpret recommendations differently. Although the initial consensus was upheld in the early stages of the lockdown, federal diversity has increased lately. Starting May 6th 2020 it was mandated that the nation-wide approach in respect to preventive measures would be delegated to a more regional level and on 6th of June more restrictions were loosened. It has been shown that the provisions taken have contributed to the substantial reduction of the growth rate in Germany [9] .",

The Robert-Koch-Institute, the German federal government's central scientific institution for public health, has issued recommendations for hygiene for the public and the health care system in Germany. In this article, we focus on general recommendations that affect health care and might specifically affect the elderly. For example, to be prepared for an increased COVID-19 associated utilization of hospitals, the total number of beds for intensive care were increased, by e.g. postponing elective and planned hospital stays. Social distancing rules were applied to health care institutions and the primary care system. For example: day care clinics were closed, ambulatory service provision decreased, treatments cancelled or restricted in case these could not meet the recommended hygienic requirements (e.g. out-patient physiotherapy).",

Further, social distancing can be associated with a loss of motivation, loss of meaning, loss of self-worth, and subsequent mental health problems [11] . Moreover, the public dissemination of preventive measures can trigger anxieties, lead to discrimination and stigma, and cause misinformation through misunderstanding [12] .

This, what is considered to be a stress-buffering effect [20] , is likely to be brought about by physiologic pathways related to neuroendocrine or immunologic function [21] . Social support appears to enhance the efficiency of the immune system in dealing with inflammatory processes [22, 23] . Furthermore, studies point out that neurons of socially isolated animals are less responsive to stimulation [24] , emphasizing the relevance of social contacts for neurodegenerative processes. The health promoting effects of social contacts stand in contrast to the vulnerability of older people to be lonely [25] .

            "text": "From end of March until 6th of June, we conducted a telephone-based questionnaire and semi-structured interview assessment. The questionnaire included variables from previously validated instruments and is available as supplement (supplement 1). They were chosen based on their feasibility in telephone-based surveys, duration and feasibility in people with cognitive impairments. All were available in German versions and conducted in German. The decision for inclusion was based on an expert panel of researchers at the DZNE, the university of Greifswald, the university of Rostock, the university of Bochum and experts from the geriatric division of the hospital in Bielefeld. They cover: a) Attitudes, knowledge about and perceived personal impact of the pandemic b) social support Footnote: n number of participants, m mean, SD standard deviation, n/a not applicable c) loneliness d) anxiety e) depression f) change in the frequency of social activities due to the pandemic g) perceived impact of the pandemic on health care related services Ad a) Participants were asked whether they were sufficiently informed about Corona (yes/ no) and whether they knew someone infected (yes/ no) and whether they rated the measures against the pandemic as appropriate (\"Yes\", \"Notoo strict\", \"Nonot strict enough\"). They were asked to rate whether they felt \"1strongly\", \"2moderately\", \"3not at all\" worried because of Corona for themselves; \"stressed out\", \"concerned about their health\", \"the health of family and friends\", \"worried about Corona in general\". They were asked to rate their fear to infect family members, whether their everyday life has changed by the pandemic and whether the visiting restrictions for nursing homes do affect their life. The items are listed in Table 2 . Ad b) Social support was measured using selected items from the German version of the Resource Generator [33] . The Resource Generator covers a wide variety of social resources that can be divided in four aspects of social capital (capital associated to: prestige and education of the network, political and financial knowledge of the network, special skills of the network, social support of the network). For our analysis and due to time restrictions in the assessment four relevant items from the aspect \"instrumental social support\" were chosen (i.e. is there anyone, who \"supports you when repairing something\", \"supports you when shopping\", \"supports you in filling out forms\", \"supports you with legal and administrative challenges\"). The participant was asked to rate these with: \"0not at all\", \"1rather not\", \"2rather\", \"3exactly\". Each item is analyzed separately and for the purpose of analysis, we add the scores of each item to generate a total score of social support, ranging from 0 to 12. Ad c) Loneliness was measured using the loneliness scale of de Jong Gierveld & van Tilburg [34] . This scale consists of 6 items with statements the participant is asked to rate with \"1 -exactly\", \"2rather\", \"3 -rather not\" or \"4 -not at all\". The scores of each item are summed to a total score, ranging from 6 to 24; the higher the score the higher loneliness is present in the participant. This instrument was chosen, because it is used in the longitudinal population-based cohort of the elderly in Germany and reference scores are available for the years 2008 to 2017 [35] . We furthermore measured loneliness with a focus on social relationship using a short loneliness scale developed specifically for use on a telephone survey [36] . Three items ask how often one feels \"lacking companionship\", \"being left out\" and \"being isolated\". Each item is rated \"seldom\", \"sometimes\" or \"often\". The sum score indicates the level of loneliness, ranging from 3 to 9. Ad d) Anxiety is measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) [37] . It is a screening instrument to diagnose a generalized anxiety disorder according to DSM-5 and ICD 10. The psychometric properties are considered appropriate. The German version is validated for the general population [38] . Participants are asked to rate how frequent symptoms of anxiety have occurred during the time-frame of 2 weeks preceding the interview (\"0not at all\", \"1single days\", \"2more than half of the days\", \"3nearly daily\"). The GAD-7 delivers a sum score by adding each item and ranges from 0 to 21. The sum score yields whether anxiety symptoms are minimal (0-4), low (5-9), medium (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) or severe (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . Furthermore, there are cut-off scores for a generalized anxiety disorder being possible (score > 10) or probable (score > 15). Ad e) The two item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used for screening for depressive symptoms [39, 40] . The participant is asked to categorize how often he/ she has experienced \"loss of interest or pleasure in activities\" and \"sadness\" during the 2 weeks prior to the assessment. The options are \"0never\", \"1single days\", \"2more than half of the days\", 3nearly daily\". These two items represent the main indicators for a positive screening of depression according to DSM-5, with one of both being mandatory. Depression was considered possible if one of the two items was scored > = 2. Depression was considered unlikely otherwise. For the sample of participants recruited for the intersec-CM study we included pre-pandemic data and could therefore calculate whether there was a change in frequency of symptoms during the period of lockdown (\"more frequent\", \"equally frequent\", \"less frequent\"). Ad f) To measure change in frequency of (social) activities due to the pandemic we use a generic list of social activities and ask whether the specific activity is carried out \"more frequently\", \"less frequently\" or \"with no change in frequency\" during the time of lockdown. If an item does not apply to the participant's situation, it was marked as being \"not applicable\" (e.g. if a participant never \"went dancing\" previously, this item was marked as \"not-applicable\"). The list consists of 24 items (see Table 3 ). Each item is analyzed separately. We furthermore provide three scores per person, which represent the number of activities that have \"increased\", \"decreased\", and been \"unchanged\" in frequency. Ad g) To assess the perceived impact of the pandemic on health care related services participants are asked to rate whether the provision and use of the service is \"better\", \"worse\" or \"unchanged\" during the lockdown in comparison to the time before. Items that were irrelevant to a participant's situation were marked \"not applicable\" (e.g. if a participant never utilized \"podiatry\" as a service, this item was marked as \"not applicable\"). The full list is provided in Table 4 . Each service is analyzed separately. We furthermore provide three scores per person, which represent the number of services where the quality is rated to be \"better\", \"worse\" and \"unchanged\".",

Our study, on the other hand, is based on a convenience sample of people already participating in intervention trials. As such, a selection bias is possible in that people with a previous diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorders might not have participated in the original study. This notwithstanding, approximately half of the cohort showed single depressive symptoms at baseline. Comparing these to the pandemic results of the two PHQ-2 items \"loss of interest or pleasure in activities\" and \"sadness\" (in intersec-CM participants), our results imply that the pandemic did not impact symptoms of depression. In fact, descriptively depressive symptoms before the baseline were shown to be more frequent than during the lockdown. Again, this may not reflect a shift causal as all intersec-CM participants were initially recruited during an acute hospital stay. Summarizing, we can show that depressive symptoms are present in our cohort, but there do not seem to be caused by the Corona pandemic and the restrictions imposed.",

On average, our cohort received medium to high levels of instrumental support even under lockdown-conditions and therefore cannot be considered isolated. We asked whether the frequency of pursuit in diverse social activities had changed due to the pandemic. On average the frequency did not change in six activities, one was pursued more and seven less often. We can conclude that the level of social activities in the elderly in our cohort did not change significantly; restrictions in activities that are important to a given individual (especially those related to \"staying in contact\") were, in fact, compensated during the lockdown.",

Especially the provision of services aiming at relief for caregivers was perceived to be worse. These results need further attention as a decrease in health care services may lead to significant long-term consequences. Recent findings from a study in the UK highlight the need to encounter this challenge. They found that paid home care was significantly affected by family members' decisions on whether care should be continued or not [45] .
