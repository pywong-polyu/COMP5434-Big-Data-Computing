Tremendous progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of CVD; however, there are still lots of limitations and new technology is needed. Nanoparticles have been studied recently for CVD due to their nanoscale size and unique properties, and hold a potential to be a novel therapy for the treatment. To test the safety and effectiveness of drugloaded nanoparticles for CVD prior to human studies, animal disease models are unavoidably needed. This review summarized the animal models used in the research of nanoparticles for CVD and provided a generic picture of current use of CVD animal models according to the different types of diseases which should be prioritized when considering the application of nanoparticles in treating CVD. This review would be useful resources not only for life science researchers and clinicians but also for those from chemistry and materials sciences background who may not have a systematic knowledge about CVD animal models.",

Substantial improvements have been achieved in life expectancy and living quality due to better prevention and enhanced treatment for CVD, but there is still an urgent need for the drug innovation. Nanoparticles, defined as heterogeneous group of substances that vary in size (10-100 nm), have emerged as a potential candidate for drug delivery system. Nanoparticles possess several unique properties such as enhanced biocompatibility, reduced toxicity, and prolonged retention time (Dong et al. 2018) . Besides, certain nanoparticles can serve as a drug due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects (Zhang et al. 2018) . In this review, we summarized in vivo preclinical studies of nanoparticles for CVD using various animal models. These established animal models provided useful information to guide further experiments particularly when designing and choosing nanoparticles and would be useful resources not only for life science researchers and clinicians but also for those from chemistry and materials sciences background who may not have a systematic knowledge about CVD animal models (Zaragoza et al. 2011) .",

Further development on novel therapeutics such as using a delivery system to improve drug half-life and reduce side effects becomes a hot research topic. As the molecular processes underlying CVD become better defined, there are growing studies to intervene CVD using gene therapy. However, nuclear acid is easy to be identified and diminished and requires a carrier to protect them interacting with internal environment. Finding a delivery machine also seems a logical tool to bring gene therapy to fruition (Herrera et al. 2018) .",

The nanoscale of nanoparticles enables themselves to cross natural barriers and enter into target cells more easily. Hence, drugs wrapped in nanoparticles could protect themselves from interactions with the surrounding environment and degradation, and further enhance the concentration in the targeted tissues. Additionally, nanoparticles can achieve controlled drug release by constructing a release system in response of internal stimuli such as pH, redox state, and the presence of biomolecules as well as external stimuli such as light and magnetic field (Dong et al. 2018) . For example, lipid nanoparticles are the carriers most used in clinical trials for therapeutics, due to their pronounced advantages over other delivery systems such as easy preparation, high biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Unfortunately, being synthetic and quite \"unnatural,\" lipid nanoparticles can be toxic and induce immune response at high doses, particularly in the condition where the required dose is high or frequent application is required. However, these effects could be overcome by selecting proper lipid components (Zhang 2005; Xue et al. 2014 ). Up to now, several nano-formulations of lipid nanoparticles have been approved for human use. For example, BNT162b2, a kind of vaccine against COVID-19 and adopted lipid nanoparticles as vehicles, has been put into clinical use (No Author 2020). All these predict a promising application of using nanoparticles for the treatment of CVD.",

In this paper, the most commonly used CVD animal models and their usages in testing nanoparticle applications for the treatment of CVD are reviewed. We focused on the animal models according to the type of CVDs and explained the complexity of choosing proper animal models to best mimic the pathological conditions of CVDs. We did not exam and compare which nanoparticle should be chosen and their potentially complicated properties when interacting with animals due to very random data in the limited applications. However, the properties of nanoparticles, especially when interacting with physiological system is the important aspects to be investigated in each individual study. Interdisciplinary collaboration with experts in chemistry and materials would greatly improve our understanding of how to best use nanoparticles to treat CVDs in this aspect.",

In addition, the availability of transgenic and knockout strains and little difficulty in creating new genetic modifications make the mouse one of the most attractive models for research. Nevertheless, large animals have similar cardiovascular system to human at both the organ and cellular levels, thus transitions from the researches in those large animals to human researches are more likely to repeat and the results obtained are also ready to use.

The hypertension animal model is characterized with elevated blood pressure.

Therefore, one single animal model may not be able to fully mimic the hypertensive responses and is therefore not sufficient to explain the antihypertensive effects of drugs when using nanoparticle as its delivery system.

It usually takes decades to form plaques with various inflammatory cytokines and immune cells contributing to the process. Rats and mice were inherently resistant to atherosclerosis. Therefore, transgenic models such as LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mouse (Ishibashi et al. 1993 ) and apoE \u2212/\u2212 mouse were established to develop atherosclerosis through gene knockout technology. However, gene knockout animals are rather expensive and may impose a substantial financial pressure to any research as well as limit the number of samples obtained. The rabbit is used as the ideal alternate animal for experimental atherosclerosis by high-cholesterol diet or repeated or continuous intimal injury through catheter, balloon angioplasty, or nitrogen exposure (Zaragoza et al. 2011) . The rabbit atherosclerosis model is a no plaque rupture model while porcine atherosclerosis models are valid to investigate the plaque rupture and restenosis. The highcholesterol diet-induced atherosclerosis models present lipid abnormality with elevated triglyceride and other liver enzymes, and atherosclerotic plaques on the wall of arteries featured by foam cells. The external injuryinduced atherosclerosis models exhibit atherosclerotic plaques without abnormal lipid profiles. Table 3 summarizes the studies using nanoparticles for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Some modified nanoparticles like oligonucleotide functionalized nanoparticles could be specifically recognized by foam cells, which may serve as a potential delivery vehicle and therefore is worth for future study (Sharma et al. 2010) . Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for example could reach the target region under external magnetic gradient. This opens up the opportunity for further investigations aiming both to improve targeting efficacy and to develop the potential \"magnetic drug targeting\"-based approaches to therapy of arterial injuries and/or atherosclerotic plaques (Matuszak et al. 2018) . In most of the study, drug-loaded with nanoparticles showed reduced lesion size and inflammatory responses than free drug in atherosclerosis animal model, suggesting that nanoparticles may be a promising strategy to prevent atherosclerosis. However, there are also some studies which did not show any antiatherogenic effects with administration of nanoformulated drugs while enhanced accumulation of drugs in the desired regions were observed (Matuszak et al. 2018) . Therefore, selecting optimal drugs turns to be crucial and important.",

MI is a life-threatening disease and can cause sudden death. Victims survived from MI often suffer from adverse ventricular remodeling, which is also known as heart failure. Therefore, it is essential to explore new therapy strategies to rescue the ischemic cardiomyocytes and attenuate ventricular remodeling. It has been revealed that myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy/apoptosis are all involved in the progression of post-infarct ventricular remodeling.

However, after training and practice, the ligation method has higher stability than other methods. The myocardial infarction is more thorough, and the size of the infarct size is positively correlated with the height of the ligation site.",

Table 4 briefly summarizes the MI animal models used in the study of nanoparticles for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction or post-infarct heart failure. Improved cardiac function and decreased infarct size were noticed in the MI animal model treated with empty nanoparticles or drug-loaded nanoparticles. Nucleic acid nanotherapies were investigated in MI animal model as well. Nox2-siRNA nanoparticles were observed to prevent upregulation of Nox2 and significantly recover cardiac function in mice receiving LAD ligation. In the past few years, several cardiac gene therapy clinical trials were conducted with aim at inducing therapeutic angiogenesis in the ischemic heart. However, the efficiency of cardiac gene delivery remains a major hurdle preventing success (Cannata et al. 2020) .

The possible mechanisms of myocardial I/R injury are as follows: (1) the outbreak of oxygen free radicals; (2) Ca 2+ ovedoad; (3) mitochondrial dysfunction; (4) inflammation; (5) energy metabolism disorders. Myocardial I/R injury is a vital negative factor influencing the therapeutic efficacy for the MI victims who accept revascularization such as percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The I/R animal model used is normally based on surgical ligation MI model. The difference is that left anterior descending coronary artery is partially ligated to achieve reperfusion in I/R model, while in MI model, it is completed ligated. The myocardial I/R animal model established by this method can better simulate human myocardial ischemia-reperfusion. Besides, isolated Langendorf I/R heart is often used for the ex vivo study of myocardial I/R injury. Since the isolated heart is detached from nerve innervation and systemic humoral factors, the heart rate, pre-and post-load, perfusion pressure, and other factors can be controlled. It is therefore especially suitable to study the effects of some single factors on cardiac function and metabolism without interference effects of related factors. However, the conclusions from isolated I/R heart are worthy of consideration when extending to humans because this model is isolated from inner environment. Small animals such as mice and rats are admired by researchers to build myocardial I/R animal model and the reasons are similar to MI animal model. At present, there is no agreeable conclusion on the exposure time of ischemia and reperfusion because they are affected by the size of the animal and the tolerance of the organ or tissue to ischemia and hypoxia. Table 5 briefly reviewed the I/R animal models used in the study of nanoparticles for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury. PLGA nanoparticles and other inorganic nanoparticles were tested either as empty or loaded with most used clinical drugs on these animal models. For majority of the study, reduced inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and lesion size were observed in myocardial I/R animal models treated with nanoformulated drugs, indicating the potential of nano-drug delivery system for the treatment of I/R injury. For example, silver nanoparticles increased the level of cytokines and aggravated I/R injury. For the concern of safety, silver nanoparticles are not proper nanoparticles for the treatment of I/R injury.",

Prostaglandin I2 and its analogues (such as beraprost sodium, BPS) are beneficial for the treatment of PAH. Intravenous administration of BPS nanoparticles (once per week, 20 \u03bcg/kg) protected against monocrotalineinduced and hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy. The extent of this protection was similar to that observed with oral administration (once per day, 100 \u03bcg/kg) of BPS alone (Ishihara et al. 2015) . The beneficial effects of BPS-NP on PAH animal models seem to be mediated by its sustained release and tissue targeting profiles.

Nanoparticles are also ideal delivery carrier for the gene therapy. Therefore, nanoparticles possess a strong potential for clinical translation in CVD.
