Many typical imaging features of this disease were described such as bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a prevalent peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes, and sometimes consolidative opacities superimposed on GGO. As less common findings were mentioned septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening and subpleural involvement. After three months from the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia some studies published the evolution of imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia such as an increase of GGOs and a progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy-paving pattern. As far as we know bronchiectasis were described only as a possible aspecific imaging feature of COVID-19 pneumonia and no studies reporting the onset or evolution of bronchiectasis during imaging follow-up in Patients with COVID-19 have been published. Here we describe two cases of rapid evolution of bronchiectasis documented at CT in Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Further studies are necessary to determine predisposing factors to the onset of bronchiectasis and to evaluate clinical correlation with respiratory distress. Radiologists should always consider bronchial features when they report CT scans of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Symptoms are variable and nonspecific and include dry cough, fever, fatigue, myalgias, dyspnea, anosmia, and ageusia. Less commonly encountered symptoms include productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and diarrhea 2 . Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test is the current gold standard for confirming infection, performed using nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens or induced sputum. Routine unenhanced chest CT is useful in early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, in monitoring disease progression, coinfection, or disease stability 3 . Since chest CT was introduced as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 pneumonia, many typical features of this disease were described such as bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a prevalent peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes, and sometimes consolidative opacities superimposed on GGOs could be found. The less common imaging findings include septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening and subpleural involvement [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Some studies described the evolution of imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia: an increase of GGOs and a progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy-paving pattern 9 . To our best knowledge, no studies reporting the onset or evolution of bronchiectasis during follow-up in Patients with COVID-19 have been published.

She was discharged from the hospital with supportive therapy. A week later she returned to the emergency department with worsening dyspnoea and body temperature >38.5\u00b0C. Her vital signs were: blood pressure 114/65 mmHg and heart rate 53 bpm. Chest X-ray showed bilateral shaded patchy opacities. Blood test revealed lymphocytes 900/mm 3 and Creactive protein 110 mg/L. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.55, pO 2 39 mmHg, pCO 2 28 mmHg, HCO 3 -24.5 mmol/L and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) of 81.6%. She was hospitalized in the Internal Medicine ward. On clinical examination: blood pressure 110/60 mmHg, heart rate 48 bpm rhythmics, respiratory rate 32/min and SpO 2, as measured by a pulse oximeter, was 98% while breathing in a respiratory mask with reservoir bag of 8 L/min. Chest auscultation revealed fine crackles on both pulmonary bases. The electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with QT c 416 ms. Therapy with 400 mg per day of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir at a dose of 400/100 mg was begun.",

Prothrombin time (PT-INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) remained stable (1.02 and 0.9 respectively). During hospitalization, oxygen saturation further worsened, and it was necessary to introduce pronation and morphine, and to increase O 2 -therapy. On day 3 from admission, D-dimer remained raised therefore Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) was performed. On the CTPA exam, no filling defects were detected in the pulmonary arteries, but peripheral patchy ground-glass opacities involving all pulmonary lobes were described. Segmental and subsegmental bronchi had normal caliber (Fig 1) . On the next week, the saturation got worst, on Chest X-ray the opacities were diffuse and increased compared to the previous exam. SpO 2 was 95% using a mask with reservoir bag at 12 L of O 2 /min and exactly 6 days after the first CTPA an unenhanced Chest CT was performed. CT showed a progression of viral pneumonia, with an increase in number and extension of multiple patchy ground-glass opacities with inter-and intralobular septal thickening characterized by peripheral distribution in all lobes, with the transformation of GGOs into consolidative opacifications on posterior-basal segments of both lower lobes (Fig 2) . The segmental bronchi in both lungs, with a significant predominance next to the consolidative opacifications in the lower lobes, showed an enlarged caliber and irregular walls, becoming bronchiectasic (Fig 2 c,d) . The ratio between the caliber of the bronchus and the corresponding artery increased, nearly doubling (from 0.61 in the first exam to 1.18 in the second exam evaluating the same segmental bronchus) in an interval time between the two exams of only 6 days (Fig 5) . On the other hand, comparing the two MDCT (Multi Detector Computed Tomography) exams, no variation in the caliber of the segmental and subsegmental branches of pulmonary arteries was documented. After hospital discharge the patient has reported an improvement of saturation (SaO 2 ) in ambient air 95% (despite 95% by using a mask with reservoir bag at hospital), but she still complained about dyspnoea during mild exercise.",

After 10 days with fever, headache, dry cough and two syncopal episodes he presented to the emergency department. COVID-19 infection was confirmed with an rRT-PCR test. Chest X-ray detected bilateral patchy opacities. Blood test results included white blood cells 4540/ mm 3 , lymphocytes 77% and C-reactive protein 23 mg/L. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.5, pO 2 54mmHg, pCO 2 32 mmHg and SaO 2 95%. Electrocardiogram didn't show any rhythm alteration with QT c 419 ms. He was admitted to the Infectious Diseases department. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/75 mmHg, heart rate 82 bpm, SpO 2 of 94% without O 2 -therapy. The body temperature was 36,7 \u00b0C. Arterial blood gas analysis was repeated: pH 7.48, pO2 65 mmHg, pCO2 34 mmHg. Blood tests showed lymphocytes 630/mm 3 , C-reactive protein 24 mg/L and D-dimer 684 \u03bcg/L. On day 3 of admission, SpO 2 worsened and it was necessary to add morphine and modify O 2 -therapy from nasal cannula 4L/min to respiratory mask 10 L/min. SpO 2 went from 87% to 94% with PaO 2 /FiO 2 112 mmHg. D-dimer was 3937 \u03bcg/L. CTPA was performed: no filling defects were detected in the pulmonary arteries, but multiple bilateral peripheral and with mainly subpleural distribution patchy ground-glass opacities were documented, together with initial parenchymal distortion and some areas of consolidation at the posterior-basal segment of both lower lobes. Segmental and subsegmental bronchi caliber was at the upper limits of standard (Fig 3) . The following day, the saturation worsened with PaO 2 /FiO 2 87 mmHg, and the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for 2 days because he needed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). A week after admission, lower-limb compression ultrasonography detected deep venous thrombosis in the venous tract distal to the left popliteal vein. Furthermore, D-dimer was 1661 \u03bcg/L (from 500 \u03bcg/L) and CTPA was repeated. CTPA detected a filling defect in a subsegmental pulmonary artery in the lower left lobe. Progression of viral pneumonia with increased interlobular septal thickening and larger areas of consolidation inside the ground-glass opacities were visible (Fig 4) . Also in this case, the segmental bronchi in both lungs, with a significant predominance next to the consolidative opacifications in the lower lobes, showed an enlarged caliber and irregular walls, becoming bronchiectasic (Fig 4 c,d) . The ratio between the caliber of the bronchus and the corresponding artery increased (from 0.7 in the first exam to 1.12 in the second exam evaluating the same segmental bronchus) in an interval time between the two exams of only 5 days (Fig 5) . Similarly to the previous case, comparing the two CT exams, no variation in the caliber of the segmental and subsegmental branches of pulmonary arteries was documented. After two month from discharge the saturation (SaO 2 ) of the patient in ambient air was 98-99%. He had still dyspnoea, but only during mild exercise.",

CT findings of COVID-19 pulmonary infection are bilateral, peripheral and basal predominant ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving and consolidation, often with an extensive geographical distribution. Multiple areas of ground-glass opacities and consolidation occur in the same patient and have round morphology or a reversed halo sign [4] [5] [6] [7] . Few studies have reported short term CT follow-up patients with COVID-19 infection 6, 9 . Pan et al. described the temporal evolution of 21 patients with mild pneumonia without severe respiratory symptoms 9 . Other studies report airway changes and bronchiectasis 8 : Fang describe two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with bronchiectasis 10 . Hanley in a post-mortem CT study on 101 bodies observed traction bronchiectasis in 53% of cases, the changes being more likely bilateral and involving the lower lobes 11 . As far as we know bronchiectasis were described as a possible imaging feature of COVID-19 pneumonia, but no published studies are reporting the onset and evolution of bronchiectasis during the short follow-up in a Patient with this disease.",

Unfortunately to date we don't know if bronchiectasis are transient or permanent because none of them underwent a control CT exam yet. Although in the literature a definite time course of onset of bronchiectasis in respiratory disease is not described, bronchial dilatation is always expression of a chronic respiratory disease with a fibrotic parenchymal change 13 . The rapid onset of bronchiectasis in COVID patients could be a sign of a rapid and progressive pulmonary fibrotic process triggered by virus infection.",
