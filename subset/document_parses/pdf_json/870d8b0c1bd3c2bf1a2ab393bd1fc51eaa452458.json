These issues have created unique challenges during this difficult time.

However, given the urgent presentation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and considering that cure is possible for some, watchful waiting is frequently impossible or inadvisable. In this article, we compare the approach to treating patients with AML at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, PA, United States, and at Marche Nord Hospital (MNH) in Pesaro, Italy, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We place special emphasis on decision-making regarding identifying those patients for whom we can defer treatment until a later, and hopefully safer, date and those for whom we cannot.",

Patients with fever are managed in the emergency room, where they perform triage, lab draws, and nasopharyngeal swab. Results of the quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction on nasopharyngeal swabs are available in 6-12 h.

Even if the data do support delaying treatment to await the cytogenetic and molecular testing for risk stratification and treatment planning, it is clear that this strategy will not be appropriate for every patient, either during or after the pandemic. For example, anyone with a life-threatening complication such as tumor lysis syndrome, hyperleukocytosis, or neutropenic sepsis should not have treatment delayed. Furthermore, there are some data to suggest that delaying treatment for younger patients may be of detriment. A previous retrospective analysis showed a shorter survival for younger patients (<60 years old) when treatment was delayed by \u22655 days (4). In addition, since the younger population is treated primarily with intensive daunorubicin (or idarubicin) and cytarabine (7+3) induction, and since additional drugs, such as midostaurin or gemtuzumab ozogamicin, are not added until after 7+3 has been initiated, there may not be a benefit to waiting in these patients.",

In addition, we recommend testing for all patients who are hospitalized or undergoing a medical procedure, and any patient who will be receiving high dose chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplant with the dual goals of delaying therapy, when possible, and protecting staff if therapy is required.

With the advent of newer therapies and increased ability to deliver intensive supportive care outside the hospital, this paradigm was changing, even prior to the pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, issues such as donor availability, testing, selection, and product availability and recipient susceptibility to infection both pre-and posttransplant have become particularly problematic. All transplant registries have been negatively affected by COVID-19, with some experiencing significant difficulty in collecting and exporting products (14) . However, delay of transplant, which may allow for emergence of measurable residual disease, is known to negatively impact the survival of patients with AML (9). Therefore, despite the risks and challenges, potentially curable patients with AML at both SKCC and MNH continue to be referred for evaluation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant as indicated. For patients referred for HSCT who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) initially recommended deferral of transplant for at least 3 months; however, this guideline has evolved and the most recent recommendation is to defer transplant for a minimum 14 days (ideally minimum of 21 days) and until the patient becomes asymptomatic and has two negative PCR swabs at least 24 h apart (15) .",

At the SKCC, and in the broader United States, for the treatment of AML in the elderly/unfit population, the anti-BCL-2 agent venetoclax in combination with a hypomethylating agent (HMA) has clearly become the standard of care. Initial phase 1 data demonstrated that this therapy is safe and effective at inducing remission, with an overall CR/CRi rate of almost 70%, although this varied significantly by molecular subtype (16) . Additionally in this study, the large majority of patients with CRi obtained transfusion independence of red cells (80%) and of platelets (93%) with a median time to response of 1.2 months and best response of 2.1 months. Recently presented abstract data from the phase 3, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled study of azacitidine plus venetoclax vs. azacitidine plus placebo confirmed these results and showed an overall survival of 14.7 months vs. 9.6 months, respectively (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.52-0.85, p < 0.001) (17) . However, in spite of its efficacy, this treatment regimen can have significant side effects, namely profound and/or prolonged neutropenia. This increased risk of infectious complications must be weighed heavily when deciding to initiate treatment in this vulnerable population. Overall, given the strength of this combination to induce remission and, importantly, to provide transfusion-and therefore outpatient infusion clinic-independence, we consider the initiation of HMA and venetoclax in older, unfit patients a priority even during the current pandemic, especially for patients who are transfusiondependent at diagnosis.",

Transitioning programs that were previously delivered face-to-face to virtual media platforms can be done quickly and with relatively low expense. At the SKCC, multidisciplinary collaboration between social workers, palliative and supportive medicine providers, financial counselors, and physicians has allowed us to continue to offer psychological, exercise, mindfulness, nutrition, survivorship, and support groups to patients and their family members remotely. Partnerships with local organizations have also served as a means to connect patients to low or no cost WIFI resources, provide technology support, and deliver groceries and other essentials to patients in their homes.",

No patients have delayed induction, consolidation, or transplantation, and there have not been any confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in our AML patient population.",

Furthermore, 3 patients with AML aged 39, 61, and 66 received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (15) . Several AML patients with fever went to the ER and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Two patients aged 51 and 72 with relapsed AML waiting for reinduction chemotherapy tested positive; they were admitted to the intensive care unit and rapidly died due to interstitial pneumonia. When lockdown ended, it became known that 3 other elderly AML patients cared for primarily at MNH had died due to COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia in other hospitals in the Marche region. All AML patients with active disease and SARS-CoV-2 died due to interstitial pneumonia. No AML patient in follow-up at our site had SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

However, through the rapid development of a set of overarching principles to guide care, changes in standard practices have been implemented in order to protect patients and staff. At both the SKCC and MNH, these principles have hinged on (1) continued provision of standard AML treatment for patients who are curable or require immediate intervention; (2) deferment of treatment for stable, incurable patients; and (3) delivery of robust supportive care services through innovative mechanisms. The SKCC approach has also relied heavily on the utilization of outpatient care (including telehealth and home visits) whenever possible, while MNH has opted for an inpatient isolation protocol. We recognize the need to revise and refine these practices as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, and as we plan for the post-pandemic era of AML care.",
