            "text": "Signaling mechanisms underlying the sexual isolation of species are poorly understood. Using four subspecies of Drosophila mojavensis as a model, we identify two behaviorally active male-specific pheromones. One functions as a conserved male anti-aphrodisiac in all subspecies and acts via gustation. The second induces female receptivity via olfaction exclusively in the two subspecies that produce it. Genetic analysis of the cognate receptor for the olfactory pheromone indicates an important role for this sensory pathway in promoting sexual isolation of subspecies, in collaboration with auditory signals. Surprisingly, the peripheral sensory pathway detecting this pheromone is conserved molecularly, physiologically and anatomically across subspecies. These observations imply that subspecies-specific behaviors arise from differential interpretation of the same peripheral cue, reminiscent of sexually conserved detection but dimorphic interpretation of male pheromones in D. melanogaster. Our results reveal that, during incipient speciation, pheromone production, detection and interpretation do not necessarily evolve in a coordinate manner.",

Divergence in sexual signalingmale traits and female preferences (Lande, 1981; Ritchie, 2007) has been proposed as one of the significant forces that results in reproductive isolation (Mayr, 1942) . This divergence is more pronounced in allopatric populations as a by-product of ecological adaptation to different environments (Endler, 1992; Nosil, 2012; Seehausen et al., 2008) . However, despite numerous documented interspecific sexual traits and preferences in animals, the genetic and neural correlates of their evolution remain elusive (Arguello and Benton, 2017; Smadja and Butlin, 2009) .",

Flies identify consubspecific mating partners through integration of different sensory modalities such as vision, audition, olfaction, and gustation (Markow and O'Grady, 2005) , which promote courtship of appropriate mates and inhibit courtship of inappropriate partners. Insights have been gained regarding the evolution of different sensory modalities that relate to the interspecific variations in male traits or female perception among drosophilids (e.g., vision (Manoli et al., 2005) , audition (Ding et al., 2016) , and taste (Ahmed et al., 2019; Seeholzer et al., 2018) ). However, even though many studies have reported the diversity of volatile pheromones in drosophilid males (Symonds and Wertheim, 2005) , the evolution of the corresponding neural changes remains uninvestigated.",

            "text": "In D. melanogaster, sex pheromones are detected by chemosensory receptors (e.g., odorant receptors (ORs)) (Auer and Benton, 2016) expressed in sensory neurons housed in hair-like structures called sensilla. Volatile pheromone-responsive ORs represent an ideal set of candidate genes to address the evolutionary basis of various sexual traits in drosophilid flies due to several reasons. First, pheromone ORs are expected to be the fastest evolving chemosensory receptors, with new receptors emerging either by sequence variation or gene loss/duplication (Guo and Kim, 2007) , to match the dramatic diversity of pheromones among closely related species (Symonds and Wertheim, 2005) . Second, the neural processing of some drosophilid pheromones (e.g., (Z)-11-octadecenyl acetate (cis vaccenyl acetate, cVA) in D. melanogaster) in the brain is well understood (Auer and Benton, 2016) . Third, pheromone ORs are narrowly tuned to fly odors and govern instant, robust and distinct behaviors via labeled-line circuitry (Dweck et al., 2015; Ejima et al., 2007; Kurtovic et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2011) . Fourth, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that express pheromone ORs target sexually-dimorphic pheromone-processing units (i.e., antennal lobe glomeruli) (Kondoh et al., 2003; Kurtovic et al., 2007) . Finally, out of 52 OSN classes in D. melanogaster (Benton et al., 2009; Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005; Grabe et al., 2015) , only four pheromone ORexpressing OSNs (Or67d, Or47b, Or65a/b/c and Or88a) are localized in a particular sensillum type (trichoid) (Couto et al., 2005) . This small number compared to other non-pheromone-detecting OSNs (Couto et al., 2005 ) makes a comprehensive evolutionary study feasible.

            "text": "One remarkable drosophilid is D. mojavensis, which represents a model of incipient speciation and host adaptation (Matzkin, 2014) . This species has four geographically-isolated and ecologically-distinct populations (Etges, 2019) (taxonomically classified as subspecies (Pfeiler et al., 2009) ) that diverged ~0.25 million years ago (Etges, 2019; Matzkin, 2014) ( Figure 1A ). The northern subspecies D. moj. wrigleyi and D. moj. mojavensis use prickly pear cacti in Santa Catalina Island and red barrel cactus in the Mojave Desert, respectively, as host fruit. The southern subspecies D. moj. sonorensis and D. moj. baja breed and feed on the organ pipe cactus in the mainland Sonoran Desert and the agria cactus in the Baja California, respectively (Heed, 1978; Ruiz et al., 1990) . Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the two northern subspecies and the two southern subspecies clustered with each other ( Figure 1B ) (Allan and Matzkin, 2019) . These closely-related subspecies exhibit many differences in their morphology (Pfeiler et al., 2009) , neurophysiological responses (Crowley-Gall et al., 2016; Date et al., 2013; Nemeth et al., 2018) , genomic and transcriptomic characteristics (Allan and Matzkin, 2019; Matzkin, 2014; Matzkin and Markow, 2013) , and behavioral traits (Newby and Etges, 1998) . Experimental reciprocal crosses between these allopatric subspecies resulted in viable fertile offspring, indicating presence of prezygotic isolation mechanisms (Knowles and Markow, 2001; Krebs and Markow, 1989; Markow, 1991; Zouros and Dentremont, 1980) . Previous evidence suggested that cuticular hydrocarbons contribute to this isolation barrier (Etges and Ahrens, 2001) , but no specific chemicals have been isolated. Here we identify these pheromones and elucidate the evolution of the underlying sensory mechanisms across subspecies to reveal the neurogenetic basis of incipient speciation.",

D. mojavensis subspecies displayed comparable courtship rituals including a novel traitdropping behaviorin which males release a fluidic droplet from their anus while licking the female's genitalia ( Figure S1 ). We asked whether the females of the different subspecies are able to distinguish their consubspecific males by offering a female of each subspecies the choice to mate with a consubspecific male or a male of one of the other three subspecies ( Figure 1C ). Competition experiments between the two northern subspecies revealed that females did not distinguish consubspecific and hetersubpecific males ( Figure 1C ). By contrast, southern females strongly preferred to copulate with their consubspecific males ( Figure 1C ). Both northern and southern females efficiently discriminated northern and southern males ( Figure 1C ). These results suggest that while a complete sexual isolation barrier has been established both between the northern and southern subspecies, and between the southern subspecies, the northern subspecies are not yet completely sexually isolated.",

We discovered four previously unknown malespecific acetates (Figure 2A and Figure S2A ) as (R) and (S) enantiomers of (Z)-10heptadecen-2-yl acetate (R&S-HDEA), heptadec-2-yl acetate (HDA) and (Z,Z)-19,22octacosadien-1-yl acetate (OCDA). Males of all four subspecies carried OCDA, while only males of the northern subspecies produced HDEA (both R and S enantiomers in similar ratio ( Figure S2B -C)) and HDA (Figure 2A and Figure S2A ). The chemical profiles of the virgin females were similar among the different subspecies, whereas mated females carried male-specific compound(s), indicating that these are transferred from males to females during mating (Figure 2A and Figure S2A ). Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) (Kaftan et al., 2014) analyses to directly visualize pheromones on the fly body (see STAR Methods for details), we confirmed the existence of OCDA on the male and mated female surfaces, but not on the virgin female ( Figure S2D -E).",

Colored bars and error bars indicate mean amounts and SEM of the three male-specific acetates (n=5 males per age); grey dashes indicate the percentage of copulation success for males of the same age within a 10minute time window (n=25 males per age). See Figure S2A for details regarding the body wash extracts analyzed by GC-MS and Figure S2F for the production site of these male-specific compounds. We next investigated whether production of the male-specific compounds correlates with male sexual maturity and copulation performance. Chemical analysis of male profiles from 0 to 24 post-eclosion individuals indicated that males of the four subspecies exhibit high abundance of the acetate(s) together with an increased copulation success from the 7 th day on ( Figure 2B ). We conclude that the identified male-specific acetates define the maturity status of males.",

The identical chemical profiles of the northern subspecies and of the southern subspecies led us to focus our attention on one representative for each group. Consistent with a role of male-transferred compounds during mating, males of D. moj. wrigleyi and D. moj. sonorensis spent more time courting virgin than mated consubspecific females ( Figure 3A ). To test which, if any, of the identified compounds contribute to courtship reduction, we perfumed virgin consubspecific females with one of the four male-specific compounds. Only OCDA treatment of females led to a significantly reduced male courtship index ( Figure 3B and Figure S3A ). groups; * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01, Mann Whitney U test, n=40. Males and females used in this and other panels are 10 days old. B, Top: Schematic of a male courting a dead virgin female of the same subspecies perfumed with hexane as a control (black) or OCDA diluted in hexane (light green). Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc correction. Ns P > 0.05; * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01, n=40 assays. See Figure S3A for the role of the other male-specific acetates in male courtship suppression in both subspecies. C, Left top: micrograph of tarsal segments of the foreleg showing different sensory hairs. Scale bar = 50 \u00b5m. Right top: schematics of tip recordings from the foreleg tarsal sensillum (class 5b). Bottom: tip recording measurements from foreleg-tarsi of D. moj. wrigleyi and D. moj. sonorensis males using DMSO or OCDA. Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc correction. Ns P > 0.05; ** P < 0.01, n=5. See Figure S3C for tip recording traces and Figure S3D for electrophysiological responses to the other male-specific acetates. D, Courtship indices of tarsi-less males tested with a dead virgin female of the same subspecies perfumed with hexane (black) or OCDA (light green To investigate how males detect OCDA, we first tested the volatility of malespecific acetates (including OCDA) by collecting headspace samples of D. moj. wrigleyi males ( Figure S3B ). This revealed that only R&S-HDEA and HDA are volatile ( Figure S3B ) indicating that the non-volatile OCDA is likely to be detected by gustation. During courtship, neural inputs from foreleg gustatory sensilla are used to evaluate the potential mating partner (Spieth, 1974) . We therefore investigated whether male foreleg tarsi detect OCDA ( Figure 3C ). Indeed, OCDA, but not other acetates, elicited a response in a subset of tarsal sensilla (class 5b) of both D. mojavensis subspecies ( Figure 3C and Figure S3C -D). Consistent with these sensilla mediating detection of OCDA, males lacking their tarsi spend equal time courting the hexane-perfumed and OCDA-perfumed females ( Figure 3D ). We conclude that OCDA has a conserved function among the D. mojavensis subspecies, is detected by tarsal gustatory sensilla and acts as an anti-aphrodisiac signal that suppresses male courtship.",

Males were perfumed with one of the four male-specific acetates or hexane. Copulation success did not differ between the acetate-and hexane-perfumed males in both subspecies ( Figure 4A and Figure S4A ). However, females of D. moj. wrigleyi were significantly quicker to accept the R-HDEA-perfumed males ( Figure 4B and Figure S4B ). We extended this analysis by performing competition assays, in which a virgin female of each subspecies was allowed to choose between two consubspecific males perfumed with hexane or with one of the four acetates. Only R-HDEA-perfumed males exhibited copulation advantage over the controls in D. moj. wrigleyi and D. moj. mojavensis, while D. moj. sonorensis and D. moj. baja females had comparable preferences between the two males ( Figure 4C and Figure S4C -D). These results indicated that R-HDEA increases sexual receptivity in females of northern but not southern subspecies.",

Unexpectedly, D. moj. sonorensis has a sensillum with identical response properties ( Figure 4E -F and Figure S4E -H) even though this subspecies neither produces nor responds behaviorally towards R-HDEA .

            "text": "To define the genetic basis of R-HDEA detection in D. mojavensis subspecies, we focused on receptors expressed in trichoid OSNs, which were previously shown to detect pheromones in D. melanogaster (Couto et al., 2005; Dweck et al., 2015; Kurtovic et al., 2007; van Naters and Carlson, 2007) . Five orthologous genes are present in the D. moj. wrigleyi genome (Guo and Kim, 2007) : Or47b1, Or47b2, Or65a, Or67d and Or88a ( Figure S5A for terminology and details). We first visualized their expression in the antenna of D. moj. wrigleyi and D. moj. sonorensis by RNA in situ hybridization and detected expression for all receptors with a slightly increased number of Or65a and Or67d-expressing cells in D. moj. wrigleyi ( Figure 5A -B). We then asked which of these ORs is responsible for R-HDEA detection by functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes ( Figure 5C ) and could detect significant depolarization upon R-HDEA application for OR47b1 and OR65a ( Figure 5D and Figure S5B ). To validate these results, we generated transgenic flies expressing D. moj. wrigleyi ORs individually in vivo in the at1-neuron of D. melanogaster lacking its endogenous receptor OR67d (Kurtovic et al., 2007) (decoder neuron) ( Figure 5E ). SSR analysis of these flies revealed that OR65a is the sole detector for R-HDEA and HDA ( Figure 5F and Figure S5C ). As predicted by the similar responses of at4 sensilla to R-HDEA and OR65a sequences among both subspecies ( Figure 4E -G and Figure S5G ), transgenic expression of OR65a of D. moj. sonorensis in the decoder neuron revealed comparable responses to R-HDEA ( Figure 5G ). Together, we conclude that D. moj. wrigleyi and D. moj sonorensis detect R-HDEA via OR65a.",

Or65a mutant females completely lack responses to R-HDEA in at4 sensilla ( Figure 5I ), and display no preference for R-HDEA-perfumed males ( Figure 5J and Figure S5D ). These findings confirm OR65a is responsible for the increased female receptivity in D. moj. wrigleyi towards consubspecific males. We next analyzed the targeting pattern of Or65a OSNs to glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL). Comparative morphological analyses revealed a high similarity in the basic architecture of this olfactory center in D. moj. wrigleyi and D. moj. sonorensis ( Figure 6A , Movie S5-6 and File S2-3) with at least three glomeruli not present in the well-characterized AL of D. melanogaster (Table S1 and Figure  S6A ). Previous genetic tracing of at4 OSNs in D. melanogaster revealed projections to three glomeruli: Or47b neurons to VA1v, Or88a neurons to VA1d and Or65a/b/c neurons to DL3 (Couto et al., 2005) . To label these neurons in D. mojavensis subspecies, we backfilled at4 sensillum neurons with a fluorescent dye. In both D. moj.",

Female preference for its consubspecific male was greatly reduced ( Figure 7A ' and Figure S7A ).

Despite this instructive role of R-HDEA in mate discrimination, we observed that D. moj. wrigleyi Or65a mutant females (which cannot detect R-HDEA) still display strong preference for consubspecific males ( Figure 7B ), indicating that other cues must exist. Previous reports revealed that subspecies-specific songs during courtship induce mate recognition among D. mojavensis subspecies (Etges et al., 2007; Etges et al., 2006) . We therefore investigated whether auditory inputs are sufficient to mediate mate recognition. Aristaless D. moj. wrigleyi females -lacking an essential part of the antennal auditory organ -still exhibited normal preference to aristaless consubspecific males over aristaless hetersubpecific ones ( Figure 7B') . However, aristaless, Or65a mutant females exhibited a major loss in the recognition of consubspecific males ( Figure 7B '').

This dramatic change in the males profiles is surprising given the relatively short divergence time between D. mojavensis subspecies (Etges, 2019; Matzkin, 2014) . However, although these subspecies utilize different host cacti in nature (Matzkin, 2014) , in our study they were bred on the same food suggesting that the different chemical profiles are not a consequence of nutrition and genetically inherited. The male-specificity and sexual transfer of these acetates resembles cVA in D. melanogaster, which is produced by the ejaculatory bulb and transferred to females during mating. Our data reveals that the opposite cVA-promoted behaviors among sexes (Kurtovic et al., 2007; Zawistowski and Richmond, 1986 ) -inhibiting male and inducing female mating behaviorsare mediated by two different compounds in D. mojavensis ( Figures 3B and 4B ). While R-HDEA induces female receptivity in the subspecies producing it, OCDA is present and suppresses male courtship in all D. mojavensis subspecies. Consistent with OCDA-induced behaviors, a recent study (Chin et al., 2014) showed that D. mojavensis males avoid courting females perfumed with ejaculatory-bulb extracts of mature males.",

Our results address a longstanding mystery of the modalities that mediate prezygotic isolation between D. mojavensis subspecies. Through a combination of behavioral competition experiments, genome engineering, and arista removal ( Figure  7) , we reinforced that the dedicated R-HDEA-sensing neurons and auditory cues are co-mediating mate recognition in D. moj. wrigleyi. In contrast, R-HDEA did not induce any behavioral change in D. moj. sonorensis females that rely only on auditory cues (i.e., the subspecies-specific song (Etges et al., 2006) ) for mate recognition. The striking change of R-HDEA-induced behaviors ( Figure 4C and Figure S4D ), despite its conserved peripheral sensory pathway ( Figure 5E and 6B-C), implies upstream modulations in the processing pathways among D. mojavensis subspecies. These findings are concordant with dissimilar cVA-promoted behaviors among sexes of D. melanogaster (Kohl et al., 2015) , likely because of dimorphic wiring in the central brain (Kohl et al., 2013; Ruta et al., 2010) in both sexes.",

To our knowledge, although males of D. melanogaster and some Hawaiian Drosophila species have been shown to attract females over distance by releasing pheromones in fecal droplets (Mercier et al., 2018; O'Grady and Markow, 2012) , releasing droplets during close courtship has not been described for drosophilid flies yet. We demonstrate that D. mojavensis subspecies males advertise their presence by producing a droplet of anal secretions in close proximity to females ( Figure S1 ). In D. moj. wrigleyi, this droplet contains the volatile sex pheromone R-HDEA ( Figure S2G ) that increases female receptivity. Such a trait might be supportive to the observed sexual behavior of D. mojavensis in nature, where males occupy undamaged areas next to the necrotic feeding sites on cacti and attract females to this spot (O'Grady and Markow, 2012) .",

Here, we demonstrate a distinct modification in the peripheral perception of D. mojavensis, compared to D. melanogaster, of the newly-identified pheromones. Accordingly, we demonstrate that the diverged OR65a orthologs of both species ( Figure S4J ) have different functional properties; the D. melanogaster-Or65a is not detecting the best ligand of D. moj. wrigleyi OR65a, R-HDEA, and vice versa ( Figure 4E and Figure S4I ). In line with the functional divergence, the number of Or65 copies is frequently changing along the Drosophila phylogeny (Guo and Kim, 2007) , indicating that the variation at this locus could be important for the evolution of novel olfactory channels (Guo and Kim, 2007) .",

Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first correlation between anatomical difference and divergent behaviors of homologous neurons. Or65a neurons that in D. melanogaster and D. mojavensis maintain orthologous receptor expression (Or65a) and sensillum identity (at4) have evolved novel projection patterns in the AL, with Or65a targeting DL3 in D. melanogaster and VA8 in D. mojavensis. The intriguing wiring of the Or65a in D. mojavensis indicates that it could be partnering with another subset of second-order neurons responsible for the different type of sexual behaviors: Or65a mediates female receptivity in D. moj. wrigleyi, whereas it inhibits female attraction toward cVA in D. melanogaster (Lebreton et al., 2014) .",

Briefly, the GC-MS device (Agilent GC 7890A fitted with an MS 5975C inert XL MSD unit; www.agilent.com) was equipped with an HP5-MS UI column (19091S-433UI; Agilent Technologies). After desorption at 250 \u00b0C for 3 min, the volatiles were trapped at -50 \u00b0C using liquid nitrogen for cooling. In order to transfer the components to the GC column, the vaporizer injector was heated gradually to 270 \u00b0C (12 \u00b0C/s) and held for 5 min. The temperature of the GC oven was held at 50 \u00b0C for 3 min, gradually increased (15 \u00b0C/min) to 250 \u00b0C and held for 3 min, and then to 280 \u00b0C (20 \u00b0C/min) and held for 30 min. For MS, the transfer line, source and quad were held at 260 \u00b0C, 230 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C, respectively. Eluted compounds for this and the following analyses were ionized in electron ionization (EI) source using electron beam operating at 70 eV energy and their mass spectra were recorded in positive ion mode in the range from m/z 33 to 500. Anal-droplets of courting males were collected on cover glass (22 \u00d7 22 mm, Cat. No.: 631-0126, https://uk.vwr.com) and then analyzed by TD-GC-MS. The structures of the newly identified acetates were confirmed by comparing their mass spectrum with synthesized standards. Hexane-body washes analysis by GC-MS. Fly body extracts were obtained by washing single flies of the respective sex, age and mating status in 10 \u03bcl of hexane for 30 min. For GC stimulation, 1 \u03bcl of the odor sample was injected in a DB5 column (Agilent Technologies; www.agilent.com), fitted in an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph, and operated as described previously (Stokl et al., 2010) . The inlet temperature was set to 250 \u00b0C. The temperature of the GC oven was held at 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, increased gradually (15 \u00b0C/min) to 250 \u00b0C, which was held for 3 min, and then to 280 \u00b0C (20 \u00b0C/min) and held for 30 min. The MS transfer-line, source and quad were held at 280 \u00b0C, 230 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C, respectively. Average amounts of HDEA, HDA and OCDA from individual flies were quantified by comparing their peak areas with the area of hexadecane (10 ng), which was added to the fly extract as an internal standard.

Due to the relative high volatility and weaker ionization of R&S-HDEA and HDA compared to OCDA, only OCDA signals were detected in the MSI spectra. Moreover, OCDA was predominantly present in a form of [M+K] + adducts . Delayed extraction time was 500 ns. Compound's desorption/ionization was realized by nitrogen UV laser (337 nm, 4 ns pulse of maximum 320 \u03bcJ and frequency of 20 Hz). Matrix ions were suppressed with a low mass cut-off set at m/z 150. Samples of the flies were fixed on their backs and processed as described previously (Kaftan et al., 2014) . The number of laser shots per spot was optimized and set to 60 (128 \u03bcJ/shot). The range of the measured masses was set from m/z 100 to m/z 1000. Data were collected with MassLynx 4.0 software and processed with custom-made software MALDI Image Convertor (Waters, UK) to obtain spatially differentiated data. These data were exported to the BioMap software (Novartis, Switzerland) and converted to 2-D ion intensity heat maps. All samples were analyzed in positive ion mode and imaged using a step size of 100 \u03bcm. Methanolic solution of LiDHB and LiVA (in case of copulated flies) matrix in a concentration of 20 mg/mL was sprayed on the fly samples by an airbrush. For one sample, 0.4 mL of LiDHB/LiVA matrix solution was used to form approximately 25 layers. Waiting time between two consecutive sprays was 3s. Lithium 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate (LiDHB) and lithium vanillate (LiVA) matrix were synthesized as described previously (Cvacka and Svatos, 2003; Horka et al., 2014) . Polyethylene glycol oligomers (with an average molecular weight of 200, 300, 600 and 1000 Da) for calibration of the mass spectrometer were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich as well as precursors of the LiDHB and LiVA. Potassiated adducts of OCDA at m/z 487 evinced a negative mass shift which was observed within a range from m/z 0.05 to m/z 0.3 between measurements. Fly odor analysis by Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME). Volatiles were collected from 20 D. moj. wrigleyi males trapped in a mesh inside a capped 4 ml glass vials with polytetrafluoroethylene-lined silicone septa (Sigma, 23242-U) to preclude flies contact to the SPME fiber (grey hub plain; coated with 50/30 \u00b5m divinylbenzene/carboxen on polydimethylsiloxane on a StableFlex fiber, Sigma, 57328-U). SPME fiber was exposed to the trapped flies for 1 h at room temperature. The SPME fiber was then retracted and immediately inserted into GC-MS system (Agilent 7890B fitted with MS 5977A unit) as operated previously (Date et al., 2013) . The inlet temperature was set to 250 \u00b0C. The temperature of the GC oven was held at 40 \u00b0C for 3 min and then increased gradually (5 \u00b0C/min) to 280 \u00b0C, which was held for 10 min. Perfuming flies with hexane or male-specific compounds. Males and female flies were perfumed with the acetates singly diluted in hexane or hexane alone as previously described (Dweck et al., 2015) . Briefly, each fly was coated by ~1-3 ng of the compound of interest after evaporating the hexane under nitrogen gas flow. Flies were transferred to fresh food to recover for 2 h and then introduced to the courtship arenas or subjected to GC-MS analysis to confirm the increased amount of the perfumed acetate.",

Sensilla types were localized under a microscope (BX51WI; Olympus) at 100x magnification and identified by diagnostic odors stated in Key Resources Table. The extracellular signals originating from the OSNs were measured by inserting a tungsten wire electrode in the base of a sensillum and a reference electrode into the eye. Signals were amplified (Syntech Universal AC/DC Probe; Syntech), sampled (10,667.0 samples/s), and filtered (300 -3,000 Hz with 50/60 Hz suppression) via USB-IDAC connection to a computer (Syntech).

The odorant was delivered by placing the tip of the pipette 2 cm away from the antennae. Neuron activities were recorded for 10 s, starting 2 s before a stimulation period of 0.5 s. Responses from individual neurons were calculated as the increase (or decrease) in the action potential frequency (spikes/s) relative to the pre-stimulus frequency. Traces were analyzed by sorting spike amplitudes in AutoSpike and then analyzed in Excel and processed in Adobe Illustrator CS (Adobe systems, San Jose, CA).",

Male flies (8-10 day old) were immobilized in pipette tips, and the foreleg was fixed with Scotch tape onto a glass coverslip. A reference glass electrode filled with Ringer's solution (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) was inserted into the thorax of the fly. The different tarsal sensilla were stimulated by placing a glass capillary filled with OCDA (10 \u00b5g) dissolved in DMSO on the sensillum tip. The recording electrode was connected to a pre-amplifier (TastePROBE, Syntech, Hilversum, The Netherlands), and the signals were collected and amplified (10x) by using a signal-connection interface box (Syntech) in conjunction with a 100-3000 Hz band-pass filter. Action potentials measurements were acquired with a 9.6 kHz sampling rate and analyzed with AutoSpike. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis. Total RNA from single flies of D. mojavensis subspecies and from 100 antennae was extracted using an RNA isolation kit (Directzol TM RNA MiniPrep, Zymo Research). First strand cDNA was generated from 1.0 \u00b5g of total RNA, using oligo-dT20 primers and Superscript TM III (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Derived cDNAs were used to amplify housekeeping and olfactory receptor ORFs via PCR with MyTaq\u2122 DNA Polymerases (Bioline) and primers listed in Key Resources Table. PCR amplicons were cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. Sequence alignment. Available (flybase, https://flybase.org) and generated (in our study) protein-coding regions of Or65a and Or47b were analysed in Geneious (v11.0.5). Briefly, a multiple sequence alignment was generated using the MAFFT (v7.309) tool with E-INS-I parameters and scoring matrix 200 PAM / K=2 as previously described (Katoh and Standley, 2013) . The final tree of OR65a orthologs was reconstructed using a maximum likelihood approach with the GTR+G+I model of nucleotide substitution and 1000 rate categories of sites in Fasttree (v2.1.5). The tree was visualized and processed in Geneious. Functional analysis of receptor genes in Xenopus oocytes. Oocyte injections and two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were described previously (Zhang and Lofstedt, 2013) . Briefly, the open reading frames of D. moj. wrigelyi Or47b1, Or47b2, Or65a, Or67d, Or88a and Orco were amplified from D. moj. wrigelyi cDNA using primers (Key Resources Table) adding BamHI (fwd) and XbaI (rev) restriction sites, and a Kozak sequence (GCCACC) immediately upstream of the first ATG. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and sub-cloned into the expression vector pCS2+. Maxi preps of recombinant plasmids were linearized with NotI and transcribed to cRNAs with mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). X. laevis (purchased from Xenopus Express France, Vernassal, Haute-Loire, France) oocytes were defolliculated with 1.5 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) in Oocyte Ringer 2 solution (82.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgC12, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5). cRNAs of each OR together with D. moj. wrigelyi ORCO cRNA (50 ng each) were co-injected into the oocytes and incubated at 18 \u00b0C for 3-5 days prior to recordings. Stock solutions of the tested compounds were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and diluted to the indicated concentrations with Ringer's buffer (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 5 mM MgC12, 0.8 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6). The compounds mentioned in Key Resources Table were applied to the oocytes successively at a rate of 2 ml/min with extensive washings by Ringer's buffer in the intervals. Whole-cell inward currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp with a TEC-03BF amplifier (npi electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany) at the holding potential of -80 mV.

In brief, both sense and antisense digoxigenin (DIG) RNA probes were generated for each odorant receptor gene using a DIG-RNA labeling kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. See Key Resources Table for details about the oligonucleotides' sequences. RNA probes were hydrolysed (60 mM Na2CO3, 40 mM NaHCO3, pH 10.2) at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h, ethanol precipitated and stored in formamide at -80 \u00b0C until use. Heads of D. moj. wrigleyi and D. moj. sonorensis females were cold fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% Tween 20 in 1x PBS) for 1 h and then washed 3x 10 min in PBST (1x PBS, 0.1% Tween 20). Third antennal segments were dissected into cold fix, washed 3x 10 min in PBX (1x PBS, 1% Triton-X) and incubated for 2 h in hybridization (Hyb) buffer (50% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.05 mg/ml heparin, 0.1% Tween 20). Antennae were hybridized overnight at 55 \u00b0C using appropriate RNA probe(s) and the next day washed 5x 2 h in Hyb buffer at 55 \u00b0C, with the last wash leading to overnight incubation at 55 \u00b0C . A wash of 20 min in Hyb buffer at 55 \u00b0C, and 3x 10 min wash in PBST at room temperature were subsequently performed. Antennae were incubated in 1:500 anti-DIG-POD (in PBST and 1x BSA) for 3 h followed by 3x 10 min wash in PBST. Samples were then incubated in TSA-Plus Cyanine 5 (Cy5) according to manufacturer instruction (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) for 70 min followed by 5x 10 min washes in PBST. Samples were subsequently suspended in 80% glycerol for visualization using confocal microscopy. Confocal Z-stacks were acquired using a Nikon A1Rsi inverted confocal microscope.

Fly brain dissections and stainings were performed as described previously (Dekker et al., 2006; Grabe et al., 2016) with some modifications as follow: Brains were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at room temperature (RT), rinsed 3x 15 min in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (PT), followed by incubation with mouse monoclonal nc82 antibody (1:30, CiteAb, A1Z7V1) in 4% normal goat serum (NGS,) in PT (48 h at 4 \u00b0C). Samples were washed 4x 20 min in PT, incubated overnight with Alexa633-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:250, A21052, Invitrogen) in NGS-PT, rinsed 4x 20 min in PT and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired with a Zeiss 710 NLO Confocal microscope using a 40x or 63x water immersion objective. Reconstruction of whole ALs and of individual glomeruli (4-6 AL specimens for each sex/species) was performed manually using the segmentation software AMIRA version 5.6.0 (FEI Visualization Sciences Group). Identification of glomeruli was verified by comparing the reconstructed images to the map of D. melanogaster AL (Grabe et al., 2015) . Glomerular volume was calculated from reconstructed glomeruli and using the information on the voxel size from the laser scanning microscopy scans. OSN backfilling. Trichoid sensilla were identified by SSR using diagnostic odorevoked responses to R-HDEA for at4 or cVA for at1. After identifying the right sensillum, the recording electrode was removed and neurons were backfilled by placing the sensillum inside a glass capillary filled with neurobiotin (Invitrogen, 2% w/v in 0.25 M KCl). Neurobiotin was allowed to diffuse into the OSNs for 2 h. Brain staining was performed as described above, and neurobiotin was visualized using streptavidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500, S32355, Invitrogen). Due to its position we name the novel glomerulus innervated by at4 neurons in D. mojavensis VA8. VA8 is located ventrally to VA1v and anterior to VL2a in an area far off the DL3 glomerulus normally targeted by at4 neurons in D. melanogaster. Scanning Electron Microscopy. Antennal scans were performed as previously described (Grabe et al., 2016) .

The backfill image corresponds to a projection of 28 Z-stacks (Watch Movie S9 (Grabe et al., 2015) . D. mojavensis-specific glomeruli are written in red (i.e., they are not present in D. melanogaster).

Subsequently, males tapped the females' bodies with their forelegs, followed by wing spreading and fanning for vibrational song production. Females responded to the males' song by vibrating their wings. Males followed the females by extending their proboscis to lick the females' genitalia and then attempted copulation. Males while courting the female in addition released a fluidic droplet from their anus. We called this novel trait \"dropping behavior\". In response to the rapid male courtship elements, females slow down their movement, quiver their abdomen, vibrate their wings and scissor them as signs for acceptance, while kicking with legs or accelerating the movement speed to signal rejection.
