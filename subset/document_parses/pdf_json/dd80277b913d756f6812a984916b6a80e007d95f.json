For example, the policy included measures for raising public awareness, training gatekeepers, enhancing collaboration with private organizations, and establishing a medical care coordination system by which primary care providers can refer depressive patients to a psychiatrist [1, 2] . As a consequence, the number of annual suicides started to decrease across Japan, falling below 30,000 in 2012, with a relatively large decline in the suicide rate from 24.0 in 2011 to 21.8 in 2012 [2] . However, although the rate continued to decrease to 16.0 by 2019, it still remains the highest among the G7 countries [2] . It is also of concern that suicides in Japan will possibly increase again due to the COVID-19 pandemic [6, 7] . Since there have been few studies to provide an explanation for the suicide decline in Japan [8] , it appears necessary to clarify the factors that contribute to the decrease in suicides in order to take appropriate suicide prevention measures in the future.",

As one of the pillars of suicide prevention, the countermeasure of connecting untreated high-risk for suicide individuals with adequate psychiatric treatment was taken, thereby increasing the rate of psychiatric care for groups at high risk of suicide. Thus, improvement of the psychiatric treatment rate for high-risk suicide groups during the period of suicide decline may have contributed to their decrease in number in Japan. However, the effect of improved psychiatric treatment rates on suicide reduction has not been verified, as it is impossible to examine longitudinal changes in psychiatric treatment rates in suicide cases based on police reports or psychological autopsies in Japan in terms of viability [1, 9, 10] .",

However, whereas the number of suicides decreased significantly in males aged 40 and older, the number of suicide attempters did not change significantly in either gender. Regarding such discrepancies, it is known that suicide is more common among middleaged and older males and attempted suicide is more common among young females in Japan [1, 2] . In this study, as in previous reports, the number of suicides was higher among older adults and was more maledominant, whereas the number of suicide attempters was greater among young adults aged 20-39 and was more female-dominant. Compared to suicide deaths, the number of suicide attempters was relatively low among men and the elderly.

In contrast, no significant improvement was observed in the female group, but this may have been due to their originally high rate of psychiatric treatment. Psychological autopsy studies in Japan reported that 44.1 to 50% of individuals who died by suicide were treated by psychiatrists [9, 10] . Psychiatric treatment rates for those who committed suicide have been lower than those for attempted suicides during the period of decline. Longitudinal studies of psychiatric treatment rates among suicides are not available, but psychiatric treatment rates of those among suicide deaths may have increased during periods of declining suicides.",

This result suggests that improved psychiatric treatment rates among males in this age group may have contributed to the reduction in the number of suicides in Tokyo. There is considerable evidence that measures for connecting untreated populations in need of treatment with psychiatric care are effective in preventing suicide [18, 19] . Several psychiatric treatments, such as pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, have been shown to be effective in preventing suicidal behavior [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . A high rate of psychiatric consultation may indicate the severity and persistence of psychopathology among serious suicide attempters and/or that mental health services are being adequately provided. Additionally, contact with mental health professionals may have mitigated the lethality of the attempts. On the other hand, the number of suicides is still high, and further efforts should be made. There is a need to further improve treatment to prevent suicide for those who come under psychiatric care. For example, when a psychiatric healthcare provider identifies a patient at risk for suicide, it may be necessary to coordinate the patient's access to problem-solving support (e.g. financial, legal and employment support), and to provide care in collaboration with support groups. It will be important for psychiatric institutions that identify such patients to provide case management [24] and to work with support groups to prevent suicide.",

On the other hand, the elderly group with the highest number of suicides in both males and females had the lowest rate of receiving psychiatric treatment, and they showed no improvement in their psychiatric treatment rate. The elderly population consists of those who are more prone to physical illness and suicide risks such as loneliness and lack of social support, and lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also be involved in increasing some of these problems [25] . These results indicate that those at high risk for suicide among the elderly population may be receiving insufficient psychiatric care, and in fact this issue may require urgent attention.",

Although suicide attempters are transported to our emergency department from a broad area, this does not cover the whole Tokyo area. So, these study fields do not exactly match. Our study was conducted as a single-site survey. This will also be a limitation of the data representativeness when it is used as a reference for taking future suicide countermeasures. Thus, surveys in a broader area and multicenter collaborative studies with larger numbers of subjects will be necessary to solve these limitations. In this survey, although we focused on the relationship between the psychiatric treatment rate and the number of deaths by suicide, the contributions of other psychosocial factors and economic factors that have been indicated as also being related to suicide were not examined. Furthermore, we did not include variables related to the subject, such as the history of suicide attempts or their means. The addition of these data to the analysis may allow a more detailed description of the phenomenon of suicidal behaviour.",
