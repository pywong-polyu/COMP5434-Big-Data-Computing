The findings of this paper include: The decrease in SO 2 concentration during the lockdown indicates a reduction in pollutant emissions from industry and households. During the lockdown, road traffic in Beijing reduced by 46.9 %, while the concentrations of PM2.5 and NO 2 in the atmosphere reduced by 5.6 % and 29.2 % respectively. The MPCR of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO 2 concentrations are 11.9 % and 62.3 %, respectively. The concentration of O 3 did not increase significantly with the decrease of PM2.5 and NO 2 concentrations. The findings of this paper provide a reference for city managers to evaluate the contribution rate of Beijing's road traffic to air pollutants and to formulate reasonable emission reduction policies.",

A large number of local emissions and geographical conditions (as shown in Fig. 1 ) result in serious air pollution in Beijing. In order to control the air pollution problem, Beijing has adopted a series of measures, including the use of electricity for heating in rural areas instead of coal , and the replacement of coal-fired with gas-fired thermal power plants. This has improved Beijing's air quality, but there are still certain gaps with the air quality guidelines specified by the WHO. For example, the average PM2.5 concentration in Beijing in 2017 was 58 \u03bcg/m 3 , which was 35 % lower than 89.5 \u03bcg/m 3 in 2013, but this concentration level is still much higher than the 10 \u03bcg/m 3 air quality guideline specified by the WHO.",

Road traffic is considered an important source of PM2.5 and NO 2 (Shekarrizfard et al., 2017; Tang, McNabola, & Misstear, 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) , and it has an important impact on the concentration of O 3 . found that secondary aerosols, solid fuel combustion, dust and marine aerosols are the principal pollution sources of PM2.5, accounting for about 46.1 %, 22.4 % and 13.0 % respectively, and vehicle emissions could be the main anthropogenic source of secondary aerosols in Beijing. Hua et al. (2020) found that heating is the main source of PM2.5 and vehicles are the main source of NO 2 in Beijing. Because of the lockdown, road traffic in Beijing has dropped sharply, which provides us with a rare opportunity to study the impact of road traffic on atmospheric pollutants through experiments. This will provide a natural, experimental basis for Beijing to formulate reasonable road traffic policies and ultimately realize the sustainable development of the city. This paper creatively puts forward the concept of the MPCR and estimates the Maximum Possible Contribution Rate (MPCR) of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO 2 by analyzing the daily air pollution data and road traffic data in Beijing from January 24 to March 31, 2020 and the same period in 2019. The results show that the PM2.5 concentration during the lockdown dropped by 5.6 % compared with the same period last year, and the NO 2 concentration dropped by 29.2 %. This, combined with the road traffic data obtained on Baidu, finally infers that the MPCR of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO 2 are 11.9 % and 62.3 %, respectively. In addition, we found that the O 3 concentration did not increase significantly during the lockdown. The reason for this phenomenon may be due to more rainfall and snowfall during the lockdown and the decrease in the concentration of CO, a precursor of O 3 .",

Quantitative conclusions are often drawn by using simulation methods. This is related to the fact that the influencing factors related to air pollution are too complicated and uncontrollable in real life. Usually, we only need to know the approximate value of a certain pollution source's contribution rate to guide the formulation and implementation of policies, and it is not necessary to accurately calculate the contribution rate. Therefore, this paper creatively puts forward the concept of the MPCR. When a major change occurs in a pollution source, and other influencing factors have a positive impact on a pollutant, the change in the concentration of this pollutant can be regarded as having been completely caused by this pollution source. The MPCR of this pollution source to the pollutant can be obtained. Although this method cannot obtain an accurate contribution rate, it greatly simplifies the calculation process. The MPCR can prevent us from overestimating the impact of a certain pollution source, and has a strong reference value for the formulation and implementation of emission reduction policies. At the same time, as long as the conditions for the use of this method can be met, other cities in the world can also use this method to calculate the MPCR of a certain pollution source to pollutants, so as to guide the city to formulate a reasonable emission reduction policy.",

This may be related to the reduction of PM and NO x concentration (Laurent et al., 2020; Pierre et al., 2020) . The concentration of O 3 did not increase significantly may be caused by the following reasons: (1) there was more rain and snow during lockdown, and the cleansing effect of rain and snow would reduce the O 3 concentration in the atmosphere; (2) during the lockdown, the CO concentration dropped by 9.1 % compared with the same period in the previous year's ( Table 5 ). As one of the important precursors of O 3 , the decrease of CO concentration will inhibit the production of O 3 .",

The MPCR of this pollution source to the pollutant can be obtained.

However, the climatic conditions in both years were not exactly the same. Compared with the same period in 2019, the weather conditions in 2020 were more conducive to reducing the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere. In addition, during the lockdown, the SO 2 concentration dropped by 37.4 %. Through the analysis of pollution sources, it is inferred that the pollutants discharged into the atmosphere by industry and households during the lockdown have been reduced. During the lockdown period of this study, travel intensity in Beijing was reduced by 46.9 %, while the PM2.5 concentration and NO 2 concentration in the atmosphere were reduced by 5.6 % and 29.2 %, respectively. When it is assumed that the decrease of PM2.5 and NO 2 concentrations is caused entirely by the decrease of road traffic, the MPCR of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO 2 concentrations is 11.9 % and 62.3 %, respectively. Road traffic is the most important pollution source of NO 2 , but not the most important pollution source of PM2.5.",
