Using the 2016 American National Election Studies dataset, we build on the literature regarding \"egotropic\" and \"sociotropic\" economic concerns to distinguish between \"micro\" insecurity (perceived insecurity regarding the individual's own personal economic well-being), and \"macro\" insecurity (negative expectations concerning the macro economy). Our results suggest micro insecurity is not significantly correlated with attitudinal differences, but macro-level insecurity is associated with increased levels of political distrust, accompanied by greater authoritarianism. Greater macro-level insecurity is also associated with more negative feelings toward \"out-groups\" (e.g. Muslims, the LGBTQ+ community, feminists, immigrants) and was a key predictor in reduced affinity for Hillary Clinton and the rise in support for Donald Trump. Results are robust to controls for political affiliation and aggregate macroeconomic indicators, suggesting that rising levels of income inequality and weakening social safety nets increase political polarization and encourage xenophobia, racism, and homophobia.",

A particularly sharp contrast in the rhetoric of recent elections was that between the theme of \"hope\" in Obama's 2008 US Federal Election campaign and the very different slogan of Donald Trump in 2016 to \"make America great again\". Trump's appeal to traditionalism was, as Jacobson (2017) notes, in glaring contrast to an ideology of openness and quite different from the historic dichotomy of \"left\" versus \"right\", which had previously centered on normative beliefs regarding the appropriate size of government. 1 Indeed, given that Democratic administrations constructed most of the American social safety net while Republicans had historically advocated policies of austerity and shrinkage of the welfare state, a conundrum of the 2016 US election was why so many disadvantaged Americans, who would benefit from greater social protection, voted for the Republican candidate.",

Was the 2016 election outcome, in part, driven by a sense of betrayal at the failure of the Obama administration to deliver on those promises of change? 2 Could it be that the \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) movement should be read as a different, less optimistic, type of response to the same basic problem -that the voters who want to restore \"Greatness\" (by voting for Trump) really want to restore the sort of society in which people \"like me\" can be secure in prosperity and social status?",

            "text": "A central theme of discussion regarding the 2016 US election results focuses on debates between the \"left behind\" 3 and \"deplorables\" 4 perspectives, which have differing implications. Although not mutually exclusive, the \"left behind\" argument emphasizes the frustrations of low-educated workers (particularly in \"Rust Belt\" regions) with American public policy (non)response to the long-term decline in their real wages and job security along with the trend to an increasingly unequal society. The implication is that greater economic security and rising real wages might reduce the MAGA appeal -and public policy changes, like a greater monetary policy emphasis on full employment, can address such issues. However, the \"deplorables\" perspective, in stressing the long historic roots of the resentments of advantaged groups (e.g., white males) at perceived relative gains of those historically disadvantaged by race, ethnicity or gender, is more pessimistic about policy options. It is not entirely clear how public policy can directly eliminate embedded racist, xenophobic, misogynist or homophobic attitudes -but the public policy option of pandering to such beliefs by ignoring the restricted advancement of disadvantaged groups is deeply unattractive. This paper tests a hypothesis which has elements in common with both approaches: that rising levels of economic insecurity underlie both increased resentment of \"out-groups\" and greater distrust of the political elites who supported macroeconomic policies (such as free trade agreements) which are widely seen as causing these insecurities. We hypothesize that these greater resentments and this increased distrust have produced a populist response characterized by authoritarian politics. Using a rich set of outcomes within the most recent wave (2016) of the American National Election Studies (ANES), our paper therefore extends the literature on the implications of economic insecurity regarding political distrust.",

            "text": "What evidence is there that greater economic insecurity might shift attitudes? As Hacker (2006) notes in The Great Risk Shift, there has been a general increase in economic insecurity in the US, dating back to the 1980s. Historically, when it was common for firms to offer long-term employment contracts and defined benefit pension plans, employers shouldered much of the economic risk associated with market dynamics. Such institutional arrangements have shrunk dramatically in prevalence, offloading risk to labour. Anderson (2018) also argues that since the 1970s, declining unionization, policies favouring capital (i.e., increasing its share of national income), and rising earnings inequality have favored the rise of populist parties and resentment of so-called \"out-groups\". Similarly, McCarty et al. (2006) find that income inequality and political polarization have increased in unison since the 1970s. Moreover, Inglehart and Norris (2017) note that increased insecurity promotes in-group solidarity along with the rejection of outsiders and a rising authoritarianism response. Using the 2008 wave of the ANES survey, Wroe (2016) finds that economic insecurity is associated with a reduction in political trust -suggesting an increased level of disdain for those in power. Likewise, Wroe (2014) notes that job insecurity predicts a lower level of trust in political institutions and the democratic process.",

Linz (1964) suggests that authoritarianism encompasses political regimes characterized by: (i) limited political pluralism, (ii) a lack of guiding ideology, (iii) no political mobilization, and (iv) a leader exercising power within poorly defined limits. Similarly, Gasiorowski (1990) defines authoritarianism as a regime \"in which a strong, charismatic, manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower class groups\" (p. 115) and Przeworski (1991) note it rests \"mainly on lies, fear, or economic prosperity\" (p. 58). In the seminal work on this topic, Adorno et al. (1950) point to increased aggression toward \"out-groups\" and more widespread prevalence of prejudice and anti-democratic behaviour as indicators of a political landscape more prone to give rise to an authoritarian regime. Guiso et al. (2017) suggest that right-wing populist political parties position themselves as champions of \"the people\" against the elite, while pandering to the fears of their supporters and advocating short-term protectionist strategies.",

Greater anxiety can stem from either a greater probability of an adverse event or greater loss from a given event (or both). Greater incidence and longer duration of unemployment both imply more economic insecurity -e.g., recessions increase insecurity because they produce an increased probability of job loss and a greater cost of job loss as a result of longer unemployment spells. Economic insecurity differs conceptually from \"risk\" or \"volatility\" in earnings, which include the chances of upside as well as downside future events. Although past events are the only evidence that is available to people in forming their expectations, 5 economic insecurity is driven by fears about the future -i.e., by future downside hazards (Osberg 2015) .",

The political science literature on the impact of economic concerns on voting behavior has drawn a distinction between egotropic and sociotropic evaluations -i.e. , in the context of economic insecurity, between \"micro-level\" insecurity about one's personal situation and \"macro-level\" insecurity driven by perceptions of the economy. 6 Lockerbie (2006) has argued that: \"voters look at what is in their wallet, untangle what is the government's responsibility and what is others' responsibility, and vote on the basis of what is in their wallet (or not there) that is attributed to the government\" (p. 194). The empirical survey article of Lewis-Beck and tegmaier (2013) concludes that: \"generally speaking, the economic vote, at the micro-or macro-levels, has statistical and substantive significance in democratic political systems\" (p. 381) and \"Clearly, sociotropic evaluations overwhelm egotropic ones. The relatively strong impact of sociotropic retrospective evaluations seems equally clear\" (p. 370). 7 The underlying motivations for sociotropic voting and political preference have been debated. It is possible that when questions are phrased in \"macro\" terms, it may be psychologically easier for respondents to blame \"the government\" or \"the economy\" than to call into question their individual capabilities or prior decisions. 8 Perhaps self-interested respondents recognize that many policy outcomes that are good for the country (like low unemployment) are also good for them. Or respondents could be, to some degree, altruistic and community-minded.",

In modern societies, there are many different levels of identity and a crucial question is whether economic trends, like greater insecurity, are driving an increasingly intolerant and xenophobic narrowing of self-identification. Steenvoorden and Wright (2019) have argued that \"uncertainty increases the need for people to seek reassurance from the collectivity, either via group identification per se or the adoption of group-derived values and norms\" (p. 8) and that \"sociotropic uncertainty mitigates multiple identification. Which types of sociotropic uncertainty are likely to matter? ... political distrust, negative economic expectations and societal pessimism\" (p. 9). They conclude: \"sociotropic uncertainty mitigates multiple political identification, because it makes people seek certainty by embracing simplified identity profiles that more easily mitigate uncertainty. Political distrust, negative economic expectations and societal pessimism all go hand-in-hand with selective (rather than multiple) political identification\" (p. 21). Consistent with that, Mughan et al. (2004) suggest that sociotropic job insecurity had a larger impact than egotropic insecurity in increasing the probability of voting for the populist party, One Nation Party, in Australia. Moreover, Mughan and Lacy (2002) find that poor evaluations of sociotropic job insecurity were predictive of Americans rejecting both major candidates in the 1996 federal election. This is a particularly striking result as it occurred during an era of robust economic growth, not unlike that of 2016.",

The drivers of economic insecurity for the working age population are very different. While our results cannot therefore necessarily be extrapolated to the entire US electorate, our sample is representative of roughly four-fifths of the adult population. 9 Respondents were interviewed twice: (i) just prior to the election (between September 7 and November 7) and (ii) shortly after the election (between November 9 and January 8). With the exception of distrust, the outcome variables were observed after the election, while the micro-and macroeconomic variables were collected prior to the election. This timing helps assure, without fully obviating all concerns related to consistency bias, hindsight bias, or simultaneity bias, that views on authoritarianism, out-groups, and political party support were not revised to fit any newly-chosen political attitudes. 10",

Predictors of sociotropic or \"macro-level\" insecurity are based on whether the respondent, in 2016, believed the economy: (i) is worse off than 12 months ago, (ii) will be worse in 12 months, and (iii) is currently bad. Each predictor is evaluated on a 5-point scale, increasing in agreement with these descriptions of the economy. 12 Since each question predicts an aspect of economic insecurity about possible negative events, thus contributing to some facet of undesirable risk (R), we extract the first principal component from our respective micro-and macro-level variables to derive two synthetic predictor variables for economic insecurity, 13 such that: 11 See: Feldman and Stenner (1997) ; Stenner (2005) ; Hetherington and Weiler (2009); Hetherington and Suhay (2011) . 12 Our use of predictors of economic insecurity can be seen as similar to the use of self-perceived health status as an outcome variable in health economics, since self-perceived health is not a measure of \"health\" (itself a multifaceted concept) or a physical or physician-generated diagnostic measure of health, rather it is a predictor of health. 13 As presented in \"Appendix\" Table 7 , only the first component has a significant eigenvalue (i.e., in excess of 1), which captures the component's variance relative to the variance of the included variables.

Specifically, sociotropic factors may be endogenously determined as rationalizations of political sentiment (Kinder and Kiewiet 1979; Tormos 2019) . We therefore control for party identification by including Republican and Independent dummy variables (Democrat being the reference category) and also analyze attitudes across affiliations separately. Moreover, to examine whether there is sufficient variation in our macroeconomic insecurity variable, such that its influence can be detected even among strong political identifiers, \"Appendix\" Fig. 7 presents two kernel density plots of macro insecurity attitudes among the top quartile of Democrat and Republican party supporters (using the ANES 100-point feeling thermometers). Notably, there is considerable macro insecurity variation even among the most ardent Democrat and Republican supporters, which reassures us that our macro insecurity index is not merely repurposed partisanship. 15 Additionally, we control for a set of socio-economic variables which include education (equal to one if the respondent had a high school education or less; zero otherwise) and income. Within the dataset, the income variable consists of 28 categories, with the final option top-coded at \"$250,000 or more\". With the exception of the top-coded category, we derive a dollar measure of income by computing the mid-point of each category. Since the Pareto distribution has been repeatedly found to provide a good fit in estimation of the top tail of the income distribution, income for those in the top-coded category is derived assuming that the expected value (y) for this category is:",

As one might expect, the dummy variable for self-reported Republicans has clearly the largest impact on pro-Trump/anti-Clinton attitudes. This parallels the work by Margalit (2019), who suggests that while factors such as rising economic insecurity may have tipped the balance in favour of Trump, the largest predictor of support for the Republican nominee was partisanship. However, the magnitude of impact of more macroeconomic insecurity is large relative to several other variables often identified as important in the literature -macro insecurity has a roughly similar size impact as that of visible minority status (although in reverse direction of association), and is greater than that of born-again fundamentalism, and in the case of men, having high school education or less.",

Thus, for respondent i from region j, we can control for the jobless rate of persons with a similar education, living in the same congressional district. Results are presented in Table 3 and suggest that the inclusion of an objective macroeconomic variable has virtually no effect on our key results. Although the jobless rate has some independent impact, the magnitudes are much smaller than the subjective macroeconomic insecurity index.

But regardless of functional form, it would appear that while microeconomic insecurity is usually not significant, macroeconomic insecurity is -a finding primarily driven by past and present evaluations of the economy.",

Reagan and Thatcher were politicians of the 1980s. But the decades since have seen widespread factory closures and stagnant or declining real wages for working class Americans. 24 Donald Trump's 2016 pledge to \"Make America Great Again\" was very different in focus -sociotropic, in fact.
