Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, might improve outcomes by mitigating inflammation. We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to the University of Washington Hospital system with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen. Outcomes included clinical improvement, defined as a two-point reduction in severity on a six-point ordinal scale or discharge, and mortality within 28 days. We used Cox proportional-hazards models with propensity score inverse probability weighting to compare outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. We evaluated 43 patients who received tocilizumab and 45 who did not. Patients receiving tocilizumab were younger with fewer comorbidities but higher baseline oxygen requirements. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with reduced C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and temperature, but there were no meaningful differences in time to clinical improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-2.22) or mortality (aHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21-1.52). A numerically higher proportion of tocilizumab-treated patients had subsequent infections, transaminitis, and cytopenias. Tocilizumab did not improve outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, this study was not powered to detect small differences, and there remains the possibility for a survival benefit.",

            "text": "Treatment with corticosteroids, which suppress immune responses nonspecifically, has not been shown to improve outcomes with other severe respiratory viral infections or acute respiratory distress syndrome in the general population. 10 However, recent clinical trial data demonstrate a mortality benefit of low dose dexamethasone for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, 11 supporting the notion that hyperinflammation contributes to disease pathogenesis among patients with severe COVID-19 disease. The increasing use of cytokine-specific immunomodulatory agents in other conditions has led to intense interest in the use of these agents for COVID-19. The rationale for use of immunomodulatory therapies in patients with COVID-19 is extrapolated from the experience in CAR-T cell therapy recipients, in whom IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab (Actemra) can rapidly attenuate symptoms of CRS. 4 In this context, tocilizumab does not appear to independently increase risk for infection, 12, 13 although infectious complications are reported with chronic use in rheumatoid arthritis, 14 particularly with concurrent immunosuppressants. Cytokine blockade for hyperinflammatory syndromes is supported by additional lines of evidence, including the finding that treatment with recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra (Kineret), may improve outcomes in patients with MAS-like features in the setting of sepsis. 15 Since the beginning of the pandemic, multiple observational reports have suggested that tocilizumab improves respiratory, radiological, and inflammatory parameters associated with COVID-19, although there are conflicting results with regard to clinical outcomes. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Observational studies using either another anti-IL-6 receptor antagonist, sarilumab (Kevzara), or anakinra have shown similar findings. [30] [31] [32] [33] The safety of immunomodulatory therapy in the context of an active infection remains incompletely understood; IL-6 is an essential aspect of immune control for many viral infections, but overproduction of IL-6 may be detrimental to viral clearance and survival. 8, 34 Results from a randomized controlled trial indicate that tocilizumab did not result in reduced mortality or need for mechanical ventilation, 35 although there was evidence for shorter duration of hospitalization and intensive care unit stays in preliminary results from another trial, 36 and the incidence of adverse events were similar to the placebo groups. There remains a critical need to understand the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19.",

The clinical utility of directed immunomodulatory agents to preempt or reverse the cytokine-driven inflammation responsible for much of this morbidity has biological plausibility, 41 [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] One of the largest and most rigorous studies in mechanically ventilated patients indicated a significant survival benefit, despite a higher incidence of infections in the tocilizumab group. 26 However, these studies are limited by residual indication bias among those receiving tocilizumab. Rapidly evolving improvements in supportive care strategies may also confound findings of better outcomes with tocilizumab over time. The first available data from randomized controlled trials of tocilizumab in moderately ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in North America did not meet their primary endpoints for a reduction in intubation or death among patients randomized to tocilizumab. 35 In a larger trial, there was evidence for a shorter duration of hospitalization and intensive care unit stays. 36 Patients receiving tocilizumab did not have an increased incidence of adverse events in either trial.",

Higher baseline severity status in the tocilizumab cohort, as well as other differences in patient characteristics, resulted in imbalances in the patient cohorts. To control for some of these differences, we compared outcomes within baseline severity categories and performed IPTW adjusted analyses. For most comparisons, we were limited to detecting relatively large differences. To avoid instability in the models, we did not include chronic lung disease, which only affected three individuals in the tocilizumab group, or hydroxychloroquine, which does not affect outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Although the use of remdesivir may have affected our findings, it was used in a minority of participants, and blinded receipt of remdesivir versus placebo was balanced across the two cohorts. The observation that tocilizumab was used in sicker patients indicates opportunities for larger studies of earlier administration. Given that obesity is a risk factor for worse outcomes with COVID-19 and that more than half of our participants had a body mass index greater than 30, weightbased dosing could be considered to attain more standardized drug exposure across patients. Strengths of this study include the relatively large cohort of patients requiring noninvasive and invasive oxygenation, along with careful adjustment for differences in patient characteristics and other confounders. We performed an RMST analysis for time to clinical improvement that is novel to studies of tocilizumab for COVID-19 and provide a tangible measure of treatment effect. 39 We performed comprehensive chart review and data abstraction to describe and analyze a variety of clinical and laboratory outcomes to evaluate the potential benefits and side effects of tocilizumab therapy, including novel comparisons of thrombotic events and resolution of sepsis physiology.
