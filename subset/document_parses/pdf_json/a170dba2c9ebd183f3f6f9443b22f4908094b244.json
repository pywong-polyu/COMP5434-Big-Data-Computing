Liver cirrhosis causes portal hypertension and this in turn leads to the common complication of varices in the oesophagus, which are prone to haemorrhage [2] , a very difficult experience for patients and clinicians. It is important that patients with oesophageal varices (OV) are monitored given their increased risk of variceal haemorrhage [2] . Monitoring is by endoscopic assessment of the size and appearance of the varices as both directly affect the risk of VH or death. Despite the advances of medical, endoscopic and radiological therapy the mortality rate from acute VH is 10%-20% [3] . Prevention of VH is therefore vital in those who have varices. The current evidence base and international recommendations identify a clear benefit in the reduction of VH with non-selective beta blockade (NSBB) in patients with moderate-large varices (>5mm in diameter), or those with advanced liver disease [4] . There is however currently no clear evidence to guide the use of NSBB in patients with small varices. The Beta-blockers Or Placebo for Primary Prophylaxis of oesophageal varices (BOPPP) trial is a phase IV, multi-centre Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) that aims to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of using Carvedilol and placebo in the prevention of variceal bleeding for small OV in patients with cirrhosis. Patients are assessed for trial eligibility following detection of small OV at gastroscopy and those found to be eligible (all patients with small (grade 1) OVs due to cirrhosis of any cause) are invited to take part.",

This is important as successful conduct of all RCTs depends on recruiting the required number of participants [6] . The challenge of trial recruitment is a long-established concern that is widely acknowledged, with factors that influence recruitment being well documented (i.e., additional demands of the trial, lack of staff and training, concerns about the impact on the clinical relationship, uncertainty about information and consent and lack of rewards and recognition) [7] [8] [9] [10] . While studies on recruitment form a large part of qualitative research in trials, research that gathers the views of both staff and patients is important, because staff and patients offer different expertise and perspectives [11, 12] . Conducting a qualitative study within the BOPPP trial (a trial that is aligned to standard of care visits and without obvious risks or demands on staff and patients) provides valuable learning and allows us to broaden the focus of recruitment barriers and facilitators across different system actors and system-levels. The broad aim of this qualitative study was to gain an understanding of the particular recruitment circumstances and conditions of the BOPPP trial, by gathering the views of staff and patients. The specific objectives of the qualitative study were to 1) to explore patient perspectives on factors that influence RCT recruitment, 2) to understand factors that influence the success of recruitment from the staff perspective, and 3) to identify opportunities for tailored interventions to improve trial recruitment.",

However, heterogeneity was sought in the sample (for example, those who declined participation as well as those who enrolled on to the trial, and those who were successful and less successful in recruiting participants to the trial) so that convergence and divergence could be examined within the sample. Incentive payments, which were not considered unduly influential, were offered to those who declined to enter the trial to advance the goals of the study [17] . Participants were over 18, and proficient in English.",

Patient interviews explored their views on trial recruitment including the acceptability of randomisation and other possible barriers and enablers associated with the proposed intervention and trial. Patients who declined to enter the trial were also asked for their reasons for declining participation. Staff were asked about their recruitment experiences including barriers and facilitators to recruiting patients with small oesophageal varices and cirrhosis. Prompts based on the TDF were used to consider factors related to the cognitive, affective, social and environmental influences on behaviour should they have relevance to the participants' narrative [16] . However, the TDF was used flexibly to allow a natural narrative flow to the interview and to enable participants to share information that was important to them [20] . A narrow approach to applying the TDF could have meant that contextual information around how wider determinants of behaviour interact would be lost. The patient and staff interview schedules were revised iteratively in response to the priorities and concerns of participants and are included in S2 File. Interviews were conducted by telephone or face-to-face by the lead author (a post-doctoral qualitative research fellow in applied health and population research, with a clinical background in Occupational Therapy), lasted around 45 minutes, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Researcher reflexive notes were kept after each interview to consider the interaction with the participant, and to detail initial thoughts. Interviews were conducted by the lead author between September 2019 and September 2020.",

Data analysis began with individual-level case-by-case repeated re-reading of interview transcripts and re-listening of sound files for data immersion (CL).

Each theme was refined, and where data allowed, further sub-themes were developed. Thematic maps, visual representations of the themes, were used to organise the themes by clustering all codes according to connections in the data and by considering the patterns and relationships between themes. An initial coding frame for patients and for staff was developed and interpretive analysis was then undertaken to group the themes and sub-themes into overarching themes. Additional codes, refinements to the specifics of themes, and thematic patterns continued until theoretical saturation was achieved [21] . Thematic saturation occurred when the emergent themes had been fully explored and new data was easily accommodated within them. Comparisons between participant groups were explored and the two coding frames were integrated to provide the final coding framework. The themes were then mapped to the TDF domains to provide a theoretical understanding of factors that influence recruitment practices.",

To optimise recruitment, trial teams must consider their context, and understand and respond to their patient population and condition, accounting for specific vulnerabilities that the patient group may have. In the case of the BOPPP trial, the patient group is dominated by alcohol-related cirrhosis with a risk of variceal bleeding, sometimes leading to fatal consequences for patients. Our findings identify trust as a non-TDF domain and demonstrate that the context of a caring, existing clinical relationship supports successful recruitment; staff are invested, responsive and aware of the specific risks and want to find solutions for patients. This finding challenges previous concerns about the impact of research participation on the clinical relationship. Pragmatic trials, that is trials designed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in real-life practice, especially those involving unpredictable populations require staff expertise in building trust, and a deep knowledge of the patient group and their vulnerabilities. A collegiate approach to trial recruitment is essential to support staff in their endeavour [24] .",

If a trial is introduced when the patient doesn't have capacity to think about it (i.e., too soon after diagnosis) or asks the patient for extra action when it is burdensome (i.e., managing health needs), there is disruption to the natural rhythm. Therefore, the rightness of timing in terms of environmental context and resources as well as when people are receptive to information, to engagement and to action (beliefs about consequences/capabilities/emotion) impacts the success of recruitment [25] . For the BOPPP trial, some patients were eager for information and action, and it fitted with their need to do something for themselves and/or for others. Stigma is common among patients with cirrhosis, often resulting in decreased healthcare-seeking behaviours [26] . However, our findings challenge this notion, and suggest that in some situations, where people might perceive that blame and shame are attached to their condition, a feeling of helping oneself, as well as being seen to help oneself provides an impetus for being involved in research. Where this is possible, patients who take part in research feel valued and staff value having more time to spend with patients. Alongside this, ongoing feedback and communication enables patients to remain involved (also supporting trial retention). Previous research also identifies a willingness to help others and to contribute towards furthering medical knowledge as reasons to be involved in participating in trials [7] .",

Staff goals and views on the value of research, that is, a patient's right to be informed of research opportunities, influence their priority of informing patients about research opportunities. Staff knowledge and understanding (to provide a correct explanation of trial processes and rationale), the environmental context and resources (such as having time to be available at clinic appointments and being mindful of at what point in the system the information is given), and social influences (such as having existing relationships with patients) influence the ability and skill of staff to support patients to understand the trial information (thereby supporting patient memory, attention, decision processes) before patients can make a decision whether or not to take part. Staff beliefs of consequences for patients (for example, impact on quality of life (positive or negative) and of patient capabilities (for example, their views of the ability of patients to engage with research when managing existing health needs) will determine whether they inform patients about the research and give them the opportunity to participate. Alongside eligibility, patient suitability is determined by staff. This is an important insight, because on the one hand, being involved in research is a right of care, and benefits all patients by involving them more directly in their own care, yet on the other hand those patients who are already wellengaged and active in their own care are prioritised and approached for recruitment. The opportunity to benefit from research should be open to all which will mean challenging implicit biases, taking time with recruitment, and possibly accepting a lower retention rate. Pragmatic results are needed to capture the impact for all patients, and not just those who are considered suitable, to reflect the real-world unbiased patient population we are trying to evaluate and serve. The focus on suitability in terms of selection strategy to improve study adherence e.g., a good database also places emphasis on patients in terms of the failure of potential retention and not on trial design or the imbalance of power in making the decision of whether or not to take part.",

It is possible, however, to enhance transferability by describing the research context and assumptions, and by making connections between the analysis of participants accounts and claims in the extant literature. It is also important to note, that despite focused efforts to purposively recruit patient participants from minority ethnic backgrounds, experiences of those from these groups are underrepresented. This recruitment difficulty is echoed in literature where it is reported that those from ethnic minorities are less likely to participate in research [29] . While we were unable to specifically explore ethnic variations and barriers to trial recruitment, we found that researcher bias and judgement of patient suitability dictated those who are prioritised for recruitment. Another possible reason for non-participation is the risk that asking patients to take part in an additional qualitative study may inadvertently alienate them from their enrolment/retention in the clinical trial [30] . Staff also reported that the quality of relationships with patients is sometimes impacted by language barriers. Future strategies such as availability of interpreters, linguistic and ethnic matching, and an awareness of cultural practices and norms provide possible options for addressing these barriers [31] .",

This method was also invaluable in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where telephone interviews were conducted during lockdown with patients classed as clinically extremely vulnerable. The anonymity of telephone use can also allow participants to disclose sensitive information and there is no evidence to suggest that they produce lower quality data [33] . A strength of the study is the thorough and systematic application of qualitative methods, including triangulation with staff and patient perspectives, and the use of the TDF to inform data collection, analysis, and theoretically driven recruitment strategies.
