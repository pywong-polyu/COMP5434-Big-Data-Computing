Dengue severity is associated with host intense proinflammatory response and monocytes have been considered one of the key cell types involved in the early steps of DENV infection and immunopathogenesis. To better understand cellular mechanisms involved in monocyte infection by DENV, we analyzed the expression levels of 754 human microRNAs in DENV-infected THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. Eleven human microRNAs showed differential expression after DENV infection and gene ontology and enrichment analysis revealed biological processes potentially affected by these molecules. Five downregulated microRNAs were significantly linked to cellular response to stress, four to cell death/apoptosis, two to innate immune responses and one upregulated to vesicle mediated, TGF-b signaling, phosphatidylinositol mediated signaling, lipid metabolism process and blood coagulation.",

Particularly, an increased number of activated monocytes have been found on blood samples from severe cases suggesting a key role for this cell type during DENV immunopathogenesis (Durbin et al., 2008) . Monocytes play a central role in coordinating inflammation both by recruiting macrophages and dendritic cells and by inducing adaptive immunity (Jakubzick et al., 2017) . Moreover, monocyte recruitment, activation, and differentiation at the dermis contributes to the establishment of DENV replication sites during early steps of DENV infection (Schmid and Harris, 2014) .

MicroRNAs have also been described to play a role in cellular strategies to overcome viruses and vice-versa (Trobaugh and Klimstra, 2017) . To investigate whether DENV infection regulates microRNAs in monocytes, we assessed the expression pattern of 754-catalogued human microRNAs in the monocytic cell line THP-1 under DENV infection. Eleven cellular microRNAs were considered differentially expressed after infection. Associated pathways were identified by gene ontology analysis and the results suggest the involvement of human microRNAs in different cellular biological processes of known relevance in dengue pathogenesis, as well as others that have not yet been explored in the context of DENV biology. Together, our data suggest a role for human microRNAs during DENV infection in monocytes and highlight interesting candidates for further functional studies.",

The efficiency of each amplification reaction was calculated as the ratio between the fluorescence of the cycle of quantification and the fluorescence of the cycle immediately preceding that. The estimated efficiency of each microRNA was obtained by the mean of the efficiencies calculated for each amplification reaction of that microRNA.

We describe downregulation of miR-548 family members (hsa-miR548c-5p and hsa-miR548d-5p), which have already been reported to inhibit DENV 1-4 replication (Wen et al., 2015) . Authors have shown that endogenous miR-548g-3p suppresses DENV propagation, possibly by direct binding to the Stem Loop A (SLA) promoter in 5'UTR, hindering its interaction with NS5. Likewise, we found hsa-miR-34a-5p to be downregulated in response to DENV-2 infection. Interestingly, miR-34 family members display antiviral activity against flaviviruses, including DENV (Smith et al., 2017) . Moreover, miR-34a microRNAs may act as potent activators of interferon (IFN) response due to downregulation of the WNT/bcatenin signaling members WNT2 and WNT3, thereby promoting an antiviral state (Smith et al., 2017) . In addition, we found hsa-miR-30a to be up-regulated by DENV-2 infection in monocytes. A same-family microRNA, hsa-miR-30e-3p, is upregulated by DENV-2 infection in HeLa cells suppressing DENV replication by promoting NF-kB-dependent IFN production (Zhu et al., 2014) , so it is possible that a similar mechanism takes place in monocytes during DENV infection by hsa-miR-30a, but this needs to be confirmed by further functional studies.",

Activation of this receptor also increases expression of antigen presentation markers (such as HLA-DR and CD80) on human monocytederived dendritic cells (Bratke et al., 2007) . During viral infection, TRK signaling can also be subverted to promote expression of cellular replication machinery components, enzymes involved in nucleotide synthesis, ribosomal biogenesis, and autophagy regulation, all of which will optimize conditions for viral replication (Hondermarck et al., 2020) . In this context, it has been shown that inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) opposingly affects DENV replication and production of infectious virus particles (Cortese et al., 2019) . Hence, these receptors are targeted by viruses to improve their success of an infection, but they can also be pharmacological targets when their exact role is revealed. Although TRK receptors may affect DENV replication and related immune activation, to date, no data is available for their direct involvement in dengue pathogenesis. Our data, bring new insights in this unexplored issue and indicate that hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-548c-5p and hsa-miR-548d-5p may act regulating TRK receptor signaling during DENV infection in monocytes.",
