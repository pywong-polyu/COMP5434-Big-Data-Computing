Despite that conserved binding patterns for a few commonly used FGs have been reported in the literature, large-scale identification and evaluation of FG-based 3D binding motifs are still lacking. Here, we developed AFTME, an alignmentfree method for automatic mapping of 3D motifs to different FGs of a specific ligand through two-dimensional clustering. Applying our method to 233 nature-existing ligands, we defined 481 FG-binding motifs that are highly conserved across different ligandbinding pockets. Systematic analysis further reveals four main classes of binding motifs corresponding to distinct sets of FGs. Combinations of FG-binding motifs facilitate proteins to bind a wide spectrum of ligands with various binding affinities. Finally, we showed that these general binding patterns are also applicable to target-drug interactions, providing new insights into structure-based drug design.",

Comprehensive knowledge of protein-ligand interactions can not only provide important insights into biological functions of ligand-binding proteins but also greatly benefit drug discovery and development (Loewenstein et al., 2009; Paul et al., 2010) . Many proteins that don't display overall sequence or structure similarities may share similar local 3D structures and can bind to same or similar ligands, thus identifying conserved binding patterns across different ligand-binding proteins at 3D level could facilitate a better understanding of protein-ligand recognition (Abrusan and Marsh, 2018; Du et al., 2016; Persson et al., 2006) .",

Therefore, identification of conserved 3D binding motifs for FGs shared by different small molecules may extend our understanding of protein-ligand interactions to higher resolution and broader scope (Guvench, 2016) . Previous studies have shown that conserved 3D motifs do exist in proteins binding different ligands with the same FG. For example, the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) motif (Saraste et al., 1990; Via et al., 2000) , in which the residues are highly conserved in terms of amino acid types as well as spatial positions among diverse phosphate-binding proteins. Conserved 3D motifs were also reported for other FGs such as adenine ring (Denessiouk et al., 2001; Narunsky et al., 2020; Nebel et al., 2007) , heme group (Ferousi et al., 2019; Zubieta et al., 2007) and prosthetic groups (Nebel, 2006) . However, these motifs were either uncovered through manual analysis of a small set of protein structures by an expert (e.g. a crystallographer) or through structural alignment of proteins that bind FGs with rigid structures, which are subjected to limited FG types and/or biased datasets of 3D structures. Computational methods for automatic extraction of 3D binding motifs for a variety of FGs in large scale are still lacking.",

The basic assumption of this method is simple: if conserved binding pattern for a specific FG exists, the pattern-forming atoms should be spatially proximal to the corresponding FG and frequently co-appear, thus can be detected through clustering analysis of functional atoms from diverse protein pockets binding the same ligand. Fig.1A outlines the major steps of the method. (1) Given a set of protein pockets binding the same ligand, AFTME first parses all the functional atoms (FAs) (He et al., 2015) that are considered to interact with the ligand atoms (LAs). (2) Then a distance matrix is constructed that evaluates the spatial distances between FAs and LAs. (3) Based on the distance matrix, a twodimensional clustering algorithm is performed, through which LAs are clustered into different FGs at the first dimension and FAs are clustered into corresponding FG-binding motifs. (4) Each identified binding motif can be represented as a vector according to its chemical composition, which facilitate further analysis. The detailed description of each step is presented in Methods and Materials section.",

            "text": "Considering the abundance of studies on ATP-binding proteins, we first applied AFTME to a set of ATP-binding proteins as a proof of concept. As shown in Fig. 1B , our method identified three FA clusters or binding motifs corresponding to triphosphate group, ribose and adenine, respectively. The triphosphate-binding motif (M1) mainly consists of hydrophilic atoms from polar amino acids like ARG, LYS, SER, etc., and the adeninebinding motif (M2) is enriched by atoms from hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids including LEU, VAL, PHE, etc., whereas the ribose-binding motif (M3) contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids (Fig. 1C ). Further investigation of these binding motifs indicated that the AFTME identified FG-binding motifs are biological meaningful units. For instance, among the hydrophilic residues (rendered in red in Fig. 1D and Fig.  S1 ) interacting with the triphosphate group, LYS and SER are both well-known conserved residues in the P-loop, a common motif for phosphate-binding in ATP-and GTP-binding proteins, which is typically composed of a glycine-rich sequence followed by a conserved lysine and a serine or threonine (Saraste et al., 1990) . It was found that the hydrophobic and/or aromatic residues (rendered in green in Fig. 1D and Fig. S1 ) making up the adenine-binding motif interact with adenine ring through C-H-\u03c0 and/or \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. Notably, Moodie et al. described the recognition of adenine by proteins in terms of a fuzzy recognition template based on a sandwich-like structure formed by hydrophobic residues (Moodie et al., 1996) . Denessiouk et al. also found that bulky hydrophobic residues can form a hydrophobic area by interacting with the adenine base (Denessiouk and Johnson, 2000) . The A-loop motif, which includes aromatic residues forming \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with adenine ring was also reported (Ambudkar et al., 2006) . These findings are largely consistent with the AFTME identified adenine-binding motif. Although no well-defined motifs corresponding to the ribose-binding motif have been reported yet, it makes sense that hydrophobic/aromatic residues of the ribose-binding motif interact with five-carbon ring while hydrophilic residues interact with the extended hydroxyl groups through polar interactions.

The color encodes the distance between an FA and an LA. Three LA clusters corresponding to the triphosphate group, ribose and adenine ring of ATP were identified, respectively. Three FA clusters or binding motifs (M1, M2 and M3) corresponding to the above three FGs were also obtained simultaneously.

As we can see from the Venn diagram in Fig. 1E , among the 492 ATPbinding pockets in the dataset, a majority (388, 75.9%) contain all the three binding motifs. Nevertheless, 86 (16.8%) pockets get two of them, among which 57 (66.3%) carry the phosphate-binding (M1) and adenine-binding (M2) motifs, indicating that combination of two motifs, especially M1 and M2, is sufficient for ATP binding. Besides, we also noticed some cases in which only one binding motif together with one or more metal ions exists (Fig. S2) , indicating that metal ions may greatly affect the global binding profile. Next, we asked how different FG-binding motifs contribute to the binding affinity. All the ATPbinding proteins with experimental affinity data available were collected and sorted from high to low affinities (Table S1 ). In general, protein pockets in high-affinity (top 1/3) group contain more FAs than those in low-affinity (bottom 1/3) group (Fig. 1F , p=7.4e-03, Mann-Whitney test). Interestingly, when looking into an individual binding motif, only adeninebinding motif (M2) shows significant increment of FA numbers in high-affinity pockets (Fig.  1G , p=4.2e-03, Mann-Whitney test), suggesting that increase of hydrophobic interactions with the adenine ring makes major contributions to higher ATP binding affinity.",

We described each FG-binding motif using a 26-dimensional vector representing the proportion of 20 types of amino acids and 6 categories of atoms, respectively (see Methods and Materials). The vector representation of the FG-binding motifs enables correlation analysis of chemical composition for any pair of motifs. It was found that adenine-binding motif pairs showed significantly higher correlations than random FGbinding motif pairs (Fig. 2D ). Similar observations were obtained for ribose-binding ( Adenine-and ribose-binding motifs are extracted from ATP-, ADP-and AMP-binding proteins, and triphosphate-binding motifs are obtained from proteins binding ATP, GTP and UTP, respectively. (D-F) Pairs of (D) adenine-, (E) ribose-and (F) triphosphate-binding motifs show significantly higher composition correlation than motif pairs binding random FGs. (G) A schematic view of large-scale identification of FGbased binding motifs using AFTME, the L, G and M represent the Ligand, the FG and the Motif, respectively. (H) Correlation analysis of the 481 identified FG-binding motifs indicates that motifs binding the same FG are highly consistent in their composition. The center line, bounds of box and whiskers represent the median, interquartile range and 1.5 times interquartile range, respectively. The p-values were calculated using paired t-test. Next, we performed a large-scale analysis of 3D FG-binding motifs for all the ligands with abundant 3D structures available. As shown in Fig. 2G , we first derived all the 3D proteinligand structures from BioLiP database (Yang et al., 2013) . Redundant proteins binding the same ligand that show over 50% sequence similarity were eliminated using cd-hit (Li and Godzik, 2006) . 233 ligands with more than 5 structures available were kept for the following analysis. 481 FG-binding motifs corresponding to 160 unique FGs were identified using AFTME (Table S2) , among which 39 FGs appeared in multiple (at least three) ligands. For each FG present in multiple ligands, a conservation score (CS) of the corresponding FG-binding motif was calculated as the average of pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients among all the identified motifs binding this specific FG. And a corresponding p value was also calculated using permutation test (see Methods and Materials). As shown in Table 1 , most FG-binding motifs corresponding to FGs appeared in multiple ligands are highly conserved across different ligand-binding proteins (CS > 0.6, p < 0.05). Overall, two motifs binding the same FG show significantly higher composition correlations compared with two randomly selected motifs (Fig. 2H) , confirming the high conservation of FG-binding motifs. These lines of evidences showed that AFTME can be applied to detect binding motifs for a diversity of FGs. Importantly, the identified binding motifs are highly conserved among different ligand-binding pockets, laying the foundations for expanding limited 3D motifs to a broader range of ligands that are not suitable for AFTME analysis (e.g. due to lack of structure data) but sharing same or similar FGs with applicable ligands.",

Notably, the FGbinding motifs in different classes are featured with distinct physicochemical properties. The first class (red dots), denoted as the aromatic motif class, is enriched with atoms from aromatic amino acids like TRP, TYR and PHE. The second class (green dots), named the hydrophilic motif class, is mainly composed of hydrophilic, donor and acceptor atoms from polar amino acids such as ARG, LYS, ASP and GLU. The third class (blue dots), the mixed motif class, consists of both aromatic and hydrophilic atoms. The fourth class, named the hydrophobic motif class, is dominated by atoms from hydrophobic amino acids including LEU, ILE, VAL etc. (Fig. 3A ).",

Here, we sought to explore how combinations of different classes of FG-binding motifs will affect the ligand-binding affinity. Experimental binding affinity for all the protein-ligand pairs in our analysis were retrieved from the PDBbind database (Table S5 ) (Liu et al., 2015) . In the single-class mode, both the aromatic and hydrophobic combinations show significantly higher affinity than the mixed and hydrophilic combinations, suggesting that general hydrophobic interactions including \u03c0-stacking, C-H-\u03c0 interactions and interactions between two aliphatic carbons contribute more to high binding affinity than polar interactions such as hydrogen bonds and salt bridge (Fig. 4E) . Consistently, in the other two combination modes, the more hydrophobic interactions are involved, the higher affinity the ligand-binding achieve. For example, combination of the hydrophobic and aromatic motifs is the most efficient binding pattern in the double-class mode. Moreover, non-hydrophilic combinations get significantly higher affinity compared to combinations with hydrophilic motifs for both the double-class (Fig.   4F , p=2.4e-03, Mann-Whitney test) and triple-class modes (Fig. 4G, p=3 .42e-05, Mann-Whitney test). The results further supplemented our observation from the ATP-binding motifs (Fig. 1G ) and confirmed the findings in the previous studies that hydrophobic interactions are a driving factor for the increased ligand efficiency (Ferreira de Freitas and Schapira, 2017; Young et al., 2007) .",

To this end, we investigated in details of interactions between three well-defined drug targets and their small molecular inhibitors (Fig. S7A ). The first case is the kinase domain of BRAF, which is the target of vemurafenib, an FDA-approved small molecular drug for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation (Karoulia et al., 2016) . Four FAs clusters (motifs) were identified based on their spatial distances to LAs, that are well separated and mapped to different FGs of vemurafenib in 3D structure (Fig. 5A, 5B, Fig. S7B ). The first motif mainly consists of hydrophobic atoms and interacts with the chlorophenyl group through hydrophobic interactions. The second motif contains atoms from two aromatic amino acids (TRP and PHE) and contacts with the pyridinyl group through \u03c0-stackings. The third motif includes both hydrophobic and hydrophilic atoms engaged in the hydrophobic and polar interactions with the difluorophenylsulfonamide group. The fourth motif is dominated by hydrophobic atoms that interact with the propane group. The second case is the methyltransferase domain of DOT1L, which is the target of EPZ-5676, a small molecular drug in clinical trial for the treatment of adult acute leukemia (Stein et al., 2018) . Using the same approach, we found a hydrophobic motif (M1), a mixed motif (M2) and a hydrophilic motif (M3) in the ligand-binding sites of DOT1L, which correspond to three different FGs of EPZ-5676, i.e. methyl-adenine, ribose and methionine, respectively (Fig. 5C, 5D, Fig. S7C ). Lastly, we looked into the interactions between the main protease (Mpro) of COVID-19 and one of its potent inhibitor 11b (Dai et al., 2020) . We observed three well-separated motifs in the ligand-binding sites of the target protein, which are located proximal to the pyrrolidine, fluorophenyl and indole-carboxamide groups (Fig. 5E, Fig. S7D) . Notably, the interactions between the identified FG-binding motifs and the corresponding FGs also follow the general chemical rules: two hydrophobic motifs (M1 and M2) interact with two ring structures, the mixed motif (M3) interacts with the carboxamide (Fig. 5F ).",

However, many proteins that don't display overall sequence or structure similarities may share similar local 3D binding sites and can bind to same or similar ligands (Kahraman et al., 2007) . Thus, identifying conserved 3D patterns/motifs across different ligand-binding proteins serve as an efficient way to learn and predict protein-ligand interactions. Computational methods that rely on multiple structure alignments or pairwise pocket comparisons have identified many conserved 3D binding patterns across different protein pockets binding same or similar ligands (Dukka, 2013) . Despite the validity and usefulness of these ligand-based binding patterns, they mainly go for nature-existing ligands with abundant protein-ligand 3D structures, thus limiting their application scope. Here, we proposed AFTME, an alignment-free method for automatic identification of 3D binding motifs at the basis of FGs shared by different small molecules, which permits studying protein-ligand interactions in a wider scope and higher resolution. The application to ATP showed the feasibility and validity of our method to detect FG-based 3D binding motifs and confirmed the reusability of the motifs in different ligand-binding proteins. We further applied our method to 233 natural ligands and obtained 481 binding motifs for 160 unique FGs, providing useful resources for deep exploration of protein-ligand recognition.",

First, ligand-binding sites of a protein can be dissected into independent sectors corresponding to different FGs of the binding ligand. These FG-based binding motifs are highly conserved among different ligandbinding pockets at both amino acid and atom level. Second, we found four classes of FGbinding motifs with distinct physicochemical properties and their own preference for FG binding. Moreover, the interactions between 3D motifs and FGs follow some general rules. For example, a hydrophobic motif is more likely to interact with a hydrophobic FG and a hydrophilic motif usually recognizes a polar FG. Third, following the general motif-FG recognition map, protein pockets consisting of different FG-binding motifs can bind a wide spectrum of ligands through different motif combination modes. Of note is that protein pockets with more hydrophobic motifs tend to gain higher binding affinity. Although the FG-binding motifs are mainly derived from protein structures binding natural ligands, we showed that these motifs can also be applied to different drug-target interactions. Therefore, we expected that the global map of motif-FG interactions, together with the current molecular docking (Trott and Olson, 2010) and/or molecular simulation (MD) (Souza et al., 2020) approaches, can greatly benefit structure-based rational drug design.",

CRISPR screening with tiling-sgRNA designs can further infer essential protein domains that are suitable for drug targeting (He et al., 2019; Neggers et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2015) . However, identifying effective small molecular drugs for a specific target through high-throughput experimental screens is still expensive and inefficient (Macarron et al., 2011) . Virtual screening using computational approaches has emerged as a starting point for identifying hit molecules for a given drug target (Lavecchia and Di Giovanni, 2013) . 3D-based predictions of small molecules for a specific protein target with machine or deep learning approaches are of higher accuracy compared to sequence-based predictors. However, these ligand-based methods rely on multiple 3D structures binding the ligands to learn the features, thus are limited to a small fraction of ligands.

First of all, each FA/LA is considered as an individual cluster and the distances between different FA/LA were calculated through the Euclidean metric. Then two clusters with the closest distance were merged, and the linkages were created using the Ward method to minimize the total within-cluster variance.

The clusters of LAs denote the different FGs within the ligand, and the clusters of FAs represent binding motifs for the specific FG matched. Following this step, we obtained different binding motifs for the FGs of the ligand they interact with. To maintain the consistency of LA clusters and our predefined FGs and reduce the noises in the identified binding motifs, we adopted a twostep filtering process: First, the LA clusters with less than 50% atoms in any of the predefined FGs were discarded together with the corresponding binding motifs, and vice versa.

By calculating frequency of occurrence for each atom category within the motif, the motif could be expressed from the perspective of atom level. With deception of three levels ranging from low to high resolution, we could gain a well-rounded and detailed understanding of the binding motif.
