This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the spatial patterns of electricity consumption in six socioeconomic sectors (residential (villa and flat), industrial, commercial, government, and productive farms) in the State of Qatar. The spatiotemporal patterns of electricity consumption have been assessed using various Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial statistical modeling prior and during the pandemic. The results demonstrate variations in electricity consumption within and between the six sectors. The main changes in the electricity consumption within sectors during the pandemic year is during the lockdown phase. Spatially, some sectors are affected by the pandemic, and hence the pattern and the spatial and temporal distribution of electricity consumption has changed during the pandemic year compared to pre-pandemic years. The results also show that there were variations of spatial clustering of electricity consumption among these sectors. Most of the high-high clustering patterns are located in the mid-eastern and northeastern parts of Qatar. The highest variation in electricity consumption between sectors occurred in the productive farms due to its massive development during the pre-pandemic period and were not affected by the pandemic. There is a sharp decline in electricity consumption in both the industrial and commercial sectors during the pandemic year. Other sectors witnessed an increase in electricity consumption during the summer months, which was mainly due to travel restrictions imposed by many countries around the world. This analysis is vital for policymakers to detect the changes in electricity consumption patterns in the context of emergencies such as the pandemic. Recently, a number of studies have been performed on the impact of the pandemic on energy demand due to lockdown and restrictive measures on economic activities [12] [13] [14] . In China, for example, the domestic electricity consumption of residents in urban and rural areas has increased by 5.3% in the first quarter of 2020 because of the stay-at-home policy. Similarly, the electricity consumption in the agricultural sector has increased by 4%. Conversely, in the manufacturing and service industries it has declined by 3.1% and 19.8%, respectively [15, 16] . In Italy, electricity consumption witnessed a decline up to 37% during the pandemic compared to the same period in 2019 [17]. In Ontario, Canada, a daily reduction in electricity consumption of 18%",

Different measures have been put in place to reduce the speed of the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic and to flatten the curve of infected cases. Many social and production activities have been reversed or suspended, such as restrictions on movement locally or internationally, the closing of public institutions such as schools and universities, working from home to prohibit mass gatherings, and the closing of most businesses including services, commercial, and industrial sectors [1, 4] .",

The pandemic has affected the energy sector-considered one of the imperatives for modern societies-by altering the supply and demand of energy, since most residents have remained in either passive or active home quarantine. Electricity consumption can be considered an important indicator of economic fluctuations and during the pandemic can be monitored to gauge the economic impact of the virus. was observed during the weekends and a peak of \u2212 25% [18] . Energy consumption in Turkey witnessed reduction by 5%, 20%, and 22% in March, April, and May, respectively, compared to the same period of 2019 [19, 20] . In Brazil, electricity consumption declined during the first trimester of 2020 in comparison with 2019 values, where different sectors witnessed this decline, including the industrial (0.4%), residential (0.3%), and commercial (2.2%) [21] . Weekly energy demand in countries that imposed full lockdown policies was reduced by 25%, while this percentage was 18% in countries that imposed partial lockdown policies. Worldwide, electricity demand in the service, commercial, and industrial sectors decreased because of lockdown policies. However, this reduction was partially offset by higher residential use [21] . Therefore, temporal electricity-related data can offer insights into the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation policies.",

Even though the State of Qatar is rich in fossil fuel energy resources, there is a strategic plan to move towards sustainability in energy use by decreasing dependence on, and consumption of, conventional energy resources and increasing the dependence on clean and renewable energy [24] . Prior to the pandemic, many studies have been performed to investigate the energy consumption patterns in Qatar [24] [25] [26] . For example [24] , investigated domestic energy consumption behavior and public awareness of renewable energy in Qatar. They found that citizens are not willing to change their energy consumption behavior through economic means due to the country's energy subsidies, and that users' awareness and education of their environmental impact requires efficient energy usage and monitoring.",

            "text": "Considering the literature on electricity consumption prior or during the pandemic, few notable research gaps have been identified in studying the energy literature related to Qatar. First, most of the studies focused on policies related to energy consumption patterns [25] . Second, most of the studies considered specific sectors in order to examine electricity consumption patterns at city or country scale [24, 27] . Lastly, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study in Qatar to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on electricity consumption patterns. Furthermore, the international studies focused on the impact of COVID-19 on energy supply and demand, electricity consumption, and electricity cost. However, these studies did not perform spatial analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on electricity consumption in terms of considering different socioeconomic sectors. This gap is a major impediment to designing effectively tailored interventions for this important indicator of the economy. Therefore, considering this research gap, this study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal impact of COVID-19 pandemic on electricity consumption across six socioeconomic sectors. These sectors are residential (villas and flats), government, commercial, industrial, and productive farms, which are considered as indictors of social well-being and economic development. The residential sector was affected by the stayat-home policy during the lockdown phase and this forced many employees to work from home and students to learn from home. The electricity consumption in the government sector during the pandemic might indicate the increased institutional work to slow down the spread of the disease. The reset of the sectors are used to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the economic activities in the State of Qatar. The novelty of this study is that it investigate the electricity consumption in the context of COVID 19 in a different approach than prior studies. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge in different ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to investigate the spatiotemporal impact of COVID-19 pandemic on electricity consumption across different socioeconomic sectors. Therefore, this study will fill this gap by examining the changes of electricity consumption pattern under the context of the pandemic and visualise the hot spots and the cold spots of electricity consumption over space, time, and sector levels. Second, the study considers different temporal levels in investigating the electricity consumption under the context of the pandemic. The electricity consumption was assessed on monthly and annual levels as well as through different stages of the development of the disease and its associate measures. To fulfill the objectives of this study, a few research questions were formulated:",

Between 2004 and 2016, Qatar witnessed an average growth rate of real GDP and of population at 15% and 10% per year, respectively. Fossil fuels (liquefied gas and oil) are the keystones of the country's economy and account for more than [29] . The government has significantly promoted the industrial sector (both heavy and light industries). The major industries are steel and iron, fertilizers, petrochemical industries, and cement industries. The agricultural sector has significantly improved within the last few years (Qatar has about 280 sq. km). Qatar is almost self-sufficient for vegetables (about 70% during summer and 40% during winter). After the discovery of vast oil and gas reserves in Qatar, population growth accelerated from the 1970s, as these natural resources attracted a large number of migrant workers from overseas. Currently, the population of Qatar is 2.7 million, as shown in Fig. 2 , and it is projected to reach 3.8 million by 2050 if the current growth rate is maintained [30] , and where more than 90% of the total population lives in Doha (the capital and administrative center of Qatar) located on the eastern coast of Qatar [31] . However, the country has implemented several policies targeting a reduction in its share of the non-hydrocarbon sector in the GDP. The State of Qatar is spending more than US$200 billion on infrastructure projects, not only in preparing for the FIFA World Cup in 2022, but also as part of the country's long-term development plan, which is known as Qatar Vision 2030 [10, 32] . This vision focuses on development within the four main pillars: economic, social, human, and environmental. Most of this funding is being invested in developing the country's infrastructure, including the building of a new airport and port, new rail and metro lines, and a state-of-the-art road network. The transformation of Qatar into a modern country is also a part of Qatar Vision 2030, which has the long-term goal of creating a sustainable, state-of-the-art country, raising the standard of living, and achieving increased economic growth by using the country's human and natural resources [33, 34] . The infrastructure investment includes mega-transport projects, coupled with the expansion of the tourism sector and real estate new-builds, to diversify the economy. These factors have resulted in a sharp and unanticipated rise in the immigration of workers.",

In Qatar, the electricity market tries to fulfill the needs of various sectors of the Qatari economy and hence can be considered as a demand-oriented market. This market is expanding rapidly due to population growth and economic development, particularly in heavy industries. The value of electricity demand in 2016, for example, reached a value of 7435 MW, with an increase of 2.3% compared to the 2015 value, and the electricity transmitted was 39,667 GWH [35] . The largest demand in 2016 was from the industrial sector with a value reaching 1560 MW. To meet this demand, both public and private sectors are responsible for generating electricity. However, the private power generation companies must still operate under the supervision of the government. The annual installed electricity power generation is able to meet the country's electricity demand (see Figures, [3] [4] [5] . However, it might face different challenges if the population growth and economic development rates remained high. Furthermore, the government provides free electricity and water for its citizens and subsidizes prices for expatriates, which elevate the pressure on these two important resources. The maximum proportion of electricity in Qatar is consumed due to cooling systems in buildings [36] . The number of industries, commercial sectors, and productive farms have increased due to economic and population growth. The production of electricity in Qatar has increased by 3.7 times between 1990 and 2010 [37] .",

Other driving forces of this unprecedented growth of annual electricity generation include the highly subsidized electricity tariffs, intensive demand for cooling during the hot summer, and the ambitions for a higher standard of living. Electricity generation increased by 1000% between the years 1985 and 2017, from 3964 GWh to 43843 GWh. Between 2006 and 2016, the average yearly growth of the electricity generation rate was 9.9%, as shown in Fig. 3 . This rate increased by 27.4% in 2020 compared to year 2016, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. In general, the average electricity production in Qatar is 3600 GWh from January 2014 to December 2020. Qatar Annual Installed Capacity (MW) has increased steadily since 2005, as shown in Fig. 5 . However, the average growth rate of electricity consumption was 16.9% from 2008 to 2016. Currently, energy consumption per capita in the country is among the highest in the world and growing fast at a rate of 2.6% compared with the growth in income per capita (1%) [38] . Therefore, there is a gap between electricity demand and electricity supply. This forced the authorities to invest in multi-billion-dollar projects aiming for capacity expansion for a new generation, transmissions, and distribution network assets [39] . However, the revenue losses in oil and gas imports since 2014, particularly in 2020, have created a pressing need to utilize the existing assets and energy reserves more efficiently. Therefore, many energy efficiency measures have been implemented, such as promoting energy star appliances. Furthermore, additional savings in cooling load was achieved by increasing the proportion of district cooling [37, 40] . Although these measures have boosted energy-saving, meeting peak electricity demand remains a significant issue. For example, in summer 2017, residents experienced several power outages because the system utilization had exceeded 90% of its capacity.",

This is considered a significant issue for electricity consumption and conservation in the country. Free or subsidized electricity does not induce energy conservation by Qatari residents. This energy policy has a negative influence on both electricity consumption and energy efficiency [35] . KAHRAMAA finances the free and subsidized electricity through the State of Qatar budget. Therefore, the electricity market in the country is demand oriented. This policy and the absence of motivation for electricity conservation led to high costs charged to the public budget. However, the positive trends in population growth and rapid economic prosperity encouraged the authorities to sustain the increase in the electricity supply generation [10] . However, the increase in electricity generation does not mean that it will be sufficient to respond to the increase in electricity supply and may result in an electricity shortage. To this end, power and energy policy in Qatar is a strategic challenge engaged with numerous sources of uncertainty in the projection of the demand, and with sets of goals in sustainability and economic growth. This requires policymakers to devise the best set of infrastructure development plans to decide where and when to make investments on advanced technologies via grid expansion planning frameworks.",

The government sector (i.e., ministries, public schools and offices, hospitals, and universities) ranked fourth in terms of electricity consumption, followed by residential flat.

Moran's I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation of data, allowing us to define spatial clustering of electricity consumption across different socioeconomic sectors and its varying spatial densities. Spatial data are described as random or independent if no patterns for the configuration of these data can be identified; and conversely defined as highly correlated if likely values are spatially close to each other [50, 51] . In this study, Local Moran's I has also been applied for better understanding whether the electricity consumption patterns are clustered, dispersed, or random during pandemic and non-pandemic years. Equation (2) and equation (3) has been used for spatial patterns of electricity consumption demands.

The commercial services and activities were distributed in many areas across the country prior to the pandemic (Fig. 10) . However, after imposing the lockdown policy, and the gradual restriction on activities to mitigate the spread of the virus, many commercial activities were asked to close, which led to a considerable reduction in electricity consumption. The commercial services during the pandemic were concentrated in the northern parts of the country, as shown in Fig. 11 . The reduction in the spatial distribution of electricity consumption is more noticeable in the industrial sector. The industrial areas are concentrated in the northeast and southeast of the country. shows a high decline in electricity consumption in the industrial area in the northeast of the country, and a less but noticeable reduction in the southeast industrial area in the country compared to the period prior to the pandemic. This is mainly a direct consequence of lockdown policies, in which many factories and manufacturing activities were closed as a mean for curbing the spread of the disease. Finally, the electricity consumption of the productive farms was not affected by the pandemic as they are spatially distributed outside the main cities, and was not included within the geographical coverage of the lockdown. In addition, the number of workers in this sector is usually small compared to other sectors, and the precaution measure, such as physical distancing, can be applied easily in this sector. The statistical analysis has been performed for better understanding the electricity consumption pattern in Qatar during the COVID-19 pandemic year. The results of the CV show differences between the different sectors, as shown in Table 4 . The highest variation occurred in the productive farms sector due to its massive development during the pre-pandemic period. Furthermore, the results clearly show that the industrial and commercial sectors are affected by the pandemic, as the variation is higher than the other sectors. Table 5 shows the correlation between different electricity consumption sectors. The results show a positive correlation between different electricity consumption sectors with strong positive correlation between residential (villa) and residential (flat) (r = 0.982), residential (villa) and commercial (r = 0.982), residential (flat) and government (r = 0.945), residential (flat) and productive farms (r = 0.982), commercial and productive farms (r = 0.952), respectively, as shown in Table 5 and reflected in Fig. 12 . Furthermore, the one-way ANOVA and Post Hoc Tukey HSD test shows that there was significant variations of electricity consumption patterns in different sectors (the significant level was tested at 0.05). The p value was <0.0001, which clearly denotes the fact that there were significant variations of energy consumption in different sectors during pandemic and non-pandemic periods.",

The most noticeable increase in electricity consumption in this sector was during the summer months (June-August) compared to the same period prior to the pandemic. This trend occurred for varied reasons. First, during the first months of the lockdown, residents were asked to stay at home, and hence people have spent more time at home. However, the slight increase in electricity consumption is because KAHRAMAA provides free water and electricity for citizens (Qataris) and subsidizes tariffs for non-citizens (expatriates). Prior to the pandemic, this policy did not incentivize residents to practice electricity conservation habits, and hence had a negative impact by increasing the electricity consumption of many households. The stay-athome policy and the absence of incentives for electricity conservation led to the higher consumption of electricity at the household level in the residential sector. Second, the noticeable increase of electricity consumption during the summer months compared to the period prior to the pandemic is due to the stringency of restrictions on traveling outside the country. Many Qataris usually spend the summer months outside the country due to the high temperatures and humidity. Likewise, expatriates living in Qatar travel home to spend their vacations with their families, thereby escaping the country's heat. During the summer of 2020, the majority of expats preferred to stay in the country because of the restrictions imposed on travel by many countries around the world, including Qatar and their native countries, and due to the uncertainty of whether or not they would be able to return to Qatar and keep their jobs.",

            "text": "Residents' decisions to avoid traveling in the summer resulted in the increase of electricity consumption, particularly through the use of air conditioning, which is the country's main source of electricity consumption. Third, many of the expat workers left the country because of the shutdown of many services, commercial, and industrial activities, particularly after the first few months of the lockdown. This resulted in an elevation of electricity consumption in the residential sector at the beginning of the lockdown period, but did not affect electricity consumption during the summer. The commercial sector witnessed a sharp decline in electricity consumption during the pandemic due to the lockdown policy. All nonessential services were closed, including retail outlets, restaurants, malls, small businesses, companies, banks, and so on. When the lockdown was eased, the commercial sector could not recover fully because the closure of commercial services resulted in the permanent closure of many companies, shops, and other businesses, which played a significant role in reducing the electricity consumption during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic year, the commercial sector benefited from the tariff subsidy. As such, this policy has had a negative impact on both electricity consumption and energy efficiency, since the probability of reducing electricity costs due to energy efficiency improvements is likely to be smaller than the costs sustained for efficiency improvements. The data in this study reflects the electricity consumption for around 46,000 entities classified as commercial, and hence the reduction of around 40% of energy consumption during the pandemic year compared to the pre pandemic period is strong evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Qatari economy. The most affected sector by the pandemic and the lockdown policies is the industrial sector. Prior to the pandemic, the government significantly promoted the industrial sector (both heavy and light industries). The major industries are steel and iron, fertilizers, petrochemical industries, and cement industries. The industrial sector witnessed significant development prior to the pandemic, particularly after the blockade imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt. The first spread of the disease was in the industrial area in Doha city. Authorities closed this area for a few months from March 2020, which resulted in a decrease of electricity consumption in this area. Furthermore, due to restrictions on the movement of goods caused by the pandemic, and because the Qatari market is small and that Qatar depends on the export of these heavy industrial products, the production of these commodities was reduced significantly, resulting in a reduction of electricity consumption by this sector. Furthermore, the countermeasures adopted by many countries to curb the spread of the disease has resulted in severe shocks to the energy sector. Oil and gas prices witnessed a significant decline due to the decline in global demand for these resources, as well as the less flexible extraction of these resources. Qatar is one of the main producers of gas and oil globally and depends on the revenues from selling these resources to develop its economy. This drop has also affected the industrial sector in the country and, in turn, affected electricity consumption.",
