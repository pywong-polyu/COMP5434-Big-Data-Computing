Gammaglobulin was first administered in 1956 by intramuscular injection. Intramuscular gammaglobulins became an effective first-line therapy for some patients, particularly those with hypogammaglobulinemia. The injections were painful, however, and gammaglobulin therapy remained limited not only by patient discomfort, but also by the amount that could be given and inconsistent absorption. Because these early preparations contained gammaglobulin aggregates capable of fixing complement, intravenous administration was not possible. Subsequent changes in manufacturing led to greater purity of intact immunoglobulins. Human intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV), the form now used clinically, was introduced first in Europe and Australia in the 1960s and later in the United States in the 1970s.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Except for a couple of sporadic and poorly documented reports of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission by IGIV, 1, 2 concern over viral transmission with these products first attracted widespread attention in 1993-1994, when more than 125 patients became infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) after receiving Gammagard (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Westlake Village, CA) and Polygam (American Red Cross) IGIV products. 3 Considerable effort was expended to discover the reasons for the unexpected infection. Researchers discovered that the manufacturing process at the time probably involved inadequate antiviral treatment. This was especially critical when more sensitive testing resulted in the removal of plasma containing hepatitis C antibodies that were most likely providing protection. As a result of this instance, manufacturers reviewed their manufacturing processes, and many implemented additional antiviral steps.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 414, "end": 415, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "A further problem with early IGIV preparations was a lack of gammaglobulin purity and function. Because of enzymatic and chemical modifications during manufacture, firstgeneration IGIV products had a variety of functional disadvantages, such as abnormal distribution of IgG subclasses, some loss of Fc function, short half-lives, and decreased opsonic activity. In the second generation of products, some of these problems were corrected. This also resulted in an IgG subclass distribution that was closer to that of healthy individuals.

These methods can be classified generally as screening, viral inactivation, and viral removal. 4 Reducing the potential for pathogen transmission begins with screening, both before and after the plasma donation is collected. All potential blood donors are screened thoroughly by medical history, physical examination, and any behavior or other factors that might put them at risk for blood-transmissible infections such as hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

It should be noted that inactivation does not eliminate the virus, but destroys the ability of the virus to replicate and infect patients. 5 Since some of the inactivation techniques also have the potential to adversely affect immunoglobulins, the manufacturers must select methods that will preserve the biologic integrity of the IgG molecule.

Prions are extremely stable, infectious-like proteins that are responsible for a variety of diseases, often referred to as spongiform encephalopathies. 10 Not all prions are bad, as \"normal\" prions exist in the brain. Although the role of these normal prions is not fully elucidated, they are felt to be involved in the memory process. 11 Prions are unique in that although they are relatively simple proteins, they are able to replicate much like a bacteria or virus. These aberrant prions ultimately concentrate in the brain where they replicate and destroy brain tissue. The term \"spongiform\" is used because the brain in such cases is often filled with holes and resembles a sponge. Although rare in humans, these diseases are common in animals. One of the most common forms, found in sheep and goats, is called scrapie. In mule and deer it is referred to as chronic wasting disease. When it occurs in humans, it is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).

The occurrence of CJD is rare and estimated as approximately 1/1,000,000 individuals. 12 It is not felt to be a risk in terms of transmission through blood or blood products. In 1995, a new prion disorder, termed variant CJD (vCJD), appeared in the United Kingdom. It was apparently transmitted by meat from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (commonly known as mad cow disease). Many of the more than 100 human victims were young, which suggests a shorter incubation period than classic CJD. Because of the shorter incubation period of vCJD and the fact that there might be lymph node involvement, it is felt that there is more of a risk of transmission of vCJD through blood or blood products. This has received even more attention as a result of several reports in the United Kingdom of possible vCJD transmission through blood transfusions. 13 In the United States, as a precaution, restrictions were placed on blood donors who had lived in the United Kingdom for 6 months or longer, and current Food and Drug Administration guidelines require withdrawal of any batch of plasma derivatives if a pool donor is subsequently found to have vCJD.

To test the effectiveness of prion removal steps, plasma samples are spiked with protease-resistant prion protein, a marker for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The samples are subsequently assayed with the Western blot technique after each manufacturing step.
