Methods Patients receiving BMA for bone metastases from breast or CRPC were surveyed. Information was collected on patient and disease characteristics, BMA treatments and perceptions regarding BMA benefits and side effects. Interest in participation in trials of de-escalated BMA therapy was also gauged. Results Of 220 patients contacted, 172 eligible patients responded (response rate 78%). Median age was 67 (range: 21-91); 137 (80%) had breast cancer and 35 (20%) CRPC. Symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) occurred prior to starting BMAs in 61% (84/137) of breast and 48% (17/35) of CRPC patients. Among breast cancer patients, 47, 33 and 13% received zoledronate, pamidronate and denosumab, respectively. Eighty-five percent (30/35) of CRPC patients received denosumab. De-escalation of therapy was more common among breast cancer patients. Although most patients correctly reported the goals of BMA therapy were to \"help stop fractures\" (62%) and \"[improve] quality of life\" (63%), 46.5% felt it prolonged survival and 54% felt it reduced bone progression. Most respondents (102/129, 79%) were comfortable with de-escalating to 6-monthly treatment after 2 years of BMA therapy. Patients considered the most important endpoints of de-escalation studies to be \"stability of bone metastases\" (45%), \"quality of life\" (22%) and \"SSE rates\" (14%). Conclusion Twelve weekly BMA was more common in breast than in prostate cancer. There remain misconceptions about the benefits of BMAs, highlighting potential gaps in patient education. Patients were interested in further BMA de-escalation after 2 years of prior BMA and provided study endpoints that were most important to them.",

Patients with bone metastasis can experience pain, reduced quality of life and increased mortality risks. In addition, bone metastases are associated with the composite endpoint, skeletal-related events (SRE), defined as pathological fractures, need for radiation and/ or surgical intervention to bone, spinal cord compression or hypercalcemia [4] . Given its greater impact on healthrelated quality of life (HR-QoL), there has been a shift towards using symptomatic skeletal events (SSE), which still includes radiation or surgery to bone and spinal cord compression but excludes asymptomatic fractures and often excludes hypercalcemia given the difficulty in assessing \"symptomatic hypercalcemia\" [5, 6] . Bisphosphonates and denosumab are bone-modifying agents (BMAs) that reduce the incidence of SREs/SSEs and delay the time to their onset [7] [8] [9] [10] . These agents have become an established standard of care in the treatment of breast and castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients with bone metastases [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

            "text": "While both the joint Cancer Care Ontario (CCO)-American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) treatment guidelines recommend zoledronate every 4 or 12 weeks, pamidronate every 3-4 weeks or denosumab every 4 weeks from the time of diagnosis of bone metastases (or in the case of prostate cancer, at the development of bone metastases and castration-resistant disease), there is still considerable variability in practice [16, 17] . Indeed, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline recommended against the use zoledronic acid or denosumab in prostate cancer patients [18] . Importantly, these guidelines are based on clinical trials of BMA therapy given for 1-2 years, meaning there is no high-quality evidence informing the use of BMAs beyond 2 years. Over time, it is possible that the risk of further SSEs is outweighed by the cumulative risk of BMA-related toxicities such as renal impairment, hypocalcemia and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). A recent systematic review of 12 studies noted that after 2 years of BMA therapy, the SSE rate fell while the risk of ONJ was reported to be as high as 7-18% [19] . Although frequent BMA therapy for prolonged duration increases the risk of ONJ, other risk factors include dento-alveolar surgery, tooth extractions and pre-existing inflammatory dental disease, highlighting the need for dental examinations and effective preventative care [20, 21] . These findings are particularly important as improvements in anticancer therapies mean that patients are surviving longer and commonly receiving BMAs for much longer than 2 years.",

As a result, it was deemed important by the authors to conduct an updated patient survey to assess the current pattern of BMA use in patients with bone metastases from breast and CRPC. Given the need for further study of the optimal frequency and duration after the first 2 years of BMA therapy, we sought to better understand patients' experience and perceptions concerning their current BMA use, as well as their opinions and preferences regarding meaningful endpoints and interest in potential BMA de-escalation trial designs. The findings of this survey could be used to help improve shared decision-making in current practice and identify important patient outcomes to be included in the development of future clinical trials.",

Eligible patients were mainly approached during their routine clinic visits with an oncologist. Additionally, to maximize the breadth and number of patients recruited, a list of patients receiving BMA therapy at one of our treatment units in Ottawa was used to contact potential study participants. Patients had to be able to provide verbal consent and be willing and able to complete the survey, which was available in English only.",

The survey was pilot tested on a limited number of oncologists (MZA, MC, CC, TN) and two non-healthcare professionals (MS and LV) before launch. The first section of the survey collected patient demographics (age) and tumour characteristic (histology). History of SSEs prior to starting BMA was also collected with minor modifications: (1) bone pain and bone fracture were separate answer choices instead of \"painful bone fracture\" given a significant potential for recall bias regarding whether a bone fracture was painful, and (2) the \"need for hospitalization to treat high levels of calcium in the blood\" was used to capture significant hypercalcemia (Electronic Supplementary Material). The survey refers to the composite endpoint (i.e., bone pain, bone fracture, radiation to bone, surgery to bone, spinal cord compression or hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization) as bone metastasis-related complications instead. SSE rate was defined as the rate of bone metastasis-related complications minus bone pain. The type and schedule (e.g., every 4-or 12-weekly) of BMA administered in the beginning were also collected.",

These differences largely reflect the funding system for these agents in Ontario where denosumab is publicly funded for CRPC but not for breast cancer. The results also showed that de-escalation of BMAs is much more common in breast cancer than CRPC patients, which is in keeping with the literature [27] . Compared with the survey from 2013, bisphosphonates remained the most common BMA used in breast cancer patients. However, more breast cancer patients are now receiving zoledronate rather than pamidronate, presumably because the cost of zoledronate now approximates that of pamidronate and requires a much shorter infusion time [22] . In the breast cohort, although 3 monthly BMA therapies were already quite prevalent in 2013, this practice has increased (current: 76% vs. 2013: 52%). Meanwhile, most prostate cancer patients continue to receive denosumab every 3-4 weeks. Concerns about reducing denosumab frequency to every 3 months include the risk of rebound in bone health deterioration and the paucity of data around denosumab de-escalation [36] . Although results of the more definitive REDUSE trial [37] are awaited, it must be noted that a recent randomized BMA de-escalation study, which included denosumab, showed non-inferiority in terms of HR-QoL physical functioning [27] and has influenced a shift towards earlier denosumab de-escalation.",

The incidence of SSEs prior to receiving BMAs among breast cancer patients in the current study was similar to that reported in a previous retrospective cohort study at our cancer centre [44.5% (61/137) and 48.4% (75/155), respectively], while the SSE rate after starting BMA was lower in the current survey [24.1% (33/137) and 47.7% (74/155), respectively] [4] . This could be attributed to advances in anti-cancer therapies that have led to more effective cancer control than before. Although the sample sizes were relatively small, especially in the CRPC cohort, and patients received a variety of BMA drugs at different schedules, the reported rates of BMArelated side effects were comparable to publicly available data [38] [39] [40] .",

For such a deescalation study, of the provided answer choices, the most important clinical outcome to maintain from the patient's perspective was \"stability of bone metastasis\" in both breast and prostate cancer, followed by maintenance of \"quality of life\". Maintenance of the rate of \"skeletal events\", which is the conventional primary endpoint in large, randomized registry trials for i.v. bisphosphonates and denosumab in advanced cancer, was only chosen by 15 and 10% of breast and prostate cancer respondents, respectively. The frequent selection of \"stability of bone metastasis\" again implies that patients may not necessarily understand that BMAs do not have clinically significant anti-cancer activity on its own against bone metastases. Since maintenance of quality of life was voted more often than skeletal events, it would be reasonable to consider a trial using some HR-QoL measure as the primary clinical endpoint.",

This issue is going to become increasingly challenging as the COVID-19 pandemic proceeds as less patients are being seen in person and more care is being delivered virtually. In order to increase the number of potential patients approached, we used pharmacy records to identify patients receiving BMAs in the local chemotherapy units.

Among the breast cancer respondents, the most common bone metastasis-related complications were bone pain (70/137, 51%), radiation to bone (40/137, 29%) and bone fracture (25/137, 18%). Among the CRPC respondents, the most common complications were bone pain (17/35, 48%), radiation to bone (12/35, 34%) and spinal cord compression (4/35, 11%) (Table 1). Since starting BMA therapy, 104/172 (60%) patients reported bone metastases-related complications (83/137 [61%] of breast cancer and 21/35 [60%] of CRPC patients). Among the breast cancer respondents, the most common bone complications were bone pain (54/137, 39%), radiation to bone (20/137, 14%) and spinal cord compression (11/137, 8%). Among the CRPC respondents, the most common complications were bone pain (12/35, 34%), radiation to bone (5/35, 14%) and spinal cord compression (5/35, 14%) (Table 2). Prior to starting BMA therapy, 61/137 (44.5%) breast cancer respondents had at least one SSE, with a median of 1 SSE (36 patients had 1 SSEs, 18 patients had 2 SSEs and 7 patients had 3 SSEs), whereas after starting BMA therapy, only 33/137 (24%) breast cancer patients had at least one SSE, with a median of 1 SSE (22 patients had 1 SSE, 6",

In addition, as the survey was anonymous, we could not evaluate the time at risk of SRE/SSEs prior to starting BMA therapy as this would require linking each patient to their treatment records. Similarly, information was not collected on other anticancer agents the patients had received along with their BMA therapy. Thus there could be incorrect attribution of side effects experienced by the patient. As with all surveys, there is an inherent selection bias in those that were contacted and those that responded. Although we had a good response rate of 78%, most of the responses came from breast cancer patients, which may, in part, reflect more breast than prostate cancer patients receiving BMA overall. Of note, 126 responded by email (breast: 109 [79.6%] vs. prostate: 17 [48.6%]) and 46 on paper (breast: 28 [20.4%] vs. prostate: 18 [51.4%])",
