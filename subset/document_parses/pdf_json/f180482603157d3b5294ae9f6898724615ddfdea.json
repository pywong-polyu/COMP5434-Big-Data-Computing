The various mitigation strategies implemented to control the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic could have additional, unintended benefits for limiting the spread of other infectious diseases and their associated burden on the health care system. Methods: We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis using population-wide hospitalization data for the state of Victoria, Australia. Infection-related hospitalizations for children and adolescents (aged <18 years, total source population 1.4 million) were extracted using pre-defined International Classification of Diseases 10 th Revision Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) codes. The change in weekly hospitalization rates (incidence rate ratio, IRR) for all infections following the introduction of pandemic-related restrictions from 15 March 2020 was estimated. Results: Over 2015-19, the mean annual incidence of hospitalization with infection among children less than 18 years was 37 per 1000 population. There was an estimated 65% (95% CI 62-67%) reduction in the incidence of overall infection-related hospitalizations associated with the introduction of pandemic restrictions. The reduction was most marked in younger children (at least 66% in those less than 5 years of age) and for lower respiratory tract infections (relative reduction 85%, 95% CI 85-86%).",

In addition to limiting transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2), these measures have had broad, non-specific impacts on health-seeking behaviour, access to health care and the epidemiology of non-COVID-19 illnesses. 1, 2 Changes to the incidence of non-SARS-CoV-2 infections might be expected to be largest in children, who disproportionately contribute to the transmission of many infections 3 and bear the largest morbidity burden. 4 Single and multicentre studies have reported marked reductions in non-COVID-19 hospital presentations and admissions [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and respiratory pathogen detections in children. 10 These studies may be limited by selection bias and incomplete hospitalization data. A recent study covering 210 hospitals in Japan, examining the 4 months following school closure, found reductions in paediatric hospitalization for infectious disease ranging from 41% at the end of March to 74% at the end of May 2020. 9 The population-level impact of pandemic-related restrictions on childhood hospitalizations with infections, the leading cause of childhood admission, 11 is unknown.",

By the beginning of October, Victoria had recorded 20 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (incidence proportion 0.3%) of which 2621 were in children less than 18 years of age (incidence proportion 0.2%).

This model included: an offset for the estimated resident population 15 ; a covariate for time (weeks) to account for secular trend; a dummy variable indicating the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods; and a harmonic term for month to adjust for seasonality. The estimated coefficient for the dummy variable described the overall relative change in infection-related hospitalizations between the pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods. In addition, we compared differences across age and diagnostic groups, using incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the hospitalization rate for the period 15 March to 3 October 2020 with the mean hospitalization rate for the equivalent calendar periods in 2015 to 2019 ( Table 1 ). The relative reduction in hospitalizations was calculated as 1-IRR*100%. Finally, to investigate the potential for a shift in the severity of illness among children presenting to hospital, we compared length of stay between the two time periods. Analyses were conducted in the R statistical package version 3.6.1. 16 ",

First, health-seeking behaviour will have changed during the pandemic. 1,2 Families may have delayed or avoided seeking health care through fear of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For example, we observed a reduction by 17% in hospitalizations for the category that included urinary tract infections, which are not typically associated with person-to-person transmission in children. This may be indicative of a change in health-seeking behaviour, but we were unable to investigate this directly as non-hospital data were not available. It is also possible that physicians modified their clinical threshold for hospitalization with infection during the pandemic, although clinical guidelines regarding hospitalization were unchanged. We restricted our study to hospitalization data to limit the impact of changed healthseeking behaviour, as it seems likely that children with severe infection would eventually be hospitalized. Indeed, lower hospitalization rates were sustained throughout April to October, suggesting a true reduction in infection. Furthermore, hospital care is free in Australia and access or financial concerns are unlikely to have strongly influenced health-seeking behaviour. Overall, it is difficult to disentangle changed health-care-seeking from reductions in pathogen transmission given there is no routine surveillance of the incidence of infectious disease in non-hospitalized Victorian children. Whereas mortality data might provide a more sensitive estimate of changed rates of disease, they would not be expected to be useful in Australian paediatric populations where mortality rates are extremely low. Our observation of marginally increased length of stay during the pandemic periods may reflect increased severity of disease, but could also reflect changes in staffing, patient flow and discharge practices rather than changes in infection severity.",

Further analyses across different settings could possibly address this important issue, but is beyond the scope of this analysis. In addition, the indirect effects of restrictions, such as reduced air pollution, may have also affected hospitalization rates and warrants further study. Last, current population estimates may overestimate the true population denominator due to dramatic reductions in immigration in 2020. However, application of the 2019 population denominators continued to show similar reductions in rates as those observed using our 2020 population estimates.",
