In this study, we formalize a recommender system for companies to guide them in their search for local suppliers. We start by presenting the research work that provides the foundation for this study. Based on this analysis, we detail our original decision support system, which exploits both data from input-output models and productive jumps. We see that it is possible to use economic complexity to determine proximities between classes of products and thus make recommendations for productive jumps that firms can make. These productive jumps represent the capacity of a firm that already produces a type A product to produce a type B product with a slight adaptation of its production tools.",

This productive know-how is the key to a country's economic prosperity and may require a complex network of specific skills acquired over several years. A country's economic complexity indicator (ECI) is an indicator of the complexity of its productive know-how. The underlying idea behind the concept of economic complexity is that the evolution of a country's productive know-how takes place progressively by \"jumping\" from the manufacture of one type of product to another type of product that is close to it in the product space.",

In addition, it opens up new perspectives in the definition of a territorial industrial resilience indicator. The main approaches based on network analysis are focused on the actual production (Craighead et al., 2007; Kharrazi et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2015; Zio & Piccinelli, 2010) . However, alternative production is activated in the event of a destabilizing shock, as happened during the last health crisis. The underlying idea is that, in terms of resilience, it may not be necessary to produce certain goods if local suppliers are able to modify their production line quickly to produce them. Suppliers adapt their production to compensate for shortages of certain products, and the integration of this new dimension is interesting to investigate.",
