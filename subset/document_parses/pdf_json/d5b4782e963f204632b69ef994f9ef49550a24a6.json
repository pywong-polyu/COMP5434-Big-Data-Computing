Children probably are the ones who have suffered the most from this situation, due to the limited socialization with peers and boredom experienced at home. In this context, schools and childhood services tried to relieve the negative effects brought by the pandemic through actions aimed at actively engaging students and their parents in promoting child development and wellbeing. Therefore, several worldwide actions have been implemented to guarantee educational continuity. However, most of these actions targeted 3-18 years old children/adolescents, while the subgroup 0-3 was rarely included. Cooperativa Sociale Aeris, a social enterprise based in northern Italy that deals with socio-educational and welfare services, took several measures to overcome problems resulting from the closure of its services dedicated to 0-3 aged children. In this manuscript, we depict how Aeris kept engaged children and their parents, reporting families' evaluation on the actions taken. For assessing their proposed activities, Aeris promptly distributed an on-line survey to the families in May 2020. The answers showed that the organized activities had a positive impact on both children and parents, diminishing the sense of loneliness and boredom for the former, and acting as an important support for the latter. Therefore, this manuscript could work as a reference for policy-makers and managers of educational services in implementing activities and initiatives during home schooling.",

These services give opportunities for children's development and socialization and for enabling families to engage fully in the labor market, each of which is important in contributing to stronger families (Baxter, 2015) . Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) policies and practices vary among different countries and communities (Rutanen et al., 2014) , but they are all based on the universal ideals of the \"best interest of the child\" (Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989) . The experiences of the first 3 years of life are recognized as highly important with respect to child well-being and development: therefore, from the basic care of younger children under age 3 while parents work, the role of Early Childhood Services has been shifted toward socialization, development, and cognitive stimulation (Kamerman, 2000) . This role may be made difficult by events that require school closure and children confinement.",

The partial school closure is registered the 24th of February 2020, while the total closure the 10th of March 2020, placing Italy as the first European country and the third country in the world after China and Mongolia to close schools (UNESCO Website, 2021) . Therefore, Italy above every other European country had to timely respond to the sanitary emergency, organizing actions aimed at facing problems arising from the closure of childhood services and schools that lasted till the end of August 2020. Each school activated custom solutions to be in contact with families, including e-learning and online meetings (Lucisano, 2020; Thorell et al., 2021) . The Italian Educational Research Society (SIRD) distributed all over Italy an online survey to investigate the experience of Italian teachers during the COVID-19 outbreak (Lucisano, 2020) . SIRD found that different means were used for maintaining contacts with families (e.g., social media, online platforms, websites, blogs, emails, apps etc.) and several didactic strategies were implemented (e.g., online lessons, registered lessons, presentations from students etc.). However, the survey was distributed to teachers from preschools, elementary schools, and secondary schools, excluding the nurseries from this evaluation. To our knowledge, there is a lack of Italian studies specifically dedicated to 0-3 aged children, which is consistent with worldwide findings previously mentioned. In Italy, this is probably due to the lower nursery attendance with respect to schools for 3-18 aged children/ adolescents. Indeed, in 2019 only 7% of children under the year attended the nursery, rising to 51% if considering children of 24-36 months. On the other side, more than 90% of 3-5 aged children attended the pre-school and the totality of children/adolescents the Italian compulsory school (6-16 years; ISTAT, 2020). Moreover, we have to consider the difficulties in organizing online activities for children less than 3 years old, since their attention to a screen is easily lost, especially if considering the youngest (<1 year old) (Szente, 2020) .",

For both the cases, the power of results reached 99.9%. In addition to these considerations, from the open-ended questions it emerged to send more rhythmic and musical games, dances, and psychomotor activities, and to continue to send readings and song videos (preferably with educators' voices and faces to maintain the contact), as well as crafts to be done with materials that can be easily found at home. With specific attention to the group video calls, families found them useful, but sometimes chaotic and dispersive.

To deal with this new destabilizing reality, Aeris activated an early intervention and developed some activities aimed at maintaining contact with families and children, supporting the most critical realities. Aeris moved from the beginning of the pandemic to minimize children's detachment from their routine, allowing them to experience the lockdown as an active process. With this purpose, the Smart-Edu website was developed; here families and children found chores, stories, videos, e-learning activities, and several resources to decrease the sense of isolation and facilitate long-distance relationships. Aeris also enhanced social channels such as YouTube and Facebook, and created WhatsApp groups/broadcasts with the aim of having contacts with families despite the distance. In particular, sharing material via social channels allowed reaching families not enrolled in the Aeris services, as demonstrated by the increased number of followers during the pandemic, leading to the spread of these support initiatives. Lot of importance was given to the video calls, which allowed children to keep having a visual contact with the educators, and parents to share experiences, opinions, and ideas with the educators, pedagogues, and other families.",

Specifically, individualized and targeted meetings between families and institutional caregivers are necessary to define the pedagogic intervention on the child and help the educators to define the child's profile and share it with the parents. A continuous exchange between families and educators is another key-point: the mutual support between families and institutional caregivers facilitates a correct interaction with children and, therefore, the development of their skills. The activities proposed by AERIS to families during school closure aimed also to reinforce the relationship between families and Early Childhood Services thus facilitating the interaction with children.",

            "text": "With the aim of assessing the proposed activities, an on-line survey was distributed to the families in May 2020. The results showed that these initiatives had a positive impact on children and parents, diminishing the sense of loneliness and boredom for the former, and acting as an important support for the latter. Readings, songs, dances, and rhythmic activities were evaluated as the most engaging. The videos proposed by Aeris were so successful that some families decided to propose their own videos and share them with other families. This allowed the families both to fill the void left by this pandemic and to be a support for other families too. Because of these actions, a deeper connection has been created with both other families and the Aeris team: if before the pandemic meetings were organized in more formal contexts, during these months everyone \"entered\" into others' homes, both symbolically giving a support, but also more practically through the video calls that allowed seeing others in their home context. Video calls were judged an important tool to reduce social distancing and were widely used, but sometimes they resulted chaotic and dispersive, due to the fast pace and large number of participants. In addition, it was not always easy to maintain the children's attention, especially with the younger (<1 year). Therefore, families proposed a reorganization of the video calls, decreasing the number of participants, slowing down the pace and reducing the free discussion in favor of activities with children as active learners. Following these suggestions, the Aeris team decided to diminish the number of children per call: from the 15 initial participants, some sub-groups were formed with approximately 10 children. This resulted in less chaotic meetings and gave the possibility to all children of interacting during the calls. These findings are in line with what reported by Szente (2020) , who shared reflections on over 50 live Zoom instructional lessons with toddlers. In accordance with Aeris' experience, children responded well to songs, engaging stories, dances, and rhythmic activities. However, when the online lessons lasted more than 20 min, they seemed to be losing their interest. Finally, also Szente (2020) noticed that video calls tended to be chaotic if the participating children were more than 10-15.",

            "text": "In general, families found the activities proposed by the Aeris team engaging, well organized and useful for child development. Moreover, the Aeris team noticed an increased participation in the meetings during the pandemic than before. Indeed, the remote mode also allowed the more committed parents to attend the meetings, and this is the reason why the Aeris team decided to keep this participation option also after the COVID-19 outbreak. The same positive feeling was perceived in other worldwide realities, in which homeschool was well received by pupils and parents (Bubb and Jones, 2020; Garbe et al., 2020; Szente, 2020) , or at least it was perceived as acceptable (Hafidz et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Despite these positive experiences, worldwide there is the common feeling that the e-learning needs to be improved (Fauzi and Sastra Khusuma, 2020; Putri et al., 2020; Rasmitadila et al., 2020) , technology implemented (Dube, 2020; Fauzi and Sastra Khusuma, 2020; Rasmitadila et al., 2020) , teachers more trained (Dias et al., 2020; Putri et al., 2020; Szente, 2020) , and integrated grade-specific approaches are needed (Zhao et al., 2020) . In general, teachers found a lower learning quality with respect to traditional lessons (Lucisano, 2020) , and families had negative beliefs about the values and benefits of online learning, retaining that the family-school partnerships has not yielded compelling results and preferring traditional methods (Dong et al., 2020; Firmanto et al., 2020; Harper et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021; Thorell et al., 2021) . These findings differ from the Aeris reality, but we must point out that the initiatives described in this manuscript are specifically thought for 0-3 aged children, therefore dealing with simple activities that use materials easily available at home. When considering the previously mentioned studies the situation differs, since they deal with school age children (>3 years old) who need more structured activities for their development, therefore more demanding to implement.",

            "text": "When it comes to children, either toddlers or school aged, what emerges is that the active participation of families is fundamental for obtaining convincing results during distance educational activities. Without the mutual collaboration between educators and families, it is impossible to hope for child cognitive and behavioral development. Several studies reported a high family engagement, demonstrating the intent of the caregivers to act as proactive actors in child development (Bubb and Jones, 2020; Hafidz et al., 2020; Kim, 2020; Novianti and Garzia, 2020; Rasmitadila et al., 2020; Sari and Maningtyas, 2020; Panaoura, 2021) . This was found also in the Aeris reality, in which most of the families actively participated in the proposed activities. In contrast, teachers in other contexts had problems in collaborating with parents (Fauzi and Sastra Khusuma, 2020; Lucisano, 2020; Pek and Mee, 2020) , while parents encountered problems with the e-learning due to their lack of time, professional knowledge in supporting children's online learning (Dong et al., 2020; Garbe et al., 2020; Listyaningrum et al., 2020) , and/or insufficient support from schools (Thorell et al., 2021) . It is interesting to notice that studies in which parents were not sufficiently involved coincide with those previously mentioned for the unsuccess of the e-learning with respect the traditional methods, highlighting the importance of mutual collaboration between educational services and families (Phillips and Lowenstein, 2011; Bianco and Lecce, 2016) . Despite the Aeris team was able to engage most of the families; the cooperative perceived that the pandemic had emphasized social differences among people. Indeed, not all of them participated in the distance initiatives, and the \"left out-families\" were usually Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 722834 those with fewer technical, cultural, and cognitive tools. However, Aeris lessened this phenomenon increasing communication especially with the most fragile and less responsive families, which usually were the foreign ones. Therefore, the emails were written in English, French, and Arabic, and some of the proposed videos were also in English other than Italian (i.e., the songs and nurseryrhymes). An improvement to reach more effectively these families might consist in proposing all the initiatives at least in double language (i.e., English and Italian). In addition, some families encountered organizational issues. Indeed, some of the parents had to assist more than one child during distance educational activities, while others never stopped working and, therefore, they were not able to connect to the online activities. Finally, some of the caregivers were grandparents who had no technological skills. A useful improvement in these situations may consist in making all the contents available in the cloud, to give the family the possibility of making them up when they have time.",

It is essential to individuate parents' needs and support them in addressing their educational role. However, this does not always happen, and the pandemic highlighted the need of mentoring families in parenting their children during learning from home (Listyaningrum et al., 2020; Meoded Karabanov et al., 2021) . This pilot study could be a reference for policymakers and managers of educational services in implementing activities and initiatives aimed at filling the gap between families and schools. Indeed, it contains suggestions for other Early Childhood Services in Italy or abroad, and it could be a useful tool for future organization of other services, since we are still facing short local school closure (UNESCO Website, 2021) . Even if the results may be dependent on the social context and national environment, a similar model could be implemented after its adaptation to the local habits and behaviors.",

Firstly, it lacks of an assessment of children and parents' wellbeing through validated instruments, and the measured variables are only parent-reported; indeed, the proposed survey evaluates families' satisfaction about the organized activities, but not the effects of these initiatives on children development and parents' stress levels. Moreover, due to the unpreparedness that characterized the beginning of the pandemic, the study lacks of a baseline evaluation of family wellbeing and needs (e.g., specific needs linked to the lockdown) before the starting of online activities. Finally, a comparison with early childhood services that acted in different ways is missing, which could be useful for identifying and implementing the best strategies in engaging families. Therefore, we will dedicate future works to the assessment of child development and children and parents' wellbeing after the school closure using validated instruments, and to the evaluation of other actions/ ways that other early childhood services implemented to generalize these findings.",
