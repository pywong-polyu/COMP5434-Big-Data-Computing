When the number of infections soared, to slow the spread, many governments decided to close universities and dormitories and move teaching to online platforms. The majority of the university students decided to move back home to their parents changing their social lives. Here, we aimed to point to risk, as well as protective factors, and understand the influence of these factors on both physical and psychological indicators of well-being. Further, to discover how university students cope with maintaining their social lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We collected online survey data from multiple university sources. Participants (N = 605) completed measures of emotion regulation strategies, knowledge on the disease, contamination fear, perceived social support, worrying and intolerance of uncertainty, quality of sleep, well-being, emotional stability, anxiety, and depression. Results: Our results showed that the most prominent risk and protective factors that were most strongly associated with the indicators of well-being were rumination, catastrophizing, positive refocusing, and social support from family; respectively. Conclusion: These results have implications for professionals working with and helping (e.g., as counselors) people during the challenges of an emergency.",

            "text": "The new coronavirus disease has emerged as the biggest pandemic of the 21st century. Most governments took serious steps to slow down the spread of the disease by enforcing social distancing, closing workplaces, universities, schools, and other facilities. These enactments have resulted in social isolation for most citizens (Casale & Flett, 2020; Lin, 2020) . For university students, the pandemic and the following governmental regulations have resulted in online studying, leaving the dormitories, losing jobs, moving back home, increasing the distance from their friends and loved ones. The sudden change in life circumstances can cause great distress for the students (Evans et al., 2021; Mart\u00ednez-Lorca et al., 2020; Paton & Flin, 1999) . Nevertheless, there could be significant individual differences in the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on people's lives (B\u00e4uerle et al., 2020; Garfin et al., 2020) similarly to other emergencies and disasters . For instance, for many students, shutting down universities might have severe negative effects on their lifestyles, especially for those from more vulnerable populations (e.g., from lower SES, unstable families, having mental health illness, or learning challenges). They might lose all the campus facilities (i.e., part-time job, dormitory, mental health consultation, IT infrastructure) and they might also lose many aspects of their social life (i.e., loss of many social relationships, forced to move back to parents). In contrast, some students have successfully dealt with the COVID-19 lockdown, and the changes have not interfered with their lives (e.g., staying in their homes or rented flats with friends, parents keep supporting them financially). Many people have experienced similar due to the toll on health care systems, loss of loved ones, jobs, and the devastating economic impact (Callaway et al., 2020) . The way students experienced the COVID-19 caused crisis affecting their psychological well-being (e.g., sleeping patterns and overall mental health) poses an opportunity to study what strategies and risk factors are associated with resilience in face of adversity in people in general.",

It has been proposed (Moody, 2001; Valkenburg & Peter, 2009 ) that online communication is impersonal and shallow compared to face-toface communication because it offers fewer channels of communication, e.g. by lack of speech and facial expression. Although the availability of video chatting is growing by the year, it is still not as readily available to everyone and cannot replace maintaining relationships through face-to-face communication on a daily basis for a prolonged time. During the COVID-19 lockdown, the only form of maintaining social relationships was online communication that created a discrepancy between the desired quality and actual social relationships; which is, by definition, loneliness (Ong et al., 2016) . Therefore, social distancing despite all the technological advancements can result in loneliness (cf. paradox of social distancing (Rozenkrantz et al., 2020; Tyrrell & Williams, 2020) ). It is well-established that loneliness has serious mental and physical health effects in various age groups and threatens the sense of safety and well-being of the individual (Holt-Lunstad, 2018; L\u00e1badi et al., 2021; Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017; Stickley et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Coping with distressing situations is particularly difficult for those who have difficulty tolerating uncertainty (Laposa et al., 2015) . Tolerance of uncertainty is an individual's propensity towards a negative or a positive response provoked by the conscious awareness of ignorance about a situation (Hillen et al., 2017) . Intolerance of uncertainty was significantly associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder as well as obsessions and checking symptoms (Laposa et al., 2015; Timpano et al., 2014; Wheaton & Ward, 2020 ). An elevated vulnerability of showing the symptoms of contamination fear might have further implications in the present circumstances as the danger of contamination might keep such individuals on alert constantly, the required safety behaviors might worsen their symptoms (Olatunji et al., 2011) , or all these can cause further mental problems such as anxiety (Hongbo & Waqas, 2020; Wheaton et al., 2012) . In fact, intolerance of uncertainty was suggested to be a transdiagnostic factor across anxiety disorders and depression (Jensen et al., 2016; Strout et al., 2018) . Symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders were linked to intolerance of uncertainty through the mediating effects of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (Jaso et al., 2020) . A recent study (Satici et al., 2020) showed the crucial mediating role of rumination between intolerance of uncertainty and fear of COVID-19, arguing that the prominent focus on negative emotions has a grave impact on mental well-being. These factors can also result in excessive worrying (McDermott et al., 2019) .",

It has long been posited (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Thoits, 2011 Thoits, , 1986 Uchino et al., 2012; Vine et al., 2019; Zeidner et al., 2016) that social support reduces the disturbing psychological and physiological impacts of exposure to negative life events (e.g. cortisol stress response) and promotes positive feelings (e.g. happiness). Although computer-mediated communication might not replace face-toface communication regarding quality (Moody, 2001; Valkenburg & Peter, 2009) , maintaining the relationships and sharing experiences is still important and can have numerous positive outcomes. For instance, reconstructing events from a broader perspective during an online conversation has been shown to have positive psychological effects such as feeling better and a sense of closure (Lee et al., 2019) . Further, faceto-face communication is still possible, e.g., when relatives and peers live at close distances. Nonetheless, since social contacts are limited in number, the quality of the existing ones is further prioritized in coping with stressful events (Williams et al., 2018) .",

Further, the ability to effectively regulate one's emotions is an important factor in determining well-being as well (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006; Gross & John, 2003) . Cognitive coping strategies, both adaptive and maladaptive, have an important role in the relationship between stressors and well-being (Kraaij & Garnefski, 2019; Kraiss et al., 2020) , such that coping with stressors by using more adaptive emotion regulation strategies results in a more positive while using more maladaptive strategies results in a more negative subjective well-being. Further, the use of emotion regulation strategies that are viewed as more adaptive (e. g., positive refocusing and positive reappraisal) are connected to better sleep quality (Mauss et al., 2013) and tend to promote psychological well-being by reducing anxiety and depression (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006; Shiota, 2006) . As emotion regulatory processes could be affected by close others, social support is an important resource that determines how emotion regulation is closely related to well-being (Marroqu\u00edn et al., , 2017 .",

Then, we used linear regression modeling (enter method) to examine the risk and protective factors for indicators of psychological well-being on all participants. The five indicators were tested in separate models. In the model, an indicator of psychological well-being (e.g. WHO-5) served as the dependent variable and CERQ subscales, MSPSS subscales, WDQ subscales, IUS total score, CF total score, COVID knowledge, and COVID fake news belief served as independent predictor variables. The Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation was nonsignificant in all five models (DWs < 3, ps > .1) indicating that there was no multicollinearity (VIF values were also less than 4).

Individuals using this type of maladaptive emotion regulation strategy are concentrating on their negative feelings and thoughts related to the current situation (Kraaij & Garnefski, 2019) . Rumination has been shown to be responsible for the high comorbidity of several mental disorder diagnoses, e.g., anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders (Balzarotti et al., 2016; Silveira et al., 2020) . This is in line with a recent study (Satici et al., 2020) showing that rumination mediated the connection between intolerance of uncertainty and fear of COVID-19 because the focus on negative emotions impacts mental wellbeing. Additionally, catastrophizing (i.e., accentuation of only the negative effects of the current situation) similarly was linked to three of the five factors of psychological well-being, resulting in a depressive mood, anxiety, and problems with sleep quality. This is in line with previous results showing a relationship between catastrophizing and increased health anxiety (Marcus et al., 2008) and poorer well-being (Balzarotti et al., 2016) . Therefore, the use of these maladaptive emotion regulation strategies prevents adaptive coping that would improve individuals' well-being (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006; Kraiss et al., 2020; McDermott et al., 2019; Shiota, 2006) .",

In line with previous results (Muris et al., 2005; Yook et al., 2010) , worrying about the future could decrease subjective well-being and increase depressive mood and anxiety. Thus, having the biggest impact among the worry domains. Amidst the situation caused by the pandemic outbreak, life circumstances are uncertain and threaten the normal course of life involving future prospects, e.g., people do not know when things will return to normal or a possible second, even more dangerous outbreak. Thus, the uncertainty of the situation may result in greater worrying (Dugas et al., 2001; Yook et al., 2010) . Further, intolerance of uncertainty was associated with subjective well-being and loneliness. The current situation is accompanied by several features that contribute to its uncertainty (e.g., fake news regarding the nature of the virus, job loss, uncertainty about how academic life will continue, etc.). Therefore, individuals who find it hard to accept and adapt to the difficulties caused by COVID-19 might further experience psychic hardship as supported by our results and by previous ones as well Jensen et al., 2016; Miranda et al., 2008; Zsido et al., 2020) . Somewhat surprisingly COVID knowledge (true and false belief) had little effect, while contamination fear did not correlate with the indicators of well-being. The lack of effect could mean that by staying home, participants could overcome these fears, although knowing more true and false information about the virus is associated with lower levels of subjective well-being and more sleeping problems.",

            "text": "The most prominent protective factors were positive refocusing and reappraisal correlating with four out of five of the psychological wellbeing indicators. Our results supported the previously showed positive effects of adaptive emotion regulation strategies (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006; Gross & John, 2003; Kraiss et al., 2020; Trompetter et al., 2017) because by concentrating on positive feelings and pleasant events, individuals could facilitate their subjective well-being and may manage to decrease their depressive moods, anxiety symptoms, and feelings of loneliness. Especially through positive refocusing, which is the attempt of thinking about pleasant and happy situations instead of thinking about the harmful event (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006) . Further, perceived social support from family appeared to be another key protective factor associated with the indicators of psychological well-being, similarly to a previous study in adolescents showing the positive effects of family time (Ellis et al., 2020) . As it has been previously shown (Ellis et al., 2020; Fuller-Iglesias et al., 2015; Turner, 1981) , social support from families promoted students' coping with the negative effects caused by the pandemic and resulted in a higher evaluation of subjective well-being and better sleep quality, whereas decreased depressive mood. Other protective factors had more specific effects. In general, the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies was linked to an overall better psychological well-being. This is in line with previous studies showing that the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies reduced anxiety and depressive mood (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006; Kraaij & Garnefski, 2019; Kraiss et al., 2020; Shiota, 2006) . Contrary to our expectations this was not true for perceived social support as the effect of perceived support from a significant other was nonsignificant and support from friends correlated only with loneliness negatively but positively with depressive mood and the quality of sleep. This finding is somewhat similar to a recent study (Ellis et al., 2020) showing that during the pandemic more time connecting to friends online was related to greater depression in adolescents. On the one hand, the lack of effect of perceived support from a significant other is not surprising considering that about half of our participants were single and the majority of those in a relationship lived with friends and not with their spouses. On the other hand, the contradictory result that showed social support from friends decreasing quality of sleep could simply mean that these participants spent more time with friends at the expense of sleep, for example staying up late chatting online or talking with others they live with.",

Rumination and catastrophizing, as maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, intolerance of uncertainty, worrying about the future were risk factors of depressive mood, anxiety, loneliness, sleep problems, and lower overall subjective well-being. In contrast, social support from family and positive refocusing, an adaptive emotion regulation strategy may serve as protective factors against the negative effects of a prolonged emergency and its consequences. Further, these results have implications for professionals working with and helping (e.g., as counselors) individuals during the challenges of COVID-19 and future stressful events or catastrophes. Preventive steps could be taken to teach people self-monitoring to recognize maladaptive patterns in their thoughts, facilitate open and frequent communication by experts, and raise awareness of the importance of social support. The impact of these measures may go beyond resolving the current situation.",
