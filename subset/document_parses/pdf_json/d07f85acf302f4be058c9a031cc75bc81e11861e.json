It differentiates into several subsets of effector cells, including T helper type I (Th1), Th2, Th17, T follicular helper (Tfh), and regulatory T (Treg) cells. 4 Treg cells inhibit autoimmune responses. Cytokines are the determinant factors for T cell differentiation. For example, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, produced by macrophages and T cells, is a critical determinant factor for driving Th17 cell differentiation and inhibiting Treg cell differentiation. [5] [6] [7] In recent studies, T cell level reduction was confirmed in COVID-19 patients. 8, 9 This finding may indicate the presence of immunosuppression in patients with COVID-19. However, the reason for the reduction is still not clear. In our study, we explored the mechanism of immunosuppression in these patients. The immune status of COVID-19 patients will be described by lymphocyte apoptosis, the expression of PD-1 and HLA-DR in T cells, T cell subset levels and the production of inflammatory factors. Our findings will help us understand the immunologic mechanism of COVID-19.",

The characteristics of these patients are described, we found that the difference in SOFA scores was statistically significant (p=0.031). The routine blood tests on the 63 COVID-19 patients showed that white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts were normal in the severe group (5.31\u00d710/L and 72.1%) but were slightly increased in the critical group (7.86 \u00d710/L and 84%). However, lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in the critical group and decreased by almost 60% compared with those in the severe group (Table 1) .

To investigate this relationship, we performed linear correlation analysis between these indicators and the SOFA score.",

Similarly, our study also found that the number of T cells was decreased in routine blood tests, particularly in critical patients. Then, we confirmed the reduction in CD3 + T cell levels by flow cytometry. A study verified T cell exhaustion by measuring the exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 9 but did not perform further research. Therefore, we hypothesized that T cell exhaustion might be due to apoptosis. Then, apoptosis and the expression of PD-1 in immune cells were detected. In DovePress fact, we confirmed that CD3 + T cell apoptosis and immune cell necrosis in critically ill patients was not more serious than that in severe COVID-19 patients by flow cytometry. They were not significantly different. In contrast, our study found that the expression of PD-1 was not increased significantly in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in critical patients compared with those in severe patients. Our findings showed that apoptosis and cell necrosis levels were not different in lymphocytes, granulocytes, or monocytes between the two groups. Therefore, we hypothesized that T cell exhaustion might be due to Treg cell proliferation. HLA-DR, an indicator of sepsis prognosis, has been reported to represent a natural T cell subset of CD8 + HLA-DR + Treg cells, which may play a suppressive effect. 13 We detected the expression of HLA-DR in T cells and monocytes and tested the level of Treg cells in peripheral blood. Unfortunately, we found that either Treg proliferation or the expression of HLA-DR was not significantly changed in critically ill COVID-19 patients compared with those in severe patients. It suggested that anti-PD-1 and HLA-DR immunotherapy may be useless in treatment. However, our data are different from the results of some current studies. Some studies have reported that the expression of PD-1 14 and TiM3 9 is increased in COVID-19 patients and associate with exhaustion of T Cells, while others have reported that the expression of HLA-DR is decreased in critically ill patients. 15 Whatever the outcome, it could be due to that there are not enough patients enrolled, and too much uncertainty of the disease. Our findings indicated that CD3 + T cell apoptosis and Treg proliferation were not the reason for T cell exhaustion, at least not the main reason. Then, we analyzed one patient to detect the distribution of T cells. A surprising discovery was that a large number of T cells infiltrated the lungs in this critical patient, which might be the main reason for the lymphocytic decline in peripheral blood. Our findings were similar to those of Dr. Xu's autopsy report: inflammatory infiltration occurred in both lungs, especially by lymphocytes. 16 However, we still need additional patients to detect the distribution of T cells.",

After lysing with 1X BD FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences, CA, USA), cells were then washed two times with PBS. Data were analyzed using Kaluza software (Version 2.1)(Beckman Coulter, IN, USA). The following monoclonal antibody panel was used for surface staining: CD8-FITC (BD Biosciences, CA, USA), CD4-PE (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) and CD279 (PD-1)-APC (Biolegend, CA, USA) for PD-1 expression on lymphocytes; CD14-FITC (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) and HLA-DR-PerCP (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for HLA-DR expression on monocytes; CD4-FITC (Quanto Bio, Beijing, China), CD25-PE (Quanto Bio, Beijing, China) and CD127-APC (Quanto Bio, Beijing, China) for Treg cells.
