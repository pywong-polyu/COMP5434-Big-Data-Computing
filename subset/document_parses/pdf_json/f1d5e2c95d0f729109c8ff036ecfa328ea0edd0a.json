These patients could be differentiated from the adaptive endotype by an alteration in the GAIT-mechanism, a late transcriptional regulatory response to IFN-\u03b3 that acts to suppress innate immunity by reducing caeruloplasmin mRNA translation. Patients with the neutrophil-driven endotype had significantly increased IFN\u03b3 levels but appeared unable to suppress their innate immune response. The endothelial leak endotype could be distinguished from both the neutrophil driven and adaptive endotypes by alterations in Slit-Robo signalling, a pathway important in the maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity; Although patients with this endotype required mechanical ventilation, they did not develop multi-organ failure in the manner of the neutrophil-driven endotype patients, and had significantly better clinical outcomes. Importantly, the endotypes identified were stable over 48 hours opening up the possibility of stratified interventional clinical trials in the future.",

The characteristics that these subgroups share are enriched for mechanisms of disease, rather than grouping patients based on observable features alone (disease phenotypes). For example, Hinks et al have shown that whilst clinically based phenotypes fail to stratify patients with asthma, mechanistically plausible endotypes can be identified (3) .",

These patients could be differentiated from the adaptive endotype by an alteration in the GAIT-mechanism, a late transcriptional regulatory response to IFN-\u03b3 that acts to suppress innate immunity by reducing caeruloplasmin mRNA translation (16). Patients with the neutrophildriven endotype had significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 levels but appeared unable to suppress their innate immune response (figure 2a). The endothelial leak endotype could be distinguished from both the neutrophil driven and the adaptive endotypes by alterations in Slit-Robo signalling, a pathway important in the maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity, and although patients in this group required mechanical ventilation, they did not develop multu-organ failure in the manner of the neutrophil-driven endotype patients.",

L13a is released from the 60s ribosome and combines with GAPDH and the pre-GAIT complex to form the GAIT complex. The GAIT complex is able to bind hairpin loop-like motifs in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNA, and prevent translation of the bound RNA molecules (24) . EPRS also plays an anti-RNA viral role by binding poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2). PCBP2 inhibits the ubiquitination of the mitochondrial antiviral system (MAVS) of proteins. MAVS, via TRAF4, induces the transcription of type 1 interferons (25) . It has also been noted that the coronavirus SARS-CoV interferes with this mechanism as its ORF9b protein promotes degradation of both MAVS and TRAF4 (26) . Thus, virally induced alterations in the GAIT mechanism provide a plausible mechanism via which patients displaying the neutrophil driven develop multiorgan failure and dysregulated innate immune activation.",

The alpha coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV), has been observed to contain a GAIT motif within its genome that is able to arrest translation, and exacerbate the host innate immune response (27) . TGEV is distinct from the well-known epidemic/pandemic beta coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS, and SARS-CoV2. Clinical data from critically ill patients with SARS-CoV also identified a key role for IFN-\u03b3 in severe disease (28) . Disruption of IFN-\u03b3 related mechanisms by viral proteins may directly drive pathogenesis since IFNGR1 knockout mice show reduced pathological changes following influenza A challenge (29) , suggesting that RNA viruses may have evolved mechanisms to disrupt the immunomodulatory effects of IFN-\u03b3, which has roles in both innate immune regulation and anti-viral gene expression.",

Hierarchical clustering and heatmap analysis revealed three optimal clusters in both the SAM and NPA samples, however, these did not align with serum clusters (figure S4). In the NPA samples there were three identified clusters. Patients in the cluster with high levels of innate immune mediators (IL6, IL8, IL12p70) all had an rSOFA score of 4. In the cluster with globally depressed immune mediators, 34% received mechanical ventilation. These two clusters did not align with the neutrophil driven or adaptive endotypes. Immune mediators from the SAM samples neither aligned with rSOFA, nor serum based endotypes, suggesting that the nasal pharyngeal compartment poorly reflects the signals found in the blood compartment.

However, our analyses demonstrate that there are three distinct mechanistic processes occurring in patients with moderate or severe influenza, which relate to differential clinical outcomes. Given that a large proportion of patients in the endothelial leak endotype required mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support, it is surprising that their 30-day mortality was similar to those with an adaptive immune response to influenza. The lack of differentially expressed genes between the endothelial leak and neutrophil driven endotypes is particularly striking given their different immune mediator profiles and clinical features. This brings into question the value of comparing individually expressed genes in isolation, when trying to explain immunological and clinical phenomena in complex multisystem diseases. Given that genes work in coordinated networks, the WGCNA approach we adopted allowed us to identify gene modules responsible for differentiating biological processes between these subgroups of patients.",

LDA is similar to principal component analysis (PCA) but seeks to maximize the variance between points that have been assigned a label (i.e. supervised). A fitted LDA model assigns relative importance to each contributing covariate. A positive importance means that this feature is strongly discriminant, whereas a feature with a negative importance is not discriminant between assigned groups. LDA can be used to distinguish the discriminant features between multiple (more than two) groups simultaneously, without having to resort to 'one-vs-all' based methods that other classification methods use (logistic regression, random forests).",
