Uncertainty related to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has enhanced the levels of stress, depression and anxiety in the general population, including nurses [1] . According to an online survey in 20 countries, adults were more affected by stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than depression and anxiety [2] . Medical personnel need good mental health in the fight against various infectious diseases [3] . Stress reduces immunity, making nurses more vulnerable to the coronavirus. Most studies concerning the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are related to epidemiological factors, but only a few papers have focused on the stress that affects nurses [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Moreover, a comparison between coping strategies for stress before and during the pandemic for nurses in the sample is made. The novelty of this research with respect to previous achievements from the literature: The comparison between nurses and non-employed nursing students in terms of vulnerability to stress, the comparative analysis before and during the pandemic for these categories, the differences between coping strategies for stress before the epidemic and during it. Moreover, the novelty is also supported by methodology compared to previous studies that are based on the multiple regression model [5, 9] . In our case, matching methods were used to ensure a deep analysis of the differences in the vulnerability to stress among different categories of nursing students, some of them already employed as nurses due to their secondary education.",

Three quarters of nurses working in the Zagazig Fever Hospital in Egypt experienced a high level of stress at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "text": "For the period corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies based on surveys identified stressors for nurses. A few studies focused on demographic characteristics, which is also an objective of this paper. For example, in Turkey, the analysis of a sample of 662 nursing students during the epidemic indicated that stress is determined by age, stress, but also to specific issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic [4] . The age was considered a good predictor for stress among nurses from Jordan during the pandemic in the sense that younger ones are more vulnerable to stress [6] . Gender was a predictor of stress in the case of nurses from India, females being two times more vulnerable to stress than males [19] . A similar study was conducted in this paper, but additional research was done for employed and non-employed nursing students, the employed ones already working as nurses in medical units. Other studies focused on personal states of nurses and labor requirements. An example is the study of Mo et al. for nurses in China where anxiety, the number of children in the family, and working hours per week are significant stressors [5] . Wang et al. showed that sources of stress during the coronavirus epidemic included the fear of being infected and transmitting the virus to one's family, and also the discomfort of wearing a mask all the time [8] . The most important sources of stress for nurses in China mentioned by Leng et al. are: fear of being infected with the coronavirus, issues related to protective equipment, hard work, lack of experience in the new context, and the isolated environment [20] . Homesickness was found to be the most important stressor for nurses in a hospital from Shanghai [9] . Personal traits might also act as stressors for all people, including nurses. Liu et al. analyzed the connection between perceived stress and personality features in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [21] . Canadian adults with extroversion and neuroticism were more vulnerable to stress during the epidemic compared to other categories, but also compared to the period before the pandemic.",

Coping self-efficacy helped nurses from Jordan to reduce stress during the SARS-CoV-2 crisis [6] . Pasay-An identified a few strategies to reduce stress among nurses in Saudi Arabia: support from managers and colleagues and good communication of new procedures during the pandemic [23] . However, Folkman and Moskowitz explained that all these quantitative approaches should be completed by a qualitative analysis to figure out individual options related to coping with stress [24] .",

Some demographic variables were analyzed as possible stressors, and females were found to be more vulnerable to stress than males for both categories (employed and non-employed students). Students from a rural environment tended to have higher stress scores than those in urban zones during the pandemic, because of isolation and less opportunities to access the labor market in big cities. Comparisons between nurses who are also students and individuals preparing to work as nurses are also essential to provide recommendations for the latter, based on the experiences of those who worked as nurses during the pandemic. Education remains an important pillar in the fight against stress.",
