To analyze the interplay between Se and gut microbiota, gut metabolomic profiles were determined in conventional (C) and microbiota depleted mice (Abx) after Se-supplementation (Abx-Se) by untargeted metabolomics, using an analytical multiplatform based on GC-MS and UHPLC-QTOF-MS (MassIVE ID MSV000087829). Gut microbiota profiling was performed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Significant differences in the levels of about 70% of the gut metabolites determined, including fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and steroids, were found in Abx-Se compared to Abx, and only 30% were different between Abx-Se and C, suggesting an important effect of Se-supplementation on Abx mice metabolism. At genus level, the correlation analysis showed strong associations between metabolites and gut bacterial profiles. Likewise, higher abundance of Lactobacillus spp., a potentially beneficial genus enriched after Se-supplementation, was associated with higher levels of prenol lipids, phosphatidylglycerols (C-Se), steroids and diterpenoids (Abx-Se), and also with lower levels of fatty acids (Abx-Se). Thus, we observed a crucial interaction between Se intake\u2212microbiota\u2212metabolites, although further studies to clarify the specific mechanisms are needed. This is the first study about untargeted gut metabolomics after microbiota depletion and Sesupplementation.",

Gut content and fecal samples contain a great number of metabolites that reflect the results of nutrient ingestion, digestion, and absorption by gut microbiota, and consequently have a key impact on host metabolism. 14 To this end, the integration of gut microbiota taxonomy and gut metabolome can provide interesting information about the mechanisms used in the host\u2212microbiota interactions.",

GC-MS raw data processing was described previously. 26 In brief, files were converted into CDF Journal of Proteome Research pubs.acs.org/jpr Article format using the Thermo File Converter tool (Thermo Fisher Scientific). XCMS software included in the R platform (http:// www.r-project.org) was used for the extraction, alignment of peaks, and normalization. In this sense, data were extracted using the algorithm \"matched filter method\" which slices the data into extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) on a fixed step size, and then each slice was filtered with matched filtration using a second-derivative Gaussian as the model peak shape. The parameters for GC\u2212MS data were S/N threshold 2, full width at half-maximum (fwhm) 3, and width of the m/z range 0.1. After peak extraction, grouping and retention time correction of peaks was realized in three iterative cycles with descending bandwidth (bw) from 5 to 1 s. For data normalization, the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOESS) normalization method was performed, which adjusts the local median of log fold changes of peak intensities between samples in the data set to be approximately zero across the whole peak intensity range. The preprocessed data were then exported as a .csv file for further statistical analysis. For UHPLC-QTOF-MS raw data processing was carried out with Agilent MassHunter Profinder B.10.0 software (Agilent Technologies). To extract the data, Batch Recursive Feature Extraction (RFE) for small molecules wizard from the software was applied. RFE performs two algorithms: First, the Molecular Feature Extraction algorithm (MFE) including extraction, selection of ion species, and charge state was used to find the features in the data set. Second, the initial features were aligned by retention time (RT) and mass, creating a list of unique features through binning. Then, the RT and mass data pairs of the aligned and binning features were used as input criteria to more accurately find the features using the Find by Ion algorithm (FbI).

In order to ensure a good stability and reliable metabolomics results, the analysis was evaluated using a total of 6 quality control samples (QC), which consisted of a pull of all the gut samples included in the study.

            "text": "Although several studies have reported the effect of Se-intake on metabolism, 24,32,33 even after exposure to xenobiotics, 2 there are not many antecedents about the impact of Se supplementation diet on mice gut metabolism. 23 In our work, we have studied for the first time the gut metabolomic profile of conventional and microbiota-depleted mice influenced by Se-supplementation including the associations between metabolic alterations and gut microbiota. The most altered metabolomic profile was found in the Abx-Se group compared to Abx (50 altered metabolites of a total of 73 annotated). In contrast, very few differences were found between Abx-Se and C groups (Table S4) . Figure 2 shows one area of gut metabolites abundance remarkably increased in Abx vs C, which decreased in Abx-Se suggesting the potential beneficial role of Se-supplementation against antibiotic treatment consequences over these metabolites. Overall, levels of fatty acyls including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and fatty acid esters increased in the Abx gut metabolome. This fact could be associated with an intestinal malabsorption maybe due to absence of microbes to transform these metabolites into energy supply. 34 The levels of these fatty acids decreased after Se-supplementation in Abx pretreated mice, suggesting a beneficial effect of Se on the intestinal Journal of Proteome Research pubs.acs.org/jpr Article microbiota restoration that resumes the absorption of these compounds. Concretely, the levels of 16-hydroxy-10-oxohexadecanoic acid, 6-hydroxy-8-pentacosanone, 6-hydroxy-8-hexacosanone, 2-hydroxy-22-methyltetracosanoic acid, erythro-6,8-tricosanediol, and erythro-6,8-pentacosanediol were significantly altered in Abx vs C, but no significant changes were observed in Abx-Se vs C. According to these results, the pathway analysis showed that the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis was one of the most affected metabolic routes by the exposure of antibiotics and Sesupplementation ( Figure 3 ). In addition, fatty acids and their metabolites play important roles in the intestinal immune system 35 and are crucial for the health of the host. 36 Moreover, increased levels of azelaic acid are linked to oxidative stress and depression. 16 Higher levels of azelaic acid were found in Abx mice, and these levels diminished after Se-intake in Abx-Se suggesting that dietary Se-supplementation has a beneficial role against oxidative stress on metabolism, which is one of the most known properties of Se. The majority of the studies about the gut microbiota and their impact in fatty acids metabolism are related to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate and butyrate by carbohydrate fermentation. It is well-known that SCFAs are essential for providing energy to epithelial cells 37 and have beneficial effects in the maintenance of the gut barrier. 38 However, we did not find alteration in the levels of SCFAs in our study. These metabolites probably could not be detected because they eluted during the time the filament was turned off (first 6 min) in the chromatograph. Otherwise, few works have described the role of gut microbiota in the metabolism of long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), but some of them have reported the effect of LCFAs intake, including palmitic acid, on gut microbiota composition. 39 In our work, levels of the LCFAs 6-hydroxypentadecanedioic acid, 12,13-epoxy-11-hydroxy-9,15-octadecadienoic acid, 9,10-dihydroxystearic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid diminished in Abx and Abx-Se groups against C, increasing in Abx-Se against Abx, suggesting an influence of Se-supplementation in LCFA metabolism on microbiota depleted mice. Steroid biosynthesis was the main affected metabolic route due to the depletion of microbiota, and also to Se-supplementation ( Figure 3 ). Most of the steroids such as cholesterol, 4-methyl-5-cholestan-8,24-dien-3ona, coprostanol, 24-ethylcoprostanol, demosterol, and campesterol were found at significantly higher levels in Abx group. It is well-known that nonabsorbed sterols reach the colon, where gut microbiota biotransform them in subproducts. 40 Sterol biotransformation by the gut microbiota is important for the production of metabolites involved in the energy supply to the host through anaerobic fermentative processes. 40 Low levels of the prenol lipids such as tocopherol, 6,10,14-trimethyl-5,9,13-pentadecatrien-2-one, 4-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-5-cholestan-8,24-dien-3-ol, and sorgolactone were observed in Abx mice. The antioxidant activity of prenol lipids have been reported in the literature. 41 In our study, prenol lipids also decreased after microbiota depletion (Abx vs C) and increased after Se-supplementation (Abx-Se) indicating that the well-known role of Se against oxidative stress 1 could be mediated, almost in part, by gut microbiota. Differences in indole derivatives compounds were observed in Abx and Abx-Se groups. In this sense, we found significant increased levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic in Abx-Se, and decreased levels of calycanthidine in Abx. It is known that indole derivatives are crucial in the interplay between host and microbiota, which are involved in tryptophan metabolism and, consequently, related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. 42 The pathway analysis ( Figure 3 ) also showed perturbations in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolism. Changes in the levels of these amino acids by gut microbiota, especially tryptophan, have been related to alterations in the functioning of central and enteric nervous systems. 43 In the same way, significantly augmented and decreased levels of the bile acid 7-hydroxy-5-cholanic acid were found in Abx-Se and Abx groups, respectively. As indole derivatives, many authors have reported the role of bile acids in the link between the intestinal microbiome and the brain. These compounds have been recognized as signaling molecules for a variety of metabolic activities. 44, 45 According to the pathway analysis (Figure 3 ), glycerophospholipid and glycerolipids metabolisms were significantly affected in Abx and Abx-Se mice. It is known that gut microbiota has been shown to affect lipid metabolism. 46 In our work, significant differences between levels of glycerides (MG ( however, no significant changes in the levels of these compounds were observed between Abx-Se and C, suggesting a potential effect of Se in the microbiota restoration, which positively affects the glycerophospholipids and glycerolipids metabolisms. In the same way, the organooxygen compounds 1-(2-furanyl)-1-butanone, theaspirone A, and 7-pentacosanone were found significantly perturbed in Abx mice, but no alteration were observed in Abx-Se compared to C.",

In the same way, Lactobacillus was positively correlated with 6,10,14-trimethyl-5,9,13-pentadecatrien-2-one and campesterol, and negatively with fatty acids (azelaic acid and stearic acid) in Abx-Se mice. No correlations between Lactobacillus and gut metabolites were observed in Abx. 48 On the other hand, although some Lachnospiraceae groups were mainly negatively associated with monoglycerides in C group, we observed positive correlations between the genera Lachnospiraceae_UCG004 and Lachnospira-ceae_UCG006 and the monoglycerides MG(20:5), MG(22:4), MG(22:5) after Se-supplementation (C-Se), suggesting the impact of Se-intake on glycerolipid metabolism through the function of Lachnospiraceae members. It is known that Lachnospiraceae members are involved in the production of butyrate 14 and consequently in the SCFA metabolism. Moreover, some authors have described that Lachnospiraceae are related to changes in lipid metabolism, as well as specific nutrients. 49 Likewise, we found that Flavonifactor and Oscillibacter members from the Ruminococcaceae family, which was influenced by Se-supplementation, were positively correlated with steroids (1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D2, 5cholestane-3,7,12,23-tetrol, and 4-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-5cholesta-8,24-dien-3-oland) in Abx-Se mice. Some authors Journal of Proteome Research pubs.acs.org/jpr Article have reported the link between the stimulation of Ruminococcaceae species and Se-yeast supplementation, contributing to the maintenance of gut health and providing enzymatic ability to degrade cellulose and hemicellulose. 23,48",
