Antimalarial peroxides have reported antiviral and anticancer activities. Here, we evaluated the in vitro activities of artesunate (AS) and two ozonides (OZ418 and OZ277) against human \u03b1-coronavirus NL63 and \u03b2-coronaviruses OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 in several cell lines. OZ418 had the best selectivity index (SI) in NL63-infected Vero cells and MK2 cells. The overall SI of the tested compounds was cell-type dependent. In OC43-infected human foreskin fibroblasts, AS had the best cell-associated SI, \u226517 \u03bcM, while the SI of OZ418 and OZ277 was \u226512 \u03bcM and \u22657 \u03bcM, respectively. AS did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in either Vero or Calu-3 cells. A comparison of OZ418 and OZ277 activity in SARS-CoV2-infected Calu-3 cells revealed similar EC 50 (5.3 \u03bcM and 11.6 \u03bcM, respectively), higher than the EC 50 of remdesivir (1.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM), but the SI of OZ418 was higher than OZ277. A third ozonide, OZ439, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 efficiently in Vero cells, but compared to OZ418 in Calu-3 cells, it showed higher toxicity. Improved inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 was observed when OZ418 was used together with remdesivir. Although the EC 50 of ozonides might be clinically achieved in plasma after intravenous administration, sustained virus suppression in tissues will require further considerations, including drug combination. Our work supports the potential repurposing of ozonides and calls for future in vivo models.",

For example, the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir had benefits in patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 5 but no benefit was observed in adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. 6 Several drugs studied until now for COVID-19 have been repurposed from other indications, to allow faster track therapeutics. These include the antimalarials hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin), chloroquine, and remdesivir, immune modulating agents, 7\u22129 and virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. 10 The antimalarial agents, artemisinins, as well as their fully synthetic versions (ozonides) have shown activity against several DNA and RNA viruses. 11 Although ozonides (1,2,4trioxolanes) have a similar mode of action to artemisinins against the malaria parasites, they have shown an extended half-life in animal models, 12,13 providing therapeutic advantage not only for the treatment of malaria but also for repurposing to other indications. OZ277 (arterolane) was registered in India in 2011 for antimalarial therapy in combination with piperaquine. 14 The next-generation ozonide, OZ439 (artefenomel), exhibits an increased pharmacokinetic half-life and good safety profile and is being tested in phase IIb clinical trials. 12, 15, 16 OZ418 has reported antischistosomal activity. 13 The detailed in vitro activity of artesunate and ozonides against human CoV is reported here.",

The serum concentration or area under the concentration time 13 The in vitro activity of OZ against human CMV was similar to AS, but the in vivo activity in a mouse CMV model was significantly improved compared to AS. 30 Our data reveal that the EC 50 of OZ418, OZ277, and AS are stable and specific for the cell lines tested; it was higher in HFFs compared to the monkey epithelial cells. HFFs are used here for the first time for infection with CoV OC43. We note that OC43 does not bind to the ACE2 receptor; hence, vimentin may interact with additional cellular receptors to facilitate virus entry or intracellular processing. 31, 32 The variability in the antiviral activity of artemisinins/ozonides in the different cell lines is consistent with the reported activity of artemisinins in different cancer cell lines 33 and suggests that the molecular target influences drug activity. It may also suggest differential usage of cellular receptors and coreceptors by NL63, OC43, and SARS-CoV-2 in the different cell types treated with OZ or artemisinins. A recent study showed differences in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process controlled by vimentin, between different origins of epithelial cells: alveolar (A549), bronchial (Calu-3), and colonic (Caco-2). When challenged with transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, A549 cells underwent EMT, evidenced by a spindlelike morphology, increased vimentin, and downregulation of Ecadherin, an epithelial marker. In contrast, Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells failed to show morphological changes or alterations in marker expression associated with EMT. 34 These data suggest the effect of AS may depend on vimentin availability for binding, while OZ either have better affinity for vimentin or target additional cellular proteins. Although vimentin has been suggested as a target for treatment of SARS-CoV-2, better understanding of the effects of virus infection and antiviral agents on vimentin stability, post-translational modification, and protein interaction is required. 35 In the case of CMV, infection disassembled vimentin, and artemisinins stabilized vimentin early after infection. 18 Future studies are needed to better understand the biological effects of CoV on vimentin and the timing and effects of artemisinins/ozonides on vimentin during infection.",

A more detailed comparison of its antiviral activity on clinical isolates of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells revealed that the 50% cytopathic effect was similar for both viruses but much higher than the RNA suppression. Lower susceptibilities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates to remdesivir were also measured for the Hong Kong/VM20001061/2020 strain. 37 This study also suggested that remdesivir should be considered as a combination therapy with emetine based on in vitro synergy.",

Furthermore, agents with broad activity against viruses/microorganisms may act through host-derived mechanisms that are cell-specific. Identification of these mechanisms will be critical in the future repurposing of drugs in infectious diseases. In vivo drug concentrations are measured in blood, but drug concentrations at the site of infection must also be considered. For respiratory viral infections, the concentrations achieved in the lung parenchyma may determine the efficacy of a given drug. For example, Oseltamivir has high bioavailability and penetrates sites of infection at concentrations that are sufficient to inhibit influenza replication. 38 The C max of oral OZ277 is achieved within 1.5\u22125 h, and then plasma concentration declines with a mean T 1/2 of 2\u22124 h.

Human foreskin fibroblasts (ATCC, CRL-2088) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Vero E6 monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1586) and Calu-3 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC HTB-55) were used for infection with SARS-CoV-2. HCoV-NL63 (Zeptometrix, Franklin, MA, USA) and HCoV-OC43 (ATCC VR-1558, from Dr. Kelly Henrickson) were used for the infection of cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 unless otherwise specified. SARS-CoV-2 strain USA_WA1/2020 was used for infection of Vero E6 and Calu-3, at an MOI of 0.05. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 4% FBS postinfection with NL63 and OC43 and either 2% or 4% postinfection with SARS-CoV-2 along with varying concentrations of the compounds. Cells treated with DMSO were used as negative controls, and emetine or remdesivir (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as a positive control for CoV inhibition.",

OZ418 showed a 2.7-fold reduction in EC 50 by released (supernatant) viral RNA in MK2 cells compared to Vero cells (Figures 2D and 3D,Table 1). The EC 50 of OZ277 measured in MK2 supernatants was similar to the EC 50 observed in Vero cells (Figures 2E and 3E, Table 1). In MK2 cells, the EC 50 of AS for released viral RNA was 1.4-fold lower than the observed EC 50 in Vero cells(Figures 2F and 3F, Table 1). Similar to the SI in Vero cells, OZ418 had the highest SI among the compounds tested (Table 1).Inhibition of \u03b2-CoV OC43 by AS and OZ. To test whether OZ had activity against both \u03b1and \u03b2-CoV, compounds were tested against OC43-infected human foreskinTable 1. EC 50 , CC 50 , and SI of OZ and AS against CoV",
