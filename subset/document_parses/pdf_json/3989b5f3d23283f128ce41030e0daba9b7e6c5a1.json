In addition, we calcu-lated the Economic Hardship Index (EHI) by using variables from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey (14). We developed 16 subcounty measures from the hospitalization and death data and aggregated these data to 5-year rates according to zip code. We also mapped the EHI according to zip code. We mapped BRFSS data at the county level, the smallest level of geography available for this data set. We stratified all measures, except EHI, by age to illustrate increases in risk by age. We developed a webbased mapping application in ArcGIS Online and linked this application to existing web data portals at floridatracking.com (the EPHT portal) and FLHealthCHARTS.com. Because we derived the data measures from different sources, we developed a user guide and linked it to the ArcGIS mapping application. This user guide discusses data limitations and the need to interpret data with caution at the subcounty level because of small population sizes. To promote the new mapping application, we added prominent links to the EPHT portal and FLHealthCHARTS.com, which is the most widely used publicly available FDOH data repository and query system (with thousands of visitors per day).",

The use of zip code geography provides for community-level input on populations disproportionately affected by severe outcomes of COVID-19. The mapping application is used by the public and by the state health office and local county health departments to speak with communities about COVID-19 response and to identify areas of Florida at greatest risk for severe outcomes of COVID-19. In addition, the map informed hospital demand planning for the FDOH Bureau of Preparedness and Response, as concerns grew about exceeding hospital bed capacity in Florida. As of February 2021, the map had more than 4,500 views. Other public health programs could use our mapping application as a template for developing a similar application.
