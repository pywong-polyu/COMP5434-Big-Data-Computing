Between April 10th and May 28th, 2020, 319 HCWs with acute illness were reviewed. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR screening, a multiplex molecular panel was used for testing other respiratory pathogens. For SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs, the normalized viral load, viral culture, and virus neutralization assays were performed weekly. For SARS-CoV-2 negative HCWs, SARS-CoV-2 serological testing was performed one month after inclusion. Among the 319 HCWs included, 67 (21.0%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 65/67 (97.0%) developed mild form of COVID-19. Other respiratory pathogens were found in 6/66 (9.1%) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 47/241 (19.5%) SARS-Cov-2 negative HCWs (p = 0.07). The proportion of HCWs with a viral load > 5.0 log 10 cp/ mL (Ct value < 25) was less than 15% at 8 days after symptom onset; 12% of HCWs were positive after 40 days (Ct > 37). More than 90% of cultivable virus had a viral load > 4.5 log 10 cp/mL (Ct < 26) and were collected within 10 days after symptom onset. Among negative HCWs, 6/190 (3.2%) seroconverted. Our data suggest that the determination of viral load can be used for appreciating the infectiousness of infected HCWs. These data could be helpful for facilitating their return to work.",

Due to close, repeated, and prolonged contacts with COVID-19 patients, HCWs have been a privileged target for SARS-CoV-2 infection 1-3 . Similar to the rest of the population, the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infections reported in HCWs encompassed asymptomatic, mild, but also severe and fatal infections 4-7 . The early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected HCWs is crucial to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission, which can be associated with an important OPEN mortality in at-risk patients 6, 8, 9 . However, medical resources may not be sufficient to keep infected HCWs on leave for a long time due to HCW shortage. Defining the duration of infectivity of HCWs is therefore of paramount importance for their appropriate management, which becomes crucial to face the current intensive recirculation of the virus in the Northern hemisphere 10,11 .",

The virus can be detected about 2 to 3 days before the onset of symptoms and the viral RNA excretion can last up to several weeks depending on the immune competence, the patient age, as well as the severity of the disease 12-17 . As frequently observed for other viral infections, the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA can be detected beyond the resolution of symptoms, after seroconversion, and without any detectable infectious virus in clinical samples [18] [19] [20] [21] . To assess the duration of infectivity of COVID-19 patients, no standard, rapid, and reliable method is available, and consequently the viral isolation in cell culture remains the most appropriate approach despite its fastidiousness 22 . In previous reports, SARS-CoV-2 isolation could be performed up to 10 days after symptom onset in mild-symptomatic patients 18,23-25 and up to 22 days after the first positive results in severe cases 20,25-27 . To improve the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs, a virological investigation including quantitative RT-PCR, viral culture, as well as the determination of neutralizing antibodytiters over the course of the disease is needed. With this aim, we performed a comprehensive assessment of COVID-19 in a longitudinal cohort study of 319 front-line HCWs enrolled during the first wave of the pandemic.",

The clinical and demographical characteristics of these 6 co-infected patients are detailed in Supplementary Table 1 . No bacterial co-infection was found for positive SARS-CoV-2 patients. For negative SARS-CoV-2 HCWs, the most frequent pathogens were rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 27), adenovirus (n = 15), and other coronaviruses (HKU1 or NL63, n = 7).

Regarding clinical findings, HCWs presented mostly a mild form of the disease, which can be explained by their relatively young age 31 . We confirmed the important proportion of smell and taste dysfunctions 7,32 , and a low rate of co-infection in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was found. Higher rates of co-infection have been reported elsewhere, which may be explained by the differences in disease severity and in the timing of testing 33, 34 . A very low proportion of HCWs with a negative RT-PCR test at inclusion seroconverted one month later, suggesting the possibility of a false negative PCR test result at initial screening. Several factors can explain false negative results with RT-PCR, including the low sensitivity of some assays 35, 36 , the poor quality of samples, or the inappropriate timing of sampling 37 . However, the Cobas RT-PCR assay used for screening herein has been widely evaluated and no lack of sensitivity has been reported 38 . Furthermore, the quality of samples was checked using a cell control 39 in order to prevent false negative results due to low cell count. Taken together, our findings confirmed the low rate of false negative RT-PCR results using serology testing 40 , although initial reports have wrongly alerted the scientific community about the poor sensitivity of RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 screening 41 . Due to the design of the present study, it cannot be excluded that some individuals may have developed COVID-19 between inclusion and the serological testing performed one month later for negative patients at inclusion.",

In a meta-analysis, a mean duration of RT-PCR positivity of 17 days has been reported with a maximum of 83 days 42 .

Another large study on 3,790 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples inoculated for viral culture has found that a large majority of cultivable samples were collected during the first week 43 . This delay might be in line with the time required for the elicitation of nAbs, as suggested by the limited number of infectious virus found herein in samples with high viral load obtained after seroconversion, and by the contemporaneous presence of nAbs in the serum of most individuals with negative viral culture. Similarly, in a report on hospitalized patients, serum nAb titers have been independently associated with the absence of detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2. The latter study has also found that some hospitalized patients with a low titer of neutralizing antibodies could still have a positive culture, as also observed herein 20 .",

In addition to age 17 , the observed differences in viral load might be related to the severity of the disease, as higher viral loads are usually noticed in patients with severe forms 45 . Although the viral load can vary depending on the gene targeted by quantitative RT-PCR, a viral load of 5 to 6 log 10 copies/mL has been suggested as a proxy for the presence of infectious virus 18, 22 . In the present study, more than 90% of cultivable virus had a viral load > 4.5 log 10 cp/mL and were collected within 10 days after symptom onset. This viral load corresponded to a Ct value of 26 with the Argene RT-PCR kit targeting the N gene. For most clinical laboratories that cannot afford true quantitative RT-PCR results, Ct values might be helpful to assess the presence of infectious virus, as previously reported [22] [23] [24] [25] 27, 43 . However, as underlined by Han et al., Ct values are highly dependent on the RT-PCR kit used and can be affected by batch effect or PCR conditions. Therefore, Ct values should be interpreted with caution 46 , especially in taking into account the presence of upper respiratory symptoms and the time following symptom onset.",

First, the inclusion period between April and June 2020, corresponded to the second half of the first epidemic wave in France, which led to a limited number of enrolled patients. Furthermore, the national lockdown may have had a substantial impact on the circulation of other respiratory viruses and the rate of co-infection is possibly underestimated. In addition, the date of symptom onset can be difficult to determine accurately. As asymptomatic HCWs were not screened, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was certainly underestimated in our cohort 4, 7, 30 . Finally, the results of viral culture must be considered with caution as this method can lack sensitivity, as its performance are highly dependent on the proper collection, transport, and rapidity of inoculation of samples on cells. Despite these limitations, the strength of the present study is to combine a clinical assessment with a comprehensive microbiological investigation in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. In particular, the longitudinal determination of SARS-CoV-2 viral load normalized using the HPRT1 housekeeping gene has not been performed so far. This method might be helpful for preventing misinterpretation related to a poor quality of sampling.",

The cytopathic effects (CPE) were monitored daily; samples were harvested when positive, while negative samples at 96 h underwent subculture on new plates. Culture supernatants were sampled at 2 h post-inoculation, at 96 h, and after an additional 96 h of subculture. RNA from supernatants was extracted using the automated MGISP-960 workstation using MGI Easy Magnetic Beads Virus DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (MGI Tech, Marupe, Latvia), and SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR kit on a QuantStudio 5 System (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA).",

Serial dilutions of human serum were incubated with pseudoviruses at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, then transferred onto HeLa-ACE2 cells in 96-well plates at 10 000 cells/well (Corning). Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h and HeLa-ACE2 cells were further lysed using 1 \u00d7 luciferase lysis buffer (Oz Biosciences), at room temperature for 1 h. Luciferase activity was measured by adding luciferase substrate (Oz Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase intensity was then read using a TECAN luminometer. The results from this assay were expressed as the serum dilution required to reduce infection by 50% (neutralization titer).",
