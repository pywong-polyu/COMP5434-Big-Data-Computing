In addition, the concurrent Covid-19 pandemic has caused disruption to the development of green bond around the world. This research explores the current development status of the green bond in Southeast Asian countries. A total of thirty-two semi-structured interviews were held with capital market participants in Southeast Asian countries. The results highlight barriers, opportunities, and regulation difficulties, and expected growth for the development of the green bond market. This research is concluded by indicating several propositions that can be tested in the future to generalize the findings from this work. We thus extend the knowledge of green bond in the financial markets of Southeast Asian countries, which also delivers implications for practitioners and policy-makers regarding the development of green bond in Southeast Asian countries.",

Besides the several challenges for accomplishing these goals, including a lack of political will, weak capacity and technical availabilities, as well as inadequate managerial mechanisms, the SDGs agenda requires sufficient financial support, especially from the private sector, to deal with pollution and climate damages, caused by business and manufacturing operations. However, the possibility of accessing available financial resources for funding has not yet been effectively resolved and the need for green investments has grown since there was a huge investment gap, currently estimated at nearly 200 billion euros per year to fulfill those SDGs (Anzolin and Lebdioui 2021) .",

First, most of the green investment projects, whether conducted in the private or the public sector are capital-intensive (Baulkaran 2019) . Second, the implementation of green projects is faced with higher risk, and possibly a lower return (Chiesa and Barua 2019; Quatrini 2021) . Besides, researchers also suggest that green financing is especially difficult to access in Asia, where the financial sectors are mostly dominated by the commercial banks as well as there being a paucity of venture capitals, especially in Southeast Asia (Deschryver and De Mariz 2020; Tolliver et al. 2021) . Thus, there is a need for new financial sources and the construction of green investment mechanisms that suit the green efforts. Thus, the introduction of the corporate green bond (GB) can help the private sector to fund cleaner business production and climate change mitigations caused by business operations and thus contribute to achieve the SDGs.",

GB can be used to raise financial support from investors who want to invest in projects that prioritize sustainability and environmental protection rather than focusing on economic benefits (Azhgaliyeva et al. 2020; Sangiorgi and Schopohl 2021) . Although GB is a similar mechanism to the conventional bonds, including face value, maturity date, and issuer, the main difference between GB and the conventional bond comes from the \"green\" label, which requires the issuer to use funding from the issuance of the GB for climate change mitigation, cleaner operations, and environmental protection actions for supporting a climate-resilient economy (Ng and Tao 2016; Quatrini 2021) . However, several concerns associated with GB have been raised which have not been examined by the current literature, such as growth barriers for the development of GB, advantages for issuers of GB, the supply and demand of GB, relevant regulations of GBs, implications for the future of GBs, the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on the development of GB, especially in the Southeast Asian market.

For example, some of the actors, such as standard setters, investors, or strategic business partners, deliver direct impacts on the decision to issue or develop GB (Erdogan and Acaravci 2021; Pi\u00f1eiro-Chousa et al. 2021) . Other actors can be seen as those having an indirect influence on the decision to invest more in GB, such as government agencies that encourage sustainability policies, or international bodies that favor GB (Sangiorgi and Schopohl 2021) . However, other investors may show a resistance to holding GB as they believe that this may reduce their economic benefits (Tolliver et al. 2021) . One of the significant features of institutions is defined by Gupta et al. (2010, p.459) as being \"\u2026 incrementally and conservatively to deal with social problems as they are based on cultural practices, deep-rooted lifestyles and ideological premises\u2026\" This feature implies that institutions are slow to react and adapt with change, which is reported as the fundamental limitation for addressing risks evolved from climate change and sustainability matters (Gupta et al. 2010; Nguyen et al. 2021 ). Thus, a critical issue facing institutions is the satisfaction of a wide range of stakeholders in a way that is consistent with their own aims.",

This ambiguity underlines the requirement for the standard setters and policy-makers to develop criteria and guidelines for qualifying GB, as a variety of uncertainties and risks may arise, thus harming the reputation of GB issuers as well delivering other negative implications for the investors and stakeholders (Nanayakkara and Colombage 2019) .",

However, GB's obligations should both include conventional bonds' characteristics, as well as the non-financial requirements and criteria for which GB were introduced or issued (Wang et al. 2020) . In other words, there are currently no environmental protection and climate mitigation obligations or penalties as long as the issuer can meet the financial requirements associated with GB. Although the \"green\" label is a significant feature of GB, as investors intentionally invest in GB for their expectation on the green implications of the investment, the concern of the obligation to fulfill this green obligation is not definitely solved (Zhang 2020) .

First, the Covid-19 pandemic caused the reduction in prices of the traditional energies such as coal, oil, and gas, thus reducing the interest in the alternative renewable energies as well as the associated sustainable finance (Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. 2021) . Second, remedies used to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, such as travel restrictions and quarantine have contributed to the international economic recession during the Covid-19 pandemic; the overreaching concern of most of businesses as well as stakeholders has been to continue business during the pandemic (Wells et al. 2020; Barbier and Burgess 2020) . Hence, the initial motivation for supporting environment protection and climate change mitigation via sustainable finance and investment of stakeholders has been reduced. Similarly, economic recovery plans developed by most governments around the world prioritize the economic survival and sustaining value chain for recovering rather than setting green efforts as a precedence (Abbas et al. 2021) . Therefore, the current disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic requires many efforts from policy-makers, market participants and GB issuers to sustain green investments. In other words, the establishment and preservation of sustainable finance such as GB may depend on the current business and regulatory context in each region and the relevant countries.",

The semi-structured interview is a popular data collection method in qualitative research as it facilitates the accessibility, flexibility, intelligibility, and ability to highlight critical and hidden facets of each respondent's points of view (Paul 2017) . As a part of the data collection procedure, four pilot interviews were conducted to make sure that the interview guide was appropriate and respondents could express their views fully along with their experiences of GB. Furthermore, purposive sampling and snowball sampling procedures have been adopted to access research participants who can provide valuable insights on to the phenomenon that meet the investigator's interest (Gioia et al. 2010; Rheinhardt and Gioia 2021) . The requirements for selecting respondents included the participant being an incumbent who works in a financial institution, or a fund manager with at least fifteen years' experience as a stock market trader and must presently be investing in the GB. Importantly, for the success of this study, the main participants of this research, who are portfolio managers and financial analysts in the Southeast Asian markets, must be approached. Those key participants can help us to facilitate the assessment to respondents across a wide range of Southeast Asian investment funds and financial institutions. Each respondent was then contacted to arrange a convenient interview time and procedure. There was a total of 32 informants from 8 funds and financial institutions, which have been coded as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H for participation in our research. All of the respondents were assured anonymity by name and institution. However, their job titles are mentioned. During each interview, following the snowball sampling approach, respondents were asked to recommend additional participants with the aim of maximizing the number of research participants across a variety of institutions. Furthermore, after seeking the permission of each respondent, interviews were conducted and recorded by the researchers, and the length of the interviews ranged between 60 and 80 min. Table 1 represents details of these interviews.",

This finding is consistent with the Climate Bond Initiative (2019), which reports that the issuance demand and supply of GB will grow in the world after 2020. Additionally, GB is also expected to replace the conventional bond and become the standard for the bond market. Those findings reinforce suggestions found in the studies of Banga (2019), Deschryver and De Mariz (2020) , and Tolliver et al. (2020) . Therefore, the following proposition can be concluded:",

Therefore, this paper aims to provide insights into the status quo of green bonds throughout the Southeast Asian countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the GB has emerged as an important source of finance for SDGs, the GB market still only accounts for a small proportion of the bond market (Climate Bonds Initiative 2019; Tolliver et al. 2021) . By accessing market participants' perception and experience, our study highlights the current development barriers, positive impacts, related regulation, and expectation of market participants within the GB development. Therefore, our study delivers both theoretical and practical contributions.",

Although GB has received certain support from the policy-makers, additional perception and experience of market participants are valuable in highlighting the pragmatic insights from these markets (MacAskill, et al. 2020; Nguyen et al. 2021) . Accordingly, research results indicate that, although the issuance of GB has faced several financial and regulation challenges, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, GB's advantages and expectation for development are also recognized by most of the research respondents. In addition, although the Covid-19 pandemic has caused disruption in the international business as well as the development of GB, it is also expected to play as a driver for the development of GB during and after the pandemic (Tolliver et al. 2021; Choudhury et al. 2021) . Furthermore, although the GB has just emerged in the Southeast Asian markets over the last few years (Azhgaliyeva et al. 2020) , and currently accounts for a very small portion of the total bond market, GB has received support and interest from the market participants due to the increasing awareness of the shareholders. Finally, stemming from our research results, and reflecting the views of the market participants, relevant political implications with specific standards and guidance should be developed to facilitate the development of GB in the Southeast Asian market.",

Although our research participants are considered as the fund and portfolio managers who are familiar with the bond markets in Southeast Asian countries, the selection is limited through its focus on a few financial institutions in several Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, future research should focus on the GB from a broader context in all of the Southeast Asian markets. Furthermore, additional studies are recommended to consider the implications of GB for financing sustainability such as renewable energy, climate change mitigation, environmental protection activities, as well as firm performance, which have not been widely conducted to date. Finally, stemming from our findings, future research avenues could explore the perspective of policy-makers in the countries that promote the GB to understand and examine the drivers precisely for promoting GB in these markets.",
