He underwent a traumatic LP which showed an opening pressure of 5 cm H20 with 780 red cells and 2 white cells with a 50/50 differential for polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear cells there was no organisms noted on gram stain as well as extended PCR. Given the lack of raised pressure symptoms in history and exam as well as low opening pressure, the patient underwent excision of encephalocele and skull base repair endoscopically with a vascularised nasoseptal flap without any plans for permanent CSF diversion. The operative specimen resected from the sphenoid sinus contained a mixture of mature astrocytes and neurones with reactive microglia confirming the clinical diagnosis of encephalocele. The patient was discharged day 1 with oral antibiotics. He remained asymptomatic for 25 days then had recurrence of CSF leak with associated headaches. This required repeat endoscopic repair with placement of a dumbbell fat graft and instillation of a lumbar drain. The lumbar drain remained till day 4 and then removed the patient was discharged day 6 with no leak. The patient remained asymptomatic with no leak at 2 month follow up.",

The current recommended mode of swab collection in Australia is the bilateral deep nasal and oral swab which replaced the nasopharyngeal swab as preferred collection method on the 1st of April as per the Public health laboratory network (PLHN) guidance. The PLHN guidance was adapted from the United States Centre for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. The described method involves the patients head being tilted up and rested against a wall (CDC recommendation for head tilt is 70\u00b0) with the swab being inserted parallel to the palate to a depth of 2-3 cm until resistance is met. Prior to 1st of April the nasopharyngeal swab and oral swab was described which involved a swab being inserted parallel to the nasal floor from a line drawn from the nasal ala to the ear lobe, note no depth is specified in this case. The authors feel that improper technique where the swab is not entered parallel to the palate due to parallax error from head tilt compounded with the depth of insertion for a nasopharyngeal swab increases the risk of complications. The average distance from the nasal opening to the sphenoid ostium in cadaveric specimens was 6.2 cm and was reached at an angle of 34.3\u00b0, the average height from the palate to the anterior skull base is 4.5 cm [6] . With most of commercially available swabs exceeding these dimensions (Fig. 3A) improperly directed swabs can cause mucosal damage as well potential damage to the skull base.",
