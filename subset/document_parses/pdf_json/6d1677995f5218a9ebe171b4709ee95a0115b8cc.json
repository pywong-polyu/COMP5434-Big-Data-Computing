However, some specific PCR assays, by including the S gene among the analyzed viral targets, can identify variants carrying the \u220669-70 deletion, found in some lineages including the B.1.1.7, currently the most common variant throughout Europe [8] . Indeed, when using some of the presently available commercial kits, the presence of this 6 bp deletion results in the absence of S gene amplification while the amplification of other targets is not affected. Therefore, these assays can be used as a screening test to track this VOC. In addition, other PCR assays have been recently developed explicitly to identify the presence of other common mutations, in addition to the \u220669-70. They can be very useful in screening for other VOCs, such as the P.1 or the B.1.351.",

In general, sequencing of the S gene alone by the Sanger method can be sufficient to identify most of the known variants, all these being characterized by the presence of specific mutations in this gene. However, knowledge of the presence of mutations in other viral genes can be helpful and should not be neglected. Whole sequencing of the viral genome by Next-Generations Sequencing (NGS) therefore represents the gold standard for the study of variants, allowing identification and detection of all possible variants of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence.

In fact, a few days prior it had been reported that the lack of amplification of the S gene target with some of the available commercial kits (including the one we were using at the time) was a typical feature of the \u220669-70 variant, present in the B.1.1.7 lineage. We therefore adopted different strategies to better characterize all the samples showing the \u220669-70, as described below. Sequencing of samples from this cluster showed, as expected, that all viruses belonged to the same strain; however, it was not the suspected B.1.1.7 lineage, but rather a different one, B.1.258, which also presents the \u220669-70 deletion. Only a few other cases of this particular strain were detected in the following months outside the cluster. However, sequencing of a few other cases with a lack of S amplification from subjects outside the jail cluster revealed the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant in one case. As it turned out, this case belonged to the first real cluster of this variant in the region, which started in a small village. From this time the B.1.1.7 variant began spreading in the region, as it did throughout the rest of Italy. Figure 3 shows the rapid spreading of the B.1.1.7 lineage that reached 78% of positive cases in April 2021. Tracking the variant based on the lack of S amplification followed by confirmation via sequence analysis, in cases from different areas and clusters, proved to be a very useful, rapid and relatively cheap approach to variant mapping.",

Two of the positive cases showed the presence of the E484K mutation alone and could not, therefore, be assigned to one of the different VOCs that carry this mutation.
