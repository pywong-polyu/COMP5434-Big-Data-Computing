Here we used 12 integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to create a high-resolution, spatially resolved 13 map of reovirus-induced myocarditis in neonatal murine hearts. We assayed hearts collected 14 at three timepoints after reovirus infection and studied the temporal, spatial, and cellular 15 heterogeneity of host-virus interactions. We further assayed the intestine, the primary site of 16 reovirus infection to establish a full chronology of molecular events that ultimately lead to 17 myocarditis. We implemented targeted enrichment of viral transcripts to establish the cellular 18 targets of the virus in the intestine and the heart. Our data give insight into the cell-type 19 specificity of innate immune responses, and into the transcriptional states of inflamed cardiac 20 cells that recruit circulating immune cells, including cytotoxic T cells which induce pyroptosis in 21 the myocarditic tissue. Analyses of spatially restricted gene expression in myocarditic regions 22 and the border zone around those regions identified immune-mediated cell-type specific injury 23 and stress responses.

            "text": "INTRODUCTION 27 Viral infection is the most common cause of myocarditis 1,2 . The resulting inflammatory 28 cardiomyopathy can lead to arrhythmias, dilated cardiomyopathy, and death 1,3,4 . In humans, 29 viral myocarditis is challenging to study because of the low sensitivity of available diagnostic 30 testing, the acute onset of the disease, the focal nature of the disease, and the extreme 31 heterogeneity of immune-virus interactions in complex cardiac tissues 4-6 . In mice, mammalian 32 orthoreovirus offers a flexible model system 7 . After oral inoculation, the Type 1 Lang (T1L) 33 reovirus strain initially infects the gastrointestinal tract. Within days the infection then spreads 34 to secondary sites in the body, including the heart, leading to myocarditis in up to 50% of 35 infections 7-9 . Yet, even in this mouse model, the molecular pathogenesis of viral myocarditis is 36 difficult to study because of the complex network of cardiac and immune cell types involved 37 and the cellular, spatial, and temporal heterogeneity of the disease 2,10 . Consequently, neither 38 the cell types that are responsible for the innate immune response, nor the cell types that are within infected cardiac tissues is needed to address these knowledge gaps. 47 Here we used integrated single-cell and spatially resolved RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to 48 study the cellular and spatial heterogeneity of myocarditic processes in the hearts of reovirus- 49 infected neonatal mice at multiple time points after infection. We also applied these 50 technologies to study the innate response to reovirus infection in the intestine. In addition, we 67 To elucidate the pathogenesis of reovirus-induced myocarditis, we analyzed heart tissues 68 collected from neonatal mice infected orally with either the T1L strain of reovirus or a mock 69 control (Methods, Fig. 1A) . We generated scRNA-seq data for 31,684 cells from infected damage identified by H&E staining (Fig. 1C, Supp Fig. 2A-B) . The combination of scRNA-seq 80 and spatial transcriptomics allowed us to resolve and visualize cell types and gene expression 81 in a spatial context (Supp Fig. 2C ). Because the virus first infects the gastrointestinal tract 82 before it spreads to other body sites including the heart, we also performed scRNA-seq and 83 spatial transcriptomics on ileum. We obtained 7,695 single-cell transcriptomes and 8,027 84 spatial spot transcriptomes for ileum from mock and infected samples at 1 and 4 dpi (Fig. 1D , 85 Supp Fig. 3A-D) . 86 To faithfully identify reovirus transcripts in the ileum and heart, which are not polyadenylated, 87 we performed hybridization-based enrichment of viral fragments captured in the scRNA-seq 88 libraries (Methods, Supp Fig. 4A-C) . In the ileum, we captured a total of 13,100 unique viral 89 transcripts, with viral load decreasing from 1 dpi to 4 dpi. At 1 dpi, entero-endocrine cells had 90 the highest fraction of infected cells followed by enterocytes and goblet cells, all of which are 91 present in the gut epithelium. Lymphatic endothelial cells were infected at 4 dpi, suggesting 92 that the virus reaches the bloodstream via lymphatic drainage to allow transmission of the virus 93 to secondary sites in the body, including the heart, as shown before 12 (Supp Fig. 4D, Fig 1E) . 94 We captured 2,762 unique viral transcripts from 392 cells in the T1L-infected hearts. The viral 95 load first increased from 4 dpi to 7 dpi and then decreased from 7 dpi to 10 dpi, consistent with 96 viral titer assays performed on whole hearts 9,13 (Fig. 1E, Supp Fig. 4E ). Endocardial and 97 endothelial cells were the most frequently infected cell types at 4 dpi, suggesting that 98 endocardial cells lining the ventricular lumen and endothelial cells lining the cardiac 99 vasculature are among the first cells to be infected (Fig. 1E) . We detected an increased 100 infection in endothelial cells from 4 dpi to 7 dpi, consistent with viral titer assays performed on 101 whole hearts 9,13 (Fig. 1E, Supp Fig. 4E) . We further detected viral transcripts in neutrophils, 102 dendritic cells, and T cells in the 7 dpi heart (Fig. 1E, Supp Fig. 4E ). This observation 103 suggests that antigen-presenting cells and immune cells may contribute to the spread of 104 infection to other organs in the body. The role of infected dendritic cells in bringing more 105 reovirus to the cardiac tissue during systemic infection has been discussed previously 8 . 106 To validate these observations, we performed histology, multiplexed RNA fluorescence in-situ 107 hybridization (FISH), and immunofluorescence assays on tissue sections from myocarditic 108 hearts and controls (multiple infected mice litters, Supp Fig. 5A-5B, Methods) . We used RNA-109 FISH to visualize expression of genes specific to cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, 110 macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells (Supp Fig. 5C & 5E, Methods) . On consecutive tissue 111 sections, we labeled reovirus antigen using immunofluorescence to identify reovirus infected 112 cells (Supp Fig. 5C) . These experiments revealed infection foci and immune infiltration in 113 myocarditic regions. We found macrophages and neutrophils in the border zones and outside 114 the myocarditic regions at 7 dpi (Supp Fig. 5C, 5D) . In contrast, most T cells were found inside 115 the myocarditic regions at 7 dpi (Supp Fig. 5D ). Endothelial cells that were positive for the To detect early transcriptional differences in the cardiac tissue after infection, we performed 137 Differential Gene Expression Analysis (DGEA, mock vs infected hearts at 4 dpi, Methods). 138 This analysis revealed a significant upregulation of 226 genes in the infected heart (two-sided 139 Wilcoxon test, log fold-change > 1.0 and p-value < 0.01), including genes related to the 140 interferon-\u03b2 pathway, interferon signaling, and innate immune responses (Supp Fig 6A-6B (Fig. 2B) . In response to infection, an increase in IR was observed for all cardiac cell types, 147 but the greatest increase in IR was observed for endothelial cells (Fig. 2B) . These data 148 suggest that endothelial cells lining the cardiac vasculature are important initiators of the host 149 defense to viral infection. Comparison of IR scores using the spatial transcriptomic data 150 showed increased IR scores in the infected hearts at 4 and 7 dpi with the highest scores found 151 in myocarditic regions (Fig. 2C) . Given our observation that endothelial cells within the heart 152 had the highest IR score in the absence of infection, we asked if this observation was unique 153 to heart tissue or was a more general phenomenon. To this end, we used the Tabula Muris 154 scRNA-seq mouse atlas 14 and estimated the IR of ~16,000 cells of five major cell types 155 (epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and mesenchymal cells) 156 across 10 different organs and tissues. This analysis revealed that endothelial cells 157 consistently had the highest IR score across all tissues in mice (Fig. 2D) . These results 158 indicate that endothelial cells lining the vasculature have a higher basal expression of innate 159 response genes within most tissues, which may prime these cells to respond to viral 160 dissemination within the blood and lymphatics. 161 To investigate the cell-type-specific IR in the ileum, the primary site of reovirus infection, we 162 performed DGEA on reovirus-infected and mock-infected ileal cells at 1 dpi and found a 163 significant upregulation of 438 genes (two-sided Wilcoxon test, log fold-change > 1.0 and p-164 value < 0.01), related to the interferon-beta pathway, interferon signaling, and innate immune 165 responses in reovirus-infected ileal cells (Supp Fig. 6C-6D) . We computed an IR score using 166 this module of 438 genes and observed higher basal IR scores in enterocytes and entero-167 endocrine cells as compared to other ileal cell types (Fig. 2E) . Enterocytes further showed the 168 highest increase in IR score after infection, followed by entero-endocrine, endothelial, and 169 lymphatic cells (Fig. 2E) . Comparison of IR scores for spatial transcriptomic data further 170 supported our analysis of the scRNA-seq data, showing increased IR scores in the infected 171 ileum at 1 and 4 dpi with the highest scores evident within intestinal mucosa and villi (Fig. 2F) . 172 The intestinal epithelial cells must tolerate commensal microorganisms present in the lumen of 173 the gut and yet still be responsive to invasive pathogens. Our data suggest that to achieve this, test, log fold-change > 1.0 and p-value < 0.01) in the reovirus-infected heart as compared to the mock-infected 184 heart at 4 dpi.

E) Infection response score for ileal cell types in scRNA-seq data across mock-infected and reovirus-187 infected ileum at two distinct stages. The infection response score represents the gene module score for a panel 188 of 438 genes significantly upregulated (two-sided Wilcoxon test, log fold-change > 1.0 and p-value < 0.01) in the 189 reovirus-infected ileum at 1 dpi as compared to the mock-infected ileum. F) Infection response score for spatial 190 transcriptomics data from mock-infected and reovirus-infected ileum at two distinct stages. 192 To explore the heterogeneity of endothelial cell phenotypes in more detail, we reclustered all 193 9,786 cardiac endothelial cells in the scRNA-seq data. We observed four distinct phenotypes: hearts at 4 and 10 dpi, and iv) inflamed endothelial cells from the heart at 7 dpi, with both 198 inflamed endothelial cell clusters expressing Isg15, Iigp1, and Ly6a ( Fig. 3A-B) . DGEA across 199 endothelial subclusters revealed that the inflamed 7 dpi endothelial cells overexpressed 200 chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, which are generally involved in immunoregulatory and 201 inflammatory processes, but more specifically in the recruitment of T cells and NK T cells 16 202 ( Fig. 3B-3C, Supp Fig. 7A ). In line with this observation, T cells in the 7 dpi hearts expressed (Supp Fig. 9D) . Ctss was expressed mainly in monocytes (Supp Fig. 9D) . Ctss 311 encodes a protease used for degradation of antigenic proteins to peptides for presentation by 312 MHC class II molecules. Increased formation of immunoproteasomes in susceptible mice has 313 been shown to affect the generation of antigenic peptides and subsequent T cell activity in viral 314 myocarditis 25,26 . GO term analysis of genes upregulated in the border zone revealed 315 enrichment of terms related to the response to tumor necrosis factor, response to interleukin-1, 316 and NIK/ NF-\u03baB signaling (Supp Fig. 9E ). 317 To further understand the effect of immune cell infiltration on the cell type composition 318 surrounding the myocarditic regions, we assessed cell type proportions as a function of 319 distance from myocarditic regions in the tissue. We quantified the cell type proportions in 320 myocarditic regions, the border zones, and the rest of the ventricular tissue, and found that the 321 fraction of Cxcl9-high endothelial cells, Ccl2+ fibroblasts, T cells, dendritic cells, and NK cells 322 was increased in the myocarditic regions, and the fraction of cardiomyocytes was reduced in 323 myocarditic regions (Fig. 4C, Supp Fig. 2C) . 324 To understand the phenotype of Ccl2+ fibroblasts enriched in myocarditic region and border 325 zone, we reclustered 9,192 fibroblast cells from the scRNA-seq dataset and identified a distinct 326 cluster of inflamed Ccl2+ fibroblasts from the infected heart at 7 dpi (Supp. Fig. 9F, 9G) . The 327 Ccl2+ fibroblasts expressed high levels of MHC class 1 (H2-D1 and H2-K1) , adhesion marker 328 genes Vcam1 and Icam1, and other genes such as Serpina3g, C3, and Ms4a4d (Supp Fig.   329   9H, 9I) . Moreover, these cells also expressed Casp1 and Casp4, suggesting that fibroblasts 330 also undergo pyroptosis in response to cytotoxic T cells (Supp Fig. 9H) . 331 To investigate the effect of inflammation on cardiomyocytes in myocarditic hearts, we 332 reclustered 502 cardiomyocytes from the scRNA-seq dataset and identified three distinct 333 phenotypes: i) ventricular myocytes expressing Myl2, Myl3, and Mb derived from mock and 334 infected hearts at 4 and 10 dpi, ii) atrial myocytes expressing markers Myl4, Myl7, and Nppa 335 derived from mock and infected hearts at 4 and 10 dpi, and iii) inflamed myocytes from the 336 infected heart at 7 dpi expressing innate immunity genes Isg15, Igtp, and Iigp1 27 (Fig. 4D-E) . 337 Inflamed myocytes from the infected heart at 7 dpi had a distinct phenotype when compared to 338 the myocytes from hearts at 4 and 10 dpi, which clustered with myocyte cells from mock-339 infected hearts (Fig. 4E) . To find transcriptional signatures for myocytes present in the border 340 zone, we selected genes that were both enriched in cardiomyocytes in the scRNA-seq data 341 and upregulated in the border zone. This analysis revealed that cardiomyocytes in the border 342 zone expressed Gm4841, Gm12185, Mt1, Mt2, Ankrd1, and Nppb (Fig. 4F, Supp Fig. 9J) . 10 dpi. We generated a total of 16,771 single-cell transcriptomes and integrated the data with 376 the data from the WT virus. We did not observe sample-specific clusters after data integration, 377 suggesting minimal experimental batch effects (Fig. 5A, Supp Fig. 10A) . We performed viral 378 transcript enrichment and compared the mean viral transcripts in WT-and mutant-infected 379 cells. We found similar levels of mean viral transcripts for WT and K287T viruses at 4 dpi but a 380 60-fold lower viral load for K287T at 7 dpi, consistent with viral titer assays 9 (Supp Fig. 10B (Fig. 5B) . 385 We analyzed the cell type composition of inflamed Cxcl9-high endothelial cells and immune 386 cells detected in K287T-and WT-infected hearts. We observed fewer Cxcl9-high endothelial 387 cells and immune cells including cytotoxic T cells, infiltrating the heart at 7 dpi compared to 388 WT-infected heart (Fig. 5C & 5F) . These differences correlate with the reduced levels of 389 inflammation associated with the K287T mutant (Supp Fig. 11A & 11B) . To validate these 390 observations, we performed RNA FISH and immunofluorescence staining on K287T-infected 391 hearts and compared them to mock-infected and reovirus WT-infected hearts (Supp Fig. 11A) . 392 Immunostaining for reoviral antigen in tissue sections confirmed both a significantly reduced 393 area with viral replication (two-sided Mann-Whitney test, p-value < 0.05) and significantly lower 394 viral antigen within those areas (two-sided Mann-Whitney test, p-value < 0.05), consistent with 395 the scRNA-seq analysis and viral titer assays (Supp. Fig. 11C, Fig. 5E ). We observed a 396 reduction in infiltration of T cells in K287T-infected hearts as compared to WT-infected hearts 397 at 7 dpi (Fig. 5D, 5F ). The fraction of total cytotoxic immune cells (Prf1+) was significantly 398 reduced in K287T-infected hearts as compared to WT-infected hearts (two-sided Mann-399 Whitney test, p-value < 0.05, Supp. Fig. 11D, Fig 5F) . These findings support the reduced 400 immune-mediated cytotoxicity seen in K287T-infected hearts. This was further supported by a 401 significant reduction in Casp1 protein expression in K287T-infected hearts as compared to 402 WT-infected hearts (two-sided Mann-Whitney test, p-value < 0.05, Supp. Fig. 11C, Fig. 5G ). 403 Our results show that cardiac endothelial cells mount a potent and robust innate immune Viral myocarditis has been recognized as a cause of heart failure for more than 50 years, but it 430 is still a challenging disease to study, diagnose, and treat 31 . Here, we used integrated spatial 431 and single-cell RNA-seq to dissect the temporal, spatial, and cellular heterogeneity of reovirus-432 induced acute myocarditis in a neonatal mouse model. We assayed ileum and heart tissues at 433 multiple time points after infection. We investigated the cell types that are infected, and the 434 cellular and spatial heterogeneity of innate and adaptive immune responses. We generated a 435 total of thirteen scRNA-seq and eight spatial transcriptomics datasets, spanning two organs, Sample preparation for single-cell transcriptomics of cardiac tissue. 507 We sacrificed mock-infected and reovirus-infected C57BL/6J mice on day 4, day 7, and day 10 508 post-infection and collected cardiac tissues for single cell transcriptomics. Single heart tissue 509 from respective stages (one heart per stage) were isolated aseptically, washed with ice-cold segmentation mask were files and morphological opening was performed to remove noise. 782 The segmentation was enhanced using watershed algorithm followed by a morphological ",

The Cxcl9-high inflamed endothelial cells furthermore204    expressed high levels of cell adhesion marker genes Vcam1 and Icam1, which help immune205    cells in the blood to attach to endothelial cells 17(Fig. 3C, Supp Fig. 7A, 7E). The endothelial 206 cells also overexpressed MHC class 1 (H2-D1 and H2-K1) and MHC class 2 (Cd74) 207 molecules, suggesting their involvement in antigen presentation to adaptive immune cells (Fig. 208 3B-C, Supp Fig. 7A, 7E). Endothelial cells have been shown to be involved in antigen 209 presentation and shaping the cellular immune response in infectious myocarditis 17,18 . Gene 210 ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis identified pathways further supporting the Cxcl9-high 211 endothelial cells' involvement in leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, T cell activation, regulation of 212 interleukin-8 production, and response to cytokines, interferon-gamma, interleukin-1, and 213 tumor necrosis factors (Supp Fig. 7B). 214 The observation that endothelial cells are involved in the recruitment of T cells prompted us to 215 explore the heterogeneity of T cells in the infected hearts in more detail. To this end, we 216 reclustered 2,205 T cell single-cell transcriptomes, leading to four subclusters representing 217 three T cell subtypes, i) Cd8+ cytotoxic T cells, ii) Cd4+ helper T cells, and iii) naive T cells 218(Fig 3E-F). Both the cytotoxic and helper T cells identified within infected hearts expressed 219 Cxcr3 receptor, interferon-gamma (Ifng), and the chemokines Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccl5, S100A4, and 220 S100A6, suggesting their involvement in neutrophil recruitment and activation(Fig. 3G, Supp 221 Fig. 7C). The Cxcr3 receptor binds selectively to the chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, promoting 222 chemotaxis(Fig. 3G). Cytotoxic T cells represented the majority of infiltrating T cells and 223 expressed Prf1, Gzma, Gzmb, and Gzmk, coding for lytic molecules associated with the 224 granzyme-dependent exocytosis pathway 19(Fig. 3F-G, Supp Fig. 7C, 7G). These cells also 225 expressed tumor necrosis factor superfamily genes Fasl and Tradd, which are involved in the 226 Fas-induced cell death pathway. Fasl binds to Fas on the surface of target cells and mediates 227 programmed cell death signaling and NF-\u03baB activation(Fig. 3G). The Fasl-Fas apoptosis 228 pathway is important in regulating T cells, in promoting tolerance to self-antigens, and is a 229 mechanism by which cytotoxic T cells kill target cells 19 . GO term enrichment analysis identified 230 pathways involved in neutrophil activation and degranulation, processing and presentation of 231 exogenous peptide antigen, interleukin-1-mediated signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor-232 mediated signaling, NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK) /NF-\u03baB signaling, cellular response to 233 hypoxia, and apoptotic processes(Supp Fig. 7D).",

This236    raises the possibility that cytotoxic lymphocytes are responsible for inflamed endothelial and pyroptosis pathway(Supp Fig. 7B). We assessed the spatial transcriptomic data241    to validate direct interactions between Cxcl9-high inflamed endothelial cells and T cells and242    found that they were indeed spatially co-localized in the myocarditic regions and the border 243 zone(Supp Fig. 2C). We calculated gene module scores for genes associated with ontology 244 terms enriched in Cxcl9-high endothelial and cytotoxic T cells for spatial transcriptomics data245    and found these pathways to be enriched in the myocarditic regions(Fig. 3D, 3H, and Supp 246Fig. 7E-H).247    We used histology, multiplexed RNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and 248 immunofluorescence to validate our spatial transcriptomic and scRNA-seq findings on matched 249 tissue sections from myocarditic and mock-infected hearts.(Supp Fig. 8A, 8B, Methods). The250 RNA FISH experiments confirmed the presence of Cxcl9-high endothelial cells (detected with 251 Cdh5) within myocarditic tissue with infiltrating T cells marked by expression of Trbc2, Cxcr3, 252 and lytic molecule Prf1 (Supp Fig. 8B, Fig. 3I). We also detected expression of the pyroptosis-253 mediated cell death marker Casp1 within endothelial cells supporting our hypothesis that T 254 cell-induced pyroptosis in endothelial cells occurs within myocarditic tissue (Supp Fig. 8B, Fig. 255 3I). Most of the T cells in the myocarditic tissue expressed the Prf1 marker for cytotoxic T cells 256 and these cells were often observed in proximity of endothelial cells expressing Casp1 mRNA. 257 We used immunofluorescence to detect Casp1 protein in endothelial cells within myocarditic 258 tissue on a consecutive tissue section (Supp Fig. 8C, Fig. 3J). We further labeled Casp1 259 protein and stained calcium deposits using Alizarin Red on independent serial sections from 260 myocarditic hearts and found Casp1+ myocarditic regions to be the sites of calcification in the 261 infected tissue at 7 dpi (Supp Fig. 8D). 262 Collectively, these results suggest that endothelial cells lining the cardiac vasculature act as a 263 blood-heart barrier and play an important role in the recruitment and activation of the host 264 adaptive immune system. These cells may be the target of both direct viral damage and 265 immune-mediated damage during reovirus-induced myocarditis. Damage to the 266 microvasculature within the heart may then cause loss of blood supply and be a factor in the 267 subsequent death of cardiomyocytes independent of direct viral replication. 268 Cytotoxic T cells recruited by inflamed endothelial cells induce pyroptosis in myocarditic tissue 270 A) UMAP plot of 9,786 single-cell endothelial cell transcriptomes from mock-infected and reovirus-infected hearts 271 at 4, 7, and 10 dpi colored by endothelial cell (EC) subtype clusters (phenotypes) (top) and condition (bottom).

J) Immunofluorescence images of Caspase 1 protein in a myocarditic heart. 284Spatially restricted gene expression in myocarditic tissue285    The spatially restricted nature of myocarditis motivated us to explore the spatial heterogeneity 286 of gene expression in reovirus-infected hearts. Our initial clustering of the spatial 287 transcriptomic data revealed distinct transcriptional programs for myocarditic regions, the 288 tissue bordering these myocarditic regions, and the rest of the ventricular tissue(Fig. 1C, 4A, 289SuppFig. 2A). Differential spatial gene expression analysis for these regions revealed290 upregulation in the myocarditic regions of cell-type markers for infiltrating immune cells, (Cd8a 291 and Gzma for T cells, Nkg7 for NK cells, S100a8 for neutrophils), markers of inflammation 292 (Cd52 and Lyc62, Supp Fig. 9A-B), and chemokines and cytokines (Ccl5, Ccl2, Cxcl9, and 293 Cxcl10). Analysis of the corresponding scRNA-seq data showed that Ccl5 is expressed by 294 dendritic cells, Ccl2 by fibroblasts, and Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 by endothelial cells. The receptor for 295 Ccl2, Ccr2, is expressed in macrophages, indicating that fibroblasts use the Ccl2-Ccr2 axis for 296 macrophage recruitment during myocardial inflammation, as described recently 20,21 (Supp Fig. 297 9C). Collectively these analyses suggest that chemokine-producing endothelial cells and 298 cytokine-producing fibroblast cells contribute to the recruitment of immune cells of the myocarditic regions and border zones showed an upregulation of 301 additional genes of interest, including Timp1, AW112010, Clu, Ankrd1, Gm4841, and Ctss 302 (Fig. 4B). Timp1 was mainly expressed by inflamed fibroblasts in the scRNA-seq data (Supp 303 Fig. 9D). Timp1 is a natural inhibitor of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of 304 peptidases involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix. Upregulation of Timp1 in 305 patients with deteriorating heart failure was reported previously 22 . AW112010 was expressed 306 by inflamed endothelial cells and fibroblasts in the scRNA-seq data. AW112010 encodes an 307interferon-induced small secreted protein with a crucial role in the innate immune response to 308 infection and inflammation 23(Supp Fig. 9D). Clu was expressed in a subset of inflamed cells 309 from all cardiac cell types in our data. Clu was shown to be upregulated during severe 310 myocarditis 24",

This mutation abolishes the capacity of \u03c3 3 to block dsRNA-mediated activation of 370 protein kinase R (PKR). The T1L K287T mutant is less virulent than the WT strain in neonatal 371 mice. K287T replicates to WT titers in the heart at 4 dpi, but to significantly lower viral titers 372 than WT virus at 7 dpi. The K287T mutant does not induce myocarditis as observed by calcium 373 staining in the tissue 9 . To confirm our findings about immune-mediated pathogenesis during 374 reovirus infection, we performed additional scRNA-seq for K287T infected hearts at 4, 7, and 375",

After oral438    inoculation, reovirus T1L infects entero-endocrine and enterocyte cells in the gut epithelium439    within 1 dpi. These cells mount a potent innate immune response to inhibit viral replication.440    The virus then infects the gut lymphatic cells within 4 dpi and is transmitted via lymphatics to 441 the bloodstream and then to secondary sites in the body, including the heart. Around 4 dpi, the442 virus infects the endothelial cells lining the cardiac vasculature. Endothelial cells mount a 443 potent innate immune response in the heart. In symptomatic cases, inflamed endothelial cells 444 secrete chemokines that recruit circulating immune cells, including cytotoxic T cells. Tissue-445 infiltrating cytotoxic T cells then induce pyroptosis in the infected tissue inducing myocarditis. 446 Overall, our experiments reveal a dynamic and spatially heterogeneous network of cellular 447 phenotypes and cell-cell interactions associated with reovirus-induced myocarditis. 448 Integrated high-throughput scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics was recently used to study 449 heart development 32,33 and heart disease 30,34 , but these methods have not been used to study 450 viral myocarditis prior to our work. Bulk RNA-seq has been used previously to profile 451 transcriptomic signatures of infection, inflammation, and tissue injury associated with viral 452 myocarditis 9,35-38 . Yet, these ensemble-level approaches do not capture the cellular and spatial 453 heterogeneity of host response to infection. scRNA-seq has recently been used to study 454 Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis in a mouse model 39 . Lasrado et al. report 455 inflammatory phenotypes of myeloid cells, the role of fibroblasts in remodeling and 456 inflammation, and the role of cytotoxic T-cells in CVB3-induced myocarditis. However, the 457 cardiac cell types that are targeted by the virus, the cell type heterogeneity in basal interferon 458 response and innate immune response, and the spatial restriction of transcriptional programs 459 were not explored in this study. 460 Reovirus infection occurs often in humans, but most cases are mild or subclinical. These 461 viruses display a broad host range, but only young hosts develop the disease. After infection of 462 neonatal mice, reoviruses cause injury to a variety of organs, including the heart, liver, and the 463 central nervous system, depending on the viral strain. Reovirus Type-1-Lang (T1L) strain is 464 mildly virulent and causes myocarditis in ~50% of the infected mice. Neonatal mice with 465 myocarditic hearts due to T1L infection survive with tissue damage and have an increased rate 466 of heart failure. Therefore, reovirus T1L infection in neonatal mice is an ideal model to study 467 the mechanisms and pathogenesis of reovirus induced myocarditis in young hosts. . However, these previous experiments do not rule out the possibility that the host 473 adaptive immune response can augment or delimit the nature and amount of host damage in 474 immune-competent mice, as is suggested by our work. Holm et al. and Stewart et al. have 475 studied the protective role of innate immune responses in reovirus-induced myocarditis 13,41 . 476 However, prior to this study the temporal, spatial, and cell type heterogeneity of basal type-I 477 IFN and innate immune responses to infection had not been characterized. Miyamoto et al. 478 and Stewart et al. compared basal levels of type-I IFN between cardiac myocytes and 479 fibroblasts in vitro but these studies did not include all the cell types that make of viral myocarditis is crucial to understanding the viral and 482 host factors that are important for disease pathology. This knowledge may ultimately lead to 483 novel diagnostic approaches and better treatments. Several viruses that frequently infect 484 humans can cause myocarditis, including Adenovirus, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, 485 human Herpesvirus 6, parvovirus B19, and SARS-CoV2. The results presented here may not 486 be representative of the mechanisms for other viral causes of myocarditis or viral myocarditis 487 in adult hosts. However, the approaches that we have implemented here can be used in future 488 studies to investigate how the induction, pathophysiology, and course of myocarditis induced 489 by these viruses differs. We hope that the data and analysis routines that we make available 490 here will be a valuable resource for such future studies. 491 METHODS 492 Reovirus infections of neonatal C57BL/6J mice. 493 Confirmed pregnant female C57BL/6J mice were ordered from Jackson Laboratories to be 494 delivered at embryonic stage E14.5.

In this approach, a panel of 5'-599 biotinylated oligonucleotides is used for capture and pulldown of target molecules of interest, 600 which are then PCR amplified and sequenced. We designed a panel of 202 biotinylated probes 601 tiled across the entire reovirus T1L genome to selectively sequence viral molecules from the 602 scRNA-seq libraries (Supp Data 2). 300ng of fragmented and indexed scRNA-seq libraries 603 from reovirus-WT infected hearts, reovirus-mutant infected hearts, and reovirus-infected ileum 604 were pooled in three separate reactions for xGen hybridization capture. Two rounds of 605 hybridization capture using the xGen enrichment protocol were performed for every reaction to 606 enrich viral transcripts. Amplification was performed for a total of 18 PCR cycles after the first 607 round of capture. 50% of the amplified product was used for the second round of hybridization 608 capture and amplification was performed for a total of 5 PCR cycles after the second round of 609 enrichment. Post-enrichment products were pooled and sequenced on Illumina Mini-seq for 610 ileum libraries and NextSeq 500 for heart libraries. 611 Reference genome and annotation 612 Mus musculus genome and gene annotations (assembly: GRCm38) were downloaded from 613 the Ensembl genome browser, and reovirus strain Type-1-Lang genome and gene annotations 614 were downloaded and compiled from the NCBI browser.

Viral unique molecule (UMI) counts were taken from the 681 combined expression matrices and added as metadata in the host gene expression data. Viral 682 UMI counts in empty droplets, droplets with low-quality cells (< 200 host UMI counts), droplets 683 with viable cells (>=200 host UMI counts) were sorted by viral UMI and visualized on a 684 histogram to filter out the cell-free ambient viral RNA enriched in the hybridization protocol. 685 Using the distribution of viral UMI counts in empty droplets, thresholds of two viral UMIs and 686 five viral UMIs were used to identify infected cells in the heart and ileum respectively (Supp 687 Fig 2D). Viral transcripts in the infected cells were then visualized on a DotPlot to determine 688 viral tropism in tissues. 689 Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis for scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics 690 Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis was performed on differentially expressed 691 genes using gseapy (v0.10.4) wrapper package 45 .

The single-cell624    transcriptomes were log-transformed and normalized using the Scanpy package verison-625 1.8.1 43 . We used Scanpy to choose the highly variable genes with min_disp=0.5 and 626 max_mean=3 thresholds. We then performed mean centering and scaling while regressing out 627 total UMI counts, percent mitochondrial transcripts, S score, and G2M score, followed by628 principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of the data to the top 20 629 principal components (PCs). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and the Nearest Neighbor (NN) graph were initialized in this PCA space using the first 20 PCs. The 631 cells were then clustered using the Leiden method with multiple values of clustering resolution canonical gene markers along with differentially expressed genes (wilcoxon method) for each 634 cluster were used to assign cell type labels. Normalized gene expression was visualized on DotPlots, UMAP plots, and Violin plots across cell type groups. A few cell type clusters 636 representing cell states of the same cell type were grouped into broad cell type groups using 637 cell type marker genes and then used for downstream analysis. Differential gene expression 638 analysis (DGEA) was performed using the rank_gene_groups function in Scanpy with the Wilcoxon statistical method. All gene module scores were calculated using the score_genes 640 function in scanpy.Reclustering and analysis of endothelial cells, T cells, fibroblasts, and cardiomyocytesNormalized gene expression for a specific cell type group was extracted from the combined 643 scRNA-seq dataset. We used Scanpy to reselect the highly variable genes within that cell type 644 group with min_disp=0.5 and max_mean=3 thresholds. We then performed mean centering645    and scaling while regressing out total UMI counts, percent mitochondrial transcripts, S score,646 and G2M score, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of 647 the data to the top 20 principal components (PCs). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and the Nearest Neighbor (NN) graph were initialized in this PCA space 649 using the first 20 PCs. The cells were then reclustered using the Leiden method 650 (resolution=0.5 for endothelial cells, resolution=0.3 for T cells, resolution=0.2 for fibroblasts, 651 and resolution=0.3 for cardiomyocytes) to get cell type subclusters. Differentially expressed 652 genes (wilcoxon method) for each subcluster were then used to assign cell subtype labels. Subclusters representing doublets and expressing markers of multiple cell types were then 654 removed from the analysis. Normalized gene expression for differentially expressed genes and 655 genes of interest was visualized on DotPlots and UMAP plots across celltype subgroups. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed using the rank_gene_groups 657 function in Scanpy with the Wilcoxon statistical method. All gene module scores were 658 calculated using the score_genes function in Scanpy.Spatial transcriptomics data processing, integration, analysis, and visualizationSpatial transcriptomics data from barcoded spatial spots from four heart sections were log-661 normalized using the Scanpy package (v1.8.1). Scanpy package was then used to select 662 highly variable genes for spatial transcriptomics data with min_disp=0.5 and max_mean=3 663 thresholds. We then performed mean centering and scaling while regressing out total UMI 664 counts, percent mitochondrial UMIs, S score, and G2M score, followed by PCA on the spot665 gene expression matrix, and reduced the dimensions of the data to the top 20 principal 666 components. UMAP and the NN graph were initialized in this PCA space. The spots were then 667 clustered using the Leiden method with multiple values of clustering resolution. The method 668 returned spot clusters representing different tissue regions, which were then visualized on H&E 669 images as spatial transcriptomics maps for individual samples to assign anatomical regions. Normalized gene expression was visualized on spatial transcriptomics maps for all tissue 671 sections. Spot clusters representing the same tissue regions were grouped into broad 672 anatomical region groups using marker genes and then used for downstream analysis.Stereoscope deconvolution method implemented in the scvi-tools 44 (v0.12.2) package was 674 used for integration of spatial transcriptomics data with time-matched scRNA-seq data and cell675    type prediction values for spatial transcriptomics spots were estimated for the infected heart at 676 7 dpi.
