This systematic review aims to: (1) assess the xenophobic attitudes and behaviors towards migrants during disease outbreaks; and (2) identify adverse health outcomes linked to xenophobia. Methods We searched nine scientific databases to identify studies measuring xenophobic tendencies towards international migrants during disease outbreaks and evaluated the resulting adverse health effects. Results Eighteen articles were included in the review. The findings were grouped into: (1) xenophobia-related outcomes, including social exclusion, out-group avoidance, support for exclusionary health policies, othering, and germ aversion; and (2) mental health problems, such as anxiety and fear. Depending on the disease outbreak, different migrant populations were negatively affected, particularly Asians, Africans, and Latino people. Factors such as perceived vulnerability to disease, disgust sensitivity, medical mistrust individualism, collectivism, disease salience, social representation of disease and beliefs in different origins of disease were associated with xenophobia. Conclusions Overall, migrants can be a vulnerable population frequently blamed for spreading disease, promoting irrational fear, worry and stigma in various forms, thus leading to health inequities worldwide. It is urgent that societies adopt effective support strategies to combat xenophobia and structural forms of discrimination against migrants. ",

Past and current events highlight the discrimination and stigmatization that international migrant's face during disease outbreaks ( White, 2020 ) . For example the 1860-1890 epidemic in San Francisco, US, where Chinese migrants were perceived as smallpox carriers and blamed for spread-ing the disease, supposedly because they had disregarded the sanitary laws, although the number of infected people were still lower among the Chinese population ( Craddock, 1995 ) . Humans have been affected by six pandemics/epidemics since 1900: the 1918 influenza pandemic, the 1957-1958 H2N2 virus pandemic, the 1968 H3N2 pandemic, the 1981 -today HIV/AIDS epidemic, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic Eisinger and Fauci, 2018 ) . As emerging infectious diseases are expected to increase over time ( Jones et al., 2008 ) , it is important to understand their full societal effects. Previous literature has highlighted some of the growing xenophobic tendencies during these periods, negatively impacting (i) the out-group's access to healthcare; (ii) the out-group's mental health; (iii) combat of the disease ( Schaller et al., 2015 ; Johnson et al., 2004 ; Navarrete and Fessler, 2006 ; Fischer et al., 2019 ) . Out-groups are a group of foreign individuals, that are not part of the host population, with a specific trait, often seen as undesirable or threatening to others, and highly associated with disease transmission during an infectious disease outbreak ( Navarrete and Fessler, 2006 ; Fischer et al., 2019 ) . Preventive measures and interventions have not been efficiently deployed to support and improve the health of these groups.",

            "text": "A previous study has systematically assessed the prevalence of stigma in several infection disease epidemics ( Yuan et al., 2021 ) . This study has shown that over a third of vulnerable populations, namely people from low-and middle-income countries or with lower education, reported infectious disease epidemic-related stigma, with the highest prevalence of stigma being observed in infected patients, followed by community members and healthcare workers ( Yuan et al., 2021 ) . Moreover, the past has strongly suggested that infectious disease outbreaks are often accompanied by an increase in xenophobic sentiments, with several current studies showing that xenophobia and its associated forms are a major concern for public health, as perceived discrimination has shown to have a significant impact on both individuals' physical and mental health, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities ( Sylvia Chou and Gaysynsky, 2021 ; Fan et al., 2021 ; Huang and Liu, 2020 ) . To our knowledge, no systematic review has collated the evidence of infectious disease outbreaks and xenophobia towards international migrants. To effectively combat epidemics and reduce stigmatization and discrimination, it is important to measure and analyze xenophobia towards foreigners as pathogen carriers. This paper responds to that call by systematically reviewing and summarizing the available literature, aiming to quantitatively evaluate xenophobic tendencies against international migrants, and the resulting adverse health effects during infectious disease outbreaks.",

All the studies reported visible discrimination against foreigners, namely Asian migrants, in various ways. Three of these studies (60%) described foreigners as disease carriers, thus being socially stigmatized and avoided Gilles et al., 2013 ; Eicher et al., 2014 ) . Participants from the H7N9 study believed new migrants were the cause of the disease (23.1%), were at greater risk to contract the disease (37.7%), and thus avoided being physically close to them (17.1%) ( Goodwin and Sun, 2014 ) . Social representations about the origins and protection measures efficiency in the context of both swine and avian flu revealed that people with lower belief in a dangerous world scores will have a higher perception that official protection measures are effective . Higher scores are linked to outbreaks explanation via hygienic origins, which are then related with out-group discrimination measures . A positive association between perceived disease salience and beliefs in the efficiency of avoiding foreigners as protective measures was reported during an H5N1 outbreak . This association was moderated by attitudes toward foreigners. Participants holding less favorable social attitudes toward foreigners believed that foreigner avoidance could help prevent infection . Othering, in the form of out-group blame processes, was very likely to occur during an H5N1 outbreak . People with increased germ aversion and supporting an hierarchical society view (social dominance orientation) attributed H5N1 human disease cases to foreign countries, particularly the Asian ones (86%) . During an H1N1 and seasonal flu outbreaks, disease protective interventions, as vaccination and hand washing, along with its resulting perceived immunity, were capable of attenuating the association between disease concerns (disease threats, chronic germ aversion) and out-groups prejudice .",

Previous studies have shown these xenophobic tendencies may be due to several reasons, including a false perception of their unhygienic habits, deprived nutrition status triggered by their particular food choices, poor health practices and barriers to basic medical services ( Faulkner et al., 2004 ; Mason, 2012 ; Mukumbang et al., 2020 ) . The reality is that migrants are at increased risk of contracting a disease themselves, rather than being a risk to the local population, due to the poor conditions they often live in and lack of preventative healthcare ( Abubakar et al., 2018 ) . Moreover, migrants living and seeking protection in poor, marginalized and frequently violent urban areas are disproportionally affected by xenophobic attitudes and behaviors that are a threat to their own lives ( Misago et al., 2015 ) .",

Furthermore, populations like Black, minority ethnic and migrant groups are also at great risk of being infected ( Devakumar et al., 2020 a) . Fear of infection and violent overactions were common outcomes reported during this epidemic, together with social exclusion, different forms of prejudice and health inequalities, being in accordance with other studies describing distinct pandemics ( Mukumbang et al., 2020 ; Bambra et al., 2020 ) . Reports of disease-avoidance mechanisms through disgust feelings and perceived vulnerability to disease, ultimately leading to behavioral avoidance, were found to be xenophobic predictors during epidemics. These mechanisms mainly happen by avoiding the sick, protecting the homeland and closing the borders ( Kam, 2019 ; Faulkner et al., 2004 ; Oaten et al., 2009 ) . The implementation of exclusionary and restrictive policy practices have been systematically used during several outbreaks, namely EVD, aiming to control disease transmission ( Emrick et al., 2016 ) , and were shown to be associated more closely to pre-existing symbolic prejudice towards migrants, rather than to fear of infection . Furthermore, people with beliefs in sociocultural origins of EVD have the strongest feeling of symbolic threat against migrants, and will thus demonstrate an even higher support for restrictive health policies . Throughout these times, conspiracy beliefs endorsement, comparable to reports of mistrustful information by competent authorities or social media, led to a lower support of quarantine policies for migrants. Perceived vulnerability to disease is linked to a 'belief in a dangerous world', which in turn predicts prejudicial attitudes against particular out-groups ( Faulkner et al., 2004 ) . This suggests that a combination of individual differences in contextual conditions and ideological beliefs about group hierarchies are a requirement for the perception of disease threat as coming from \"outside \".",

This may be done by governments to divert from their own failings ( Devakumar et al., 2020 a) . To successfully prevent and reduce the negative impact of epidemics on the well-being of migrant populations, it is urgent to accurately address the major xenophobiarelated attitudes, behaviors, and outcomes, by taking into consideration past pandemic scenarios. These insights will aid in the development of social support interventions and preventive programmes in society, aiming not only to increase the knowledge and awareness of society about xenophobic tendencies against migrants, but also to implement efficient public health measures and recommendations that can greatly improve the health of the disadvantaged communities mostly affected by the epidemics. Migrants access to equal healthcare services free of charge and to social security programmes should be immediately applied in the pandemic combat. As migrants are frequently scapegoated ( Devakumar et al., 2020 a) , it is extremely important to condemn the false statements about them, demand for correct political rhetoric and educate the public, thus preventing prejudices from spreading and escalating. Moreover, the adoption of public health principles ensuring safety, equal treatment, and social support to all will give confidence to the local population and prevent migrants from being blamed.",

Only published original quantitative peer-reviewed research papers were included, with the majority being very heterogeneous. Moreover, it was difficult to establish a cross-comparison between the obtained data, since no standardized xenophobia measures were described, with almost all included studies relying on self-report. As we are not aware of any type of validated quantitative method to measure xenophobia, we recommend the development of a xenophobia questionnaire to be validated in different environments, aiming to obtain comparable results in different countries and distinct seasons. The comparison of migrant groups across diverse destination countries can sometimes lead to bias, as the majority will continue to have unmet health needs. The rather low number of studies included in this review demonstrates general issues in research on \"international migrants \" during infectious diseases outbreaks.",

This constitutes a serious public health concern. It is urgent that societies adopt effective support strategies to combat xenophobia and structural forms of discrimination against migrants. Governments and public health authorities must guarantee the health, safety, and social inclusion of us all, namely by reducing the threats of infectious disease-related xenophobia. To achieve this, they must act to combat the stigma faced by these often marginalized and minoritized groups, improve knowledge and awareness in society about infectious diseases, and strengthen global healthcare services, especially during pandemics.",
