Postponement of non-emergency surgeries and reduced health-seeking behavior by patients has resulted in many residents failing to meet their dissertation requirements. Institutes accept adjustments in the sample size. However, publishing these dissertations, a requirement by regulatory authorities, will prove challenging.",

Worry of financial and personal constraints that this would entail aggravates anxiety caused by the pandemic. [5] Though the impact of this pandemic on ophthalmic training has been mostly detrimental, there have certainly been some gains. It opens new avenues for research. Online platforms, having overcome limitations of time and location, are important teaching methods. Wet labs and simulations, second fiddle to patient-centric training, have now achieved renewed importance. These modalities that have been adopted as rescue measures are likely to prove a valuable addition to traditional teaching methods in the future.",
