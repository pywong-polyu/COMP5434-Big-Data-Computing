He had no evidence of asbestos exposure nor the BAP1 inherited cancer syndrome. He declined enrolment into the MARS2 trial and proceeded in June 2018 to extra-pleural pneumonectomy (EPP) followed by palliative radiotherapy to his upper thoracic spine due to disease extending to the neural foramina. In September 2018, he developed a postoperative recurrence and was enrolled into the ATOMIC-meso trial, receiving a combination of pemetrexed, platinum and either placebo or the arginine-depleting agent ADI-PEG 20 until October 2019. He progressed and was then enrolled into the CONFIRM trial, a randomised study of nivolumab or placebo for relapsed mesothelioma. He was withdrawn after 3 months due to progressive disease clinically and radiologically. He developed a left renal vein thrombus and was started on low-molecular weight heparin. Due to worsening chest wall pain secondary to subcutaneous metastatic deposits, he was treated with 20 Gy in 5 fractions of radiotherapy in March 2020. Informed by his participation in the CONFIRM study, he then proceeded to combination immunotherapy with ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks) and pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks) [6] . Within four weeks he noticed a subtle livedoid changes in his left hand, but no other associated localising symptoms. In May 2020, after 6 weeks the combination immune checkpoint blockade was discontinued due to significant progression of nontarget disease including left subclavian artery compression by tumour. By this time the livedoid changes were extensively and symmetrically distributed in all four limbs but there was a particular prominent area of purpura on his left hallux (see Fig. 1 ). He was hospitalized to exclude acute limb ischaemia. He confirmed no history of autoimmune conditions, no prior dermatological history, and no associated symptoms of myalgia or arthralgia. The left subclavian artery was patent on CT imaging and the arterial supply to his lower limbs was normal by duplex doppler imaging with no evidence of embolic or thrombotic occlusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetation or significant valvular abnormalities. Serology was positive for speckled antinuclear antibody (ANA) with a titre of 1/640 and positive extractable nuclear antigens (Ro 60 positive and La positive) and negative for rheumatoid factor, anticardiolipin antibodies, cryoglobulins, human immunodeficiency virus, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and double-stranded DNA; complement levels were normal. The patient declined a skin biopsy, and so a differential diagnosis of cholesterol embolism could not be excluded, although there was no evidence of hypocomplementaemia or eosinophilia during the development and progression of his skin symptoms. Overall, the clinical presentation and serology were consistent with immunotherapy-induced ANA positive small vessel vasculitis with digital ischaemia. He received a five-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day initially) followed by a tapering regimen of oral corticosteroids starting at 75 mg o.d. with good improvement, although it was not possible to reverse the dry gangrene now evident in the left hallux.",

However, upon reducing his prednisolone to 30 mg o.d in August 2020 the dry gangrene in his left foot progressed to involve all 5 toes (see Fig. 2 ). Prednisolone was increased to 100 mg o.d. and he was admitted for a further 3-day course of pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg) and prostacyclin (epoprostenol 7 ng/kg/ min) followed by prednisolone 100 mg/day, together with oral mycophenolate mofetil (750 mg b.d.) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg b.d.) . The vasculitis stabilised, but two weeks later he reported loss of taste, loss of smell, and increasing breathlessness and was hospitalised for COVID-19 pneumonia. Mycophenolate was withheld, he responded to treatment and was discharged but subsequently readmitted a week later with secondary bacterial pneumonia to which he succumbed in October 2020.",
