Recently, Bangladesh has been attracting students from different parts of the world for various undergraduate programs [2] . The inflow of IUSs is beneficial for both the host country and the students; IUSs benefit the host country by contributing \"intellectual capital,\" whereas the IUSs receive education and a degree. Nonetheless, IUSs face innumerable challenges when moving to a completely unknown non-native country [3] . Beyond the difficulties related to the educational institution, adjusting to a new place may present socialization stress among the students [3, 4] . The IUSs encounter events and stressors beyond that of native students that have an impact on their mental health [4] . They have to deal with these problems without their family or familial support. The inability to cope with lectures and classroom activities and the most significant language barrier may result in anxiety or depression among the students [3] .",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is defined as \"a common mental disorder, characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite and feelings of tiredness and poor concentration. It can be long-lasting or recurrent, substantially impairing a person's ability to function at work, school or cope with daily life\" [3, [5] [6] [7] . Mental conditions may reduce an individual's lifespan by 12.3% adjusted for disabilities, and 31% of all years of life at all ages. The new updated WHO figures state that 300 million people are now dealing with depression and that between 2005 and 2015, this rose by 18% [8] . A study from Bangladesh revealed depression prevalence of 52.5 to 54.3% among students enrolled in medical schools [5] .",

In particular, research shows that dental students are prone to higher burnouts compared to medical students as it involves patient interaction during both theoretical and clinical course elements [12] . Obtaining an undergraduate academic degree in dentistry requires tedious education and demands to acquire deep knowledge on the field. The course usually runs for five years, with the last two years for clinical training, and one year of internship follows upon graduation. An undergraduate dental student must acquire theoretical knowledge and practical experience and develop interpersonal skills, which are judged at the end of each academic year through oral, written, and practical examinations. These persistent academic workloads and non-academic stressors, e.g., whole working day, coordinating with faculties, and administrative formalities, are generally stressful for students [6, [13] [14] [15] . With this in mind, the extensive periods of self-study, minimal sleep, and hours of professional education may, in turn, contribute to social deprivation, psychological exhaustion, and depression. This burden may have a detrimental effect on their work and personal life. Early-stage identification of depression is vital for minimizing suicide deaths and intentional self-harm.",

For instance, language and cultural differences may cause a considerable barrier. They may also endure financial crisis, unclear immigration status, homesickness, and alleged inequality above the usual university issues [16] . Students, especially those studying in foreign countries, who fail to adapt to changes and their new surroundings are more vulnerable to depression [17, 18] . Several studies have shown that depression is extremely prevalent among international students [17, 19, 20] . Previous studies on IUSs have been conducted primarily in the developed countries. Several studies have recently emerged on the topic related to depression among students studying in government-funded public versus self-funded private universities [17, 21] . It is also crucial to understand the extent of the effect on mental health as a result of studying dentistry abroad with different cultures, food habits, and adaptation among IUSs. The number of international students studying in Bangladesh has increased since 2012 and contributed to the local educational system but there is a research gap regarding their experience and learning outcome [22] . However, no such study has been conducted worldwide among non-native international undergraduate students studying dentistry and its effects on mental health. Hence, for the first time, this study evaluates the depression status among international students studying dentistry in Bangladesh through a cross-sectional study design. Here, we hypothesized that a change in the sociocultural environment, financial security, and structure of course curriculum has an impact on the mental health of non-native IUSs studying dentistry in Bangladesh.",

The criteria were used to recruit the respondents-(i) international undergraduate dental students (IUDSs), (ii) enrolled in the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) program after completion, which leads towards graduation in dentistry. No exclusion criteria were used. Data were collected from October to December 2020 from the following selected dental colleges-Dhaka Dental College and Hospital, City Dental College, Mandy Dental College and Hospital, Pioneer Dental College and Hospital, Rangpur Dental College, Update Dental College and Hospital, University Dental College and Hospital, MH Samorita Hospital and Medical College Dental Unit, and Sapporo Dental College and Hospital. The researchers used a convenience sampling method to recruit the students by using their academic and professional network to find a gatekeeper from each of the dental colleges to send the Google form link. The researchers used a snowballing sampling process and requested the IUDSs to circulate the Google form weblink with other IUDSs in their respective colleges. A total of 206 students from the previously mentioned nine dental colleges submitted their responses. Among them, five students did not consent to participate in the survey, and one of them did not thoroughly fill out the questionnaire. Hence, the final sample size of the survey was 200 IUDSs.",

Of the students who found it challenging to use the transport facility in Bangladesh about 65.5% of them suffered from depression. Homesickness, health problems, financial difficulty, and living conditions were significantly associated with depression as shown in Table 2 . Also, the Cramer's V coefficient suggests that homesickness and health problems have a moderate association with depression, and problems adapting to local Bangladeshi food, financial difficulty, accommodation, and transport problems have a substantial relationship with depression. The multivariable logistic regression analysis findings are shown in Table 3 . The logistic regression analysis revealed that the international students who had difficulties communicating in the local language were 2.28 (95% CI: 1.13-4.61) times more likely to experience depression than those without such difficulties. The odds of depression among the homesick international student were 2.75 (95% CI: 1. 38-5.47 ) times greater than the odds of depression among the students who did not feel homesick during their stay in Bangladesh. International students that experienced any health problems had 3.57 (95% CI: 1.86-6.87) times greater odds of experiencing depression compared to the students without any health problems. The international students who went through financial difficulties were 2.62 (95% CI: 1. 31-5.27 ) times more likely to experience depression than those who did not face any financial problems.

After successful completion of the BDS course, they must complete a rotatory-based internship for one year. The increase in distress can be due to the transition from pre-clinical to clinical stages, as demonstrated in other studies [6, 26] . Most studies reported that international female students studying medicine or dentistry are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. The difference among female and male students varies from 53.9% to 30% and 46.1% to 16%, respectively [27, 28] .

Those who are homesick are 2.5 times more likely to be depressed. The state of accommodation plays an important role apart from homesickness on an international student's mental health. Not getting the desired place of living on time or the unavailability of a dormitory act as stressors on the newly arrived students [3] .

A study conducted in a Greek dental school found that an informal academic connection between student and teacher provides a positive environment [33] . Our research shows that students who received full intellectual interaction did not suffer from depression in contrast to those with poor academic interaction. In most studies, one of the most critical hurdles for a non-native international students studying healthcare is the inability to communicate [18, 34] ; the adaptation to the host country's language. This affects the social interaction with other students and generates a communication gap between the institution and hostel (accommodation) administration who speaks only the host native language [3] . This language barrier affects a student's ability to understand class lectures and assignments, the confidence to participate and communicate in class, and may impact performance during oral examinations. A similar study conducted in China found that international students are not appropriately assigned due to patient care, history taking, and conveying treatment plans for communication insufficiencies [35] . Even among international students studying in Australia and in the USA, which are officially English speaking countries, studies have reported differences in language proficiency and multilingualism concerning their academic experience and results [36] [37] [38] .",

As a non-native dentist compared to their fellow native colleagues, the fresh international graduate dentists in Bangladesh may face challenges and have difficulty in learning clinical skills and gaining trust among the local patients during their mandatory internship training periods. In an exciting study, Cohen and colleagues [37] explored the clinical preparedness range, communication ability, social comforts, and clinical confidence between USA-born and non-USA-born clinical radiation sciences students, and the findings were intriguing. Although the academic and research environment is more structured for international students in the USA than in Bangladesh and the widely used communication language between the students, clinicians, and patients in English, the student's place of birth was an influencing factor in each clinical preparedness domain [37] .",

Even they felt less prepared clinically than their native USA-born colleagues. In Bangladesh, an IUD must communicate both in Bengali and English to complete such a challenging clinical degree in dentistry. Furthermore, even if an IUD can learn Bengali, it takes time to get used to the typical local dialect, which varies according to localities and races. They can communicate in social and academic life, even with their patients, during clinical learning sessions. The patients may only explain the signs in their native and local Bengali dialects. A study revealed that foreign-trained dentists interested in seeking employment in the USA face numerous challenges, including complex admission processes, high tuition costs, immigration barriers, and cultural differences [21] . Even a study conducted on non-native international students pursuing post-graduate education in Finland exhibited that international students face academic, social, financial, and mental health challenges and have concerns about their future career in a country that is officially a non-native-English-speaking one [18] . Similarly, in Bangladesh, an IUDS faces similar challenges and becomes worried, and may even get depressed regarding their potential dentistry career. After graduation, they can be a massive asset to Bangladesh's local healthcare sector and contribute further as trained international clinicians and innovative researchers. As Bangladesh moves towards a developing country and its economic growth attracts more global investments, it will encourage foreign employees to immigrate for their professional career development. The international dentists trained in Bangladesh can support and serve the international community in the coming future. The government and health care authorities should make policies and guidelines for a smoother career path for the IUDSs who will graduate from dental colleges in Bangladesh. Increasing the diversity in the dental profession in Bangladesh to match the native population might improve dentistry access for the locals, international residents, and minorities, hence reducing dental care disparities.",

We have reported that the non-native IUDSs face a language barrier that is even greater while studying a clinically oriented subject such as dentistry in Bangladesh. The data support previously published findings on non-native international students enrolled in universities from non-native-English-speaking countries such as Finland and China [18, 35] . Although, their educational infrastructure and pattern are traditionally more established for hosting non-native international students. Additionally, primary data of the current study was collected from IUSs from multiple public and private dental universities of Bangladesh. The findings provide a broad view of student's perspectives and without any doubt, they will provide the necessary feedback for the educational institutions, foreign ministry, and respective international diplomatic representatives. To date, this will be the first study conducted on non-native international undergraduate dental students (IUDSs), who will be engaged in a very skilled and technically advanced profession dealing with patients, both in Bangladesh, their home country, or even in a third country where they may migrate for higher studies and professional development.",

It is evident from the findings that several factors influence students' mental well-being during demanding dental education years. The educational institute must support housing, visa issues, and management of challenges faced due to cultural differences for the international students. Helping students to integrate into culture also requires attention from teachers and fellow students. Class lectures should be conducted in a medium that allows each student to understand the content. Educational institutes should offer or guide IUSs to take up a language course for beginners. Also, Bangladeshi diplomatic missions abroad can provide necessary short language courses and provide vital cultural information during the granting of study permits. If necessary, the corresponding diplomatic representatives and their resident citizens in Bangladesh can cooperate to integrate the students into the community. They can also guide them to blend in with the culture. The dental college authorities also should arrange regular parents' meetings (on-site and virtual) and open dialogues between the students, alumni, and their country representatives in Bangladesh. It is also imperative that educational institutes have clubs and events that allow for the mixing of IUSs from other institutes/universities. Also, routine psychological counseling, food and nutrition guidelines, and academically encour-aging seminars should be arranged for the IUDSs. As dental education requires interaction with patients, special classes could be set for the IUDSs to learn the basic language skills and cultural knowledge of the local community. ",
