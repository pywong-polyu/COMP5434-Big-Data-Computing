However, the need for several reagents and steps and the high cost of PCR hinder its worldwide implementation to contain the outbreak. Here, we report a cotton-tipped electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus antigen. Unlike the reported approaches, we integrated the sample collection and detection tools into a single platform by coating screen-printed electrodes with absorbing cotton padding. The immunosensor was fabricated by immobilizing the virus nucleocapsid (N) protein on carbon nanofiber-modified screen-printed electrodes which were functionalized by diazonium electrografting. The detection of the virus antigen was achieved via swabbing followed by competitive assay using a fixed amount of N protein antibody in the solution. A square wave voltammetric technique was used for the detection. The limit of detection for our electrochemical biosensor was 0.8 pg/mL for SARS-CoV-2, indicating very good sensitivity for the sensor. The biosensor did not show significant cross-reactivity with other virus antigens such as influenza A and HCoV, indicating high selectivity of the method. Moreover, the biosensor was successfully applied for the detection of the virus antigen in spiked nasal samples showing excellent recovery percentages. Thus, our electrochemical immunosensor is a promising diagnostic tool for the direct rapid detection of the COVID-19 virus that requires no sample transfer or pretreatment.",

Other types of corona viruses were previously known, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV HKU1, and HCoV NL63. 1 Since its first identification in China in 2019 until present, SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally causing significant morbidity and mortality. COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 2020. Until now, there are no available vaccines or drugs proven to treat COVID-19. Therefore, the timely detection of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to effectively control the rapid spread of the infection.",

            "text": "Several diagnostic methods are being developed for the detection of COVID-19. It can be achieved by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, detection of antigens, or by serological testing (the detection of the virus antibody). However, the serological tests are not reliable for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the relatively long delay between infection and seroconversion. Molecular diagnosis using RT-PCR is the primary used method for the detection of corona viruses. However, PCR takes relatively long time for analysis (minimum of 3 h) and requires several steps, including the collection of the specimens by swabbing, the transport of the sample into a solution, and extraction of the viral RNA before amplification. Moreover, RT-PCR is relatively expensive which hindered its wide applicability for population scale diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. 1 Thus, sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic methods based on the direct detection of the viral antigen without pretreatment are highly demanded to control the COVID-19 outbreak. There are four main structural antigens for corona viruses: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), matrix (M), and envelope (E). Among them, the S and N proteins have the potential to be used as biomarkers because they can distinguish different types of corona viruses. 2 Biosensors have been widely used for many diagnostic applications showing fast, easy, and reliable detection. 3\u22125 Several types of biosensors have been previously reported for the detection of viruses using surface plasmon resonance, 6\u22129 electrochemical, 10\u221212 and colorimetric lateral flow assay (LFA) 13, 14 detection. Until now, only few biosensors have been developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 such as the graphene-based field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor reported by Seo et al. 15 The FET immunosensor was used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using spike S1 protein as the biomarker. Plasmonic photothermal biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 through nucleic acid hybridization have been also developed. 16 Fluorescence-based microfluidic immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and antibodies have been also reported. 17 Despite the sensitivity of these sensors, they still need either an extraction step of the RNA and/or expensive equipment for measuring the signals.",

As shown in Figure  1C , the first CV scan showed a single irreversible cathodic peak at 0.3 V, characteristic for the reduction of diazonium salt via one electron transfer process. The reduction led to the removal of nitrogen molecule and the formation of aryl radical that forms a covalent bond with the CNF surface. However, in the second CV scan, the reduction peak was almost disappeared, likely because of the complete coverage of the CNF electrode surface with the carboxyphenyl layer which retarded the electron transfer process.

To characterize the fabrication steps of the immunosensor, SWVs were recorded at different steps in ferro/ferricyanide solution. Figure 2 shows the SWV reduction peaks of the redox couple at the bare carbon electrode, the CNF-modified electrode, the carboxyphenylmodified electrode, and after the immobilization of the N protein. As shown in the figure, an enhancement of the reduction peak current was observed when the electrode was modified with CNF compared to the bare carbon electrode. This is attributed to the increase in the electrochemical surface area of the electrode because of the CNF material. However, after the electroreduction step of the diazonium salt on the CNF electrode, the SWV reduction signal of the redox couple was almost disappeared because of the formation of the carboxyphenyl layer on the electrode surface. This has led to the passivation of the electrode and retardation of the electron transfer because of the aromatic layer. Moreover, the negatively charged carboxyl groups repelled the redox anion from the Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article surface, leading to a decrease in the reduction current. However, the immobilization of the virus protein antigen on the carboxyphenyl-modified electrode after activation with EDC/NHS led to an increase in the reduction peak current. This is likely because of the shielding of the negatively charged carboxylic groups on the CNF surface with the antigen. It is worth noting that the reported isoelectric point of the N protein is 10.07, 32 indicating that the antigen carries a positive charge at pH 7.4. Effect of the Cotton Coating on the Electrochemical Signal of the Electrode. The goal of this work is to develop a cotton-tipped electrochemical immunosensor which can perform both the sample collection and the detection. After the immobilization of the protein antigen on the CNF electrode, the electrodes were blocked with BSA solution and left to dry at room temperature. Then, a piece of cotton fiber was coated on the detection zone of the electrode, as shown in Figure 3A , which mimics the standard Q-tip. The cotton was used because of its high absorbing capability which allows the collection of the nasal samples by swabbing. 33 The incubation of the sensor with the antibody solution and the measuring redox solution is carried out in PCR tubes, as shown in Figure 3B ,C.",

            "text": "To this end, it was crucial to first investigate whether the coating of the electrode with the cotton fiber impacts the electrochemical signal. Figure 3D shows the SWV reduction peak current of the bare electrode before and after coating with the cotton in the redox solution. Nonsignificant change (less than 5%) in the electrochemical signal was observed after coating the carbon electrode with the cotton, likely because of the high absorbing properties of the cotton fiber. The cotton fiber was able to absorb the redox solution by capillary action and transports it to the electrode surface which remains in contact with the solution during the measurements. Figure 3E shows the reduction peak current at the SARS-CoV-2 immunosensor (the antigen-modified electrode after blocking with BSA) before and after coating with the cotton. The change in the peak current was less than 5%, indicating that there was no significant effect on the electrochemical signal of the sensor because of the coating with the cotton. It was also important to assess the effect of cotton coating on the biosensor response to the binding of the antigen on the sensor surface with the antibody in the solution. For this purpose, the reduction current of the uncoated and cotton-coated immunosensors was detected in the redox solution. Then, the two immunosensors were incubated in 1 ng/mL solution of antibody in two PCR tubes. After washing, the electrodes were measured in the redox solution and the sensor response was evaluated as the percentage change in the reduction peak current in each case. As shown in Figure 3F , the cotton-tipped biosensor response was almost similar to the uncoated immunosensor. These results imply that the cotton-tipped electrochemical sensor can be used as an effective platform with dual function as a sample collector and detection tool. Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article Competitive Electrochemical Detection of SARS-CoV-2 on the Immunosensor. The detection on the immunosensor was achieved via a competitive assay where a fixed concentration of antibody is mixed in the solution with different concentrations (0.1 pg/mL to 1 \u03bcg/mL) of the N protein antigen solution and then incubated on the immunosensor surface. A competition between the immobilized and the free antigen to bind the free antibody in the solution is realized. The higher the concentration of free antigen, the smaller the amount of antibody available to bind to the antigen on the electrode surface. The binding of the antibody to the antigen on the immunosensor causes an increase in the reduction peak current of the ferro/ferricyanide redox couple. This could be attributed to the binding with the positively charged antibodies which attract the redox anions, leading to an enhancement of the reduction current. Figure 4A shows the SWVs of the SARS-CoV-2 immunosensor upon incubation with different concentrations of N protein mixed with 10 \u03bcg/mL of the antibody solution. When the concentration of the N protein was high, the increase in the SWV peak current was low and vice versa. The calibration plot of the SARS-CoV-2 immunosensor is shown in Figure 4B . The calibration plot is obtained by plotting the biosensor response [the percentage increase in the peak current; (i \u2212 i o )/i o %] versus the logarithm of the antigen concentration. Good linear relationship was obtained for the concentration ranges from 1 to 1000 ng/mL of the N protein solution. The linear regression equations of the straight line was (i \u2212 i o )/i o % = 63.6 + \u22127.8 log C (ng/mL) (R = 0.991) for SARS-CoV-2. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 0.8 pg/mL for SARS-CoV-2 N antigen, indicating excellent sensitivity of the immunosensor. This LOD is much lower than that in other reported immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (LOD of ELISA is 0.4 ng/mL for SARS-CoV-2 N protein). All the experiments were carried out in triplicates, and the standard deviations of the measurements were ranging from 2.5 to 5.5%, indicating excellent reproducibility of the electrochemical immunosensor.",

Unlike the reported approaches, we integrated the sample collection and detection tools into a single platform by coating screen-printed electrodes with absorbing cotton padding. The immunosensor was fabricated by immobilizing the virus antigen on CNF-modified screenprinted electrodes which were functionalized by diazonium electrografting and activated by EDC/NHS chemistry. The detection of the virus antigen was achieved via swabbing followed by competitive assay using a fixed amount of N protein antibody in the solution. A ferro/ferricyanide redox probe was used for the detection using the SWV technique. The LOD for the N antigen electrochemical immunosensor was 0.8 pg/mL, indicating very good sensitivity for the biosensor. The biosensor did not show cross-reactivity with antigens from other viruses such as influenza A and HCoV, implying high selectivity of the method. Moreover, the biosensor was successfully applied for the detection of the virus antigen in spiked nasal samples showing excellent recovery percentages. The signal measurements can be realized using a handheld potentiostat and easily monitored using a smartphone device. Therefore, the developed cotton basedelectrochemical immunosensor is a promising diagnostic tool for the direct, low cost, and rapid detection of the COVID-19 virus which requires no sample transfer or pretreatment. We believe that the identification of other more stable and highaffinity synthetic recognition receptors such as aptamers for the virus proteins will pave the way to replace the antibody in several electrochemical biosensing platforms.
