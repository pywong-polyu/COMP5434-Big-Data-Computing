This new coronavirus canonically utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for cell entry. Herein, building upon our previous single cell study of the placenta (Pique-Regi, 2019), another study, and new single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing data, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 throughout pregnancy as well as in third-trimester chorioamniotic membranes. We report that co-transcription of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is negligible, thus not a likely path of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2 at any stage of pregnancy. In contrast, receptors for Zika virus and cytomegalovirus which cause congenital infections are highly expressed by placental cell types.

Our first-trimester data are in agreement with a prior report showing that there is minimal expression of ACE2 at the human maternal-fetal interface [62] ; however, the same dataset was recently used to report the opposite [63] . Nonetheless, the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not examined by either study. We also evaluated the expression of SARS-CoV2 receptors in the chorioamniotic membranes (also known as the extraplacental membranes) in the third trimester, since these tissues may also serve as a point of entry for microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and potentially the fetus [64] .

This is likely the reason why the reported scRNA-seq studies of the human placenta contain a low fraction of syncytiotrophoblast cells [STB, multinucleated cells forming the outermost fetal component of the placenta in direct contact with the maternal circulation (i.e., intervillous space)] [60, 61, 65] . Therefore, we considered whether the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was minimally observed in the placental cell types due to the reduced fraction of STB cells (i.e., dissociation bias). To address this possibility, we prepared single-nucleus suspensions of the placental tissues (including the decidua basalis) and performed single-nuclear RNAseq (snRNA-seq), which reduces the dissociation bias against large cells [66] . An important advantage of snRNA-seq is its compatibility with biobank frozen samples; therefore, we pooled 32 placental villi/decidua samples collected in the third trimester (Table S2 ). This represents the first snRNA-seq study of the placental tissues. A limitation of snRNA-seq is that it has a higher background compared to scRNAseq but this should not affect the analyses reported here. As expected, a larger fraction of STB cells/nuclei was observed using snRNA-seq compared to scRNA-seq (Fig. 1A) . Consistent with the scRNAseq analyses, the snRNAseq data demonstrated that co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is unlikely in the placental tissues (Fig. 1B) . Finally, we explored the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in third-trimester placental tissues by mining two microarray datasets that we have previously reported [67, 68] . These analyses of bulk gene expression data revealed that while ACE2 was detected above background in most of the samples, TMPRSS2 was largely undetected (Table S3) . Collectively, these results consistently indicate that the human placental tissues negligibly co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2. This reduced expression contrasts with the high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal goblet and ciliated cells within the human airways, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, which are targeted during COVID-19 [69] [70] [71] .

The expression of additional SARS-CoV-2-related receptors or proteins in the human placenta is shown in Fig. 2 , CoV-Alt; however, further research is required to test their participation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. For example, in vitro studies suggest that BSG (Basigin, also called CD147 or EMMPRIN, transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily) provides an alternate entry for SARS-CoV-2 when ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not expressed [73] [74] [75] . We found that the placenta and chorioamniotic membranes expressed high levels of BSG throughout pregnancy (Fig. 2 , CoV-Alt); yet, this transcript is also widely expressed in all human tissues and cell types (Fig. S1) . Therefore, it is unlikely that this protein alone is a sufficient requirement for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and other proteins may be required to explain the cell-type primarily affected by COVID-19. Moreover, cathepsin L (CSTL) and FURIN may also function as proteases priming the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [76] . We found that these proteases are highly expressed by the placental tissues throughout gestation (Fig. 2 , CoV-Alt). Nevertheless, these proteases may not provide sufficient levels of priming by themselves [77] [78] [79] when tested with SARS-CoV-1, yet this has not been verified for SARS-CoV-2. Given that the placental tissues are enriched in maternal and fetal macrophages [61] , and that a subset of these immune cells expressing sialoadhesin (SIGLEC1, also known as CD169) can contribute to viral spread during SARS-CoV-2 infection [80, 81] , we also investigated the expression of SIGLEC1 in this study. As expected, SIGLEC1 was expressed by macrophages in the placenta and chorioamniotic membranes and, to a lesser extent, in T cells (Fig. 2 , CoV-Alt). However, even if the virus could infect the placental/decidual macrophages expressing SIGLEC1, this is not sufficient for viral spreading. The expression of ADAM17 was also investigated in the placental tissues since this metalloproteinase competes with TMPRSS2 in ACE2 processing [82] . The placenta and chorioamniotic membranes highly expressed ADAM17 (Fig. S2) ; however, only cleavage by TMPRSS2 results in augmented SARS-S-driven cell entry [82] . While these CoV-Alt molecules may be used for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they are likely to be less efficient than ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which are already targeted for antiviral interventions [59] ; yet, new candidate host:viral interacting proteins and possible drugs are being investigated [72] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 152, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 618, "end": 622, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 623, "end": 627, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 628, "end": 632, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1159, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1372, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1377, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1382, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1543, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1700, "end": 1704, "text": "[80,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1708, "text": "81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2209, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2370, "end": 2374, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2560, "end": 2564, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2660, "end": 2664, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 259, "end": 265, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 741, "end": 748, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 843, "end": 852, "text": "(Fig. S1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1266, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1911, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2287, "text": "(Fig. S2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "MAIN TEXT"}, {"text": "Given that the main mediators for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 were minimally expressed by the human placenta, we also investigated whether the receptors for congenital viruses such as CMV and ZIKV, which are known to infect and cross the placenta [5, 6] , were detectable using our pipeline.

In addition, we showed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptors are not expressed by the chorioamniotic membranes in the third trimester. However, viral receptors utilized by CMV, ZIKV, and others are highly expressed by the human placental tissues. While transcript levels do not always correlate with protein expression, our data indicates a low likelihood of placental infection and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, it is still possible that the expression of these proteins is much higher in individuals with pregnancy complications related with the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system, which can alter the expression of ACE2 [92] . The cellular receptors and mechanisms that could be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 are still under investigation [72] ; yet, single-cell atlases can help to identify cell types with a similar transcriptional profile to those that are known to participate in COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 917, "end": 921, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1034, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MAIN TEXT"}, {"text": "Placenta and decidua scRNA-seq data from first-trimester samples were downloaded through ArrayExpress (E-MTAB-6701).
