The study will also provide valuable information on potential cost-effectiveness for individuals and the healthcare system. \u25ba Early involvement of engaged patients, key decisionmakers from each province, directors of fertility clinics, as well as professional and public health associations will increase the feasibility of the trial and the potential impact and use of the findings to influence policies and priorities of institutions and governments. \u25ba It is not possible to blind the intervention and data collection since the tested intervention is a lifestyle programme, but the study's primary outcome of life birth is a robust clinical outcome that is not susceptible to bias. \u25ba Self-reported questionnaires may introduce desirability or recall biases, but the study uses tools validated in such setting and these biases should be similar in the intervention and control groups.",

            "text": "Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, infertility is 'a disease characterised by the failure to establish a clinical pregnancy after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse or due to an impairment of a person's capacity to reproduce either as an individual or with his/ her partner'. 2 For the purpose of this study, subfertility is defined as an infertility with a reasonable probability of spontaneous pregnancy without medical intervention, which excludes couples with sterility or severe infertility (such as bilateral irreversible tubal factor or severe male factor). Medically assisted reproduction (MAR), including ovulation induction, ovarian stimulation, intrauterine insemination and assisted reproductive technology (ART) 2 are part of the current clinical management of infertility and have become more and more used and effective in helping infertile couples to achieve a pregnancy. 3 Unfortunately, these procedures are costly and carry risks for both women and infants. These risks can occur at different stages of ART: ovarian stimulation (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, thromboembolism and ovarian torsion), oocyte retrieval (infection and bleeding) and early pregnancy (ectopic or heterotopic pregnancy, and multiple gestations 4 ). Although these risks are rare, they can have significant consequences. Furthermore, some studies have suggested that ART procedures may have negative neonatal consequences, such as higher frequencies of alterations in DNA methylation patterns associated with DNA imprinting disorders in children conceived through ART. 5 Obesity (defined operationally as a body mass index (BMI) \u226530 kg/m 26 ), is a known modifiable risk factor associated with female infertility 7 and the population affected worldwide is high enough for obesity to be recognised as a global epidemic by the WHO since 2000. 8 The prevalence of obesity has been estimated to be as high as 30% in Canadian and 38% in American populations, respectively. 9 More precisely, 21% of Canadian women of reproductive age had obesity in 2015. 10 Women who plan to get pregnant are currently more likely to be affected by obesity, 11 which can significantly affect their fertility. For instance, a very large cohort study including more than 40 000 couples estimated that women with obesity display a 78% higher risk of having infertility compared with women with a normal BMI (18.50-24 .99 kg/m 2 ) (OR with 95% CI: 1.78 (1.63 to 1.95)). 12 Women with obesity are also more likely to develop polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is the leading cause of anovulatory infertility, affecting 6%-10% of women of childbearing age. 13 Furthermore, a higher BMI has been associated with reduced pregnancy rates even in women with ovulatory cycles, equating to a 4% decrease in pregnancy rate per kg/m 2 of BMI increase in women with a BMI \u226529 kg/m 2 . 14 Moreover, studies assessing MAR procedures have reported that women with obesity: (i) require higher doses and a longer duration of clomiphene 15 and gonadotrophins [16] [17] [18] [19] to achieve ovulation, (ii) display a lower pregnancy rate per cycle 18 and (iii) are at a higher risk of cycle cancellation 16 18 and miscarriage. 20 21 Obesity also increases the risk of complications during pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, caesarean section and intrauterine death. 22 23 In keeping with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease paradigm, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and excessive gestational weight gain are consistently associated with the early development of obesity and diabetes in the offspring. 24 Obesity in childhood is closely linked to adult obesity, 25 26 perpetuating the intergenerational cycle of obesity. [27] [28] [29] Adopting a healthy lifestyle before conception and restoring a healthy metabolic environment early during pregnancy likely represents the best approach to break the vicious circle of intergenerational propagation of obesity and diabetes.",

            "text": "Infertility management in women with obesity seeking fertility treatments To prevent the adverse effects of obesity on female fertility and on gestational and neonatal health, many organisations have recommended that women with obesity should be assisted, before conception, to lose weight (5%-10% of their initial weight) and adopt a healthy lifestyle, and maintain that healthy lifestyle during pregnancy. [30] [31] [32] [33] Results from a recent systematic review support lifestyle modification prior to ART in women with overweight or obesity. 34 The authors pointed out that despite the lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the area, pre-conception weight loss in women with overweight or obesity can help improve fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Out of the seven RCTs assessing non-surgical methods of weight loss, including some form of lifestyle intervention, the most methodologically rigorous study was a RCT published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2016. 35 This study compared 287 women with obesity and subfertility who were randomised to a 6-month structured lifestyle intervention (including six outpatient visits and four telephone consultations with a nurse or dietician) and 285 women assigned to prompt fertility treatments. The lifestyle intervention lasted only 6 months and was not continued during fertility treatments or pregnancy. After a follow-up of 24 months, the lifestyle programme did not improve the live birth rate, but resulted in a significant increase in the rate of spontaneous pregnancies (rate ratio (95% confidence): 1.61 (1.16 to 2.24)) and reduced the need for fertility treatments (rate ratio (95% confidence): 0.78 (0.70 to 0.86)). 36 In a follow-up article, the same group of authors observed, from a hospital perspective, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u20ac15 845 per additional point of percentage in the healthy live birth rate resulting from the lifestyle programme compared with usual care. The authors concluded that their intervention may be deemed as cost-effective, especially for longer follow-up Open access timelines, in anovulatory women, women who completed the study or women \u226536 years of age. 37 Interestingly, in a survey asking women with obesity or overweight and considering pregnancy if they were interested in adopting a healthier lifestyle prior to conception, 91% reported their willingness to participate in a lifestyle programme. 38 However, despite the patients' motivation and the international recommendations to encourage women to optimise their lifestyle before starting fertility treatments, most women with obesity do not have access to such targeted lifestyle programmes integrated within their fertility care. Therefore, our objective is to give these women access to the Fit-For-Fertility Programme (FFFP), an interdisciplinary lifestyle intervention, integrated into the fertility clinic care pathway. This programme supports participants in adopting sustainable healthy behaviours, in pre-conception, throughout fertility treatments and during pregnancy. In response to the national priority to improve the quality and costs of reproductive and perinatal care established by our Canadian network on reproductive and maternal health of women with obesity and infertility, we will conduct a multicentre RCT assessing the FFFP in women with subfertility and obesity.",

Policymakers and professional or patient organisations of all relevant provinces provided their support to the project and partnered with the research team to facilitate the feasibility of the trial and dissemination of the results. Importantly, three patient organisations partnered with our team and provided strong support letters: Obesity Canada, the Association des couples infertiles du Qu\u00e9bec and Conceivable Dreams. Engaged patients have been implicated early in the development of this protocol to ensure that the results will be relevant for the target population and that the methods are appropriate for the participants. Two previous participants from the pilot study conducted in Sherbrooke are acting as engaged participants and have participated in each step of the trial's development. Before submission of the grant proposal to the funding agency, they approved the study's research question and its general objectives, as well as the acceptability of the intervention and the burden of research visits. Thereafter, they were regularly consulted by the Sherbrooke research team, and they partnered with the team during dedicated research meetings. Among other contributions, they have given precious input regarding recruitment approaches, data collection tools and timing, intervention upgrades from the pilot study, as well as participants' newsletters. Other fertility clinics have committed to include one or two engaged patients, who will participate at research meetings at each site.",

This intervention is aimed at supporting participants to implement progressive and sustainable lifestyle changes. Participants attend 30-min individual sessions with a dietitian and a kinesiologist, respectively, every 6 weeks for the first 6 months, then every 8 weeks for the following 6 months and then every 12 weeks until the end of the treatment period. These individual meetings take place in person with the participant, or virtually using an authorised system of telemedicine in the event that face-to-face meetings are not possible (eg, due to public health rules such as during the COVID-19 pandemic). Personal remote contact (eg, by phone, email) is offered between in-person meetings. Patients are guided by the dietitian and kinesiologist to formulate SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely). 47 These professionals are trained in evidence-based motivational communication skills, 48 with emphasis placed on how to arm women with the knowledge, motivation and skills to achieve sustainable lifestyle changes. To ensure equitable delivery of the intervention, we will implement an internal quality control and training process. Therefore, after receiving training in motivational communication by our leading expert (KL), each professional will audio-record their first three individual meetings. These recordings will be evaluated by an expert in motivational communication using a coding scheme to verify fidelity. Feedback regarding the professional's application of motivational communication techniques will be provided as needed, and additional recordings may be necessary based on the trainer's assessment. After 6 and 12 months, three more individual sessions are recorded and used to analyse the quality and fidelity of the intervention from a research perspective. Consent for recording individual meetings is a specific question in the informed consent form and participants have the opportunity to revoke their agreement at any time during the course of their participation in the study. \"Let's get going!

Therefore, a sample size of 293 women per group is required to detect a 15% absolute difference between groups, with a power of 95% and alpha level of 5%, from an estimated live birth rate of 35% in the control group (based on our previous pilot RCT 46 ) to 50% in the intervention group (nQuery Advisor V.4.0). Assuming a withdrawal rate of 5% (eligibility criteria violation and loss to follow-up), the total recruitment target is 616 women. A 95% power is sufficient for most of our secondary outcome analyses. To recruit a total of 616 participants in 18 months, the two clinics with smaller practices (CHUS and Centre hospitalier universitaire de Qu\u00e9bec (CHUQ)) will need to recruit 53 participants (ie, 39 per year), and the other five clinics will have to recruit 102 participants (ie, 68 per year). These recruitment rates are feasible given the data from our pretrial survey of participating fertility clinics that showed that smaller practices (CHUS and CHUQ) evaluate 80 to 315 new women with obesity per year, and larger practices, between 265 and 810.",

The primary economic analysis will be based on the ICER, using live birth as the primary effectiveness outcome. As a secondary measure of cost-effectiveness, QALYs will be calculated from the SF-6D V.2, 65 66 using the algorithm developed by Mulhern et al. 67 QALYs will help in considering the aspect of healthrelated quality of life affected by weight reduction, healthy lifestyle and psychological impacts of subfertility. A 1.5% discount rate will be considered for periods higher than 1 year and sensitivity analysis will be performed. 68 To estimate the CI on the difference in costs, we will perform non-parametric analyses with 5000 bootstrap replications. We will also perform cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to compare the cost-effectiveness thresholds for different costs per unit gain. 68 69 Methodology and analyses of qualitative substudy In addition to the simple satisfaction questionnaire, an in-depth, qualitative iterative exploration of patient's perceptions of the FFFP and medical care will be performed. Purposive sampling will be used to create the two sub-groups in each clinic, based on the technique of critical incidents using patients' characteristics (levels of satisfaction with their care based on questionnaires, fertility or pregnancy outcomes, loss or gain of weight during follow-up, ethnic group, etc.). A semi-structured interview guide will be used for the focus groups, tailored to each trial group, with open-ended questions adapted from results of previous studies on similar topics. 70 The 90-minute focus group meetings will be led by a facilitator who will encourage participation and discussions. 71 72 An experienced observer from our research group will participate remotely from Sherbrooke: he will take notes and support the facilitator, by asking follow-up questions, for example. Data will be analysed as soon as possible by a member of the research team, using Miles, Huberman and Saldana's method. The analysis of the content of the focus groups as they are conducted will help enrich the subsequent focus groups (iterative approach). 73 A preliminary analysis grid with various categories based on our previous work will be used, to which emerging categories will be added successively. Regular discussions with the research team will take place during the analysis process to promote a comprehensive understanding of the material collected.",

Interventions supporting changes in lifestyle habits and a moderate weight loss of 5%-10% of the initial weight are highly recommended for women who are trying to conceive. [31] [32] [33] Unfortunately, there is little evidence from large and of good quality RCTs in this population supporting this recommendation. To our knowledge, there is only one published RCT (the LIFESTYLE study) evaluating the impacts of a 6-month Open access lifestyle intervention on fertility outcomes among a general population of women with obesity and subfertility, not specifically affected with PCOS. 35 Although the authors did not observe an improvement in their primary outcome (vaginal birth of a healthy singleton) with their lifestyle intervention as compared with usual care, they reported a higher proportion of women in the intervention group achieving a spontaneous pregnancy (26.1% vs 16.2%, relative risk with 95% CI: 1.61 (1.16 to 2.24)) and a reduced total number of treatment cycles.

First, it is not possible to blind the intervention and data collection, either to the participants nor the professionals (research or clinical), since the tested intervention is a lifestyle programme. Although a blind research study adds robustness and limits potential bias, we do not think this represents an important stake, because the study's primary outcome is life birth, which is a robust clinical outcome that is not susceptible to bias. Second, data collection is done mainly using self-reported questionnaires that can result in a desirability bias. However, most of the questionnaires used have been validated and used in previous studies, and the bias should be similar in the intervention and control groups. Additionally, self-reported questionnaires may introduce a recall bias when patients have to report on previous events (eg, costs, nutritional intake in the last month). In that perspective, clear and detailed instructions are given to patients at each research visit to assist them in completing the questionnaires to the best of their ability. Thirdly, there may be a degree of diversity in the FFFP delivery due to the multicentre nature of the study. In the context of a pragmatic RCT, this diversity would in fact, reflect the real-world reality of programme implementation in different fertility clinics. While we consider this aspect to be a strength contributing to the generalisability of the results, it could also result in a variability in the efficacy of the intervention at each centre. To mitigate this concern, formal training is provided to all health professionals regarding motivational interviewing techniques, with coaching for the first meetings with participants until the professional masters these skills appropriately. Fidelity of the proper use of motivational communication in real clinical settings will be monitored throughout the study and corrective measures will be initially suggested to professionals, if needed. Furthermore, some standardisation in administering the core concepts of the FFFP is provided to health professionals beforehand to ensure that the interventions are as effective as possible.",

The multicentre setting allows our work to be more generalisable, because of the diversity in the subpopulations and healthcare systems enrolled. The slight differences in provincial healthcare systems in Canada will allow us to examine the potential of the FFFP to be implemented in various healthcare contexts. The proposed study relies on early involvement of engaged patients, key decision-makers from each province, directors of fertility clinics, as well as professional and public health associations, which will increase the potential impact and use of the findings to influence policies and priorities of institutions and governments. The results of our multicentre RCT will have a major scientific impact since they will provide important data on the importance of a lifestyle programme supporting women with obesity seeking fertility treatments. We believe our work will promote better fertility outcomes and response to ART as well as contribute in achieving a healthy pregnancy and giving birth to a healthy baby. This study will also provide valuable information on potential cost-effectiveness for individuals and the healthcare system.
