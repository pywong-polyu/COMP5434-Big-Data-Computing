This study aimed to understand the inf luences of COVID-19 on different comorbidities and vice versa through network-based gene expression analyses. Using the shared dysregulated genes, we identified key genetic determinants and signaling pathways that may involve in their shared pathogenesis. The COVID-19 showed significant upregulation of 93 genes and downregulation of 15 genes. Interestingly, it shares 28, 17, 6 and 7 genes with diabetes mellitus (DM), lung cancer (LC), myocardial infarction and hypertension, respectively. Importantly, COVID-19 shared three upregulated genes (i.e. MX2, IRF7 and ADAM8) with DM and LC. Conversely, downregulation of two genes (i.e. PPARGC1A and METTL7A) was found in COVID-19 and LC. Besides, most of the shared pathways were related to inf lammatory responses. Furthermore, we identified six potential biomarkers and several important regulatory factors, e.g. transcription factors and microRNAs, while notable drug candidates included captopril, rilonacept and canakinumab. Moreover, prognostic analysis suggests concomitant COVID-19 may result in poor comorbidities. We believe these findings might be useful to further understand the intricate association of these diseases as well as for the therapeutic development.",

The etiological agent of this international outbreak is an RNA virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that belongs to the Coronaviridae family [1, 2, 5] . Depending on the demography and environments, the spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from the common cold to respiratory failure [6] [7] [8] [9] . Importantly, the persistence and prognosis of COVID-19 are greatly influenced by the underlying health conditions and age of the patients [10, 11] . Two or more coexisting health conditions are comorbidities when they influence each other with their shared pathogenesis [12, 13] . Remarkably, the most frequent comorbidities in COVID-19 are hypertension (HT) (27-30%) , diabetes (19%) and coronary heart disease (6-8%) [5, 8, 11, 14] . Their associations may lead to the discovery of other potential risk factors that might help in identifying and managing high-risk populations [11, 15] . Although comorbidities are associated with the severity of COVID-19, the specific disease-modifying mechanisms need to be investigated [8] .",

ACE2 expresses in most metabolic tissues and organs, including the lung, pancreas, intestine and kidneys [19] . Recent studies revealed HT as one of the most frequent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients [5] . In a study, about 23.4% of the severe COVID-19 patients (N = 1099) were reported to have HT [20] . Previously, clinical studies suggested HT as a risk factor for high death rates in SARS and MERS as well [21] . Patients with HT and cardiovascular disease are usually treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) that increase the expression of ACE2 which in turn attracts more viral load [22] . Therefore, disease severity may arise due to the role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of HT and cardiovascular diseases [5] . Though the coexistence of HT and SARS-CoV-2 showed a higher mortality rate, there is insufficient evidence to establish the link between the prevalence of HT and the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection [5] . Hence, the specific molecular mechanism of high blood pressure that may be responsible for the severity of COVID-19 is yet to be studied.",

Nationwide analysis in China showed that 34.6% of diabetic patients have developed a severe form of COVID-19 [24] . However, current data indicate that diabetic individuals are not prone to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population; rather, it could provoke the severity of COVID-19 [19, 25, 26] . Although earlier studies were focused on type 2 diabetes, recent studies suggested that COVID-19 patients with type 1 diabetes could also be at a potential risk of disease severity [27] . As mentioned earlier, ACE2 receptors are expressed in metabolic organs/tissues/cells, for example, pancreatic beta cells associated with controlling glucose metabolism; hence, entry of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to altered glucose metabolism, which possibly complicates the pathophysiology of predominant diabetes [19, 27, 28] . Furthermore, patients with lung cancer (LC) are prone to the severity of COVID-19 [29, 30] . In a homogenous study, a significant spike in CFR (52.3%) has been observed in LC patients with COVID-19 infection as compared to the general population [31] . Considering the predisposition of lung infection and compromised immunity in LC patients, the higher CFR from COVID-19 in LC patients is not surprising. Therefore, identification of the genetic determinants that may have worsened the LC outcome is important for optimal care during this pandemic. Hence, genetic determinants that are triggered by the COVID-19 and lead to a poor prognosis should be determined.",

After comparing the COVID-19 with other datasets, we found 49 unique shared DEGs in which 42 genes were upregulated ( Figure 2E ) and only 7 genes (i.e. CXCL14, CYP4F3, MAP7D2, METTL7A, NANOS1, PPARGC1A and VTCN1) were downregulated (Supplementary File S6). To understand the pathogenetic involvement of COVID-19 with the aforesaid diseases, we performed a cross-comparative analysis among the gene expression profiles. The Venn diagram of Figure 2A shows that COVID-19 shares 28, 17, 6 and 7 genes with DM, LC, MI and HT. To visualize their association, we constructed a genedisease relationship network (GDN) centered on the COVID-19 as shown in Figure 2E .

Herein, log2FC \u2265 |1| was used to identify DEGs, and statistical significance was set to adjusted P-value \u2264 0.05. Next, the DEGs were subjected to functional enrichment in terms of distributions, GO and pathways, comorbidities, PPI, regulatory biomarkers, PDI and survival analysis. For PPI, the network was constructed with STRING confidence cutoff of 900 and potential hubs were identified using five different methods, while regulatory factors (e.g. TFs and miRNAs) were determined with degree centrality of 5 and 2, respectively. To detect the top-ranked factors, additional filtering was done using betweenness centrality of 50 and 100, respectively. For pathways, we considered Reactome (2016), KEGG (human; 2019) and WikiPathways (human; 2019) databases, while GO terms were determined with Biological Process (2018), Cellular Component (2018) and Molecular Function (2018) databases.

For COVID-19-like expression, for instance, the chances of survival in LC patients tend to reduce due to the COVID-19related expression of nine DEGs (i.e. ADAM8, C3, CCL20, CXCL14, FAM167A, METTL7A, PPARGC1A, SAA2 and TYMP), while the survival rate increases for five DEGs that include IFITM1, IRF7, LIF, MAP7D2 and VTCN1.

While the latter case is not surprising given the site of pathogenesis, such association with the former is quite interesting. It could be orchestrated by several genes acting in concert. For example, the upregulated IRF7 gene is associated with the pathogenesis of LC and type 1 diabetes [58, 59] . Further, the elevated expression of ADAM8 was observed in type 2 diabetes [60] . It also causes malignant cell growth and leads to poor outcomes in cancer patients [61] . The poor survival associated with ADAM8 expression is also supported by our survival analysis. In our study, ADAM8 was upregulated in COVID-19, DM and LC, and its upregulation revealed a poor prognosis in LC patients. Therefore, the results coincide with the previous study. Another gene MX2 encodes for interferon (IFN)-induced GTP-binding protein, which is found to be overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma [62] and is involved in a better survival rate in skin cancer [63] . However, we did not find any significant difference in the survival outcome in LC with the expression of MX2 gene. COVID-19 shares the upregulation of CCL20 gene with LC and HT. It promotes LC through the proliferation and migration of cells using the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways [64] . Its overexpression is also involved in airway inflammation leading to severe asthma, HT, liver injury and LC [64] [65] [66] [67] . Furthermore, we found upregulated CCL20 which is associated with better survival in LC patients. We observed that the upregulation of KRT6B is shared between COVID-19 and MI patients. Being a key mediator of the Notch signaling pathway, KRT6B enhances atherosclerosis by promoting endothelial dysfunction [68] , which in turn may lead to the MI episode [69] .",

The majority of the shared DEGs are located at chromosomes 1, 11 and 12. Interestingly, in a study on a mouse model, chromosome 12 is found to be linked with airway hyper-responsiveness [70] . Besides, chromosome 11 holds fundamental genes related to metabolism and cell proliferation that are involved in a variety of cancers, especially in LC [71] . Moreover, most of the genes were found to be related to lung and spleen tissues. Therefore, our finding is supported by the characteristic features of COVID-19. To further validate the association of COVID-19 with selected comorbidities and other diseases, we applied the shared DEGs, which revealed potential risk factors and diseases. In addition to the selected comorbidities, the Metascape server suggested the top 20 complications, including reperfusion injury, liver cirrhosis and injury, psoriasis, dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, ulcerative colitis, hypersensitivity, cancers, etc. Interestingly, recent reports are in line with our findings. For instance, the COVID-19 severity is prevalent in patients with liver cirrhosis and associated injuries [72, 73] . Studies suggested that psoriatic patients could be more susceptible to COVID-19 [74, 75] . Kutlu and Metin [76] recently reported that 9.6% of COVID-19 patients had a history of psoriasis. This is plausible since psoriasis developed due to the hyper-inflammatory reactions, which are highly prevalent in COVID-19 [74, 75] . Further, the shared DEGs were submitted in the Expression Atlas to determine their expression levels in associated comorbidities. Like in COVID-19, most of the shared DEGs were highly upregulated in various identified diseases, i.e. skin diseases, glioblastoma, psoriasis, Crohn disease, ulcerative disease, pneumonia and keratosis. Therefore, this finding coincides with the prediction done by the Metascape server, hence, validates our study as well.",

            "text": "Further, we selected the top 30 pathways that may play a crucial role in disease development. Notably, most of the genes and identified pathways are related to pro-inflammatory reactions (i.e. cytokine productions) and response to viral infections, which explains the cytokine storms in COVID-19 severity [16, 19] . The predicted pathways include Th1-secreted cytokines (i.e. lFN-\u03b3 , IL-1 and IL-2), Th2-mediated cytokines (i.e. IL-4, IL-13 and network. The interacting network of miRNAs and TFs were filtered with degree centrality less than and equal to 2 and 5, respectively. In these networks, hexagons are shared DEGs, while lime and blue circles represent associated miRNAs or TFs, respectively. IL-10), IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) signaling pathways which cause widespread damage, respiratory failure and mortality [77, 78] . Interestingly, pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially Th1 cytokines, are known to increase insulin resistance [79, 80] that may facilitate additional complexities in a COVID-19 patient. Increased cytokine production is also associated with HT [81] . The preexisting cytokine imbalance in HT could make COVID-19 even worse and vice versa. Therefore, these pathways could be linked to COVID-19 and may reveal crucial checkpoints for drug targets. Due to the high prevalence of IL-17 in COVID-19, for instance, anti-IL-17 therapy has been considered as a potential treatment for COVID-19 [82] . Like pathways, GO terms pathways included the immune system process, defense response, cell surface receptor signaling, etc., which are relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using the common DEGs, a PPI network was constructed to visualize their association and to determine the key diseasemodifying players (hubs) in COVID-19 and comorbidities. Hubs are defined as proteins with eight or more interactions, while proteins with less than four interactions are named nonhubs [83] . Since they have many interacting partners within a network, hub-proteins are considered as functionally significant [84] . Using different methods, we identified six common hubproteins (i.e. SOCS3, TLR2, BIRC3, PPARGC1A, HELZ2 and IRF7) involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk factors related to COVID-19. In our previous study, we identified SOCS3 as a hub-protein and observed its upregulation in SARS-like viral infections [32] . Another hub-protein BIRC3 is an apoptotic inhibitor and plays a crucial role in regulating NF-\u03baB signaling and apoptosis [51] . It facilitates the malignant transformation of gliomas, a type of brain tumor, which is also evident in our study [52] . Therefore, the upregulation of BIRC3 due to COVID-19 may also initiate the progression of LC. Furthermore, the expression of SOCS3 downregulated the JAK2/STAT3 pathway to promote macrophage polarization that plays a key role in lung inflammation [47] . A previous study also identified MMP9 as an important biomarker in SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory failure [85] . Interestingly, MMP9 is also suggested as a hubprotein by several methods used in this study. This protein is well known for its involvement in both acute and chronic lung diseases [86] . In acute lung injury, MMP9 degrades cell matrices in lung tissues through neutrophil-mediated inflammation and destruction of the alveolar-capillary barrier [85, 87] . Therefore, these hub-proteins can be regarded as candidate biomarkers or, if their biological role in COVID-19 is confirmed, as potential drug targets. However, hub-proteins detected by the MNC method are completely different from other methods, which is conceivable since MNC scores the network differently [43] .",

Hence, both are essential to understand particular disease development. This study unfolded relationships among the shared DEGs and their respective TFs and regulatory miRNAs. We identified several TFs, such as NFKB1A, E2F1, TP53 and CREB1, which are known to involve in viral-mediated acute respiratory diseases [90] [91] [92] . Among the 45 miRNAs, 10 were related to LC (i.e. miR-9-5p, 98-5p, 34a-5p, 30a-5p, 21-5p, 155-5p, 19a-3p, 19b-3p, 132-3p and 124-3p). The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for the invasion, migration and metastasis of cancers, which is regulated by miR-19a-3p and 19b-3p [93] . The miR-155-5p controls the apoptosis and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage using the Apaf-1-mediated pathway [94] . Again, miR-21-5p is upregulated in non-small LC, while its downregulation reduces cell proliferation [93] . Likewise, miR-21-5p, 34a-5p and 143-3p are found to be associated with different cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, heart failure, coronary artery disease and HT [95, 96] . Specifically, miR-21 involved in cardiac remodeling by targeting the ERK/MAP pathway, while miR-143 targets NF-\u03baB and ACE-related pathways for macrophage differentiation and polarization [95] . The presence of miR-122 is observed to be upregulated briefly after the initiation of ischemia. Further, miR-125b-5p is upregulated in DM patients and is involved in insulin resistance as well as the immune response to viral infections [97] .",

Moreover, some miRNAs associated with asthma (i.e. miR-155-5p) and pneumonia (i.e. miR-30a-5p) were also found, which are highly prevalent in COVID-19 [92, 100, 101] . Overall, these data and those included in the respective supplementary file(s) are of clinical interest and may shed light on the cause and progression of COVID-19 as well as any new prospective therapeutic strategies. By considering the common DEGs, several drug candidates are also proposed. As expected, several drugs have already been found to have therapeutic effects against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, pre-treatment with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), has shown to reduce the level of ACE2 and promote antiinflammatory reactions that may contribute to the better outcome of the COVID-19 patients [102] . We also identified rilonacept which is an approved IL-1 inhibitor. In a recent study, mortality risk from COVID-19 was significantly reduced among the patients treated with IL-1 inhibitor [103] , hence, rilonacept should further be assessed for its anti-COVID-19 action. Another identified drug is canakinumab, which restored normal oxygen level in patients suffering from COVID-19-related pneumonia [104] . Therefore, the identified drug candidates should be evaluated for their protective effect on COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Finally, we evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on the prognostic outcome of LC patients. Importantly, the expression pattern of most DEGs in COVID-19 was found to be associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with LC. In earlier studies, for instance, downregulation of METTL7A and upregulation of CXCL14 had been found to be associated with the worst OS [105, 106] . Most crucially, CXCL14 was reported to be involved in the progression of LC from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [106] . Therefore, it may also be a key determinant in transforming the COVID-19 into LC metastasis. We observed that the PPARGC1A is downregulated in COVID-19 and is associated with a poor LC prognosis. Further, we identified PPARGC1A as a hub-protein in COVID-19 and LC. A previous study suggests PPARGC1A as a potential biomarker in LC prognosis [54] . Therefore, other identified hubs could also be potential biomarkers in COVID-19 and LC prognosis. However, unlike in this study, the upregulation of PPARGC1A facilitates LC metastasis [54] . Likewise, COVID-19 results in IRF7 overexpression, which was subsequently found to deteriorate the LC prognosis. Nevertheless, an early study suggested that the silencing of IRF7 may increase the virus-mediated killing of LC cells, therefore, better survival outcome [58] . Furthermore, IFITM1 is upregulated in COVID-19 and LC metastasis [107] . Proliferation, migration and invasion in LC can be inhibited by silencing the IFITM1 gene suggested in a previous in vitro study [107] . Therefore, genes that are related to poor LC outcomes can be targeted to hinder/stop the development of LC following the COVID-19 as well as to ameliorate the OS outcome.",

Using the network-based approach, we identified important proteins, regulatory molecules, signaling pathways and gene ontologies as well as other potential risk factors. While these networks may reveal important diseasemodifying elements as potential drug targets, the signaling pathways can unfold important molecular checkpoints for the development of novel therapeutics in COVID-19 eradication. The identified biomarkers can be utilized to design new diagnostic tools and as drug targets based on their role in the progression of diseases. Furthermore, as suggested by the prognostic analysis, poor survival outcome in LC patients may result due to the altered gene expression caused by SARS-CoV infection. These genes can be silenced to inhibit the LC progression and to ameliorate the overall prognosis. Nevertheless, the feasibility to use and/or target the genetic determinants in fighting the pandemic requires further experimental validation.",
