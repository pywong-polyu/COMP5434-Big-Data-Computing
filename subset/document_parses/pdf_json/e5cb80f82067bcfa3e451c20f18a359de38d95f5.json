The virus is transmitted through human-to-human contact after its introduction from the enzootic cycle [1] . EBOV disease (EVD) outbreaks cause significant human and societal impacts, including high mortality rates and long-term persistence in immune-privileged body sites in survivors [2] . Indirect health effects for those not infected include a reduction in uptake of reproductive, maternal, and child health services, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care, and malaria services [3] . The largest EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2013-2016 was the third Public Health Emergency of International Concern ever declared in history and prompted intensified vaccine and antiviral development.",

Additional toxicology studies, such as developmental and reproductive toxicity are performed later in development. For pandemic vaccines, it is possible to use pre-existing data supporting the vaccine platform to initiate clinical trials. For the rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP program, data from repeat-dose toxicology studies were not available when clinical development started in 2014. However, antemortem parameters were evaluated in NHP efficacy trials and safety data from other similar viral vectors (such as a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based HIV vaccine) [18] to support the start of clinical trials, and toxicology studies were performed in parallel with clinical development. In addition, the Public Health Agency of Canada and their partners published efficacy studies in NHPs with rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP that were used to support the start of clinical trials [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , and additional immunogenicity and efficacy studies in NHPs were performed in parallel with Phase 1 clinical trials to validate the selection of the vaccine dose used in Phase 2 and 3 clinical efficacy trials.",

The Animal Rule is an alternative pathway that may be used, and approval is based on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate studies in animals without adequate and well-controlled efficacy trials in humans.

In some cases, process technologies that supported earlier licensure were chosen in lieu of options that were more advanced but required more time to develop. Key manufacturing process parameters such as the cell line, virus strain, drug substance production platform, and drug product platform were maintained identical or as close as possible to the clinical scale process, reducing the time required to lock in a process for regulatory submission. In a traditional development paradigm, the initial clinical process might undergo further development to optimize the process with these changes requiring additional clinical studies. For rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP drug substance (i.e., bulk vaccine), a roller bottle production system that was used to produce early clinical material, which was more manual but well-characterized, was maintained and the number of bottles scaled up to ensure adequate capacity. For drug products (i.e., vaccine filled into single-or multi-dose vials), the frozen formulation used throughout clinical development, including efficacy studies, was maintained. Although lyophilized or liquid formulations, in principle, offer benefits for cold chain storage, the development of a new formulation requires significant efforts and there are often technical challenges with developing thermostable formulations for viral vaccines. Furthermore, to show equivalency of any new formulation to the existing frozen formulation would require additional preclinical and clinical testing. Ultimately, the frozen formulation supported the short-term goal to achieve licensure as quickly as possible but represented a tradeoff for the longer-term benefits of a lyophilized or liquid formulation that would not require long-term storage at \u221270 \u2022 C.",

However, macaques are the animal model of choice for evaluating immunogenicity and efficacy of EBOV vaccines (Table 1) [28, 29] because EBOV infection in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques is similar to infection in humans in terms of disease symptoms, day of onset, clinical measurements, and outcome; and NHPs are susceptible to lethal infection with wild-type strains of EBOV. Prior to the initiation of rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP Phase 1 studies during the 2013-2016 outbreak, several NHP studies were conducted with non-GMP research-grade rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP in a stringent NHP model for vaccine efficacy, where a 1000 plaque-forming units (pfu) intramuscular (IM) challenge dose resulted in 100% lethality in unvaccinated cynomolgus macaques [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . In cynomolgus macaques, a single inoculation of researchgrade vaccine (at~1 \u00d7 10 7 pfu) given by different routes (IM, oral, intranasal) was shown to protect against illness, viremia, and death after challenge with a high dose of EBOV (1000 pfu, generally thought to represent 100-1000 times the lethal dose [median lethal dose; LD 50 ] in experimental animal studies). Non-immunized controls all developed illness, high viremia, and succumbed to infection within 10 days of the challenge. These studies demonstrated that a single immunization with rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP is highly immunogenic and effective in protection against EVD and death in the NHP model [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

Additionally, it was unknown whether clinical trials conducted during an unpredictable EVD outbreak would be able to attain sufficient EVD cases to demonstrate efficacy. These unknowns were shared for all vaccines under development; and a workshop was convened in December 2014, co-sponsored by the FDA, the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the US Department of Defense, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, to discuss EBOV immunology in the context of vaccine development, clinical evaluation, and regulatory decision-making [31] . Without data demonstrating the correlates of protection for any of the vaccines, binding and neutralizing antibody assays and other functional antibody and cell-mediated immunity assays were proposed for development in both NHP studies and clinical trials to compare immune responses across species. If efficacy could not be demon-strated in late-phase clinical trials, these data would be especially important, enabling the pursuit of the Accelerated Approval Pathway or Animal Rule for licensure.",

Despite these potential differences between vaccine platforms and responses, it was agreed that standardized assessment of immunogenicity of the vaccines was needed as part of a global health response for EVD through a collaborative effort among government organizations and the vaccine industry. The Filovirus Animal Non-Clinical Group (FANG), co-led by a US government interdepartmental and interagency group assisted the collaboration effort, with the Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCS)-Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) leading the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay development and validation effort.

MSD worked closely with MCS-JVAP and other partners (including The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Battelle Memorial Institute, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and several vaccine developers) to assess the human ELISA reagents for detection of antibodies against EBOV GP in NHP samples using the same assay method as used for human samples. A single assay was implemented for both human and NHP samples once the FANG human ELISA was shown to have comparable assay performance for detection of NHP anti-GP antibodies. The validation process for the assay with human samples, conducted at two contract research organizations, and a subsequent validation to assess the performance of the assay with NHP samples, took nearly two years to complete [35, 36] .

Vaccine viral RNA persisted primarily in lymphoid tissues by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction throughout the duration of the study (112 days) (data on file, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA). A subsequent plaque assay detected replication-competent virus limited to day 1 post-vaccination. There was no evidence of viral replication at any other time point measured (days 56, 84, and 112).

            "text": "Due to the rapidly advancing EVD outbreak in western Africa in 2014, a decision on the potency of a vaccine dose was made as soon as the initial Phase 1 clinical trial results became available. This was based on safety, immunogenicity, and that animal challenge studies were expected to be efficacious in humans. Instead of studying this dose potency in Phase 2 proof of concept trials (as in a typical development program), the selected dose was used in Phase 2/3 clinical trials in the countries affected by the outbreak. Data from all relevant clinical trials (e.g., with a final formulation and at the final dose) should be summarized to comprehensively assess safety, and if possible, these data should be integrated with the MAA to facilitate the presentation of a single point estimate for the frequency of adverse reactions and to optimize the ability to look for rare serious adverse events [54] . Variations in the trial designs throughout the rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP clinical development program (e.g., open-label versus blinded, utilizing or not utilizing memory aids, varying durations, different CSR MedDRA version) were a major limiting factor in the ability to integrate safety data ( Table 2) . Differences in geographical regions (e.g., Africa only versus Europe/North America only), outbreak and trial setting circumstances (e.g., outbreak versus non-outbreak, community versus clinical settings), and methods for data collection (e.g., phone contact with participants versus in-person visits) were also limitations to safety data integration. Of note, the trials were not designed or conducted with the final objective of data integration, but ultimately, it was feasible to integrate serious adverse event (SAE) data from blinded trials because of the more uniform detection methods for SAEs across trials ( Table 2 ). The discrepancies in the safety data collection methods represent a drawback to conducting many trials sponsored by different parties in parallel. The advantage was the speed to completion of the clinical trial program. If 12 clinical trials with standardized safety data collection methods were conducted by a single sponsor, it could have resulted in the clinical development program lasting 5-10 years longer due to resource constraints, rather than the approximate four years in which the rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP clinical program was conducted. These tradeoffs must be carefully weighed and considered when developing a vaccine for pathogens with pandemic potential.",

Ultimately, all partners used a collaborative approach to facilitate the use of validated immunogenicity testing in a binding GP-ELISA and functional neutralizing PRNT in the Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL), Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE), Guinea Front Line Worker (FLW), and lot consistency clinical trials, which allowed for the assessment and integration of immunogenicity data from the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, the three countries most impacted by the 2013-2016 EVD outbreak (Figure 3 and Table 3 ).

The ring design of Ebola \u04aaa Suffit maximized the declining number of EVD cases by clustering vaccination around all reported cases in real time as they were identified and then randomizing those clusters to either immediate vaccination or vaccination delayed by 21 days [24] . Simply stated, the WHO brought the trial to the cases rather than setting up clinics and waiting for those cases to occur. This unique design allowed for the evaluation of the efficacy of rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP at the individual participant level, in addition to an assessment of the effectiveness of ring vaccination as a containment strategy. Moreover, it demonstrated that it was possible to conduct a randomized trial during the outbreak despite substantial opposition to this type of trial by stakeholders involved in the response [56] . Since the immune responses in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea were similar, it was possible to extrapolate those results to the separate population in Guinea that was included in the Ebola \u04aaa Suffit trial, in which efficacy results were obtained, but due to logistical reasons, no immunogenicity specimens were collected [24] . Although it was not possible to assess immune correlates of protection (i.e., determine which immune response in the Ebola \u04aaa Suffit efficacy clinical trial was associated with protection) at the individual level, an immune correlate of protection was assessed at the population level by describing point estimates of efficacy in the Ebola \u04aaa Suffit trial and point estimates of immunogenicity in integrated data from the PREVAIL, STRIVE, and FLW trials [57] . The statistical immune correlate of protection analysis was not critical for the rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP clinical development program because human efficacy data were available, but it may be important for future generations of EBOV vaccines. Additionally, immune correlates of protection may be important to expand the indication to special populations such as children and persons infected with HIV, in whom efficacy has not yet been assessed.",

Interestingly, gamma irradiation resulted in an approximate 20% increase in non-specific binding pre-vaccination and an approximate 20% decrease in specific binding post-vaccination [58] , which had the greatest impact on the assessment of fold-increase pre-to post-vaccination and must be considered when comparing immune responses of specimens that have been irradiated (PREVAIL, STRIVE, and FLW trials) versus those that have not been irradiated (e.g., lot consistency trial). Additionally, since there was no immune correlate of protection established at the time, it was important to determine a serum status cutoff that could define seropositivity and seroresponse. Non-validated GP-ELISA results from rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP and placebo recipients in Phase 2 PREVAIL trial conducted in Liberia were assessed to determine which serum status cutoff optimally differentiated between participants that received vaccine and placebo and therefore defined seropositivity and seroresponse [50] . Based on these results, it was determined that 200 EU/mL optimally determines seropositivity and that 200 EU/mL and a two-fold rise pre-to post-vaccination optimally determines seroresponse [59] .",

These include assessments of the durability of responses, the impact of booster doses, and safety and immunogenicity in special populations, including children and HIV-positive participants. In addition, expanded access/compassionate use protocols have been extensively utilized in the context of the recent Ebola outbreaks in the DRC to provide access to the vaccine for individuals at-risk for EVD, including children as young as 6 months of age and women who are pregnant (post first trimester) or lactating. Cumulatively, these studies are greatly expanding our understanding of the performance of the vaccine and provide a model for expanding the evaluation of safe and effective vaccines for emerging viruses to vulnerable populations.

The study was sponsored by the WHO and conducted by M\u00e9decins Sans Frontieres. The study was initiated at the same time as the Ebola \u04aaa Suffit trial, but since efficacy was not assessed in this study, efforts were focused on the safety and efficacy trials for the initial license submissions. Data from the trial expanding our knowledge of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have recently been published [53] . Importantly, given the conduct of this trial in the same country and at the same time as the efficacy trial, population-based approaches to evaluate potential correlates of protection for ERVEBO TM have been assessed using the data from the trial [57] . This evaluation suggests that the GP-ELISA assay, originally established by the FANG and subsequently validated at Q 2 Solutions, correlates with protection for this vaccine, although a specific protective threshold was not defined. Evidence for a correlate of protection for rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP provides additional information for groups such as the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) as they recommend the best way to use the vaccine to have the largest public health impact. \u2022 PREPARE (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in People at Potential Occupation Risk for Ebola Virus Exposure) trial: This ongoing National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored, randomized, and controlled trial being conducted in the US and Canada evaluates the durability of immune responses to rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP in individuals who are at occupational risk of exposure to Ebola (e.g., through working in BSL-4 laboratories, etc.) and includes randomization to assess the impact of a booster dose given at 18 months.",

The trial, which is fully enrolled, includes children as young as 1 year of age. The data for the primary endpoint at one-year post-dose 1 is expected to be released soon. Additional follow-up of participants for five years post-dose 1 is planned. This study will provide critical data on the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP in pediatric populations as young as 1 year of age and is expected to serve as the basis for expanding the indication, which is currently limited to adults, to include children. \u2022 ACHIV (African-Canadian Study of HIV-Infected Adults and a Vaccine for Ebola) trial: This randomized, placebo-controlled trial is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP in HIV-positive adults and adolescents and includes the evaluation of one and two doses. This trial is sponsored by the University of Dalhousie and is being conducted in Burkina Faso, Canada, and Senegal with ongoing enrollment. Given that Ebola outbreaks may overlap with areas of high HIV prevalence, understanding the safety and immunogenicity of rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP in these populations is very important. It is noteworthy to say that this trial has been temporarily paused due to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the complexity of conducting clinical trials in the context of outbreaks. \u2022 Expanded access protocols related to the Ebola outbreaks in the DRC: Working with the Ministries of Health and local researchers, WHO has implemented expanded access protocols in the DRC, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Burundi. These protocols are designed to provide access to individuals at potential risk of EVD by virtue of being a contact or contact of contacts for a case of EVD or being a healthcare provider or FLW in a region involved in an active outbreak or in a neighboring region that is at risk of spread. These protocols have been extensively used as part of the Ebola response to the recent outbreaks in the DRC (beginning with the Equateur Province outbreak in May 2018). Through these protocols, more than 300,000 individuals have been vaccinated in the DRC, including children as young as 6 months of age and women who are pregnant (post first trimester) or lactating [60] . In addition, more than 14,000 individuals have been vaccinated in the neighboring countries. Data from these expanded access efforts are expected to provide information on safety in these important populations and to provide information on the effectiveness of the vaccine, potentially including information on the durability of protection for rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP. The data generated through these expanded access efforts are much closer to \"real world\" data and will be an important complement to the data generated through randomized controlled trials.",

A coordinated global effort was required to acquire a large safety database from multiple clinical trials with diverse populations, during which time manufacturing processes were developed, and doses were supplied to public health agencies for use in response to ongoing EVD outbreaks. The expansion of vaccine manufacturing infrastructure globally is critical for ensuring the ability of the global public health community to respond to emerging infectious disease threats as quickly as possible. In addition, efforts are ongoing to better understand the safety, immunogenicity, and utility of rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP in additional populations not studied in the initial clinical development program.",
