In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of reduced doses of Ad26.COV2.S. 30 rhesus macaques were immunized once with 1x10 11 , 5x10 10 , 1.125x10 10 , or 2x10 9 vp Ad26.COV2.S or sham and were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes. Vaccine doses as low as 2x10 9 vp provided robust protection in bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas doses of 1.125x10 10 vp were required for protection in nasal swabs. Activated memory B cells as well as binding and neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not show evidence of virologic, immunologic, histopathologic, or clinical enhancement of disease compared with sham controls. These data demonstrate that a single immunization with a relatively low dose of Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Moreover, our findings show that a higher vaccine dose may be required for protection in the upper respiratory tract compared with the lower respiratory tract.",

These data have raised the possibility that protection against asymptomatic infection may be more difficult to achieve than protection against severe pneumonia in humans. However, the role of vaccine dose in protection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts has not previously been defined. Moreover, suboptimal vaccine doses can be utilized to assess the theoretical concern of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), although VAERD has not been reported to date in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies in animals or humans.",

We assessed viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and nasal swabs (NS) by RT-PCR specific for subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA), which is believed to measure replicating virus 13,17 . All 10 sham controls were infected and showed a mean peak of 4.45 (range 3.2-6.5) log10 sgRNA copies/ml in BAL (Fig. 4A) .

Similarly, all sham controls showed a mean peak of 5.68 (range 3.8-6.9) log10 sgRNA in NS (Fig. 4B ). In contrast with limited viral breakthroughs in the BAL, 80% (4 of 5) of animals in the 2x10 9 vp group, 40% (2 of 5) of animals in the 1.125x10 10 vp group, and 20% (1 of 5) of animals in the 5x10 10 vp group showed viral breakthroughs in NS (Fig. 4B) . These data suggest that a higher vaccine dose may be required for protection in the upper respiratory tract compared with protection in the lower respiratory tract. Suboptimal vaccine dose levels led to loss of protection in NS but did not result in enhanced virus replication compared with the sham controls.

After staining, cells were washed and fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde. All data were acquired on a BD FACSymphony flow cytometer.
