Patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis (PMF) on JAK2 inhibitors could have a worse outcome if they become infected with the virus; however, the effect of JAK inhibitors increasing of SARS-Cov-2 infection is unknown (23) . On the other hand, the abrupt cessation of JAK2 inhibitor (ruxolitinib) may result in progressive disease or rarely cytokine storm which worsens the clinical course of SARS-Cov-2 infection, and it has been suggested that ruxolitinib it can be a possible therapy for cytokines storm in critically ill COVID-19 patients (24) . Given the base line increased risk and frequenting of thromboembolic complications in MPNs and advanced stage COVID-19 patients, it is necessary to reduce hematocrit <45%. And to maintain a WBC <10 \u00d7 10 9 /L and platelet <400 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Cytoreductive therapy should be maintain if there is a history or an active thromboembolic or hemorrhagic event (25) . Patients on phlebotomy for PV can maintain it but decreasing the frequency is considered. Because of unclear situation with MPNs, cytoreduction (hydroxyurea, IFN, anagrelide. . . .) should not be adjusted. For PMF patients the management must be established according to know prognostic factors which can be evaluated by MIPSS or DIPSS plus or equivalent (26). JAK2 inhibitors therapy such as ruxolitinib could be given if clinical situation allows. If ruxolitinib needs to be stopped, careful tapering must be done (25) .",

Subcutaneous administration at home of bortezomib is preferred to limit hospital admissions. Oral triplet regimen could be used as an alternative (e.g., ixazomib, lenalidomide, dexamethazone). If stem cell transplant is differed, first line therapy could be prolonged to 6-8 cycles; then, patients could be continued on oral regimen consolidation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, especially those with stable disease and with standard cytogenetic risk. Maintenance therapy can be done with lenalidomide alone (50) (51) (52) . For transplant ineligible patients, regimens like Rd (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) and DRd (daratunumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone) could be administered depending on cytogenetic risk and comorbidities; however, doses of daratumumab should be given at a less intensive schedule. For these patients de-escalating steroids after six cycles should be considered. Oral regimens particularly ixazomib based can be given (50, 53, 54) .",
