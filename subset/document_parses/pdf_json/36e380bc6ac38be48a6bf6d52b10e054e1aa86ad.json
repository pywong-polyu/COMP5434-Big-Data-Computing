And the test is based on the mechanism of specifi c immune response in human body to the antigen, eggs of schistosoma. Mature miracidium in schistosoma eggs can secrete soluble egg antigen (SEA), which exudates from micropores in the eggshell to attach to the surface of eggshell and binds to the antibody in the to-bedetected serum. The antigen-antibody complex deposites are thus formed around the eggshell, which are shown as bubble like or fi nger shaped deposits on the surface of eggs under a microscope. Such a fi nding indicates positive. In the serum of a healthy human body, no specifi c deposits can be observed around eggs due to absence of corresponding antibody, which is defi ned as negative.

One type is applied to detect and localize the antigen or antibody in tissues and cells, which is known as immunohistochemistry or immunoenzymatic staining. The other type is applied to detect soluble antigen or antibody in various body fl uids, which is known as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA). After preparation of specimen, immunoenzymatic staining is performed with the following procedures: inhibition of the endogenous enzymes and the following immunoenzymatic staining for examination. Its basic principle and procedures are the same as those of fl uorescence antibody method, only with enzyme to replace fl uorescein as the marker and emergence of colored substances in the substrate as positive. Routine immunoenzymatic staining can be further categorized in to direct and indirect staining. Direct staining is performed to label specifi c antibody with enzyme for direct detection of parasite or its antigen. After fi xation of the specimen containing parasite or its antigen, the inside endogenous enzymes are fi rstly inhibited. After that, enzyme labelled antibody is directly added for its binding to the antigen in the specimen, followed by addition of substrate for coloration and microscopic examination. Indirect staining is performed by processing of the tissues or cells containing parasite or its antigen with specifi c antibody for binding of the antigen to the antibody. The unbinding components are cleansed and eliminated, followed by addition of enzyme labelled antibody for formation of antigen-antibody-enzyme-labeled-antibody complex. Finally, the substrate is added for coloration and microscopic examination. Although with additional one step, the indirect staining shows higher specifi city and has gained wider application. The second enzyme labelled antibody can be replaced by staphylococcal protein A (SPA) or biotin-avidin system, which has also be successfully applied to detect many antigens and antibodys. Meanwhile, both specifi city and sensitivity of the staining have been increased by varying degrees. ELIZA can be further categorized into solid-phase ELISA and homogeneous ELISA. Solid-phase ELISA is to chemically or physically link antigen or antibody to a solid phase carrier to prepare an immunosorbent for immunoenzymatic assay. ELIZA is the most widely used solid phase immunoenzymatic assay. Homogeneous ELISA is applied to directly detect antigen or antibody in the solution with no isolation of the free enzyme marker from the binding enzyme marker and no use of solid phase carrier.

In addition, the procedure should show high sensitivity and specifi city, which requires simple procedures for labelling and detection and the labeled marker can be preserved for a long period of time. It also should not contaminate the environment and do no harm to human health, with a low cost. The applicable markers include radioactive markers such as 32 P, 3 H, 35 S and non-radioactive markers such as biotin, digoxin and enzymes. The radioactive markers are highly sensitive and specifi c, but their use requires special safety procedures in addition to their contamination to the environment and a short half-life period. Non-radioactive markers are free of contamination and special safety procedures, with favorable stability for prolonged preservation. However, they are inferior to radioactive isotopes in term of sensitivity and specifi city. The labeling of probe can be categorized into in vivo labeling and in vitro labeling. In vitro labeling is more commonly applied, including chemical labeling and enzymatic labeling.",

The molecular hybridization of nucleic acid can be categorized into solid-phase hybridiza-tion and liquid-phase hybridization based on the medium and responsive environment. Solid-phase hybridization is achieved by fi rst fi xation of one nucleic acid chain on a solid support while the other chain is free in liquid. It has gained wide application due to the simplicity in operations. Liquidphase hybridization, however, refers to the test procedure that two nucleic acid chains participating in hybridation are free in liquid, with rapid hybridation. Liquid-phase hybridation is commonly applied together with nucleic acid electron microscopy to study the homogeneity of different DNA and the relationship between mRNA and chromosomal DNA. Liquid-phase hybridization can be classifi ed into Southern blotting, Northern blotting and Western bloting based on different target of identifi cation. Southern blotting is employed to analyze recombinant DNA, recombinant plasmid and bacteriophage, while Northern blotting is used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of RNA. Western blotting is applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis of proteins and their interactive effect.

Many sample molecules are needed in detection, and the sample is commonly amplifi ed before labelling and analysis in order to improve the sensitivity of reading. As for the isolated genomic DNA, direct amplifi cation by PCR can be performed, while as for mRNA, cDNA should be fi rstly prepared by using RT-PCR. Many materials can be used to label the sample to be detected, such as Cy3, Cy5, biotin, and radioactive isotope 32 P. The labelling of sample refers to the process that dNTP carrying marker, such as Cy3 or Cy5-dNTP, biotin-dNTP, 32 P-dNTP, is interfused into target molecule sequence via amplifi cation of DNA or cDNA. Otherwise, the dNTP carrying marker is interfused into the target molecule sequence during synthesis of primer, which is then used to amplify the target sequence, with the terminal of amplifi ed product labelled. Fluorescence labeling is more commonly employed, which is based on the fact that the labeled molecules can be activated by laser to emit fl uorescence within specifi c wave length. Therefore, the sample containing labeled molecules can be detected. This approach does not require labeling by isotope but with extremely high sensitivity and is applicable for quantitative detection. Therefore, it is widely applied in labeling of samples on gene chip.",

After the non-hybridized molecules are fl ushed away (the procedure can be omitted when real-time fl uorescence is used), a fl uorescence microscope is used to scan the gene chip to collect fl uorescence intensity of each site for comparative analysis. As double strands with normal base pairing show more favorable thermal stability than double-strands with mismatched base pairing, fl uorescence signal intensity of the double strands with well matched base pairing is 5-35 times as high as that double strands probe with one or two mismatched base pairing. Additionally, the intensity of fl uorescence signal shows certain linear relationship with the quantity of target molecule in the sample. Therefore, precise detection of fl uorescence signal intensity can demonstrate the specifi city and intensity of hybridization.

Each sequencing is consisted of 4 independent reactions in a series. And each reaction contains all 4 dNTPs with addition of limited quantity of different ddNTP. Due to the absence of necessary 3-OH group in ddNTP extension, the extending oligonucleotides are terminated selectively at site G, A, T or C, which is determined by corresponding dideoxy in reaction. The relative concentration of each dNTP and ddNTP can be adjusted to obtain a chain termination product with bases ranging from hundreds to thousands. They share common starting point, but terminate at different nucleotides, and can be separated into fragments in different sizes via high resolution denaturing gel electrophoresis. After that, X-ray fi lm autoradiography or non-isotope labeling can be applied for their detection. The chemical modifi cation sequencing proposed by Maxam and Gilbert is based on the fact that certain chemical reagent can induce base modifi cation at specifi c site (or specifi c type of base) in DNA strand, with following base shedding or replacement and fi nally occurrence of specifi c rupture.
