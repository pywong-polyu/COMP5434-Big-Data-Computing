The ANR further expanded its commitment by including COVID-19 as a research priority in its 2021 funding plan. The ANRS opened a call for projects dedicated to low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). The Fondation de France, the Public Hospitals of Paris (AP-HP) and the Institut Pasteur coordinated efforts to support health care workers and hospital first response, and to fund research projects on COVID-19 detection, treatment and prevention through a community-based solidarity initiative \"All united against the virus\", launched in March 2020. National and interregional PHRC programs funded the implementation of 58 clinical studies. Overall, nearly 100 research projects on pharmaceutical treatments and more than 300 on non-pharmaceutical interventions were launched within the first six months of the pandemic, facilitated by a pivotal shortening of authorization delays through fast-track procedures. Pharmaceutical treatments tested included several classes of repositioned antivirals, anti-inflammatory drugs to contrast the excessive inflammatory response and anti-coagulants to prevent thrombotic events observed in COVID-19 patients.",

The crisis response has been extensive but scattered on various fronts, suffering from an important lack of coordination between funding agencies and between researchers and decision-makers, and from the lack of readiness in the research community to mobilize funding and human resources. The situation assessment documents released in June and July 2020 consequently proposed actions to implement and consolidate a coordinated crisis response in the short and long term. For instance, the Rossignol report Analysis of the first 135,000 questionnaires and 12,000 serological samples determined the adult population in metropolitan France that had been exposed to the virus (4.5%) and its socio-demographic characteristics [9] .",

To this aim, the SAPRIS study, a nationwide survey coordinated by Inserm and Sant\u00e9 publique France, was launched in April 2020 involving 200,000 participants from four pre-existing national general population cohorts. The main questions focused on COVID-19 symptoms, consultations for other pathologies, perception of risk, and effects of preventive measures on daily life, among others. These data were integrated with serological testing of participants to evaluate national seroprevalence and its correlation with socio-demographic factors. EpiCov and SAPRIS data were further exploited by the COVIDSM study, sponsored by Inserm in April 2021, and aimed at evaluating the impact of the health crisis on the population's mental health. Lastly, several mathematical modelling studies have been implemented since the early days of the pandemic, exploiting data such as disease prevalence, infection rates, or mobile phone data tracking population behaviors [10, 11] . This approach allowed, among others, to characterize and anticipate the impact of public health interventions, from lockdown and school closure to mass screening and vaccination strategies, on disease control or epidemic rebounds [12, 13] . The public health studies described so far, along with many others promptly implemented, helped define control and mitigation strategies. Hence, recommendations were issued by national public health authorities to contain infections while preserving individual health.",

A crucial take-home message from the last 18 months must be that proper development of research infrastructure, organized management of financial means and coordination of a common response of scientists, health professionals, regulating agencies and political actors must be the cornerstone in times of preparedness as much as it has been in times of crisis.",

            "text": "From the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, French research institutions were strongly mobilized to accelerate research on the virus and the disease. The REACTing consortium (REsearch and ACTion targeting emerging infectious diseases), coordinated by the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) and assembling members of the French National Alliance for Life Sciences and Health (Aviesan), was solicited to coordinate the early national research response on SARS-CoV-2 by the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation (MESRI) and the French Ministry of Solidarity and Health (MSS). In this context, a COVID-19 Scientific Council was promptly set up in January 2020 by REACTing to support authorities on strategic issues of epidemic management. However, REACTing did not have the adequate means or leverages nor the full mandate to fully accomplish the national research coordination task at later stages of the pandemic. In late March 2020 the COVID-19 Analysis, Research and Expertise Committee (CARE) was set up to support REACTing, informing public authorities on scientific, therapeutic, and technological innovations proposed by the scientific community. The REACTing COVID-19 Scientific Council defined French priority research areas, accordingly to research priorities identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response (GLOPID-R) in February 2020 [2]. Hence, monitoring of infected populations and diagnosis, epidemiological modelling, fundamental research, vaccine and therapeutic clinical research, and social sciences were primarily targeted. In February 2020, REACTing COVID-19 Scientific Council awarded seed funding provided by the government to 20 research projects selected according to national priorities, for a total budget of \u20ac1M. The overall effort of the French research community was thereafter supported by established national funding institutions and programs, such as the French National Research Agency (ANR), the National Research Agency on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis (ANRS), the Hospital Clinical Research Program (PHRC), and private for-profit and non-profit organizations, research institutes and foundations. The ANR, in synergy with MESRI, opened two funding calls in spring 2020, supporting 234 research projects on disease pathophysiology,",

            "text": "[4], commissioned by the MSS and published in June 2020, proposed the implementation of an ad-hoc National Steering Committee for Therapeutic Trials and Other Research (CAPNET) as a key measure to prioritize and accelerate high-potential clinical research projects. The CAPNET, launched in November 2020, relies on scientific evaluation of research projects by the REACTing COVID-19 Scientific Council to award a National Research Priority label to high-potential proposals in line with national priorities, fostering accelerated regulatory procedures and access to institutional funding. Another key action resulting from evaluations of the French scene was merging REACTing with the ANRS, in January 2021, to form the ANRS|Emerging Infectious Diseases, an autonomous coordination and funding agency within Inserm. The aim was to set the basis for national research coordination and preparedness on emerging infectious diseases, and on existing ones previously managed by the ANRS, by relying on the established infrastructure of the agency and by further fueling it with human resources and financial means. Although we are convinced that, given its research expertise, France could have implemented a much better response, the actions described above resulted in the implementation of relevant research projects and important achievements, some of which are important for the future. Representative examples are described below (Figure 1). As the first COVID-19 outbreak evolved, understanding the viral epidemiology and transmission dynamics became compelling. Several cohorts, population surveys and serologic complementary studies were implemented in France to address this need. As the first COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in February 2020, the CoV-Contact observational cohort was set up to evaluate individual factors associated with COVID-19 development after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and was coordinated by Inserm in collaboration with the AP-HP and funded by a grant from the European Commission. This study determined early on that health professionals were at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, paving the path to targeted infection control measures [5]. ComCor, a nation-wide survey-based epidemiological study coordinated by Institut Pasteur in collaboration with the French National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), the National Public Health Agency (Sant\u00e9 publique France), and the Ipsos Social Research Institute, was launched in October 2020 and counted 160,000 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection as of April 2021. ComCor included two branches aiming to describe circumstances of infection of index cases who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during implementation of national curfews, and comparing characteristics, behaviors and practices of index cases with those of matched individuals. The study group published two analyses, in December 2020 [6] and March 2021 [7], identifying factors associated with increased or decreased risk of infections, including specific environments and individual behaviors. In February 2021, the ComCor group expanded its studies to vaccination history and vaccine efficacy against variants of concern [8]. In spring 2020, Inserm and the Directorate for Research, Studies, Evaluation and Statistics (DREES) of the Ministry of Solidarity and Health developed a large epidemiological study, EPICOV, based on surveys and serological testing of a representative sample of randomly selected individuals, aiming to define the immunological status of the general population.",

            "text": "AZD7442 monoclonal antibody combination since in April 2021. EU-Response will coordinate with RECOVER (Rapid European COVID-19 Emergency Response research), an EU-funded project aiming to undertake clinical research in primary and hospital care, epidemiological and biological investigations, and modelling studies to fill knowledge gaps on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and transmission. Besides, France will participate in the European project Orchestra, which aims to establish an international network of cohorts for the conduct of retrospective and prospective studies on prevention and treatment of COVID-19, and to be better prepared for future pandemics.At a national level, an outstanding number of clinical trials were implemented in France aiming both at managing the clinical progression of mild and severe forms of the disease, and at identifying antiviral molecules active against SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized populations, the CORIMUNO-19 platform, sponsored by the AP-HP, implemented various therapeutic studies such as CORIPLASM, for convalescent plasma testing, CORIMMUNO-ANA-1 for anakinra, and CORIMUNO-TOCI-1 for tocilizumab. Although these studies did not show efficacy of anakinra in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia[21], they were among the first demonstrating a potential efficacy of tocilizumab in limiting worsening of clinical conditions in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19[22]. Of note, an effort was also made to promote clinical trials in outpatients. For instance, COVERAGE, sponsored by Bordeaux hospital, tested therapies such as the anti-hypertensive telmisartan or inhaled glucocorticoid ciclesonide for clinical management of mild disease. Targeted populations were COVID-19 outpatients aged over 60,or over 50 at risk of developing severe disease. Furthermore, in March 2021 the French National Drug Safety Agency (ANSM) granted a cohort temporary authorization of use (ATU) to antiviral monoclonal antibody cocktails (mAb) as early treatment for patients at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. Their use is regulated by strict conditions developed jointly by the ANSM, the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses, and the ANRS|Emerging Infectious Diseases. More precisely, the ANSM authorized two mAb dual therapies, casirivimab/imdevimab co-developed by Regeneron Pharmaceutical and Roche, and bamlanivimab/etesevimab by Eli Lilly. The CocoPrev cohort was therefore established by the ANRS|Emerging Infectious Diseases to evaluate the effects of these two mAb cocktails on COVID-19 outpatients and their impact on variant emergence. Nevertheless, as no decisive therapy for COVID-19 or related complications exists yet, the need for a COVID-19 vaccine has been compelling. An unprecedented effort on vaccine research and development allowed approval of the first COVID-19 vaccines via emergency use authorization within 11 months from viral sequence publication. To date, 19 COVID-19 vaccines based on different technologies including mRNA platforms, adenoviral vectors or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus are approved or authorized for emergency use across the world. The WHO further counts 292 new vaccines in the pipeline, 108 of which in clinical phases. To promptly develop a COVID-19 vaccine, France relied on major pharmaceutical companies: Sanofi Pasteur, Valneva, and Merck who collaborated with Institut Pasteur. Sanofi Pasteur leading vaccine candidate is an adjuvanted recombinant subunit vaccine, developed in collaboration with American authorities. Technical issues related to antigen concentration [23] led to delays in its clinical development, postponing expected authorization to end of 2021. Valneva is currently carrying out a phase III clinical trial of their inactivated adjuvanted vaccine with financial support of the United Kingdom, aiming at authorization by the British regulatory authorities by fall 2021. Merck and Institut Pasteur interrupted their research in January 2021 due to unconclusive results in phase I trial [24]. France further contributed to COVID-19 vaccine research efforts by supporting second-generation candidate development. Three high potential academic projects led by the Vaccine Research Institute (VRI), the Institut Pasteur of Lille, and the CEA-LETI/Inserm, respectively, received MESRI funding to accelerate their development. Moreover, the NANO-SARS-CoV-2 project, led by Tours University, was awarded an ANR grant for vaccine preclinical development, and evolution to human clinical trials is expected for 2022. The vaccine candidate from Institut Pasteur-TheraVectys Common Lab has recently shown to provide sterilizing protection in animal models [25], opening the path to clinical development. Lastly, BPI France has supported two vaccine candidates primarily targeting T cell immunity, developed by French biotech companies OSIVAX and OSE, respectively. Today, French vaccine clinical research relies on the COVIREIVAC platform, established in April 2020 and based on the pre-existing vaccine research network I-REIVAC, coordinated by Inserm and funded by the MSS ad MESRI. To date, COVIREIVAC includes 37 clinical investigation centers, a network of 11 immunology laboratories and counts over 40,000 volunteers for trials. COVIREIVAC hosts ENSEMBLE 2, a phase III clinical trial sponsored by Janssen to assess safety and efficacy of a two-dose regimen of their vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S. Three major academic studies are also hosted by COVIREIVAC: ARNCombi, CoviCompare and COV-POPART. ARNCombi compares immunological efficacy of the homologous two-dose standard vaccine regimen with the same mRNA vaccine with that of an heterologous regimen combining two different mRNA vaccines. CoviCompare program evaluates immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccines in the over 65 population compared to young adults. A phase II trial series, CoviCompare is currently testing mRNA vaccines and will soon include other available vaccine platforms, aiming to tailor their use to the population type by investigating optimal efficacy. The national vaccination cohort COV-POPART [26] aims to evaluate immune response induced by COVID-19 vaccines in immunodeficient or immunosuppressed populations, and to identify and characterize vaccine failures and the role of SARS-CoV-2 viral variants on them. As SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic evolve, research is developing accordingly. Noteworthily, as new and highly transmissible viral variants emerged, the EMERGEN consortium was set up in January 2021 by the ANRS|Emerging Infectious Diseases and Sant\u00e9 publique France to implement genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and in the longterm of other emerging pathogens. It also aims to promote related research projects, such as biological studies in animal models, clinical studies, mathematical modelling studies or wastewater screenings. In the clinical setting, SEVASAR was launched in March 2021 to evaluate whether the Alpha variant, first identified in the United Kingdom, is associated to specific or more severe clinical manifestations. In addition, as the pandemic is progressively controlled and societies seek to safely going back to normality, research responds with projects to monitor and control viral spread during cultural and sporting events. For instance, projects have been implemented to study SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the context of a live concert (AMBITION Live Again, sponsored by the AP-HP), or of a sporting event (COVID ESO for participant athletes, sponsored by Lyon Hospital). Finally, the French global research strategy to fight SARS-CoV-2 also prioritized collaborations with LMICs. Nearly 100 funded projects were identified covering a wide range of research areas from public health to fundamental and clinical research and to social sciences. A relevant example is the implementation in 2021 of AFROSCREEN, coordinated by the ANRS|Emerging infectious diseases, in partnership with the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) and the Pasteur Network, and funded by the French Agency for Development (AFD). The objective of this project, implemented in 13 African partner countries, is to build laboratory capacity to improve the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants, allowing their adequate control in the short-term, and overall genomic surveillance on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the long-term. AFROSCREEN generated projects such as AphroCoV, launched by REACTing in March 2020, and ARIACOV and REPAIR, commenced in October 2020 by the IRD and Institut Pasteur, respectively. These projects aimed at strengthening laboratory human and technical resources for early diagnostic and appropriate patient care of COVID-19 cases, and reinforcing quantitative and qualitative data collection mechanisms, in African partner countries. The projects described so far represent a non-exhaustive list of clinical research efforts in response to the COVID-19 crisis. However, the atlas of implemented research projects of all scientific disciplines is much broader. To assess how French research contributed to tackling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we performed a cross-sectional study of articles published on COVID-19 as of June 2021 through a bibliometric analysis. The research targeted all articles and letters on the Web of Science platform containing SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 or equivalent terms, and was further filtered by country of author affiliation. This research retrieved 97,348 articles on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, regardless of their country of publication. For reference, a total of 3,501,266 publications, all topics and countries included, were counted in the same timeframe. Regarding the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19-related publications per country, if we only consider the number of publications regardless of the real-world impact of trials, France ranked tenth (3.9%) preceded by the United States of America (26.6%), China (13%), Italy (10%), England (9%), India (6.5%), Spain (5%), Germany (4.7%), Canada (4.2%), and Australia (4%) (",

Of note, the contribution of French research to global scientific research during the COVID-19 crisis compares to that of non-pandemic times (3.8%), representing a steady commitment of the scientific community. Among SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19-related articles, 3,847 report a French affiliation of the authors. When considering high-impact journals that fall in the first quartile of all journals based on their impact factor, France ranks second, following the Netherlands. Of the 3,847 articles mentioning a French affiliation, 3,175 are registered as of June 20, 2021, in Incites, a citation-based research analytic tool.Among them, 34.8% are categorized within the top 10% and 11.4% within the top 1% of mostcited publications. Lastly, French authors co-affiliated with international partners, such as the Unites States of America (17% of publications), Italy (14%), or England (13%). Concerning research topics based on keywords and journal of publication, clinical subjects such as infectious diseases, general medicine, and critical care medicine occur as predominant, while fundamental research subjects are seemingly less developed. This is evident particularly when comparing to countries such as Germany, the Unites States of America, or the United Kingdom. However, a modest shift towards fundamental topics, namely immunology and microbiology, as well as towards public health and environmental subjects, was recently observed in France.",
