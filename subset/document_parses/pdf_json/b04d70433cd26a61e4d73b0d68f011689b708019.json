            "text": "The aim of this observational cross-sectional study was to gain information on the awareness; protective measures and economic effects of dentists in Switzerland during the global COVID-19 pandemic. All dentist were members of the Swiss Dental Association SSO from all over Switzerland-including all Swiss cantons and Liechtenstein-and received a previously calibrated questionnaire as an ad hoc online version. The questionnaire was divided into four parts: personal data; precautionary measures; awareness; perception. In total, 1324 questionnaires were analyzed; the response rate was 30.59% (n total = 4328). Participants stated in less than 2% common symptoms/signs of COVID-19; of which only fatigue was statistically significant (p < 0.01). A small number of dentists reported a positive test (0.91%; n = 12) or having one or more symptoms (2.65%; n = 35) of COVID-19 during the pandemic; whereas only 6.71% (n = 87) of the participants reported having treated SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. High prevalence areas were only medium-large and large Swiss cantons (p < 0.01). Face filter (FFP2/FFP3) masks were used by about half of the dentists, while disposable visor was rarely used. The majority of dentists had to reduce the dental practice activity to a minimum of 0-10% (n = 923; 69.98%) due to the lockdown. This economic impact forced 1.4% (n = 18) to close their practice permanently or by the end of 2020 due to the economic situation. These results can be helpful to better prepare dental practices for future outbreaks of infection (e.g., prophylactic storage of additional protective measures), define the best strategy and organize the dental workforce. Political decision-makers should consider drastic economic effects when deciding on drastic measures such as \"lockdown\", which can lead to practice closures and unemployment of dental staff after only a few weeks. This should be taken into account, especially with regard to possible financial assistance to severely impaired dental practices to maintain a high level of dental care.",

In brief, the items related to the health situation, risk, was derived from the questionnaire developed for SARS risk [9] following the Stehr-Green scale. The questionnaire was structured into four domains. The first contains personal data (such as age, sex, residential area and work status), the second contains health status (such as symptoms/indications related to COVID-19 disease) [10] , the third contains work status and personal protective equipment (PPE) adopted after the outbreak of the infection, and the fourth contains knowledge and self-perceived risk of infection. Based on these basic items, a preliminary questionnaire, translated into German and French, was prepared and developed for Switzerland and presented to a small group of dentists (n = 12). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the repetition of the test and the intra-rater reliability of each item were calculated. An ICC value of 0.80 or higher was considered satisfactory. Items with an ICC value below 0.80 were discussed by the authors and modified and adjusted according to the preliminary results.",

On 2 July, all dentists n = 4328 who were in the database of the Swiss Dental Association SSO in Switzerland and Liechtenstein-i.e., 58.77% of a total of 7364 dentists with granted licenses in the Register of Medical Professions in Switzerland (as of 31 December 2019) [12] and the Principality of Liechtenstein (n = 58; as of 2017) [13]-received an e-mail requesting their consent to participate in the questionnaire in accordance with the applicable data protection laws. All participants received a personal survey code by e-mail. After entering the code, the participant was taken to the online survey input interface, where they could enter the information directly on the computer. The personal survey code was only valid once. In addition, all information was completely coded and then anonymized. All participants were asked to declare that they had read the privacy policy and that they voluntarily agreed to the data collection and processing. Questionnaires that were not completely filled out or completed were not included in the data collection and therefore no data were collected. If they answered no, the questionnaire was automatically closed and no data were collected. The questionnaire was sent only once, a reminder was not sent. The participants were asked to respond by 6 July. Nevertheless, the questionnaire was unlocked until 15 July and then stopped. All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the local research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments, or with comparable ethical standards. Swiss law/Federal Act on Research involving Human Beings (Human Research Act) [14] does not require ethics committee approval to collect and analyze anonymous data. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants by accessing the online survey.",

The southern part of Switzerland borders on the Italian region of Lombardy, mainly in the Swiss canton of Ticino, which had the highest number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths in northern Italy at the beginning of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in early spring 2020. The sample of dentists to whom the questionnaire was sent by e-mail was more than half of the dentists in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, according to data from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and the Office for Statistics of the Principality of Liechtenstein [12, 13] . The response rate was quite low, even though the sample is quite representative for Switzerland and Liechtenstein at just under 18%. The data of this study were conducted as part of a large-scale global survey and collected with participating countries on all continents of the world [9]. These data for Switzerland were collected in cooperation with the University of Bern (Switzerland) and the Swiss Dental Association SSO. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the only study to date that collects information on awareness, protective measures and economic effects in Switzerland and Liechtenstein during the global COVID-19 pandemic [9]. Although it is not surprising that 94% of the participants have acquired information about COVID-19 in different ways, as the media coverage has been dominated by information about SARS-CoV-2 and the related disease COVID-19 for months, it is interesting to note that more than one third have acquired the information digitally via online training, which is an indication that many dental training events have been switched from presence to online as a result of the various country regulations of the pandemic. It remains to be seen how this development might change in the future. Still, no data on the health conditions of dentists with regard to COVID-19 are available to date. The percentage of people who tested positive or had COVID-19 (0.91%) in the study is similar to the areas of populations with high prevalence of COVID-19 and is in agreement with a study in the North of Italy [8] . This data could be due to a possibly higher participation rate in the survey of persons infected with the virus or with claimed symptoms/signs. However, they were reported with a relatively very low percentage of dentists (3.56%). It must be taken into consideration that the symptoms/signs were also caused by other diseases, such as seasonal influenza or other infections of viruses or even bacteria. Surprisingly, the symptoms/signs were generally around 5% and the differences between areas with different prevalence were marginal.",

There is a large discrepancy in the use of disposable visors/headset in the present survey, which was about 10-12% and 64% in northern Italy [8] . This may be due to the fact that, by declaring the area as a high prevalence area early on, dentists were very aware of the situation in Lombardy (Italy) regarding the possible risks and effects of the virus infection. Another reason could have been the different training with protective materials as well as the possible availability of such materials. In this context it should be considered that there was a worldwide shortage of protective materials due to the high daily need in many countries. The multinomial regression analysis underlined that the use of N95/FFP2 was significantly associated in the different Switzerland areas, grouped by COVID-19 prevalence. However, in Switzerland, there is no additional local/national recommendation for the use of visors or headsets in the dental practice. While dentists in the present report provided similar information on protective materials in all COVID-19 prevalence areas, in Norway, a small proportion of dental staff in high prevalence areas have been equipped with additional infection prevention measures compared to those in low and medium prevalence areas [18] .",

This is in agreement with a study in Poland with a total of 71.2% of the participating dentists that decided to entirely suspend their dental practice [19] . The main reasons for this were unpreparedness of the dental sector, shortage of personal protective equipment, subjective perception of the risk of COVID-19 infection, and a general feeling of fear and insecurity in the situation at that time [19] . Unfortunately, while the present survey did not examine the reasons for the reduction in practice activity in more detail, Poland saw a significant decrease in the number of patients treated weekly compared to before the pandemic started in March [19] . Although not examined in detail in the current study, the decrease in patient numbers during the lockdown has also been reported by dentists in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The reasons for this and the economic impact should be further investigated. The significant patient decline is also reported in a Norwegian study; twice as many patients were treated by telephone compared to clinical care [18] . This fact is also reported from China [20] , where numerous public dental hospitals stopped the elective treatment of patients and only offered emergency treatment. Almost 90% of the hospitals reported that they offered dental consultations online, 70% of which were free of charge. Long-term effects on the dental care of patients are feared by the authors in China [20] . Impacts on practice structures are possible, although currently not foreseeable and not further investigated in the current study. However, the effects on smaller practice structures such as individual practices may be different from those of larger ones, such as dental centers [21] . The uncertain situation may also have a decisive influence on the young dental profession and may also change expectations of the profession and possibly discourage the establishment of a practice in the near future, thus changing the landscape of dental professions as well as oral health care in Switzerland and Liechtenstein [22, 23] . The effects of the lack of patient flows that would have economic effects could primarily be the changeover to short-time work, reduction in working hours or even the dismissal of salaried dentists and employees. This could also lead to problems, such as unemployment in the long term, although this is not yet foreseeable. The backlog of treatments resulting from a lack of treatment could also lead to the loss of the patient base due to restricted opening hours, and the resulting financial shortfalls could ultimately lead to insolvency and the closure of the practice. While 1.4% of the study participants will be forced to permanently close by the end of 2020 at the latest, due to the economic situation, this situation will have to be evaluated again in the autumn/winter in order to identify effects early and, if necessary, to take countermeasures from the political side in order to continue to successfully maintain oral health care.",

Although the number of participating dentists is representative for Switzerland and Liechtenstein, it is possible that our study comprised mainly dentists who experienced little impact or who did not want to disclose their personal sensitive data regarding the COVID 19 pandemic. Through the experience of previous studies, the authors [9] limited the number of questions that they felt were most relevant in order to obtain the best possible results and experiences that could help dentists and policy makers to improve the situation in a possible second wave or to make better decisions based on the newly obtained knowledge. Most importantly, it is worth mentioning that the study was conducted when the situation in Switzerland and Liechtenstein had eased in July 2020. The findings on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID- 19 have not yet been fully researched and understood, and a transfer of knowledge among dentists is still necessary.
