We develop a novel machine learning framework that uses data-sets describing the distribution of a virus within its host and the range of its animal host, along with human immunity data, to infer rates of animal-to-human transmission across a focal region. By training the model on data from the animal host, our framework allows rigorous validation of spillover predictions on human data. We apply our framework to Lassa fever, a viral disease of West Africa that is spread to humans by rodents, and update estimates of symptomatic and asymptomatic Lassa virus infections in humans. Our results suggest that Nigeria is most at risk for the emergence of new strains of Lassa virus, and therefore should be prioritized for outbreak-surveillance. 14 Machine learning techniques have shown promise at predicting the geographical 15 range of spillover risk for several zoonotic diseases including Lassa fever [4-6], 16 Ebola [7, 8], and Leishmaniases [9]. Generally, these models are trained to associate 17 environmental features with the presence or absence of case reports in humans or the 18 associated reservoir. Once inferred from the training process, the learned relationships 19 July 14, 2020 3/31 47 We apply our framework to Lassa virus (formally Lassa mammarenavirus [LASV]), a 48 negative sense, bi-segmented, single-stranded ambisense RNA virus in the Arenaviridae 49 family and the causative agent of LF in West Africa [11, 13].

However, due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust predictions is challenging. Recent efforts to overcome this obstacle have capitalized on machine learning to predict spillover risk. Past approaches combine infection data from both humans and reservoir to train models that assess risk across broad geographical regions. In doing so, these models blend data sources that separately describe pathogen risk posed by the reservoir and the realized rate of spillover into the human population. We develop a novel approach that models as separate stages: 1) the contributions of spillover risk from the reservoir and pathogen distribution, and 2) the resulting incidence of pathogen in the human population. Our methodology allows for a rigorous assessment of whether forecasts of spillover risk can reliably predict the realized spillover rate into humans, as measured by seroprevalence. In addition to providing a rigorous cross-validation of risk predictions, this methodology could shed light on human habits that modulate or amplify the resultant spillover. We apply our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that poses a high threat of emergence in West Africa.",

Machine-learning models that can anticipate when and where animal-to-human virus transmission is most likely to Introduction 1 Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a deadly threat to public health. 2 Approximately 40% of EIDs are caused by pathogens that circulate in a non-human 3 wildlife reservoir (i.e., zoonotic pathogens) [1] . Prior to full scale emergence, interaction 4 between humans and wildlife creates opportunities for the occasional transfer, or 5 spillover, of the zoonotic pathogen into human populations [2] . These initial spillover 6 cases, in turn, represent newly established pathogen populations in human hosts that 7 are subject to evolutionary pressures and may potentially lead to increased transmission 8 among humans [2, 3] . Consequently, a key step in preempting the threat of EIDs is 9 careful monitoring of when and where spillover into the human population occurs. 10 However, because the majority of EIDs from wildlife originate in low and middle income 11 regions with limited health system infrastructure, accurately estimating the rate and 12 geographical range of pathogen spillover, and therefore the risk of new EIDs, is a major 13 challenge [1] .",

            "text": "between disease presence and the environment can be extended across a region of 20 interest. Using these techniques, previous studies of Lassa fever (LF) have derived risk 21 maps that assess the likelihood of human LF cases being present in different regions of 22 West Africa [4, 5] . Fitted risk maps are often assessed, in turn, by evaluating the ability 23 of a model to discriminate between case data and background data that was left out of 24 the training process [5, 7] . Though such models have demonstrated impressive 25 discrimination abilities when evaluated by such binary classification ability, these 26 forecasts are not explicitly vetted on their ability to predict the magnitude of pathogen 27 spillover from the reservoir into humans. As a result, the extent to which predicted risk 28 explains the realized variation in human exposure to the pathogen is unclear. 29 To address this need, we develop a multi-layer machine learning framework that 30 accounts for the differences between how data involving a wildlife reservoir, and data 31 from human serosurveys, can simultaneously inform spillover risk in people and 32 rigorously assess whether predicted risk quantifies the rate of new cases in humans. Our 33 approach uses machine learning algorithms that, when trained on data from the wildlife 34 reservoir alone, estimate the likelihood that the reservoir and the zoonotic pathogen are 35 present in an area. These predictions are then combined into a composite estimate of 36 spillover risk to humans. Next, our framework uses estimates of human pathogen 37 seroprevalence, as well as estimates of human population density, to translate the 38 composite risk estimate into a prediction of the realized rate of zoonotic spillover into 39 humans. Omitting human seroprevalence data from the training process of the risk-layer 40 has several advantages. First, in the case of LF, due to modern transportation and the 41 longevity of Lassa virus antibodies in humans, a general concern is that the reported 42 location of human disease or Lassa virus antibody detection is not the site at which the 43 infection occurred [10] [11] [12] . Training the risk layer on reservoir data alone helps avoid 44 these biases. Secondly, in our framework, human seroprevalence estimates provide an 45 ultimate test of the risk layer's ability to correlate with cumulative human exposure to 46 the pathogen. rodent-to-human transmission is believed to account for the majority of new LASV 52 infections [11, 15] . LASV spreads to humans from its primary reservoir, the 53 multimammate rat Mastomys natalensis, through food contaminated with infected 54 rodent feces and urine, as well as through the hunting of rodents for food 55 consumption [16] . Because M. natalensis have limited dispersal relative to humans, 56 direct LASV detection in the rodents is likely to indicate actual areas of spillover risk. 57 We evaluate each layer of our framework for its ability to predict different attributes 58 of LASV spillover into humans. Our model demonstrates a clear ability to predict 59 spillover risk as measured by the spatial distribution of the LASV pathogen and 60 reservoir, and a more moderate correlation between the predicted risk and human 61 seroprevalence. We also use our machine learning framework to estimate the total LASV 62 spillover into humans. Data from longitudinal serosurveys has been used to estimate 63 that between 100,000 and 300,000 LASV infections occur each year, and that between 74 64 -94% of LASV infections result in sub-clinical febrile illness or are asymptomatic [17] .",

Our results indicate that magnitude of new cases in Nigeria is driven primarily by its greater human population 401 density, rather than an increased per-capita risk. If these predictions are correct, 402 Nigeria is likely to represent the greatest risk of LASV emergence because the large 403 number of annual spillover events allows for extensive sampling of viral strain diversity 404 and repeated opportunities for viral adaptation to the human populations [53] . 405 In addition to identifying the countries most at risk for viral emergence, our model 406 framework provides updated estimates for the rate of LASV spillover across West Africa. 407",

Later estimates that were partially based on the same 423 longitudinal serosurveys derived an upper bound of 13 million LASV infections, but 424 only considered the number of cases in Nigeria, Guinea, and Sierra Leone [20] . 425 Furthermore, these later estimates are derived from the maximum observed human 426 LASV seroconversion rate in the Sierra Leone study, which likely does not apply across 427 West Africa. In contrast, our estimates are based on human seroprevalence data that 428 comes from six countries in West Africa and spans a 47 year time period.

BCTs use 167 a stage-wise learning algorithm that, at each stage, trains a new tree model to the 168 residuals of the current model iteration. Each newly fitted tree is added to the ensemble 169 model, thereby reducing the residual deviance between the model predictions and a 170 training set [47].

We 220 trained each model on a data-set comprised of 36 absence locations and 36 presence 221 locations, sampled from the full data-set with replacement. The estimation of error in 222 the D L layer is similar to that described in the D M layer. Specifically, we calculate the 223 AUC of the fitted model on an equal number of out-of-bag presences and absences. 224 Next, we combined the D M and D L layers into a composite feature, denoted by D X , indicative of whether a pixel simultaneously has environmental features that are 226 suitable for M. natalensis, as well as LASV in M. natalensis. The combined feature is 227 defined as D X = D M \u00d7 D L and summarizes the realized risk of LASV spillover to 228 humans within the local environment. 229 Connection to human seroprevalence and incidence 230To connect the new risk parameter D X to human arenavirus seroprevalence, and to 231 evaluate the ability of the D X layer to explain historical LASV spillover in humans, we 232 regressed seroprevalence from human arenavirus serosurveys on the D X layer and an 233 intercept. We used quasi-binomial regression to account for over-dispersion in 234 seroprevalence measurements that could otherwise contaminate hypothesis tests on 235 model coefficients[51]. In the regression, the log-odds of each seroprevalence estimate is 236 weighted by the number of individuals tested in the serosurvey.237Next, we used a SIRS model that includes waning immunity to derive an equation 238 that relates a given LASV spillover rate into humans and the resulting seroprevalence in 239 a human population. Throughout, we assume that the seroprevalence measures that240 were obtained from historical serosurveys describe LASV infection at steady-state (i.e., 241 are unchanging in time). This derivation, in turn, is used to translate the regression 242 model's predictions of LASV seroprevalence into incidence (spillover cases per year) in 243 humans. For the SIRS model, we employ several assumptions: 1) humans within each 244 0.05x0.05 \u2022 pixel constitute a closed population with constant birth rate b and per-capita 245 death rate d. Within each pixel, humans are compartmentalized into three 246 non-overlapping classes: susceptible (S), infected with LASV (I), and recovered from 247 LASV infection (R).

Though human-to-human 250 transmission of LASV is common in nosocomial outbreaks, rodent-to-human 251 transmission is believed to be the primary pathway by which the virus is spread outside 252 of hospital environments [15]. 3) Susceptible humans become infected with LASV at a 253 constant rate F S, where F denotes the rate of infectious contact between a human and 254 infected M. natalensis (i.e., the force of infection).
