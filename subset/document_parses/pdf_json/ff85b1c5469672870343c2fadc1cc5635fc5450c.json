The capacity for human systems to remain resilient or buffer the impacts of these extreme events has led to great damage in already vulnerable ecosystems. Just prior to the onset of a national lockdown, civil society organizations in Argentina had launched a key initiative to stop the deforestation of the Chaco, the second largest forest ecosystem in South America.

While livelihoods are naturally at the forefront, this lack of vision is leading to economic drawdown and unregulated resource use, with strong negative impacts on natural systems including biodiversity losses that will impact economic sustainability in the future. Developing countries, the Global South, and Small Island Developing States, whose economies are based on their natural resources, may face a greater risk of decisions which may ultimately harm both humans and wildlife, such as large-scale logging to produce wood products 8, 9 . For instance, seasonal grouper bans in Fiji meant to protect spawning populations were lifted early to allow fishers to harvest and sell these species, despite declining populations prepandemic 6 . This reality contrasts starkly with the potential for the pandemic to offer a pivot point for societal transformation. Both ecosystem and economic sustainability are possible if measures are implemented that shift away from activities that damage ecosystems in favor of those which promote resilience 10 . In fact, the pandemic offers potential for societal transformation to promote a longer-term vision for both ecosystem and economic sustainability.",

More subtle wildlife responses to disturbances need to be considered. Human activities, for example, which may have previously appeared relatively benign (such as hiking and snorkeling), may discourage animals from using their preferred habitats 11 . Limited access to preferred areas for foraging, avoiding predators, or thermoregulation may have important energetic impacts that in turn may influence whether an animal will survive exposure to disease or starvation. Thus, strategies which more explicitly minimize human-wildlife interactions may improve conservation outcomes. Indeed, the negative effects of breaks in programs to protect nature provide strong support for the value of conservation strategies already in place, e.g., programs to eradicate invasive predators or support habitat enrichment of endangered species 11 .",

As a result of border closures there has been a shift towards a less \"extractive\" model in research practices. Scientists often \"parachute\" into countries and into communities to collect specimens and data, leaving nothing of value behind, but also missing opportunities to gain from local natural history and knowledge 16 . This approach has not been possible during the lockdown, and instead external scientists have needed to work remotely via field operations executed by local scientists and community experts. For example, researchers from Dalhousie and Memorial Universities in Atlantic Canada (including co-author Bates) partnered with the Nunatsiavut Government (regional Inuit government) to co-develop and colead a research project on sustainable ocean systems 17 . Part of the project's response to COVID-19 related lockdown protocols was to hire four local Inuit Research Coordinators in different Nunatsiavut communities (rather than just one) to conduct and lead research during the lockdown period, such as deploying instruments through the ice for measuring ocean conditions. Creating a network of community-based positions has now been recognized as invaluable for the success and co-development of the project outputs, and will continue for the life of the project. Indeed, the pandemic response has generally accelerated the recognition that local research teams have locally relevant local knowledge and field expertise, combined with the skills to lead and conduct research in collegial partnerships with scientists based elsewhere.",
