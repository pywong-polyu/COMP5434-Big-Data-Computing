For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if initial infections occur around holidays. Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact.",

Fiftytwo local cases (94.5%) were linked to imported or known cases, and 3 local cases (5.5%) have unknown origin. Since February 7th, Taiwan has implemented entry restrictions on foreign nationals based on their travel histories; 14-day home quarantine started being required for visitors from certain locations from February 10th and became required for all travelers from March 19th [10] . While COVID-19 transmission in Taiwan is relatively well-controlled, the number of cases globally is still increasing [1] . When border control is relaxed in Taiwan in the future, importation from other countries has the potential to lead to local outbreaks, especially if other non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as hand washing or mask wearing, are not adopted at the same level as in March and April 2020.",

Facebook's newly developed colocation matrices (Facebook colocation data) give the probability that people from two different geographic units will be in the same 600 m \u00d7 600 m location for 5 minutes using data over the course of a week. Facebook's regular movement data (Facebook movement data) aggregates the number of trips Facebook users make between locations every 8 hours ( Figure S1 ) [18] . Mobility data between January 26th and June 30th were used. Facebook movement data were disaggregated by weekdays (Monday to Friday), weekends, and holidays (Lunar New Year, Ching Ming festival, and Dragon Boat Festival).

On average, intracity movement was 7-fold of intercity movement, and intracity colocation probability was over 200-fold of intercity colocation probability. We quantified the difference in connectivity between locations by three measures: risk of infection, risk of regional importation, and source of importation ( Fig. 1 and Table S1 ). Risk of infection identifies locations with larger colocation probabilities. If assuming contact rates were proportional to colocation probabilities, disease transmission rates are expected to be higher in locations with higher risk of infection, such as Taipei City, New Taipei City, and Kaohsiung City. Risk of regional importation represents the relative number of travelers and local people, and higher values indicate higher possibility that travelers will transmit virus to local people. Source of importation calculates how much travelers from each location contribute to other locations. Viruses are expected to spread more quickly if initial local infections in Taiwan occur in locations with higher values of source of infection. Taipei and New Taipei City are cities with the highest risk of regional importation and source of importation, respectively. These three measures quantify different but related aspects of mobility and connectivity that are relevant for disease transmission, and while well-connected cities tend to have high values for all three measures, there are still some differences among them.",

As expected, we found that, if we assumed that the transmission rates varied among cities (contact model), the probability of having more than 1000 infections also varied with the locations of initial infections, with the cities with larger risk of infection showing larger P 1000 ( Figure S4A and Table S2 ). In simulations where 1000 infections were reached, the time it took to reach 1000 infections (denoted by T 1000,k ) was also shorter for cities with larger risk of infection ( Figure S4B ). When assuming that the transmission rates in different cities were the same (residence model), the probability of having more than 1000 infections and the time to reach 1000 infections did not vary much with the locations of initial infections ( Figure  S5 and Table S3 ). The effect of intercity connectivity, however, was reflected in the variation in infection numbers across cities at T 1000 (denoted by V 1000 ). The variation in infection numbers was lower in cities with higher values of source of importation ( Figure S4C ) as the chance of spreading the virus to other cities was higher.

Health officials can therefore take into consideration feasibility of different interventions, impact on society [35] , and the capacity of the healthcare system to determine the optimal interventions and their duration [5] . Because the volume of travel in and around holidays can increase the speed of virus spread, our results suggest that it is important to avoid travel or reduce the impact of travel through Fig. 3 The impact of travel reduction on the probability of having 1000 infections. P 1000,3 from simulations with initial infections in Taipei City (representing big cities) or Pingtong County (representing small cities) using both contact and residence models are shown. The difference between big and small cities was more significant in the contact model than in the residence model. Intracity and intercity travel reduction reduced P 1000,3 , while the impact of intercity travel reduction was minor. Here travel reduction was applied during the whole time and R 0 = 2.4 measures such as limiting social interactions and wearing facemasks when taking public transportation to reduce the spread of the virus.",

While the Facebook data are limited to the population of Facebook users with location services turned on, these movement data can provide important insights into mobility patterns [18] . Additionally, Facebook coverage was consistent across cities (Table S4) , suggesting minimal bias due to differential coverage by location. Moreover, our model utilizing human mobility data from Facebook is not limited to intercity or intracity level, or Taiwan. Facebook mobility data are also calculated at finer geographic scales (such as towns) and for other countries, and our model can be easily applied in these settings to understand disease dynamics of COVID-19.",

As the duration of intracity travel reduction increased, P 1000,3 decreased in both models. P 1000,3 did not change with the duration of intercity travel reduction can result in similar impact.
