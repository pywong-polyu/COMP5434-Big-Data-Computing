We used electronic medical records from a nationwide cohort consisting of people who tested positive (positive group), tested negative (negative group), and those who did not receive the test (control group) for COVID-19. For people with neither a history of dementia nor mild cognitive disorder (MCI), the negative group was more likely to develop dementia than the control group, and less likely to develop MCI than the positive group. For people who already had dementia, the negative group was more likely to develop comorbid psychiatric disorders than the control group, but less likely than the positive group. These findings suggest the necessity of managing mental health not only for patients with COVID-19 but also for people who tested negative for COVID-19.",

Our hypothesis is that those who have taken COVID-19 tests are likely to have more people infected with COVID-19 around them, implying that their experiences of COVID-19 are physically and psychologically closer than those who have not been tested. Therefore, we assumed that they received a greater adverse effect on mental health than those who had not been tested for COVID-19.

This cohort was used in the present study and the participants are made up of three groups: those who tested positive for COVID-19 (positive group), those who tested negative (negative group), and those who did not receive the test (control group), during the 4 months between Feb 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020, the early period of COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. The control group consisted of 15 times more numbers of participants of the positive group and their age and gender were matched to the positive group. We have created a new control group from the control group by selecting those who have visited a hospital more than once for any reason during the period between Feb 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. In this study, only the new control group was used as the control group. Cases of self-referral were excluded from the negative group. All COVID-19 tests used real-time RT-PCR, and all COVID-19 tests and COVID-19 treatments were provided free-of-charge by the government. Data of sociodemographics, ICD codes, prescriptions and procedures were obtained through the claim database, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea (HIRA). The cohort data was provided by the government until July 31, 2021. Details of the database of the HIRA were presented in other studies. 20, 21 The first hypothesis of this study is that, from the day the positive group was diagnosed with COVID-19, and from the day the negative group was tested for COVID-19, distress will significantly worsen and social relations and activities will significantly decrease for both groups, therefore, during the pandemic, diagnosis of dementia will increase among those without a history of dementia. Second, diagnoses of comorbid psychiatric disorders or prescriptions of psychotropic medications will increase among those with a history of dementia but without a history of any psychiatric disorders other than dementia, compared to the control group.",

The positive and negative groups are more likely to live in group settings (e.g., nursing home, assisted living, and group home) compared to the control group. In order to reduce such selection bias, this study adjusted the data by including a variable indicating whether or not they were admitted to skilled nursing facilities during the period from Feb 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Economic statuses of the study participants were divided into three levels: the medical aids group who are unable to pay for health insurance and thus receive government assistance (low), the bottom 50% of those who pay for health insurance (middle) and the top 50% of those who pay for health insurance (high). The history of underlying diseases included hypertension, diabetes, chronic lower respiratory diseases, heart diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and malignant neoplasms. The following four ICD diagnoses of dementia were assessed: Alzheimer's disease (G30, F00), vascular dementia (F01), dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere (F02), and unspecified dementia (F03). We also included mild cognitive disorder (MCI) (F06.7). Risk factors for dementia included mood disorders including depression, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, traumatic brain injury, nicotine dependence (mental and behavioral disorders due to use of tobacco), and alcohol dependence (mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol) (corresponding ICD codes are reported in the supplementary Table 1 ).",

The Korean Dementia Screening Questionnaire-C (KDSQ-C) test included in the medical checkup is aimed at screening dementia for those over 66 years of age. 22 It is for those who want to get a medical checkup voluntarily. There are a total of 15 questions, possible points for each question being 0, 1, and 2. It mainly evaluates memory and daily activities that require complex cognitive functions, and a cut off score of 6 is used to diagnose dementia with 79% sensitivity and 80% specificity. 22 In this sub-analysis, among those who had the KDSQ-C test in 2018, only cases with no diagnosis of dementia in the past 5 years (MCI was not considered) and with less than 6 points of KDSQ-C score were included to adjust for baseline cognitive function. An additional analysis of participants with KDSQ-C \u22656 was also performed. English version of KDSQ-C is presented in the supplementary Table 2 .",

However, there was no difference in the incidence rate of dementia between the positive and the negative groups, although the positive group showed higher MCI incidence rate than the negative group. According to previous studies, it was reported that people infected with COVID-19 suffer from dementia symptoms. 2, 23, 24 Therefore, the results of the previous studies are not consistent with this study. Our explanation on this is as follows. It is likely that one of the reasons people in the negative group were tested for COVID-19 was due to contact with people in the positive group, which implies that they may share a similar environment or live in the same place. That means the positive vs negative group analysis in this study is more likely to be independent from a confounding variable related to living in group settings such as nursing homes, which was not controlled in the previous studies. 2, 23, 24 Accordingly, it is needed to consider the possibility that the results of the previous study may be due to selection bias.",

To answer this question, we analyzed the incidence rate of having a diagnosis of dementia more than twice, and as a result, it was found that there was little difference from the incidence rate of having it more than once. It is highly likely that the symptoms of dementia persisted until the next visit, and it also suggests that once diagnosed with dementia during the pandemic, they could not recover from the symptoms in a short time.",

In other words, even if the positive group or the negative group had many restrictions in their lives due to COVID-19, their uses of psychiatric care services were not lower than that of the control group. In view of this, it is not convincing to say that the reason for the worsening of comorbid psychiatric symptoms in the positive and the negative groups, compared to the control group, is untimely suspension of dementia treatment.",

In South Korea, as of April 30, 2020, of deaths from COVID-19, 8.1% were infected at nursing homes, and 3.6% were infected at other social support facilities, amounting to a total of 11.7%. 26 This is very low compared to the 42% in the United States as of May 21, 2020, but accounts for a large percentage of total deaths in South Korea. 26 Among the elderly, those who have been tested for COVID-19 will be more likely to live in a group setting than those who have not been tested, leading to a selection bias for people living in group settings in this study. In order to take this into account as much as possible, \"admission to skilled nursing facilities\" was included as a variable, propensity score matching was performed, and efforts were made to adjust cognitive function through pre-pandemic dementia screening test KDSQ-C. This is the strength of this study. In South Korea, in the earliest stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, religious gatherings were identified as super-spreading events, but it is also a limitation of this study that the selection bias for this was not considered. 27 Second, the number of the positive group was small. Among the people in the positive group, too few had had the KDSQ-C test, so they were excluded from the analysis, which hindered the verification of the research hypotheses. However, the number of the positive group was a fundamental limitation because it was the number of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea. Also, the inclusion of only voluntary participants in the KDSQ-C test can certainly act as a bias. Third, because variables including nicotine and alcohol dependences depend only on the ICD codes, we could not capture data of the real-world. Finally, there may be various confounding factors that have not been considered. One of them is levels of education, which takes up an important part in evaluating the risk factor of dementia, but it was not considered in our study.",
