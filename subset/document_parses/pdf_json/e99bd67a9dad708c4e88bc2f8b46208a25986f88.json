This has concerned the choice of topics themselves, the detail in which the norms have been set out, and their ratification and subsequent application and supervision. During the last 40 years the debate has been moving from one extreme to another. The post-World War II consensus on the need to maintain a balance between economic and social progress was an element in reconstruction and of industrialized countries' growth and welfare. As of the 1980s, this consensus broke down. With increased emphasis on market forces, labour standards started being seen as rigidities and impediments to growth. Once the Cold War ended, a question in the early 1990s was posed in almost brutal terms: now that the common enemy-communist state power-was gone, was there still a need for the ILO and its standards?",

This in turn brought about a new transparency and a new openness of the entire world economy, enabled by technological change and the utilization of real-time sourcing and production. However, the good news of the spread of democracy and markets was accompanied by a shock when especially Western consumers found out that new and affordable products from emerging countries were-or could be-produced by very young children in miserable conditions. Consumers reacted for moral reasons; workers reacted because cheap imports affected their jobs. All of a sudden there was a call for universal rules on labour again. After having first been sidelined in the frenzy of transition, fundamental rights at work became a hotly contested issue in globalization and international trade.",

The ILO introduced an extensive programme of assistance to developing countries for freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, freedom from forced and child labour and multiform action against all forms of discrimination at work. These fundamental rights-or \"core labour standards\" as they were also calledwere universally accepted as an element of the new globalized world order. Support for applying them and even pressure to do so was assisted by extra-budgetary resources from the industrialized countries. For many of them, this was the second best option once trade sanctions were discouraged. Fundamental rights made their way into international documents governing trade, investment and cooperation. They were seen to translate the social dimensions of the new world economy, while promoting them was akin to the role of the ILO after the two World Wars.",

Employers had still been ambivalent about the role of Mussolini's fascist corporations in Italy, but subsequently the course of the war showed that their organizations could be equally threatened by totalitarian r\u00e9gimes. In 1919, the language of the labour principles of the Constitution had affirmed that freedom of association was a right of workers and employers alike. 4 In the early Cold War years, the ILO recognized that the independence of employers was also covered by the concept of trade union rights. 5 The questions of freedom of association and forced labour found new relevance because of the practice of communist countries. What had been a reaction to the atrocities of the fascist regimes carried over to discussion on social, individual and economic liberties in reconstruction and economic development. In the labour field, during the Cold War, certain human rights-above all freedom of associationdefined the side on which you were between the market economy and communism. This placed the main part of the trade unions on the same side of the divide as employers. In practice this determined much of the standard-setting after 1948 well beyond the fundamental principles and rights at work. Multiple compromises were called for in the period between 1945 and 1989-between employers and workers, between industrialized and developing countries, and between radical and moderate elements of-especially-the Workers' Group.",

The Conventions on freedom of association, collective bargaining, child and forced labour and discrimination were formally recognized as human rights. All countries which had ratified them should fully respect their legal obligations while all others should do their best to live up to their principles. 8 After Copenhagen, ILO Director-General Michel Hansenne launched a ratification campaign on the relevant Conventions. At that moment the Minimum Age Convention No. 138 was quietly added to the list of \"core\" Conventions as the then applicable standard on child labour. At the same time, a need clearly existed for an additional human rights standard on child labour. The earliest labour legislation at the beginning of the nineteenth Century had been on child labour. In the ILO, child labour had always been treated through Conventions on the minimum age for employment. This reflected the fact that the age of moving into full-time employment should permit compulsory education, particularly after universal schooling had become the norm towards the end of the nineteenth Century. Sectoral Conventions adopted by the ILO were in 1973 taken over by the Minimum Age Convention No. 138.

This has not taken place so much through outright conditionality as through trade preferences accorded to countries which desire to respect fundamental labour standards. The European trade systems opted to use the ILO's short-list for trade preferences. Most bilateral or regional free trade treaties have followed the same pattern, either referring to the fundamental Conventions or the 1998 Declaration. The United States, however, has continued to apply a broader set of criteria than the fundamentals to its trade policies. This included labour inspection. When the US trade unions filed a trade petition because an ultraliberal 2006 Georgian Labour Code-later amended-violated freedom of association principles, the case was mainly about labour inspection which the Georgian reformers of the former communist system had scrapped. 9 What I am arguing here is that the focus on fundamental rights at work safeguarded the role of international labour standards in general. The standards and their application were seen as a remedy to the problems of globalization and not as a complication or rigidity. In addition, the wave of ratifications of the fundamental Conventions led many countries to review their position on ILO Conventions in general. The factual blockage on new ratifications of all Conventions, which characterized especially the 1980s and 1990s, is no longer there.",

Writing about the wages of labour, Adam Smith observed that workers wanted to gain as much as possible in wages while employers conceded as little as possible. Both had an interest in combining (organizing) but Parliament had prohibited the workers from doing so. The masters in turn could always collude-and tacitly did so-to keep the price of labour down. 10 If workers were bereft of their wages, their existence could become untenable in a matter of days while employers could weather long periods of conflict. Workers could act with the \"folly and extravagance of desperate men who must either starve or frighten their masters into an immediate compliance with their demands\". 11 As a result, employers would call upon local authorities who would impose a settlement far short of workers' claims.",

The employers' vision generally is more of systems of information and consultation, without sanctions or legal obligations. It is not surprising that, for a hundred years, the workers have been advocating adoption of Conventions whereas, for the employers, the preferred form of instrument has been a Recommendation.",

In the context of globalization, the Centenary Declaration reaches out to one of the main Constitutional assertions, namely that the failure of any country to treat its workers humanely is an obstacle to all other countries which desire to do so. Fittingly, the Declaration weaves together the threads from over one hundred years to produce a narrative which, while not new, is the result of continuous review and updating.",

The Conference of 2019 adopted a new Convention on Violence and Harassment at Work. This Convention (No. 190) reminds us that freedom from violence and harassment at work is a human right, and in working life the rules have to cover everyone, irrespective of the contractual form of their employment. In addition, the Conference asked for further strengthening of the right to workplaces with guaranteed proper conditions of occupational safety and health. This can be seen as a logical trajectory for the ILO. A hundred years ago the ILO was first preoccupied by such questions as hours of work, minimum age for employment, and protection against unemployment as well as conditions before and after active years of work. The brutality of World War II highlighted the role of international labour standards for democracy, thus promoting recognition of universal human rights. This was followed by decolonization and technical assistance and, later on, the search for social principles of globalization.",

The ILO would be well advised to move ahead with as concrete application as possible of the principles which were for the first time adopted in its Constitution in 1919 and recognized as guidelines for social justice ever since. The rule of law must be maintained as the basic framework. Within it, any consensus at the parliamentary and macro-economic levels needs to be translated into specific agreements and real action at the national, sectoral and local level. Tripartite cooperation and collective bargaining play a crucial role here. This is the way to promote universal principles at the level of workplaces and enterprises-and society in general.",
