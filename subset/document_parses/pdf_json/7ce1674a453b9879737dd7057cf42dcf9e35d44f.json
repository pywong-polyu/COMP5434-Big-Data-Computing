Because of the spread of antibiotic resistance, the altered microbial-community structure caused by antibiotic use and the fewer new antibacterials released in recent years due to the high costs involved, rational prescription of antibiotics for CAP is more important [3] . In practical clinical situations, it is very difficult to precisely prescribe antibiotics to individual children with CAP based on bacterial pathogens that are proven by testing to be the cause of infection. Reasons include the low yield of blood cultures, lack of satisfactory sputum specimens and unwillingness to perform pulmonary aspiration. Furthermore, positive results are scarce due to the appearance of resistant bacterial strains [4] . Therefore, most early-stage antibiotic therapy for bacterial pneumonia is empirical; that is, it covers a range of possible target bacteria while culture results are pending.",

At present, such data mostly show antimicrobial-susceptibility testing results by bacterial species [5] . However, not all data may be of clinical relevance that should be verified more accurately and broadly. In addition, the physician might feel that antibiotics covering a very broad range of bacterial infections always work, although even the broadestspectrum antibiotics have gaps in their coverage. In this case, the physician would try to use ever-more-complex combinations of antibiotics to ensure coverage of more possible bacterial infections. However, using more broad-spectrum options for children would increase antibiotic resistance locally and globally [3] , and prolonged empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or frequent changes of antibiotics are associated with a number of negative pathologicaltest outcomes [6] . Owing to the lack of practical guidance and evidence, some pediatricians even empirically choose antibiotics based on patients' symptoms and signs and on their own subjective experience [7] .",

Eui Jin Hwang et al.

EAT is a growing field of AI application research in radiology, but until now there have been few research results, especially in children.

We then constructed and validated a comprehensive multi-class classification model for differential diagnosis of these three common types of bacterial pneumonia by synthesizing three radiomics submodels based on radiomics features extracted from low-dose chest CT images. The results of our study indicated that the atypical pneumonia model performed better than either the Gram-positive or Gram-negative model. Compared with traditional imaging, in which radiologists can rarely distinguish type of bacterial pneumonia by reading CT images only, the radiomics model could provide a reference for continual optimization in the future. Note that our current results are not ideal, which might be related to the instinct characteristic of multi-classification method and the pathological manifestations of bacterial pneumonia. Considering the child's cooperation and radiation damage, a chest X-ray is the optimal option for diagnosing pneumonia. But CT needs to be considered when complications are suspected or there is difficulty in differentiating community-acquired pneumonia from other pathology [12] . We should exclude other reasons beside infections causing pneumonia such as obstruction and tumor and so on. Over the past decade, recent advances in CT scanning technology have dramatically reduced radiation doses [13] . The radiation dose of a low-dose chest CT is within 1 mSv; however, compared with 0.1 mSv for a chest X-ray, the radiation dose is still important to consider for the application of CT in children [14] . However, X-ray might not be the ideal way to identify the cause of pneumonia. X-ray interpretation has high inter-observer variability, particularly between unexperienced and experienced readers [15] , leading to both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Withholding antibiotics can cause the physician to miss the best time to treat pneumonia and prolong the course of the disease, while the opposite error can lead to antibiotic resistance. Therefore, correct diagnosis and avoidance of antibiotic overuse should be given priority over radiation dose and economic costs [12] . Accordingly, we chose low-dose chest CT for early diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia. Owing to its intrinsic advantages and better results than other machine-learning (ML) models, we chose SVM classifier. SVM achieved good performance when classifying image data, even with limited clinical samples. We used L2-term regularization to improve generalization capabilities and prevent overfitting, as well as the kernel trick to handle nonlinear data to improve their flexibility and adaptability. We defined the range of values for each hyperparameter; for example, C = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100}. The grid search algorithm was guided by the AUC measured on the training set. Optimal C and gamma were both 1.0.",

The first two features, gray-level variance (GLV) and size zone non-uniformity (SZN), with the highest correlation in the comprehensive model, both belonged to the GLSZM group. GLV measures the variance in gray-level intensities for the zones. SZN measures the variability of size zone volumes in the image, indicating the degree of homogeneity in these volumes and thus differences in the homogeneity of pulmonary lesions caused by the three types of bacterial infection.

The pathogenic mechanism of atypical bacterial pneumonia, including CPP, MPP and CTP, differs too much from those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia infections. For example, M. pneumoniae is the smallest prokaryotic microbe in nature; its lack of walls and malleability facilitate its adhesion to host tissues. Its membrane proteins, invasive proteins and adhesive proteins enable it to pass through cell filters, causing adhesion damage, membrane fusion damage, nutrition depletion, invasive damage, toxic damage, immune damage and inflammatory damage [16] . This is its main pathogenic mechanism. Therefore, characteristics such as bronchial-wall thickening, lateral bronchial-wall thickening, or intralobular or lobular groundglass opacities can help us distinguish MPP from other bacterial pneumonias [17] .",

This is a very new type of model on which we plan to improve. We hope that in the future, this radiomics model can be applied using a convenient software package that connects to PACS in radiology departments, and that radiologists will recommend EAT to clinicians based on the results of this model when reporting conventional CT findings of pneumonia like making a suspiciously malignant or benign statement when diagnosing a tumor.",
