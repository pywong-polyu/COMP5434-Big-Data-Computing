On the basis of the results of current trials, the AIDS Research Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued interim guidance for people living with HIV (PLWH), which recommends vaccination of all patients against the new coronavirus infection, regardless of their CD4+ T-cell count or HIV RNA viral load. 1 However, the guidance emphasizes the insufficiency of data on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in the HIV+ population. Moreover, it has been reported that not all available vaccines can produce protective immunity in HIV+ people. 2 Also, in phase three of clinical trials in which, by design, the only group representing immunosuppressive conditions were HIV+ persons, the included sample size did not achieve sufficient statistical power to evaluate the efficiency of vaccines tested in these groups. 3\u22125 In the Russian Federation, 681118 PLWH were registered at territorial AIDS Centers by the end of 2019 (464\u00a21 per 100,000 population). 6 For these patients, SARS-CoV-2 two-injection adenovirus-based vaccine Sputnik V, 7 registered in Russia, is widely available. The efficiency of Sputnik V against the strains circulating by the end of 2020, according to the results of clinical trials of phase 3, was 91\u00a26%. The field efficiency in the period with active circulation of the delta variant was about 80%. 8 This is not surprising, given that the virus-neutralizing activity against delta is 2\u00a26 times lower than the initial level. 9 In the HIV+ group, the efficacy of the Sputnik V vaccine is known neither for the parental strains nor for the delta variant.",

We used a logistic regression model with stepwise selection of variables. Predictors were excluded at p values > 0.05. The dependent probability of contracting COVID-19 is described by the equation: p = 1 / (1 + e-z) * 100%. z = -3\u00a2953 + 0\u00a2007*X age \u2212 1\u00a2290*X vaccination + 0\u00a2275*X CD4+ + 0\u00a2155*X gender , where: p is the probability of contracting COVID19 during the analyzed period (%), X age is the age (full years), X vaccination is the\u2212vaccination status (0, not vaccinated;1, vaccinated), X CD4+ is the CD4+ T-cell count (0, < 350; 1, \u2265 350), X gender is sex (0, Male; 1, Female). The resulting regression model is statistically significant (p < 0\u00a2001); however, according to the Nigel Kirk determination coefficient, the model takes into account only 2\u00a29% of all factors determining the probability of contracting COVID-19 (Fig. S2) . A 1-year increase in the age variable, holding all other variables constant, increases the chance of contracting COVID-19 by a factor of 1\u00a2007 (95% CI: 1\u00a2001\u22121\u00a2014). Being vaccinated with other variables fixed decreases the probability of contracting COVID-19 by 3\u00a2631 times (95% CI: 2\u00a2794 \u22124\u00a2720) as compared with being unvaccinated. A CD4+ T-cell count \u2265 350 decreased the probability of contracting COVID-19 by 1\u00a2317 times (95% CI: 1\u00a2155\u22121\u00a2502). Being a woman increases the probability of COVID-19 by a factor of 1\u00a2168 (95% CI: 1\u00a2035\u22121\u00a2317) as compared with men, with the other variables fixed. There is a positive correlation between the probability of contracting COVID-19 and age, and a negative correlation with CD4 Articles + T-cell count and being vaccinated. Women have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than men.",

Vaccination significantly reduces the risks of becoming severely ill and of requiring hospitalization. It is important that the effectiveness of protection against the delta strain was maintained at a high level. In patients with CD4+ T-cell counts < 350 cells/\u00b5l, vaccine effectiveness was lower but was still present. There were insufficient data to reliably calculate the effectiveness of the vaccine in this group. Better protection can be achieved after additional dose-testing and adjustment of immunization schedules in this patient population. Our results show that treatment of HIV leading to CD4+ T-cell reconstitution is beneficial for infected individuals and also provides a community benefit by decreasing the spread of other infectious agents including SARS-COV-2. This relationship among pathogens is well known for other agents, in particular tuberculosis. 22 Our study has several limitations: (i) The study groups were not sufficiently homogeneous (the vaccinated group included significantly more males and 16% more patients with CD4+ T-cell counts > 350 cells/\u00b5l, and was on average three years older than persons in the unvaccinated group; (ii) The sample size for immunocompromised patients was not sufficient to estimate the exact level of effectiveness of vaccine protection for this subgroup; (iii) The data were insufficient for a number of parameters, resulting in some cases excessively wide confidence intervals; (iv) Factors such as BMI, comorbidities and ethnicity were not taken into account due to the lack of these data, which may affect the residual bias in our regression model.",
