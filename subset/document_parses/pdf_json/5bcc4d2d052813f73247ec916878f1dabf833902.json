            "text": "To increase testing capability for SARS-CoV-2 during a rapidly evolving public health emergency, we aimed to deploy a validated laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 on an accelerated timeline and using reagent supply chains that were not constrained. Methods. A realtime RT-PCR assay that detects the structural envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2 was developed and validated on the Roche cobas 6800 instrument platform with the omni Utility channel reagents, which performs automated nucleic acid extraction and purification, PCR amplification, and detection. In silico analysis was performed for both inclusivity of all SARS-CoV-2 variants and cross reactivity with other pathogenic organisms. Positive control material was used to determine the Limit of Detection (LOD) and patient samples (positive and negative) confirmed by another authorized assay were used for clinical validation. Experiments were carried out at the Christiana Care Health System's Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory (Newark, DE) between April 1 and April 4, 2020. Results. A real-time RT-PCR assay for SARS-Cov-2 was developed and validated in just two weeks. For all oligonucleotides, 100% homology to the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences was observed. Greater than 80% homology between one or more oligonucleotides was observed for SARS-Cov (Urbani strain) and Influenza A, however risk of cross reactivity was deemed to be low. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was 250 copies/mL. The assay identified 100% of positive patient samples (30/30) and 100% of negative patient samples (29/29 patient negatives and 1/1 saline). Up to 92 samples can be run on a single plate and analysis takes approximately 3.5 hours. Conclusions. In this work, we demonstrate the development and validation of a single target laboratory-developed test for SARS-CoV-2 in two weeks. Key considerations for complementary supply chains enabled development on an accelerated timeline and an increase in testing capability.",

The rapid development and deployment of these assays has been key in limiting the outbreak to the extent it has been limited; yet, achieving widespread testing capability for a public health emergency of this size and scale has been hindered by assay throughput and the availability of reagents, supplies, and equipment.

Diagnostic companies have developed and marketed their own proprietary PCR-based assays as kits specifically designed for their respective in vitro diagnostic testing platforms; however, implementation is limited to testing facilities with access to these instruments and the availability of the corresponding kits. As the demand for testing increases, many labs experience supply chain issues and reagent shortages, which limits the scale-up of widespread testing. The supply of reagents required by these PCR-based protocols cannot keep up with rapidly increasing demand, ultimately impacting the ability to effectively diagnose and contain SARS-CoV-2. On March 31, 2020, due to the rapidly evolving pandemic and shortages of commercial in vitro diagnostic tests, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that molecular-based laboratory developed tests are justified to protect the public health 5 and issued guidelines for developing and validating these assays 6 under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Under such guidance, assays should at least establish a limit of detection, include inclusivity and cross-reactivity analyses, as well as perform clinical assessment with a number of known patient-positive as well as non-reactive samples.",

In response to the first SARS outbreak in early 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) international working group identified the novel coronavirus strain in April 2003, but early diagnostic tests developed were either unreliable or did not detect the virus until late in the illness's course. 8, 9 It took nearly six months before a reliable assay could be established. 10 During the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2015, the US Department of Defense obtained an EUA for their RT-PCR diagnostic in early August 2014, however, this was the only test to gain FDA authorization until BioFire Defense gained approval nearly three months later in late October 2014. 11 Similarly, after the WHO declared Zika a public health emergency of international concern in February 2016, 12 testing in the US was initially limited to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Distribution of tests to authorized laboratories was controlled and managed by the CDC and the limitation in distribution of early CDC assays resulted in a backlog of nearly 1,000 samples in the Miami area at one point during the outbreak. 7 The first commercial laboratory was issued an EUA in late April 2016 13 and to date, the only laboratory-developed test EUA was issued to Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity in August 2017, 13 a year and a half after the CDC test was authorized.",

It is important for treatment of the patient as well as for developing an understanding of the spread of the disease in the community. An inability to rapidly diagnose patients can also strain healthcare systems. For example, patients that present with symptoms, but for which a diagnosis must wait several days, are treated as if they may be positive, requiring the use of a significant amount of personal protective equipment by healthcare providers and requiring special isolation. If a patient tests negative, a significant amount of equipment and resources can be allocated to those in need.",

Laboratories may need to strategize their choice of instruments, reagents, supplies, protocols, and sources for each, to quickly develop tests that are rigorous enough to gain regulatory acceptance, and that can be adopted for sustained use during an outbreak of unknown duration. Some issues to consider are speed to regulatory acceptance and risk of non-acceptance, the benefits and drawbacks of using less common targets and/or reagents, compatibility with commercial platforms, and the availability of custom and commercially available reagents. One possible approach is to apply laboratory-developed tests customized for SARS-CoV-2 to commercially available automated platforms that are already designed for in vitro diagnostics. Such an approach can increase throughput by relying on an automated platform that would require less staff resources and can test numerous samples at once, as well as by using reagents and supplies that are less limited by supply chain issues. This approach can also supplement the use of proprietary diagnostic tests to maximize instrument use time and decrease turnaround time. It also can help provide a rapid clinical diagnosis to patients.",

For all oligonucleotides, 100% homology to the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences was observed (Table 1 ). In silico cross-reactivity analysis only showed significant primer homology (homology exceeding 80%) to SARS-coronavirus (Urbani strain), SARS-CoV-2, and Influenza A. Significant homology (100%) to the SARS-CoV genome was observed for the forward primer, reverse primer, and probe. Based on sequence analysis alone, cross-reactivity of this assay for SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-coronavirus (Urbani) cannot be ruled out. However, SARScoronavirus (Urbani) has not circulated broadly in the human population since 2004 9 sand therefore cross-reactivity during the COVID-19 outbreak is statistically unlikely and not clinically-relevant at this time (the early phases of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak). An alignment with 82% homology was found between the E-gene reverse primer and Influenza A, with one mismatch (18 of 19 base pairs). No significant alignment was found between Influenza A and the forward primer or probe. Despite the in silico prediction of potential cross-reactivity, experimental observations with seven Influenza A-positive patient samples and six Influenza A (H1N1)-positive patient samples revealed no cross-reactivity. 14 In addition, the lack of homology between the forward primer and probe suggests that no amplification will occur even if the reverse primer were to bind to a portion of the Influenza A genome. Therefore, the risk that this assay detects Influenza A was deemed to be low. Experimental observations with other respiratory pathogens from clinical samples were consistent with these in silico observations. 14 Table 1 : Results of in silico inclusivity and cross-reactivity analysis.

We selected a target of 250 cp/mL to test and designed the LOD study to document that the assay could detect this level. The experiments were performed to simultaneously determine the feasibility of the proposed assay and determine this LOD by spiking positive control material into three different sample matrices at levels spanning two orders of magnitude (5,000 cp/mL -250 cp/mL). FDA guidance specifies that the LOD of the assay is the lowest detectable concentration of SARS-CoV-2 (cp/mL) at which greater than or equal to 95% of all replicates test positive, and this limit must be verified with at least 20 replicates at the claimed concentration. 6 To fulfill this requirement, three concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 standard were evaluated across three sample matrices, including 20 replicates in VTM. All samples in the LOD experiment tested positive (Ct < 40 cycles) regardless of concentration or clinical matrix ( Table  2 ). Based on this data, the assay's LOD of 250 cp/mL was established. ",

To circumvent limited availability of PCR extraction kits, this assay takes advantage of cobas reagents that are not specific to SARS-CoV-2 testing and which are not in limiting supply. Our experience was that to rapidly advance assay development, it was helpful to find multiple vendors and product listings to source critical reagents. While manufacturers of custom oligonucleotides, for example, can quickly ship primers and probes used by existing PCR tests established by the CDC, the production of alternate custom reagents was subject to some manufacturing delays. Our assay development effort benefited from sourcing primers, probes, controls, and other reagents from multiple vendors, as well as acquisition of different types of reagents from a given vendor (for example, lyophilized primers as well as ready to use primers). This approach saved time during method troubleshooting; however, it did increase the financial investment needed to launch the effort.

While it is admittedly difficult, if not impossible, to foresee all possible issues, having a team consider failure modes early in the process helped prepare and develop mitigations. Even the smallest issues can impact the ability to validate an assay. For example, the reagent cassette used in this study must be vented with a pipette tip during loading of the prepared MMx-R2; however, the only tips available in the laboratory during early experiments were barrier tips which prevented air flow. The barrier tips made it difficult to pipette precise volumes into the reagent cassette during practice runs. This unforeseen issue was initially overcome by using a needle to break the barrier seal on the tip for practice runs by allowing venting of the cartridge and precise pipetting. Ultimately, the issue was addressed by acquiring non-barriered tips for this purpose.",
