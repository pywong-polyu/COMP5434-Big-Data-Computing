In particular, it stresses the importance of integrating material and spatial approaches to the study of digital religion. In doing so, it proposes the theory of \"hypermediated religious spaces\" to describe processes of religious mediation between online and offline environments by taking into account materiality and space. The article discusses theoretical perspectives by means of case studies: first, the importance of materiality within Internet practices is illustrated through the example of Neo-Pagan online rituals; second, the notion of space, and \"third space\" in particular, in relation to Internet practices is analyzed through the case of the hashtag #Nous-Sommes-Unis, circulated by French Muslims; third, the theory of hypermediated spaces is exemplified by the analysis of a live-streamed mass in the Italian city of Manerbio during the Covid-19 lockdown. The article aims at kindling scholarly reflections on terminologies and theories for the global and interdisciplinary study of digital religion.",

The blessing is symbolically important as it occurred when the world was struggling with new lockdown restrictions, particularly severe in Italy. Arguably, the image is remarkable because of the emptiness of St. Peter's square, a space usually full of believers. As people could no longer physically participate in religious functions, the special Urbi et Orbi was consumed exclusively through media, either television or Internet streaming.",

            "text": "This image may suggest that the Covid lockdown brought extraordinary changes to religion, with mediation substituting the physicality of believers gathered around the pontiff. Indeed, during the Covid-19 lockdown several religious communities around the world were forced to find online strategies to substitute physical interactions (Campbell 2020a) . However, two considerations need to be done. First, as media scholar Stewart Hoover (2006) asserts, religion and media have always been entangled throughout history. Religion is inevitably based on messages diffused through media, from sacred texts to new media technologies (Horsfield 2015) . The second consideration is that the reproduction of religious rituals online is not something that is only caused by physical distancing restrictions, and it is not limited to social network sites (Hadden and Cowan 2000) . For instance, Pope John Paul II already spoke favorably about the possibility of diffusing Catholic messages online at the World Communication Day in 1990 (Jonh Paul II 1990) . Since then, some religious communities from all traditions chose to partially or completely move their activities to the Internet, creating the phenomenon of \"online churches\" (Hutchings 2017) .",

            "text": "Hence, the possibility of participating in the Pope's mass through media technology is not something new or extraordinary. However, an image such as that of Pope Francis preaching alone in St Peter's square is arguably impactful because it makes people aware of the absence of physicality during the function and the empty space around the pontiff. The intensification of online mediation during the Covid-19 pandemic urges scholars to further reflect upon questions they have already asked for decades: how does mediation affect religious communities, identities, and authorities? How do people recreate a sense of materiality through digital technologies? How are spaces of religious practice negotiated online? With these questions as starting point, the aim of this article is to present theoretical reflections on the notion of \"virtual environment\" in relation to religion. Concerning terminology, in the article I will predominantly use the term \"space\" instead of \"environment.\" This is because I draw from theories that define space as the result of material and mental practices (Knott 2014) , and help me contextualize space as connected to the Internet. In the first part of the article, I will explain that online and offline spaces are entangled in contemporary religious practices by presenting the theoretical framework of \"digital religion\" (Campbell 2012) . Then, I will discuss the notion of materiality in relation to the theory of mediation (Meyer 2010) . I will also offer reflections on the notion of space and the Internet, discussing the spatial turn in religious studies and the notion of third spaces of digital religion (Hoover and Echchaibi 2014) . Lastly, I will discuss the theory of hypermediation (Scolari 2015) to describe the fluid interactions between different media platforms and physical spaces. It is important to notice that materiality and space are increasingly incorporated in studies of technologies, media, and related fields (see, for instance, Herzogenrath 2015) , so this article is connected to larger scholarly debates on these topics.",

In specific, I will describe Neo-Pagan online rituals to explore how digital religion employs materiality to enhance a sense of communal participation. I will also analyze the diffusion of the hashtag #NousSommesUnis (We Are United), spread by French Muslims in the aftermath of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, as an example of how digital religion exists in spaces across different platforms. Then, I will analyze the case of a Catholic church in Italy employing live streaming as a substitute for physical engagement during the Covid-19 lockdown to show how materiality and space are hypermediated during moments of limited physical interactions. This last case is the only one addressing religion during the Covid-19 pandemic, and aims both at highlighting how this historical moment intensified online practices, and at stressing continuities with previous examples of digital religion. These case studies are based on my own research and present data acquired through qualitative interviews and qualitative content analysis of media texts. Establishing whether online religious functions and interactions are authentic is beyond the scope of this article, but it aims at offering an overview of theories on materiality, space, and religion that will hopefully help understand online and offline performances as entangled rather than separated.",

            "text": "Because religious groups have employed the Internet since the 1990s, this is also the period when scholars started analyzing empirical cases of religion in Internet venues. While it is a relatively recent field of study, the exploration of religion and the Internet already underwent four waves of research (Hojsgaard and Warburg 2005; L\u00f6vheim and Campbell 2017) . The first wave, which took place in the 1990s, tends to describe the Internet as a space that is separate from physical reality, and that invites practices unrelated to the offline dimension. This is why scholars employed terms such as \"cyberspace\" and \"cyber-religion\" (Brasher 2004) , which indicated the Interned as a space \"other\" than everyday activities. During the second wave of studies on religion and the Internet, scholars started to approach digital spaces in a more nuanced way. In the early 2000s, Christopher Helland (2000) introduced the distinction between \"religion online,\" indicating established religious groups that use the Internet to enhance their activities, and \"online religion,\" describing interactive online practices existing mostly, or exclusively, online. This distinction is important because, first, it stresses the existence of religious groups that simultaneously occupy online spaces and offline-material-spaces. Second, it highlights how the Internet can create new types of practices that are intrinsically different from those occurring without the aid of digital technologies.",

The aforementioned example of Pope Francis preaching in St Peter's square during the Covid-19 lockdown can be considered an instance of digital religion as it shows how an offline space can be mediated to enhance offline practices. Believers would have been unable to listen and watch Pope Francis doing the Urbi et Orbi blessing without media technologies, but at the same time the ritual is based on a material space. Therefore, this shows how media technology creates new conditions for the practice of religion where materiality and space do not disappear, but are present in new forms.",

The notion of onlife indicates the blurring of boundaries between real and virtual, as well as of the distinction between human, machine, and nature. While in this article I still employ the terms \"online\" and \"offline\" to describe practices that are connected to the Internet or to physical spaces, I embrace the idea of thinking of religious practices as increasingly \"onlife.\" Rethinking the terminologies that describe digital religion also helps to account for the contemporary high-tech society where many interpersonal communications occur through digital media, including religious experiences.",

First, most works analyzing examples of religion and media, including the case studies I present in this article, focus on contexts, such as the North American or European ones, with a high presence of digital media (Hjarvard and Lovheim 2012) . Scholars also need to consider that there are locations where Internet connection is scarcer, and that the condition of being onlife depends on economic possibility, access to technology, media education, and skills. Second, while media proliferate in several contexts, there are religious communities that make the conscious choice of not engaging with technology. The work of Campbell (2007) on the so-called \"kosher phone\" K describes how certain ultra-orthodox Jewish communities in Israel work together with developers to create smartphones that only connect to sites deemed appropriate by religious authorities. This is an example of how religious groups can consciously negotiate the boundaries between online and offline spaces even in highly mediated contexts. Religious communities' agency in employing new technologies has also been explored by Campbell with the notion of \"spiritualizing the Internet,\" an approach that frames the Internet as suitable for religious engagements (Campbell 2005, p. 2) . This theoretical standpoint is further elaborated in analyzing how religious people create meaning through media narratives, in what Campbell defines \"technological apologetic\" (Campbell 2020b) .",

This approach marks a material turn that rejects the dualism between mind and body, and considers art, music, spatial practices, clothing, and literature as integral parts of the religious experience. According to David Morgan (2016) , material practices are not secondary aspects, but they are the very core of religion. Examples of religious materiality include the Muslim female veil, which does not only indicate religious belonging, but symbolizes complex negotiations in terms of ethnic identity and status (\u00dcnal and Moors 2012) . Besides, Valentina Napolitano (2019) analyzes the act of Pope Francis to show a wooden cross on the Italian island of Lampedusa, where several migrants arrived in dinghy boats from North Africa. The cross, made of wood from shipwrecked boats, became a powerful material symbol employed to unite people and emotionally move them.",

(p. 13) Meyer explains mediation with the example of the Catholic icon: even if it is human-made, it is believed to embody the sacred presence, and it can be experienced with the senses, through a gaze, a prayer, or a kiss (ibidem). Mediation, a theory elaborated also in relation to media consumption (Martin-Barbero 1993), is here conceptualized as a process that brings believers from immanence to transcendence through religious media. The term \"media,\" in this context, designates all the objects, performances, and pieces of art that participate in the religious experience, and includes audiovisual media, studied by Meyer in Pentecostal-charismatic churches in Ghana. Drawing, among others, from the work of Meyer, Arjun Appadurai (2015) situates the relationship between mediation and materiality beyond the study of religion, describing as \"mediants\" all the human and non-human actors that participate in material practices, such as those connected to housing and shelter.",

First, digital artifacts and technological devices-smartphones, tablets, computers-are themselves material objects that can embody the religious experience (Campbell and Connelly 2020) . Second, digital media may not allow tactile practices, but they facilitate visual culture which, Morgan (2005) writes, also helps to materialize religion by providing a \"sacred gaze\" connected to the sensors consumption of images. Third, there are practices that help \"rematerializing\" the digital. As Tim writes, the materiality of the Internet lies in the different affordances of the platforms-including design, aesthetics, coding, and interfaces-as well as in the actions and relations that digital practices make possible. Hutchings employs various examples to illustrate this approach: applications that create the possibility of reading the Bible on a technological device and connect with other believers, printed Bibles linked to online videos to enhance the reading experience, and graves with QR codes that permit people to grieve their loved ones with the help of dedicated websites. These case studies show how materiality can be embedded in Internet practices that activate relationships and identities.",

The case of online rituals can illustrate how materiality and mediation are connected: in exploring Buddhist meditation in virtual environments, Heidi Campbell and Louise Connelly (2020) highlight how people meditate through avatars and digital artifacts that reproduce material objects, while at the same time reproducing practices in the offline space. This is also true for Neo-Paganism, an umbrella term that includes several religious communities that draw from pre-Christian beliefs. These groups share various characteristics and usually accord great importance to rituals and community practices, which they adapted to online environments already in the 1990s (Grieve 1995) . While not all Neo-Pagans employ digital technologies, many rely on the Internet to get in contact with like-minded people and create online communities (Renser and Tiidenberg 2020) . Douglas Cowan (2005) discusses Neo-Pagan online rituals as creating a placeness experience, and emphasizes that an Internet-mediated experience cannot replicate the sensorial practices that people are supposed to activate in a physical location. However, in my previous work (Evolvi 2020 ) I argued that Neo-Pagan online engagement, while indubitably different than an offline ritual, is also characterized by material expressions.",

But as far as I'm concerned cyberspace is astral, is a different portion of that plane so you are making an energetic connection with the priestess and the leader, what I do when I'm doing ritual is that I visualize a connection being made with all different people around physically (personal communication, 17 September 2016) In this quote, the interviewee described the importance of visualization to give a sense of physicality and materiality to an online ritual. In the interview, she also explained some strategies to embed material practices in online rituals, such as creating altars and placing candles near the computer. For example, she described a ritual of abundance where people are encouraged to take an egg, paint some symbols on it with cinnamon and vegetable oil while in front of the computer, and eat it the day after. This practice helps people to feel the material part of the ritual while at the same time being connected with others through the Internet. Materiality is embedded in various ways: the computer is a material object that makes people feel connected with each other, tangible objects such as eggs and candles help believers recreate a sense of materiality around the computer, and imagination allows the participants to visualize the ritual and raise the energy as a community. The interviewee, as per the aforementioned quote, considered cyberspace as an astral place, where it is possible to conduct a ritual. According to this approach, the online rituals enabled by the JaguarMoon community are an example of online mediation as they consider the online connections and the objects around the computer as concurring to help believers attain the transcendental.",

Kim Knott (2014) invites us \"to reflect about space as a medium in which religion is situated\" (p. 3), not only considering spaces that are \"sacred,\" but mapping the presence of religion in everyday spaces. From this perspective, space is created through interpersonal relations and embodied experiences, and includes both religious and non-religious manifestations. Knott draws from Lefebvre (1992) to conceptualize space in both material and metaphorical terms. In particular, Lefebvre describes a spatial triad constituted by three dialectically interconnected aspects. First, space can be conceived, meaning that it holds certain pre-planned characteristics that are usually connected to power relations. Second, space can be lived, which means that it may be modified by people's imagination and their disruptive practices, but it is also connected to traditions and symbols. Lastly, space can be perceived, connected to spatial practices that condition how people use a certain environment through their performances. This triad shows how space has certain aims, but these aims can be subverted by both imaginary and material efforts. Applied to religion, this distinction suggests that religious groups and individuals can negotiate spatial practices and imaginaries to either maintain certain hegemonic and traditional spaces or create new uses for existing spaces.",

For example, Christian churches in Europe are sometimes converted into non-religious places, or they might be used by other religions, such as Islam.

For instance, Mia L\u00f6vheim (2011) analyzes young women's blogs as \"ethical spaces\" that exist at the interstice of producers, texts, and users. This ties to larger debates in media studies, which describe the Internet through spatial metaphors (Rogers 2015) or approach spatiality as potentially enabling discursive performances online (boyd and danah 2006).

Drawing from Homi Bhabha's (2004) conceptualization of hybrid spaces, Hoover and Echchaibi consider third spaces as generative of hybrid identities and aesthetic imaginaries that derive from the encounter of different online and offline narratives. Hence, even if the Internet might not seem an authentic space for all religious believers, people engaging with third spaces usually consider them as authentic venues for religious practices. Not all online environments hold such characteristics, but third spaces are venues that people approach as-if they are legitimate spaces of religious practice and discussion. For instance, Susanne Stadlbauer (2021) applies the theoretical framework of third spaces to the study of Salafist YouTube videos, conceptualizing them as spaces where they try to recreate a sense of \"purity\" of the first Islam.

The hashtag was created in 2015 by the French interfaith association Coexister and used in a video by the student association \u00c9tudiants Musulmans de France (EMF, French Muslim Students). I have analyzed the diffusion of the hashtag as an example of how young people engage with digital media (Evolvi 2019) . To understand how different spaces concur to create certain discourses, it is useful to trace a brief history of #NousSommesUnis. First, the hashtag was created shortly after the terrorist attacks of the 13th November 2015 in Paris to condemn Islamic terrorism and show that young people from different faiths were united against violence. The hashtag became popular thanks to a video produced and circulated by Muslim members of EMF (EMF Asso 2015) where several people show a sign with #NousSommesUnis, while a voiceover reads a poem expressing grief for the attacks. National and international media outlets discussed the hashtag (see, for example, Buratti 2015) . The increasing visibility of the hashtag created multiple venues for people to use it, both online and offline. For example, other people who wanted to show solidarity created videos inspired by the original EMF video, and several individuals and associations used it on social networks also in relation to other attacks and forms of violence. Besides, #NousSommesUnis became an interfaith group with a website (www.noussommesunis.com) used to promote cohesion, collect petitions, and publish people's testimonies. As Fig. 1 shows, the hashtag has also been displayed during demonstrations against violence. The tweet that embeds the picture reads \"At 16 in front of the City Hall of Rouen\", and has the hashtags #NousSommesUnis and #NousSommesEnsamble (We Are Together) .",

The hashtag enabled young French Muslims, who usually do not have many opportunities to express themselves in the public sphere, a safe space to have their voices heard. This metaphorical space helped change the terms of mainstream conversations, as media reported also this story instead of only focusing on Islamic violence. Moreover, similarly to the blogs explored by Pennington (2018) , the website #NousSommesUnis collects people's voices and becomes a third space where religious identities are discussed. If the practice of circulating online narratives and images can create a space of dialogue, it also has an impact on material spaces. For instance, in the video, #Nous-Sommes-Unis is written on billboards and paper signs and physically displayed by people. Something similar happens in the picture shown by Fig. 1 , where the hashtag is used to bring people together in a manifestation of solidarity. These practices, which are based on physical spaces, are then remediated on platforms such as YouTube and Twitter. This example shows how the Internet can embed materiality and space in both metaphorical and material ways.",

Differently, digital communication creates the possibilities for people to participate by creating content and circulate their discourses across platforms.

In particular, people create religious narratives to rapidly reach like-minded users or to spread fear and anger against those who are perceived as different. In doing so, they create spaces that are between alternative and mainstream narrations, public and private feelings, and real and imaginary religious experiences. It is for this reason that I define \"hypermediated religious spaces\" those spaces that exist between various platforms, are connected with offline and material experiences, and would not hold the same qualities without the Internet.",

            "text": "During the Covid-19 lockdown, as exemplified by Pope Francis' Urbi et Orbi, Catholic communities had an unprecedented push to digitalization that forced them to find new communicative paradigms (Sabat\u00e9 Gauxachs et al. 2021) . The work of Eline Huygens (2021) on Roman Catholic practitioners during Covid-19 lockdown suggests that people found different strategies to reproduce, or address the lack of, materiality, embodiment, and performativity within digital religion. An example can be found in a live streaming done on the 3rd of May 2020 by the Catholic priest of Manerbio, a town in Northern Italy. The city of Manerbio is situated in the region of Lombardy, the first hit by the Covid virus in Europe, and was among the areas most affected by the pandemic. In spring 2020, the Italian authorities issued a complete lockdown in the country, and people could not attend church functions and celebrate funerals. To address this issue, several priests and religious leaders decided to live stream rituals online. The priest of Manerbio performed a commemorative mass to honor the 150 people from the town that had lost their lives due to Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, and live-streamed it on Facebook. The priest put candles, flowers, and pieces of paper with the names of the decease on the church's benches, where the believers used to seat, as can be seen in Fig. 2 . The mass rapidly gained national resonance (see, for instance, RAI News 2020), as the video and pictures of the empty church with the metaphorical presence of the town's deceased emotionally moved people across the country. I consider this an example of hypermediation because it involved different spaces, both enacted through media technologies and embedded in material practices. The physical space of the church, inaccessible because of the Covid-19 lockdown, was mediated through technologies and consumed in people's private places. Furthermore, the aesthetic of the mass, completed by flowers and candles, was remediated through the Internet, and from there through national television channels and newspapers. This allowed both for the amplification of the event through the live streaming of the space of the church in Manerbio, and for the creation of a space where people could comment, create narratives, and discuss their feelings. Hence, on the Fig. 2 A picture of the livestreamed mass in Manerbio, Brescia. Retrieved from RAI News, https://www.rainews.it/ dl/rainews/media/ContentItem-41e0fe7b-5d65-41c6-8d02-385fad4075e5.html#foto-1 Facebook page of the Parish of Manerbio (Parrocchia di Manerbio 2020), where the priest streamed the video and posted pictures of the mass, members of the local community could leave messages offering each other condolences and remembering the deceased. Moreover, several media outlets posted the story on their social networks pages (see, for instance, SkyTG24 2020), attracting comments from people across the country, who often expressed sorrow and solidarity even if they did not have any personal connection with the city of Manerbio. While the case of the Pope's Urbi et Orbi seems similar to the mass in Manerbio-as the space normally filled with believers was empty, and people followed the ceremony through digital technologies-the two created a different model of people's engagement. The Pope's mass mirrored a physical mass in St. Peter's square, with believers being the relatively passive audience of the pontiff. Differently, the priest of Manerbio seemed to invite people's conversations, as the event was done specifically to involve the members of the local community and give them a space to grief. Therefore, as happened with #NousSommesUnis, the images of the mass in Manerbio rapidly travelled across media platforms also because of people's engagement in circulating them.",

In the live-streamed mass in Manerbio, each candle symbolized a person who passed away because of Covid, metaphorically creating the condition to express grief that did not take place during a funeral. Members of the community did not directly experience the materiality of the candles, but they could experience the symbology of that materiality through the visual mediation of the Internet. This process was characterized by the creation of a space between different venues. First, people experienced the public space of the church, usually associated with town life and community activities, in the private space of their homes. Second, the event was streamed through the Internet to a local community, but it became part of mainstream conversations as it was discussed by various national media. Third, the mass was based on physical space and rooted in materiality, but became effective through the imaginative efforts of people who consumed it through mediation and understood the metaphorical role of candles. Therefore, this can be considered a case of hypermediation not only because it involved space and materiality, but also because it existed at the intersection of various media platforms and spaces.",

If the notion of \"onlife\" (Floridi 2015) can partially help to highlight the interconnections between online and offline venues, it still needs to be adapted to the negotiation of online religious identities, communities, and authorities. In thinking about terminology, it is important to consider the differences and similarities between types of space: as exemplified by the cases analyzed in this article, some online venues are reproductions of physical ones, while others are live streaming of what happens in a material space, and others are spaces of dialogue and connection. Hence, scholars need to consider digital religion as creating various types of space that are not static, but continuing changing and in conversation with each other, and they need to find theoretical approaches and definitions that reflect these characteristics.",

Therefore, hypermediated spaces do not necessarily reproduce hegemonic spaces, but they also offer the possibility of subverting the status quo by creating new religious imaginaries. Neo-Pagans and Muslims in non-Muslim countries can use the Internet to create communities they do not find in their local environments and establish narratives that are not present in so-called mainstream media. By paying attention to issues of social justice and activisms, the study of digital religion can also explore social inequalities and the creation of alternative spaces. This perspective is also an invitation to look at the creation of spaces outside contexts with a high media usage, and going beyond the North American and European focus that characterizes the study of digital religion.",

This aspect is intensified when people do not have the possibilities of meeting in person, as happened during the Covid-19 lockdown with the mass in Manerbio. However, if the Covid-19 pandemic forced people to employ certain tools, it did not drastically change communication dynamics. Certain minority groups, such as Neo-Pagans or Muslims in Europe, had already employed online communication because of social marginalization or lack of physical communities. What the Covid-19 lock-down did is make mediation almost inevitable for the experience of religion. While some hypermediated practices might disappear when social and physical distancing rules are no longer in place, the intensification of Internet connections during moments of lockdown likely created the conditions to think of space, materiality, and digital religion in new ways.",
