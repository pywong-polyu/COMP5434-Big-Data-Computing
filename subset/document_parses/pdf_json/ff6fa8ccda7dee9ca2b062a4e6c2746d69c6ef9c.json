[4] Indeed, patients with severe COVID-19 have exhausted antiviral defenses and massive tissue and systemic inflammatory response. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that could have a role in promoting the resolution of ARF in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

Multivariable Cox proportional-hazard models estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of both the primary composite endpoint and all-cause death, with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), taking into account the confounding factors (i.e., sex, age, and baseline values of SOFA score, PaO 2 :FiO 2 , CRP levels) potentially associated with the outcome. These variables and others with baseline differences (e.g. smoke) were tested in univariate survival models and variables significant at p=0.1 were tested in the multivariable models. Proportional hazards assumption was assessed by visual inspection of the log(-log(survival)) plot. There were no missing data with regard neither to the composite primary endpoint and the adjustment factors included in the final Cox models, nor to MV-free days. Available case analysis was performed for time variation of C-reactive protein (CRP) and PaO 2 :FiO 2 levels.

            "text": "Early interventions aimed at down regulating the SARS-CoV-2-associated hyper-immune response in severe COVID-19 patients may well avoid disease progression and enhance pneumonia resolution. The cytokine profile reported for these patients [13] is within the broad range of regulation provided by corticosteroids [14] , particularly MP that is associated with an optimal lung penetration. [15] Our study protocol involved an initial iv bolus to achieve rapid, almost complete A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t glucocorticoid receptor saturation, followed by an infusion to reach a total 160-milligram dose over the first 24 hours and to maintain high levels of response throughout the treatment period. After day 7, treatment duration was guided by monitoring the anti-inflammatory response and oxygenation parameters. Our study investigated a dose more than double the one investigated in the RECOVERY RCT and included tapering to minimize the risk of rebound inflammation. This might explain the rapid reduction observed in inflammatory markers. Treatment duration was guided by monitoring the anti-inflammatory response and oxygenation after at least 8 days. Our MP treatment response is similar to that of randomized controlled studies (RCTs) in COVID-19 [16] , non-viral ARDS [17] and severe pneumonia [18] , as well as of large-scale observational studies in severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV (n=7008) [19] [20] [21] and H1N1 influenza (n=2141). [22] Additional support for the use of methylprednisolone in COVID-19 originates from transcriptomics data. After matching the expression changes induced by SARS-CoV2 in human lung tissue tissues and A549 lung cell line against the expression changes triggered by 5,694 FDAapproved drugs, methylprednisolone was found to be the drug with the greatest potential to revert the changes induced by COVID-19. [23] This study has been carried out before the results of the RECOVERY RCT became available, as visible by clinicaltrials.gov posting records (results first posted June 4, 2020). In the RECOVERY trial, patients were randomized to receive dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg/day or standard of care alone, providing evidence of a lower 28-day mortality in the dexamethasone group compared to the usual care group only among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%) or oxygen alone (23.3% vs. 26.2%) at randomization, but not among those receiving no respiratory support. In our study, both mortality and mortality reduction in the MP group were better than reported in the RECOVERY trial. Apart from the different study design and setting, we speculate this difference is possibly due several reasons: first, the RECOVERY trial uses a different drug (dexamethasone) at a lower dose, equivalent to approximately 32 mg of methylprednisolone. [24] Second, it is likely that MP has pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages over dexamethasone, despite lung penetration needs further comparison. [24] Third, in the RECOVERY trial, the impact of the study treatment on survival seems to correlate with the need for respiratory support and therefore with illness severity. In this support, it was already noticed that glucocorticoids are not effective in patients without ARDS and/or sepsis. [18] While permissive inclusion criteria are needed to recruit large populations in RCTs, we have designed strict criteria that allowed us to include in the analyses only patients affected by severe pneumonia/ARDS with high levels of systemic inflammation and need for respiratory support. It is worth stressing that inflammatory organ injury with subsequent dysregulated host response is thought to be the main A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t mechanism of damage in COVID-19; as a consequence, the subgroup of patients having markedly elevated levels of inflammatory markers is the one supposed to benefit most from therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing inflammatory organ injury, including corticosteroids.",

[17] In these RCTs, hyperglycemia was transient in response to the initial loading bolus and did not impact negatively on outcome. [17] Viral shedding in both groups of our study was in agreement with international literature. [25, 26] The WHO quotes a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus study to warn about the risk for reduction in viral clearance with corticosteroid treatment. In the Arabi et al. study [27] , however, those that received corticosteroid treatment for greater than seven days (similar to our study) had a fifty percent reduction in mortality [aOR: 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-1.00; p= 0.05] and no impact on viral clearance (aHR: 0.94, 95% CI 0.36-2.47; p= 0.90). Moreover, there is no evidence linking delayed viral clearance to worsened outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and it is unlikely that it would have a greater negative impact than the host's own cytokine storm. [28] The observational design of our study implies some obvious limitations, namely a possible restricted control over data collection and potential inclusion biases. However, internal validity was achieved by (1) the comparability of concurrent groups at baseline, (2) . accounting for potential confounders into the multivariable Cox regression analyses, and (3) conducting sensitivity analysis to assess for potential bias in outcome ascertainment potentially influenced by medical decision making. Our study's strengths include a prospective evaluation of a pre-designed intervention protocol based on established pharmacological principles in patients at high risk of progression to ARF and death. Limitations of the study is that we did not control for center effects and site investigators were not blinded to treatment as with any observational study. Despite these limitations, we believe that our findings represent valid and generalizable conclusions, that have been further strengthened by the recently published RECOVERY RCT.",

            "text": "Indeed, we observed benefits when MP treatment was started early and prolonged in the hospitalization of hypoxemic patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at high risk of ARF progression. MP treatment was demonstrated to be safe, and also allowed for a significant reduction in mortality and immediate improvements in systemic inflammation and oxygenation markers, as well as reducing invasive MV times. We believe our data support the evidence that early low-dose prolonged MP treatment can decrease ICU burden and mortality, therefore contributing to reduce the concern surrounding this therapeutic approach in patients admitted with ARF due to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the current state of affairs.

Upper panel: time-course of C-reactive protein levels (mean \u00b1 standard error). The differences between groups were significant at days 3 and 7. Middle panel: time course of mean PaO 2 :FiO 2 .
