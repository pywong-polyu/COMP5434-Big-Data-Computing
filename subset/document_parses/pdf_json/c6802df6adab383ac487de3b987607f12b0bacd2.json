By profiling the lung and colon transcriptome and lung proteome of nine patients who died of COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, we obtained molecular insights into the host response to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, all samples had a low viral burden, a finding that suggests the patients' deaths may be due to uncontrolled host inflammatory processes rather than an active viral infection. Taken together, our findings shed light on COVID-19 pathophysiology and offer potential therapeutic targets for severe COVID-19 disease.

Surprisingly, even though these patients all died of COVID-19 pneumonia and displayed a significant transcriptional response relative to healthy controls, there were very few viral reads present in the samples (Dataset S3). Out of an average of 98.2 million reads per sample (Dataset S4), we recovered only 2 to 177 viral reads in six of the cases. The other three cases had no reads that mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome at all; however, directed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR of the input RNA used for RNA sequencing confirmed the presence of virus in these samples at low abundance (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ).

            "text": "Neutrophil Activation and Pulmonary Fibrosis Are Major Contributors to the Pathogenesis in the Lung. To systematically identify biological pathways representative of the host tissue response in COVID-19, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of significantly up-and down-regulated genes. The top 60 enriched GO terms were further organized into a network with edges connecting overlapping gene sets. The functional modules were identified as the mutually overlapping gene sets clustered together and named using GO hierarchical structure terms (Fig. 2B) . Some of the modules identified, such as \"leukocyte migration\" and \"chromosome segregation\" (the latter of which contains gene sets relevant to mitosis and cell division), are not unexpected in response to severe infection. Other modules, however, seemed less intuitive as a response to a viral pneumonia. The top two hits from the GO analysis of upregulated genes reflected neutrophil activation and neutrophilmediated immunity (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A ), a finding that is consistent with the neutrophilic infiltrate observed upon histologic assessment of these tissues. Closer inspection of the upregulated genes in the neutrophil activation pathways revealed many genes involved in the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), such as myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin, and histones ( Fig. 2C and Dataset S5). NETs are known to form in the setting of infections as a defense mechanism against pathogens, including viruses (12) ; however, dysregulated NETosis triggered by platelets can lead to ongoing tissue damage and thrombosis (13, 14) . Patients with COVID-19 have been found to have increased serum levels of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and citrullinated histone H3, both of which are markers of NETs (15) . Using immunofluorescence, we identified foci where myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase, and cytoplasmic DNA were colocalized (Fig. 2D) , an observation that demonstrates the presence of NETs in the lungs of fatal COVID cases. Given the paucity of viral RNA present in these samples and the overwhelming degree of pulmonary thromboses identified during the autopsies of these patients, it is possible that these NETs have been triggered by platelets rather than SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of platelet factor 4, which is often involved in platelet-triggered NETosis (16) , is increased within the cases by \u223c5.5-fold (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ).",

Indeed, many of these patients had been symptomatic for nearly a month prior to their ultimate demise, and they may have begun to enter the fibrotic phase of diffuse alveolar damage (18) . Moreover, it has been noted that patients with severe COVID-19 develop a more typical picture of acute respiratory distress syndrome with eventual loss of lung compliance (19) . Considered together, our findings help bridge the clinical and histological observations with their molecular bases.",

Additionally, we observed down-regulated expression of three genes that are markers for pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), which are specialized epithelial cells important in airway sensory function that are innervated by neurons (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B ). Intriguingly, defects in PNECs can lead to altered cytokine production and increased lung inflammation (23, 24) . Broadly, there is growing evidence of neuroimmune interactions in the lung (25, 26) , and the down-regulation of these pathways may reflect an immunomodulatory process. Future work will be needed to determine whether distinct lung-innervating neuronal subtypes or their synaptic nerve terminals are affected in lung tissues following infection.",

None of the nine patients had any gastrointestinal symptoms based on their medical records; however, we did detect all of the three marker genes of SARS-CoV-2 in one of the patients, and some fragments in other patients using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR ( Fig. 3A and Dataset S3), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could exist in the gastrointestinal tract even when the primary infection-site lung had a very low viral load. We further examined the transcriptional response in the gastrointestinal tract by performing total RNA sequencing on the FFPE colon samples from these 9 fatal cases and 10 uninfected individuals as control. We found that although there is no obvious pathogenesis in the colon tissue based on histological examination, there is a dramatic change in the transcriptome in the colon tissues in the fatal cases when compared to healthy controls. With the caveat that the control samples represent histologically normal tissue obtained from patients with colon cancer, a total of 4,932 genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed genes, with 1,246 upregulated and 3,686 down-regulated genes in the cases (Fig. 3B ). Principal component analysis (PCA) of all samples from the two tissue sites revealed clear separation of the lung and colon in the controls, while the tissue-specific separation is not so clear in the cases (Fig. 3C ). Consistent with the PCA, the pairwise Euclidean distances among the samples within the same tissue type is significantly lower than the pairwise Euclidean distances among the samples across the tissue types in the controls, while such comparison is no longer significant in COVID-19 cases (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ).",

Several enriched pathways in the up-regulated genes in the colon related to the response to the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), suggesting that there is a local response to TGF-\u03b2 in the colon. The only GO term enriched in the down-regulated genes and shared by the two tissue sites was \"long-chain fatty acid catabolic process.\" The top nine of the enriched GO terms in downregulated genes involved in immune cell activation and immunity suggested the immune system is disrupted in other organs as well.

To better integrate our findings with what is already known about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in the lung, we examined expression of genes that have previously been implicated in viral entry. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry (28), was increased by approximately fourfold in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 (Fig. 4A ). TMPRSS2, a cellular serine protease that primes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and has been shown to be important in facilitating viral entry into cells (28) , is down-regulated in the lungs of fatal COVID-19 cases (Fig. 4A) . Two other proteases, cathepsins B and L, which are able to substitute for TMPRSS2 (28) , had increased expression (Fig. 4A) , an observation that suggests these cathepsins might be the more relevant proteases for viral entry into the lung epithelium. regulation of protein complex disassembly regulation of exocytosis negative regulation of intracellular transport regulation of synaptic vesicle cycle regulation of wound healing cellular divalent inorganic cation homeostasis chondrocyte proliferation regulation of developmental growth retrograde trans\u2212synaptic signaling regulation of cellular response to growth factor stimulus endothelial cell differentiation transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling pathway response to transforming growth factor beta endothelium development regulation of glucose import cellular response to transforming growth factor beta stimulus vasculogenesis maintenance of location response to chemokine IMP biosynthetic process endodermal cell differentiation osteoblast differentiation response to nutrient cellular response to toxic substance mitotic cell cycle checkpoint ossification response to oxidative stress detoxification leukocyte migration mitotic sister chromatid segregation mitotic nuclear division antimicrobial humoral response antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial peptide collagen metabolic process neutrophil mediated immunity DNA packaging neutrophil activation extracellular structure organization Additionally, in an effort to contextualize our transcriptome findings through the prism of functional genomics, we examined the expression level of genes that regulate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis as identified in a CRISPR screen (29) , that interact with SARS-CoV-2 as assessed by protein-protein interactions (30) , and that predispose to severe infection as characterized in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) (31) (Fig. 4B and Datasets S7-S9). Seven of the 104 genes identified in the CRISPR screen were up-regulated in our transcriptome data (ACE2, CTSB, CTSL, and SERPINB13 are proviral; STRAP, GTF2H2, and GEMIN6 are antiviral), and 6 genes were downregulated (SMARCB1, ZFHX3, and CST6 are proviral; ZNF250, XRCC3, and KAT14 are antiviral). Of the 332 human proteins found to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, 34 were differentially expressed in our dataset, with the overwhelming majority (29 genes) being up-regulated. None of the genes identified in the GWAS screen were differentially expressed in the lung tissue of fatal cases, but XCL2, a chemokine ligand of one of the hits (XCR1), was significantly down-regulated. This subset of genes that have been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and have altered expression levels in the lung of severe cases may help guide future drug development for COVID-19.",

Given the low viral load in these patients, the sustained elevation of S100A8/A9 level lends further support to the idea that an uncontrolled immune reaction contributes to the pathology. GO enrichment analysis of significantly up-regulated proteins identified four neutrophil-related GO terms as top enriched GO terms, as well as extracellular structure organization (SI Appendix, Fig. S8) , consistent with the enriched GO pathways identified in the transcriptome data. Therefore, these highly expressed proteins such as S100 proteins, might represent potential therapeutic targets that facilitate regulation of the excessive inflammation response in COVID-19 patients with severe disease.",

Given that our data originate from a cohort of patients who died of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, during the very beginning of the pandemic, these data will serve as an important resource that helps provide a baseline of the host response to the earliest SARS-CoV-2 strains against which future datasets can be compared. It is likely that mutations will continue to accumulate in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the host response of future patient cohorts can subsequently be compared to this Wuhan dataset to better understand the evolution of host-virus interactions. Moreover, this Wuhan cohort represents the closest approximation to the \"natural history\" of COVID-19 that is likely to be studied, particularly since later patients-even in the early stages of the outbreak in the United States-were quickly being enrolled in a variety of clinical trials to assess different therapeutics. The finding that these fatal cases had a low viral load in the setting of massive transcriptional changes is suggestive that patient deaths may be more related to an overexuberant and uncontrolled host response rather than unabated viral replication. This observation is consistent with what was seen in patients who died of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections and fits within the damage-response framework (37, 38) , which holds that ongoing host damage may be the result of the host immune response rather than persistent microbial interactions. Moreover, our findings of a low viral burden at the time of fatal outcome may help explain why direct antivirals, such as remdesivir (39) , are more effective in patients with less severe disease and dexamethasone, an immunosuppressant, is associated with reduced mortality in severely ill patients late in disease (40) .",

For example, our finding that expression of IL-6 is not increased in the lungs of these fatal cases highlights that anti-IL-6 therapies may not be an effective treatment for severe, late-stage COVID-19 pneumonia, which is consistent with preliminary randomized clinical trial findings (41, 42) . The observation that neutrophils are transcriptionally enriched in the lungs with histologic evidence of NET formation may provide scientific justification for the 9 ongoing clinical trials testing the efficacy of dornase alfa. Moreover, the finding that expression of cathepsins B and L-but not TMPRSS2-is elevated in the lungs suggests that inhibitors of these proteases may help prevent viral entry (43) . Continued study of the host response in concert with ongoing viral evolution will be critical to better understand these host-virus dynamics and provide a more complete understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.",
