Due to a rise in telemedicine use by doctors and patients, it is imperative to understand the perception of patients towards the adoption of telemedicine, the availability of telemedicine to the general population, the frequency with which patients avail these services, and the motivation or apprehensions in using them, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aims The study is performed to understand the behavioral attitude and perceptions of the population regarding telemedicine and, in doing so, make services more user-friendly for patients. Methods A total of 1170 participants were surveyed using a structured online questionnaire to assess the perceptions towards the adoption of telemedicine in healthcare delivery services. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify key variables of knowledge and attitude affecting the utilization of telemedicine. Results Of the total respondents, 35.3% of patients never encountered telemedicine before and 26.9% did not come across telemedicine even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Understanding the perceptions of patients, using targeted health education, positive communication, and behavioral modifications, is the key factor to be addressed to mitigate the apprehensions towards telemedicine and improve the utilization of the services.",

It also provides a platform for research and continuing education of healthcare service providers [1] . Asia is the home to a burgeoning market for telemedicine services due to ease of availability, accessibility of affordable internet, better bandwidth, and smartphones with video cameras. The COVID-19 pandemic has garnered the relevance of telemedicine and drawn the highest attention ever since its advent [2, 3] . Telemedicine has played a potential role in times of humanitarian crisis like hurricanes and pandemics wherein victims were relocated from their homes and their primary healthcare providers [4, 5] . It is also playing a crucial role in the present pandemic, as one of the safest interactive means between the patients and clinicians as social distancing is necessary [6] . Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and India have issued legislation for telemedicine implementation. They have also witnessed an increase in the uptake among patients and providers. However, to scale up its usage and maintain long-term sustainability, a user-friendly and robust system needs to be adapted by analyzing evidence about telemedicine and its use among patients and health professionals [7] . The few advantages of telemedicine are that it offers healthcare services to people in rural or poorly accessible areas, elderly populations with mobility issues, and vulnerable patients from unnecessary exposure to the infectious environment of hospitals [6, 8] . Less or no transportation and waiting time, easy access to specialists, lower risk of catching a new infection, and better healthcare management are some added benefits of telemedicine to patients and healthcare professionals. It also facilitates frequent consultation with their physicians, ensuring better management of medication, lifestyle, and health complications without having the difficulties of going into hospitals [8] [9] [10] .",

In telemedicine, lack of physical examination can result in patient apprehension and potentially impede the patient-doctor rapport. Breach of patient confidentiality and private medical data are few concerns associated with the usage of telemedicine [9, 13] . Few companies deny insurance coverage for telemedicine consultations, and there is no clear medicolegal framework or regulatory body regarding telemedicine used to resolve issues like privacy, malpractice, and liabilities. These can lead to underconfidence and lack of trust in using telemedicine [14] [15] [16] [17] . With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of Southeast Asian countries have altered policies to reduce these barriers to telemedicine and expand mobile health expansibility [7] .",

In the subsequent waves of the pandemic, due to the mutant and highly virulent strains, a rapid spread is witnessed, resulting in great burden and burnout on healthcare professionals. In these circumstances, telemedicine has emerged as a convenient medium to get a grip over the situation. Telemedicine is used for providing online consultations for COVID-19 patients at home isolation and telemonitoring of their lab reports, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and sugar levels by asking specific questions. Sensors for tracking the location of oxygen/ICU bed availability in hospitals, etc., were highly useful means implemented during these times. This study was performed to understand the perception and attitudes of outpatients towards telemedicine pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 times. The challenges and their experience using telemedicine have also been assessed [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

There was also an increase in the usage of telemedicine during the pandemic period compared to the prepandemic period. A decrease in the number of participants who never availed of telemedicine during the pandemic signifies that people have started seeing telemedicine as a viable option to receive healthcare. No study till date has evaluated the perception of telemedicine during COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 and compared the experience between users' and non-users' points of view in the Indian populations [8] . A study by Ronda et al. on the perception of telemedicine on diabetic patients reported that non-users of telemedicine and users of telemedicine had different perceptions, and incomplete knowledge or unawareness about the web portal and feeling of inadequacy with the use of computers were the most reported challenges faced by patients in using telemedicine [8] .",

Regarding satisfaction with the quality of healthcare, 26.9% rated their experience positively and 27.3% of people rated their experience neutral; however, 11.3-19.4% rated it unsatisfactory. This could be a natural insight of people not trusting the ability of telemedicine to compensate for physical examination and in-person visits compared to conventional outpatient visits. Similar results were also observed in the study by Holtz wherein respondents mostly seemed to have a positive to neutral response to \"reduced waiting time for consultation\" and \"easy transfer of medical reports, X-rays, and availability of doctors\" overall [23] . The overall positive experience during COVID-19 has increased compared to the experience of telemedicine usage pre-COVID-19.

This lack of confidence could be due to limited physical examination, fear of misdiagnosis, lack of patient education, and inadequate knowledge about the previous medical history. Participants also reported these as major challenges in using telemedicine. A systematic review by Scott et al. reported technical challenges, followed by resistance to change, cost, reimbursement issues, age of the patient, and level of education of patient as major barriers. They have suggested that policymakers have to formulate public policies at national and international levels to bridge gaps in the use of telemedicine in all geographical areas, particularly those in rural settings [12] .
