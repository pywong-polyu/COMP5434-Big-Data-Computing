B%gnesi OF LATE, there has been considerable interest in mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can enter cells other than by the conventional mechanism of attachment of HIV to CD4, which serves as a cell-surface receptor for the virus. As some of the other mechanisms proposed employ antibodies or complement proteins, it is possible that immune responses to HIV would enhance rather than reduce infection of some target cells and thereby worsen the course of disease. If so , this would be bound to have a major impact on vaccination and therapeutic strategies. It is therefore worth examining the evidence, including the most recent papers' \u00b72, to assess whether such concerns are legitimate.",

The most poignant effect is seen with flaviviruses, such as dengue, West Nile and yellow fever viruses. In these cases, enhancing antibodies are distinct from the neutralizing antibodies that block virus infection . Neutralizing antibodies prevent fusion of the viral membrane with that of the cell within endocytic vacuoles in monocyte/macrophages and thus block entry of the virus into the cytoplasm' . In contrast, enhancing antibodies do not prevent fusion but rather facilitate uptake of the virus-antibody complex through binding of the Fc portion of the antibody molecule to Fc receptors on the target cell surface. In vitro, the enhancing effect of such antibodies can be as high as 10,000 fold when neutralizing antibodies are absent ; in vivo, an excess of enhancing antibodies can exacerbate infection and the course of disease'.",

One difficulty in confidently observing enhancement with HIV stems from the inability to separate enhancing antibodies from other antibodies to HIV.

Two groups have reported 6 .? that monoclonal antibodies (OKT4A and Leu 3a) to the CD4 receptor that are known to interfere with HIV infection blocked the enhancement effect and at least one study being prepared for publication records similar results (R. Yarchoan , personal communication). By contrast, Homsy et al. ' recently reached the opposite conclusion: neither OKT4A nor soluble forms of CD4 that block attachment of HIV to CD4 prevent enhancement of HIV infection of monocyte/macrophages. The former studies suggest a mechanism whereby the enhancing antibodies serve to concentrate the virus on the macrophage surface (2 in the figure) (which , compared with the T-cell surface, is sparsely populated with CD4 receptors) and the high affinity of the virus for CD4 allows it then to transfer from antibodies to CD4 molecules and proceed to enter the cells by the normal mechanism (3 in the figure) . But, if neither OKT4A nor soluble CD4 can block enhancement, it presumably involves a mechanism of entry that does not require CD4. (There is some recent evidence\"\" that, even in the absence of enhancing antibodies, HIV can infect cells by a CD4-independent mechanism, using an unidentified receptor.)",

Mitchell and colleagues\"JO have reported an effect that is mediated by certain components of human complement. Cells bearing receptors for complement would attract complement-fixing antibodies attached to HIV much like Fc receptors would bind antibody-HIV complexes (4 in the figure). This phenomenon can in some cases be studied in the presence of neutralizing antibodies provided that the titres are high enough and complement is present. Furthermore, there appears to be a requirement for CD4, suggesting that after association of the complex with the complement receptor , the virus attaches to CD4 and the normal route of infection proceeds' (3 in the figure) .

In addition to the dramatic explosions of supernovae, stellar winds are observed that are 10 6 _1010 times as intense as the Sun's, and these can have profound effects on the evolution of the star and of the surrounding interstellar gas. Two new reports indicate the importance of spatially-resolved observations of stellar winds in elucidating the mechanisms of mass ejection. On page 449 of this issue!, Moran et al. describe their radiointerferometric observations, using the MERLIN array run from 10drell Bank, of an unusually active 'Wolf-Rayet' star. This is expelling material at a rate considerably greater than most stars in its class and so presents a challenge to theorists. And Reipurth recently presented 2 highly resolved CCD (charge-coupled device) images of a remarkable high-velocity jet -a so-called Herbig-Haro objectejected far into space by a star that has only just formed. Moran et at.! studied a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star, AS431, that is one of the more luminous stellar objects in our Galaxy. Such stars are remarkable for the rapid rate at which they eject material, resulting in substantial reduction in the stellar mass over the astronomically short times of 10 4 _ 10' years 3 \u2022 Radiation pressure is undoubtedly responsible for the mass ejection, but present theories cannot account well for the extreme efficiency of ejection that observations of thermal radio emission indicate. Such observations can determine mass-loss rates very accurately4. However, some WR stars, including AS431, radiate non-thermal radio emission, the origins of which are not clear, so that mass-loss rates cannot be accurately derived for these objects'.",
