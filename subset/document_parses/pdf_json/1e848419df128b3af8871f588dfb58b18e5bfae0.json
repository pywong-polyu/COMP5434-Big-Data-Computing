            "text": "Pregnancy is characterized by physiological immunosuppression with predisposition to respiratory viral infections [1] . In previous years, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus increased the rate of hospitalization in an intensive care unit and lethal outcomes in pregnant women [2] . The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on maternal and perinatal outcomes remain poorly understood due to the limited research of clinical manifestations and laboratory findings in pregnant women with Coronavirus disease 2019 [3, 4] . Thus, there is as yet no consensus regarding the probability and implications of the vertical transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [5] [6] [7] . Several findings indicate the possibility of vertical SARS-CoV-2 transmission. First, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (the main cellular receptor binding virus) was found to be expressed in the placenta, ovary, uterus and vagina [8] . Second, clinical studies in China revealed immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in neonates from mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests [9, 10] . Third, IgM antibodies, representing the acute phase of viral infection, are sufficiently large in size to pass from the mother's blood through the placenta. Finally, viral RNA and protein were found in the placenta [11] [12] [13] [14] . The vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 clinical cases of pregnant women have been studied in the third trimester of pregnancy. The systematic review by Alexander M. Kotlyar et al. indicated that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the third trimester is possible but rare (probability around 2-3.7%) and it is not associated with severe neonatal pathology [15] . Out of 936 neonates from mothers with COVID-19, 27 neonates were detected SARS-CoV-2 positive by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with a nasopharyngeal swab. The results of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA testing were positive for 1 out of 34 neonatal cord blood samples (2.9%), 2 out of 26 placenta samples (7.7%), 0 out of 51 amniotic fluid samples (0%), 0 out of 17 urine samples (0%), and 3 out of 31 fecal or rectal swab samples (9.7%). The results of serology analysis of the neonates based on the presence of immunoglobulin M were positive for 3 out of 82 samples (3.7%) [15] . However, very little remains known about maternal and neonatal outcomes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester and, particularly, the second trimester of pregnancy [11, 12, 15] . Unlike the first and the third trimesters, the second trimester is associated with notable attenuation of the mother's immune activity [1] . To the best of our knowledge, only two case reports of second trimester SARS-CoV-2 newborn testing have been published until now [11, 12] . In the first case, viral mRNA was found in the placenta and umbilical cord blood of a child born after 22 weeks of gestation [11] . Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of viral capsids on the fetal side of placenta. In the second case, all newborn samples were SARS-CoV-2 negative, except the fetal side of placenta [12] . In both cases, the child did not survive. Acute inflammation in placental tissue was considered to be the main cause of the adverse pregnancy outcome. Further studies are necessary to characterize the effect and potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the second trimester for fetus development.",

IgM antibodies against cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Epstein-Barr virus were not detected. At the 26th week of gestation characteristics of blood flow centralization were detected. We recorded fetal umbilical artery pulsatility index 1.42, positive end-diastolic At the 26th week of gestation characteristics of blood flow centralization were detected. We recorded fetal umbilical artery pulsatility index 1.42, positive end-diastolic flow, middle cerebral artery pulsatility index 0.96, peak systolic velocity 46.3 cm/s, cerebroplacental ratio 0.67 (decreased), reverse blood flow in ductus venosus. Ultrasound scan indicated fetal growth restriction (0.1 percentile) and anhydramnios.",

However, according to the earlier results by Auriti et al., some newborns become SARS-CoV-2 positive on the 5th day, which suggests the possibility of horizontal transmission of the virus [19] . Our experience also includes 62 women who were SARS-COV-2 positive at different stages of pregnancy but recovered by the time of labor. All newborns were SARS-CoV-2 negative according to the PCR analysis. This indicated the absence of transplacental transmission of the virus from mother to the fetus and the teratogenic effect of the virus to the fetus, in agreement with previous studies [20, 21] . Previously reported adverse outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 infection included an increase in the rate of preterm birth and hospitalization of newborns in the NICU [22] .",

Our experience also includes 62 women who were SARS-COV-2 positive at different stages of pregnancy but recovered by the time of labor. All newborns were SARS-CoV-2 negative according to the PCR analysis. This indicated the absence of transplacental transmission of the virus from mother to the fetus and the teratogenic effect of the virus to the fetus, in agreement with previous studies [20, 21] . Previously reported adverse outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 infection included an increase in the rate of preterm birth and hospitalization of newborns in the NICU [22] .",

Within 4 weeks of dynamic observation, the fetal-placental blood flow deteriorated to critical levels, and therefore a surgical delivery was performed. So it can be proposed that in this case the SARS-CoV-2 infection was the independent risk factor for placental insufficiency and severe neonatal pathology. The changes revealed in the placenta are consistent with the literature data on the development of maternal vascular malperfusion in SARS-CoV-2 positive women [27, 28] . Taglauer et al. and Facchetti et al. observed the increased perivillous fibrin in 46.7% and 26.7% of cases, respectively, and placental infarctions in 33.3% and 40% cases, respectively [29, 30] . Therefore, we consider SARS-CoV-2 infection to be the major reason for the development of the placental damage in our study. This conclusion is supported by the results of PCR and mass spectrometry indicating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in placental tissue and umbilical cord blood. Furthermore, the results of our immunohistochemical analysis show the obvious positive cytoplasmic expression of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1 subunit) in the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast, which is a strong indication for the vertical transmission of infection from mother to fetus [24] . This conclusion is further confirmed by the positive results of RT-PCR of the placenta and umbilical cord blood for three SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-like genes.",

Tryptic peptides identified in the COVID-19 patient placenta sample coincide with the major peptides from our previous study [33] . The N protein, being the most abundant protein in the virion, is the best candidate for mass-spectrometry detection of the SARS-CoV-2. The obtained results confirmed the potential of mass-spectrometry approaches for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 in different samples including biological fluids and tissues.",

For the first time, the expression of Nucleocapsid N SARS-COV-2 protein in the placenta was confirmed by proteomic method (HPLC-MS/MS).",
