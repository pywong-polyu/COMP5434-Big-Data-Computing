A longitudinal study of henipavirus diversity and excretion dynamics identified 18 putative viral species circulating in a local population, three with differing seasonal dynamics, and the winter and spring periods posing a higher risk of virus spillover and transmission. The annual peaks in virus excretion are most likely driven by subadults and may be linked to the waning of maternal immunity and recolonization of the roost in early spring. These results provide insightful information into the bat-host relationship that can be extrapolated to other populations across Africa and be communicated to at-risk communities as a part of evidence-based public health education and prevention measures against pathogen spillover threats.",

Not all emerging agents have global pandemic potential, but even localized epidemics might have severe and devastating impacts on public health, as exemplified by recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in Africa and Nipah virus disease in Southeast Asia 1,2 . One of the important measures in preventing zoonotic disease spillover is identifying the maintenance populations and ecosystems where natural reservoirs of potential zoonotic agents occur. Bats have been identified as reservoirs for many zoonotic viruses and predicted to host a significantly higher proportion than other mammals, although this is still under debate with a recent study suggesting a homogenous risk among mammalian taxonomic orders 3,4 . As such, biosurveillance for bat-borne pathogens has seen a marked increase over the last few decades and has pointedly improved our knowledge of chiropteran hosts and their associated viral diversity 5-11 .",

This species has a broad geographical distribution spanning sub-Saharan Africa and parts of North Africa, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia 16-19 . In recent years, it has been associated with various viruses belonging to at least 16 viral families, including paramyxoviruses related to the Henipavirus genus 5, 6, 9, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Bat-borne henipaviruses, Hendra and Nipah viruses, are significant human and animal pathogens due to their high morbidity and mortality rates 26 . Nipah virus has also been shown to be capable of sustained human-to-human transmission chains 27 . Although these viruses have mainly been associated with Pteropus bat species, recent evidence suggesting an association of Nipah virus with Rousettus leschenaultii from India has also been reported 28 . The detection of related henipaviruses in African bat species and serological evidence of human exposure to these viruses could indicate that spillover is occurring undetected, which raises concern given the pervasive lack of public health resources in many African countries 29 .",

Definitive seasonality and magnitude of Hendra virus excretion pulses coinciding with disease spillover and outbreaks have been reported, although viral excretion has been documented year-round [30] [31] [32] [33] . Excretion pulses were shown to be significantly higher during the dry winter season 31 ; however, variations across latitudes were observed towards Australia's northern parts, where excretion was reported in dry and wet winter regions 32 . Winter spillover variation was found to be related to winter temperatures, which affect bat behaviors and physiology, as well as human behavior 34 . For Nipah virus, viral infections in bats were not seasonal but rather were driven by waning humoral immunity in adult bat populations. Introduction of virus to a colony where seroprevalence was below a threshold of herd immunity was a likely determinant of an outbreak within bats 35 .",

A longitudinal assessment of henipavirus antibodies in a captive colony of E. helvum bats found pups to lose their maternal antibody protection between four and twelve months following birth 39 . Evidence suggests virus maintenance at a population level and horizontal virus transmission during the pregnancy and lactation stages of the reproductive period. These findings were more recently supported through molecular assessment of viral persistence and excretion in the same captive colony of E. helvum bats. The results suggested viral shedding throughout the year; however, a significant seasonal pattern was detected, with peaks observed in July and January 40, 41 .

Several sample types were used (Table 1) , with initial biosurveillance conducted on archival spleen and urine samples opportunistically collected over several years (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). These sample types were selected based on previous findings reporting successful detection of henipavirus-related viral sequences in fruit bats 5, 36, 37 . Collection of these tissues and urine samples from individual bats was performed as previously described whereby bats were sedated with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (1:2; a volume of 0.05 to 0.1 mg/g body mass) and euthanized through cardiac exsanguination 9 . As a noninvasive approach, population-level urine and fecal samples were collected monthly over more than two years to assess paramyxovirus excretion over time. Population-level urine was collected as previously described, and care was taken to collect clear urine samples not containing fecal matter 9 . Briefly, urine droplets were collected using cotton-tipped swabs or by pipetting from plastic trays placed in the cave underneath roosting bats. For the collection of population-level fecal samples, fresh droppings were collected from the cave floor underneath roosting bats. Three fecal deposits were collected using cotton-tipped swabs and pooled. Rectal swabs Scientific Reports | (2021) 11:24262 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-03641-w www.nature.com/scientificreports/ collected from individual bats were included in the study to determine whether specific host characteristics such as age, sex, or forearm mass index (FMI) can be correlated with infection status. The swabs were collected under anesthetics during catch-and-release sampling using a mixture of ketamine and xylazine on 1:2 ratio (a volume of 0.05 to 0.1 mg/g body mass) as previously described 9 . Sterile cotton swabs (VWR Critical Swab) were dipped in 1 \u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being inserted into the rectum of bats and rotated three times. All biological samples were immediately transferred into a liquid nitrogen-charged dryshipper for transport to the laboratory and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further processing. Morphological measurements of all bats were taken, including weight, forearm length, age, and sex. The age of the bats was determined based on forearm measurements, where > 89 mm was classified as adults and \u2264 89 mm as subadults [42] [43] [44] . Each bat was marked by a 3-letter-3-digit tattoo code on the propatagium of the left ventral wing of the bat. This procedure was performed while the bats were sedated and allowed for analyses of recaptured bats. Briefly, this involved cleaning of the wing surface with AIMS animal tissue prep (AIMS\u2122), after which the code was tattooed onto the wing. Tattoo ink (AIMS Permanent black pigment; AIMS\u2122, USA) was injected into the skin using a seven-point round liner (7RL) needle and a Bold Monk Ordinary Tattoo Machine (GetInked, South Africa). Bats recaptured during the same sampling event as when initial marking was done were released. Upon recapture during a subsequent monthly sampling event, sample collection was repeated, and the tattoo number was documented. Detailed sample information is recorded in Supplementary Dataset 2 available online. During sampling, collection of proportional numbers representing both sexes and age groups was attempted as much as possible. However, colony structure varied over time, particularly from February to April, where noticeably higher numbers of subadults were sampled.",

Lower excretion levels were reported from September to November and seemingly decreased towards the end of each year. Notably, a cyclic absence of excretion was observed in autumn between February and May 2018 and 2019. Peak viral excretion is believed to follow in line with the waning of maternal antibodies. The viral excretion peaks also fell within the winter months for the region characterized by a cold, dry climate and limited food availability (Fig. 1) . However, at a lower detection frequency, the continued excretion during the spring (September to November) coincides with the recolonization of the roost (Fig. 1) .

Findings associating R. aegyptiacus bats with henipaviruses have been limited, with only seven detections reported from populations around Equatorial Africa 5,6,20,21 .

This is considerably higher than that reported for viruses belonging to other viral families, such as the Filo-, Adeno-, Herpes-and Coronaviridae (Geldenhuys et al. in preparation) , detected in the same target population 14, 51, 52 . High viral diversity and strain detection rates increase the probability of strains with zoonotic potential present in these populations, as exemplified by henipaviruses and Sosuga pararubulavirus, which are observed at a higher frequency in their respective bat reservoirs 3, 12, 30 . In conjunction, the repeat detection of viral RNA across years could be an indication of the establishment and maintenance of these viruses within their natural reservoir populations and increased intraspecies transmissibility. The risk of human and livestock exposure or disease spillover might be considered much lower for the diversity documented at a very low detection rate; however, this diversity should not be disregarded, as their zoonotic potential remains unknown. The three dominant putative species presenting with much higher detection frequencies provide the opportunity for increased exposure and potential spillover, posing a higher risk for the local community. Moreover, the detection of these viruses in bat excreta highlights the potential for environmental contamination not only in the cave where these bats roost but also across their foraging range, as previously demonstrated for Nipah virus 53 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Serological investigations into henipavirus dynamics in E. helvum bats in Africa provided initial insight into the association of these viruses with African fruit bat species 39, 54 . These studies primarily relied on the cross-reactivity of African henipaviruses with Nipah virus and reported the limitation of not working with a 42 .

This is exemplified by the presence of Marburg virus in South African populations of R. aegyptiacus without local disease emergence-possibly due to the absence of extrinsic factors driving outbreaks in other parts of Africa such as hunting for and consumption of bat bushmeat or entering of caves for guano mining 14, 51 . With our longitudinal molecular approach, we were able to study the dynamics of African henipa-and related viruses in a single host species. Compared to previous reports, synchronized shedding of multiple putative viral species was observed yearly, although dominant putative viral species displaying variable seasonality were detected 9, 41, 55 . Similar findings have been reported from a captive population of E. helvum bats in Ghana, whereby distinct paramyxoviral sequences display various shedding patterns 41 . This suggests the involvement of different local drivers for various paramyxovirus taxa, highlighting the limitations of lower resolution studies where such differences might be overlooked. The temporal dynamics of BatPV Rousettus aegyptiacus PS1 and PS11 are in line with data previously reported for Hendra virus with a characteristic winter seasonality for peak viral excretion 31 . During this time, the bat population at Matlapitsi cave is at its lowest (Fig. 1) , with most of the population exiting the roost to overwinter in other locations with a warmer climate and where food is likely more readily available 42 . For the remaining individuals, low food availability and dependance on alternate food sources, such as cultivated fruit, could result in nutritional stress. This has previously been suggested to have a physiological impact on bats and reduced immunocompetence, making them susceptible to infection 30, 56 . Intraspecies transmission and exposure of local humans and livestock populations to bat-borne paramyxoviruses are more likely to occur in winter due to the aggregation of R. aegyptiacus bats around limited food sources, and these bats potentially feeding on cultivated fruiting trees planted throughout human settlements, as observed over the course of field studies in the area.",

Waning of maternal immunity provides a synchronized influx of na\u00efve individuals who could be exposed to these viruses, resulting in large-scale horizontal transmission, infection, and virus detection during these pulses. The birthing pulse for the targeted South African population of R. aegyptiacus in this study was documented in late spring (October/November), which is approximately six months before the peak in viral excretion 42 . These data correspond to serological findings of the loss of henipavirus maternal antibodies in E. helvum bats at four to 12 months (averaged at six months) following parturition 39, 54 . While our study did not include a serological aspect to confirm the influence of maternal immunity on infection acquisition during the study period, our molecular findings seem to support a greater risk of infection with henipavirus and related viruses following the loss of maternal immunity.",

However, since this is an open population with regular movement in and out of the colony to one or more different roosts, the possibility of a large metapopulation across southern Africa should be considered before such inferences can be made 42 . It becomes increasingly important to study bat movement patterns and collect spatiotemporal virological and serological data across the distribution of this bat species.

At a local scale, the period with the highest risk for human and livestock exposure to henipavirus and related viruses was determined to be winter through spring. When the natural wild fig food source of R. aegyptiacus is limited during winter, increased human contact is possible when bats seek other food sources, such as the cultivated fruit trees found between human dwellings within the area. In addition, R. aegyptiacus has been documented to expand their home ranges in winter and forage further away from the roosts, which results in increased dispersion to other settlements within the greater area 17 . The Tzaneen region northeast of the cave is known for its tropical and subtropical agriculture with cultivated fruits as one of their main lines of produce-which could serve as a secondary food source for these bats. Therefore, risk assessments for winter months should include settlements within a wider radius around the cave roost. Overwintering roosts also warrant consideration for risk assessments due to the observed increase in viral shedding during this time and the associated infection status of subadults participating in the movement between roosts. This highlights the need to incorporate bat tracking in larger-scale studies to identify secondary roosts. During spring, when the roost is recolonized and the fig trees start to fruit, the now larger population of bats will remain mostly localized and feed and within the Matlapitsi valley, increasing contact rates with humans and free-roaming livestock. Consequently, the landscape structure, bat movement and feeding behaviour, proximity of the human settlement to a roosting cave, and human behaviour might be the most important risk factors to consider when performing risk assessments and providing recommendations to the local community.",

Seasonal excretion of putative viral species indicated in different color bars per season (sampling period June 2017 to September 2019). The number of detections is represented by dots of different sizes and colors. The total number of detections represents both the initial tissue-based biosurveillance and longitudinal excretion data. Amino acid similarities were based on a 150 amino acid sequence and indicate the similarity shared between the putative species. Sample types are F-fecal, R-rectal swabs, U-urine, S-spleen, and K-kidney. b. Bar charts represent the proportion of RNA-positive samples for putative species (PS) 1 (n = 20), PS11 (n = 23), and PS18 (n = 14) detected in bat excreta specific to sample type, season, and month of detection. For sample type, detections for fecal (Fe) and rectal swabs (ReS) were combined, as they form part of the same excretion pathway. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of partial paramyxovirus polymerase (L) gene sequences detected in Egyptian rousette bats. The proportional phylogeny was based on an alignment of sequences with 439 nucleotide lengths. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed using the TIM3 + I + G substitution model with a resulting effective sample size (ESS) value of 594.3. Sequence names in red represent sequences detected in this study, blue-sequences detected in the same bat species from other countries, and black-representative sequences from the literature. Numbers in brackets at the end of red sequence names indicate the number of detections per sequence. Posterior probabilities of more than 0.5 are indicated at internal nodes, and large clades were collapsed. Newcastle disease virus was selected as an outgroup, and other Orthoparamyxovirinae genera are indicated in bold italics.
