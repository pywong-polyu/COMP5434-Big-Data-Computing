            "text": "Purpose SARS-CoV-2 virus dynamics in different hosts and different samples and their relationship with disease severity have not been clearly revealed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the viral loads of 6 different sample types (nasopharyngeal/ oropharyngeal combined, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood) of patients with different ages and clinics, to reveal the relationship between disease course and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and differences in viral loads of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Methods Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood samples are collected from patients who were hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission. Laboratory analysis were carried out at Public Health Institute of Turkey Virology Reference and Research Laboratory. Results A total of 360 samples from 60 patients were obtained on admission. Fifteen (25%) of the patients were asymptomatic while 45 (75%) were symptomatic. A significant difference was found between mean ages of asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients (26.4 and 36.4, respectively, p = 0.0248). No PCR positivity were found in blood. Only one asymptomatic patient had positive PCR result for urine sample. Viral loads of asymptomatic patients were found to be significantly higher (p = 0.0141) when compared with symptomatic patients. Viral load had a significant negative trend with increasing age. A significant decrease in viral load was observed with increasing disease severity. Conclusion In conclusion, this study demonstrates that asymptomatic patients have higher SARSCoV-2 viral loads than symptomatic patients and unlike in the few study in the literature, a significant decrease in viral load of nasopharyngeal/ oropharyngeal samples was observed with increasing disease severity. Factors associated with poor prognosis are found to be significantly correlated with low viral load.",

On January 7, 2020, the causative agent was identified as a new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has not previously been detected in humans [1] . Later, the name of 2019-nCoV disease was accepted as COVID-19, and the virus was named as SARS-CoV-2 because of its close resemblance to SARS CoV. After this date, the number of patients increased rapidly, and on March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic for the second time in the twenty-first century after the influenza pandemic caused by H1N1. In mid-June 2020, COVID-19 occurred in 215 countries in total, with nearly 8 million confirmed cases and 500.000 deaths.",

Eventually, it was understood that it was a complicated disease which could cause systemic inflammation and even thrombosis. It is still not fully understood why some patients exhibit mild or no symptoms, while others suffer severe symptoms. This is because neither the amount of time SARS-CoV-2 RNA can survive in the upper respiratory tract nor the correlation of viral load and prognosis is well known. In addition to viral load, there are many parameters which affect the course of COVID-19 such as age, gender, comorbid diseases, and genetic factors. In the current literature, there are studies with limited sample size, which report different results regarding the PCR positivity rates of different tissues [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . There are many unclear issues regarding the relationship between the course of the disease and virus dynamics in different age groups and patients with different comorbidities, different immune responses in different hosts, correlation between virus excretion amount and pathways, and clinical course of the disease.",

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in different samples from 60 COVID-19 patients. PCR positivity rates were 80%, 50%, 13.3%, 8.3%, and 1.7% for NP+OP, saliva, oral cavity, rectal, and urine samples, respectively. Wang et al. reported that PCR positivity rate for nasal swaps, pharyngeal swaps, and feces were 63%, 32%, and 29%, respectively [6] . Their study consisted of 1070 specimens from 205 patients with different severity and found 1% blood positivity and no urine sample positivity. We found no blood sample positivity, but 1 PCR-positive urine sample (1.7%) collected from an asymptomatic patient. In some studies, no PCR positivity in the urine samples was detected, despite the existence of viremia [4, 6, 10] . There are too many points that need to be clarified about the extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus and time dependent changes of PCR positivity. Chen et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the blood (6 out of 57 patients) and anal swabs (11 out of 28 patients) [11] . They concluded a quite different point from our study, that the presence of virus outside of the respiratory tract like blood and anal swab is related with severe disease. However, we found PCR positivity in anal and urine samples of asymptomatic patients. Zheng et al. reported that the PCR positivity rate in stool samples did not differ between patients with mild disease and patients with severe disease and they detected only one PCR positivity in a critically ill patient among 180 urine samples [12] . Note that, although there is some evidence that a higher viral load can be found in the stool of some patients, this does not provide substantial evidence for the use of anal swab samples as can also be seen in this study results where only 5 out of 60 patients' samples were found positive.",

It is reported that approximately 40-45% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 will remain asymptomatic [15] . Surprisingly in our study, viral loads of asymptomatic patients were found to be significantly higher (p = 0.0141). Zou et al. evaluated SARS-CoV-2 viral load in 18 COVID-19 patients' upper respiratory specimens. They included only one asymptomatic patient and found that NP+OP sample's viral load of asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients [16] . The period of the disease when samples for the PCR test were collected is important both in terms of PCR positivity and viral load. This correlation makes it difficult to compare the results of the studies. In a study including 31 adult patients who were virologically confirmed COVID-19 but were asymptomatic on admission, it is reported that the cycle threshold values of asymptomatic patients were significantly higher than those of asymptomatic patients who developed symptoms after admission to hospital while having similar duration of viral shedding [17] . In our study, all PCR and viral load analysis were performed on admission to hospital for all patients.",

Therefore, patients actually begin to be infectious before the symptom onset and isolation. Probably, this is one of the important points that makes the control of the epidemic difficult. Asymptomatic patients maybe another important point. Although asymptomatic patients are intuitively thought to be less infectious due to producing less aerosols since they do not cough as much as symptomatic patients, their high levels of viral load may indicate a higher than expected infectiousness. It must also be kept in mind that asymptomatic patients are rarely detected and isolated. Therefore, their exact role in the pandemic might be more important than initially thought.",

Shi et al. found that pneumonia cases had the lowest viral loads, followed by non-pneumonia cases, and severe pneumonia cases having the highest with no statistically significant differences [18] . Zheng et al. reported that viral load of respiratory samples was significantly higher in severe patients than patients with mild disease [12] . But the respiratory samples in their study were sputum and saliva. They found that in the mild disease group, viral load was higher during the early phase, peaked at the second week from disease onset, and declined afterwards. However, they also found that the viral load remained high in the severe disease group. We found a significant decrease in viral load with increased disease severity. To interpret the studies correctly, it is absolutely necessary to consider when the samples are taken. In our study, patients were in relatively early phase of the disease since the median time from illness onset to admission was 3 (1-14) days. The reason for low viral load in severe patients can be interpreted as late admission to hospital. However, it is not the case in our study, since no significant difference was found in admission day from symptom onset of patients belonging to different severity groups (p = 0.805). To et al. reported no difference between median viral loads of severe and mild cases [19] . As seen in these examples, there are studies that find the viral load in severe patients lower, higher, or equal (i.e., no significant difference) compared to the mild patients.",

We found that gender is not a factor affecting PCR positivity and viral load. But the viral load had a significant negative trend with increasing age.
