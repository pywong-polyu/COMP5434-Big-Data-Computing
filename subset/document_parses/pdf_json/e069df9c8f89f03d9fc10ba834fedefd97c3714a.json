            "text": "Since the epidemic outbreak in early months of 2020 the spread of COVID-19 has grown rapidly in most countries and regions across the World. Because of that, SARS-CoV-2 was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, by The World Health Organization (WHO). That's why many scientists are working on new methods to reduce further growth of new cases and, by intelligent patients allocation, reduce number of patients per doctor, what can lead to more successful treatments. However to properly manage the COVID-19 spread there is a need for real-time prediction models which can reliably support various decisions both at national and international level. The problem in developing such system is the lack of general knowledge how the virus spreads and what would be the number of cases each day. Therefore prediction model must be able to conclude the situation from past data in the way that results will show a future trend and will possibly closely relate to the real numbers. In our opinion Artificial Intelligence gives a possibility to do it. In this article we present a model which can work as a part of an online system as a real-time predictor to help in estimation of COVID-19 spread. This prediction model is developed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate the future situation by the use of geo-location and numerical data from past 2 weeks. The results of our model are confirmed by comparing them with real data and, during our research the model was correctly predicting the trend and very closely matching the numbers of new cases in each day.",

The problem in construction of such advisory systems is the lack of knowledge and data to compose them easily since we dont have any information about the virus spread before it start. We can estimate it just by the data from an extremely short period of time in which the situation changes rapidly. There are several methods which help to make prediction in such situations, however mostly reported are neural networks due to good generalization and precise prediction in case of uncertain environments.",

In [18] was presented how to model an ad-hoc predictor of arrhythmia from ambulatory electrocardiograms, which can support urgent decisions saving life. In medical systems data from various sensors can serve as knowledge for prediction models. Health sensoric data can be used to predict kidney diseases as shown in [19] , heart failure as discussed in [20] or mRNA engineering from alternative polyadenylation [21] . Deep learning structure serves as pulmonary changes detection from cov19 virus as discussed by [22] and [23] . It is also possible to use neural networks as remote processing controls in cloud teleophthalmology IoT system as proposed in [24] . Some of models also give explainable premises of the disease symptoms as decision support model [25] or inflammation in Crohn's disease [26] . A wide survey on positive aspects of using machine learning techniques to predict medical symptoms from diabets was presented in [27] . Artificial Intelligence also serves as death or survival predictor. In many cases neural networks were reported to succeed in estimating situation of patients or future spread of some diseases which lead to fatal death of people. In [28] was described a model developed for predicting in-hospital mortality of patients with kidney injury, while in [29] model for survival of breast cancer was developed. In [30] neural networks were described to predict clinical events in Intensive Care Unit. Neural networks also can predict future spread of respiratory disease. In [31] was discussed how Artificial Intelligence can be used to predict infection from inhale of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Intensive Care Unit. In recent time many works are oriented on computation for cov19 virus spread both in regional and world range. In Table 1 is presented a summary of recent approaches. From the table we can learn that various models have been used to predict the spread in local and global aspects. However each of these analysis is using mathematical solutions based on calculations. Our proposed approach is oriented on machine learning (especially on devoted neural network architecture) and because of this proposed system is able to predict the cov19 spread trend Pandey et al.

Therefore prediction model must be able to conclude the situation from few past data information in the way that the results will show a reliable trend and will possibly closely relate to the real number of cases. Proposed prediction model is using neural networks to do it. At the beginning the data is normalized to help find relations between neighbor countries or regions and after that an input vector is presented to the nested neural network model in which we have composed devoted architectures to predict situation. First neural network is working on 12 days time window to predict the situation in the World, while second one is working with 8 days time window to predict the situation in regions of a country. The proposed model works well in both cases and is able to give a helpful estimation of the trend which can be used for planning but also closely approaches the real number of cases each day.",

Proposed two types of neural architectures are devoted to prediction from small cov19 data so that the results both for countries and regions are well adequate to the real numbers. Applied two types of activation functions gave the neural network ability for exact fitting to the normalized data from various locations. The architecture is trained by ADAM algorithm so that the error rate is low and the system is well developed. The situation is changing fast so we can also see changes in the predicted numbers reflected in our system accuracy. On the other hand the system gains efficiency very fast and learns the new data with good precision. The statistics of the system show that with new incoming data proposed model is better trained to prediction about the situation in each country or region. ",

            "text": "Proposed neural network predictor has an important advantages over other approaches. First of them is good adjustment to the new information. When the neural network is trained it easily adopts to new data and gives correct predictions. It is not necessary to analytically model the trend line, which is the key factor for purely mathematical predictors. On the other hand for neural networks well training a reasonable amount of data on the input is necessary to achieve good accuracy. However as we have shown in our model we can simulate these by architecture of the neural network and data preprocessing. Due to the nature of incoming information in this case we have developed two architectures for countries and regions, but each of them is fed with different number of values from previous days. The interpretation of our results is the trend of the situation (growing or decreasing) and potential number of new cases. For both of them our neural network predictor works well.",

Applied neural network architectures give good results and help to show the growth trend for countries and regions. The situation of any disease or epidemia is changing very fast so it is hard for any mathematical model to perfectly fit to the real numbers. On the other hand prediction models sourced in Artificial Intelligence give flexibility to the changing situation to match new incoming data while maintaining accuracy in prediction. Therefore such models can be used to reliably estimate changes in uncertain environments by using predicted tends of growth. The hards thing in case of cov19 prediction is that the project started with very limited number of information about cases and additionally the situation was changing rapidly from day to day. Therefore in such conditions it is very hard to model and train the neural network to achieve reliable results. Although such conditions our model proved to work well. Applied data selection on the input, normalization and proposed division made it possible for our proposed architectures to train well for predictions in countries and regions.",
