The validity and reliability analyses were conducted with 428 nurses working at 5 general hospitals. Exploratory factor analysis of the scale was performed, and convergent and discriminant validity as well as internal consistency reliability were determined. Results: Eight subcategories (security, patient identification, operation (invasive procedure), medication, blood transfusion, management of infection, management of falls & sores, management of firefighting) with 44 items were validated to measure patient safety care activities. Convergent and discriminant validity indicated the applicability of the eight-factor Patient Safety Care Activities scale. The reliability of the Patient Safety Care Activities Scale was acceptable, with Cronbach's a = .88~.95.",

Failure to promote patient safety in a healthcare facility threatens patients' lives as well as undermining patients' trust in healthcare professionals and facility and prolonging hospital stay, resulting in poor healthcare quality and financial loss [2] . Therefore, ensuring patient safety must be the most important responsibility of healthcare facilities, and nurses should demonstrate clear strategies and objectives to enhance patient safety while providing care [3] .",

Thus, standardized guidelines for and an instrument to assess safety care activities would contribute to enhancing the quality of safety care activities and patient safety outcomes through accurate and consistent management and assessment. However, the currently available instruments to measure safety care activities only contain some of the areas in the healthcare accreditation standard, such as only focusing on infection, communication, falls, medical equipment management, surgery/invasive procedures, staff safety, or fire safety [8] , or only partially cover a variety of areas, including falls, participant training, infection, facility inspection, fire, patient identification, communication, medication administration, and blood transfusion [9] . The objective of to directly compare safety care activities is to prepare guidelines for integrated safety management activities. Existing tools were intended to measure falls, bedsores, and fire prevention in part, and most available tools are nonstandardized tools with unestablished reliability and validity. Furthermore, the validated tools for medication administration safety [10] and falls and bedsore care [11] [12] [13] only assess a single safety care activity. As a result, these tools are significant for patient safety in the corresponding areas but cannot present the level of comprehensive patient safety activities. In addition, studies also measure the awareness of patient safety culture to indirectly propose the level of safety care activities with an argument that individuals with a high awareness of patient safety culture will engage in a high level of safety care activities [8, 9, 14] .",

The main conceptual words of this study were patient safety, safety management, activity, and instrument. The subcategories and items were compared among existing literature related to safety care activities. And focus group interview was conducted on seven nurses with at least 2 years of experience as nursing staff in the department dedicated to patient safety in a hospital. Semi-structured and open-ended questioning method was used in interview, and asked, 'Please tell me about the nursing care necessary for patient safety.' The time required for discussion was about 3 h. Interviews proceeded from each subject to the point of saturation of data that they thought were no longer coming out of new statements related to patient safety nursing activities. Participants were allowed to speak freely without being restricted, but all subjects were asked to speak at least once in a single question so that all subjects could participate and talk without being biased against only one subject. Analysis was carried out in 4 steps. In the first step, after transcripting the interview contents, the data were repeatedly read and a meaningful statement was drawn. In the second step, phrases or sentences with meaningful content related to patient safety nursing were selected and re-statemented in a general form that could represent them. In the third step, meaning was derived from meaningful statements and restatements as a step of constructing meaning. In step 4, the composed meanings were integrated and categorized into 12 subjects.",

In the course of item analysis, the correlation coefficient between each item and total items was calculated, and the criterion >.30 [19] was applied. The verification of the construct validity of the preliminary scale was calculated by exploratory factor analysis. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) values were calculated and Bartlett's sphericity was verified to determine the possibility of exploratory factor analysis for verification of construct validity. As an exploratory factor analysis method, the main axis factor extraction method and the Verimax rotation method were used, and the factors were extracted based on the eigen value of 1.00 or higher, and the factor load was applied to the standard >.40 [19] . The criterion validity was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficients with reference to the Korean modified version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture, originally developed by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [20] and translated and modified into Korean by Kim et al.

The content validity of the preliminary items was tested, and the results showed an I-CVI of .88 and S-CVI of .83, indicating high validity. The validity was tested in three stages of appropriateness, redundancy, and clarity. The comprehensibility and reliability of the preliminary items and time required to complete the survey were examined through a pilot survey, based on which the preliminary Safety Care Activity Scale was developed. To validate the preliminary scale, the reliability and validity of the scale were tested using a sample consisting of randomly selected clinical nurses from three university hospitals across regions. In terms of the criterion validity, patient safety culture was strongly correlated with safety care activities, and this not only establishes the criterion validity of the developed Safety Care Activity Scale but also supports important previous findings that safety care activity increases with increasing awareness of patient safety culture [8, 9, 14] , which adds to the significance of this study.",

Therefore, education on prevention of security accidents and education on countermeasures is necessary through online and offline education. It is an opinion that it is not just time-filling education, but case-centered concrete practice plan education.
