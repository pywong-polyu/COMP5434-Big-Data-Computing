In this study, we propose a deep representation on heterogeneous drug networks, termed DeepR2cov, to discover potential agents for treating the excessive inf lammatory response in COVID-19 patients. This work explores the multi-hub characteristic of a heterogeneous drug network integrating eight unique networks. Inspired by the multi-hub characteristic, we design 3 billion special meta paths to train a deep representation model for learning low-dimensional vectors that integrate long-range structure dependency and complex semantic relation among network nodes. Based on the representation vectors and transcriptomics data, we predict 22 drugs that bind to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 or interleukin-6, whose therapeutic associations with the inf lammation storm in COVID-19 patients, and molecular binding model are further validated via data from PubMed publications, ongoing clinical trials and a docking program. In addition, the results on five biomedical applications suggest that DeepR2cov significantly outperforms five existing representation approaches. In summary, DeepR2cov is a powerful network representation approach and holds the potential to accelerate treatment of the inf lammatory responses in COVID-19 patients.

            "text": "Since the COVID-19 outbreak, numerous studies have suggested that cytokines [e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 and interleukin (IL) -6] play key roles in the inflammatory storms of patients with COVID-19 [3] [4] . Therefore, there are an increasing number of researchers that used appropriate immunosuppressive agents to treat the excessive inflammation in COVID-19 patients, such as IL-6R antagonists, IL-1 antagonists, TNF inhibitors and Janus kinase inhibitors. Many existing anti-inflammatory drugs have been applied to treat COVID-19 patients and tested in clinical trials. In particular, tocilizumab, an IL-6R antagonist, has been proved to be effective in treating severe ill patients with COVID-19 by small-sample clinical studies from China (clinical trial registration ID: ChiCTR2000029765). However, the side effect associated with tocilizumab (e.g. thrombocytopenia, severe infections and liver damage) should be noted [9] . In addition, the clinical data of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 are limited, and the efficacy of these agents in treatment of patients with COVID-19 deserves further exploration. Therefore, in the absence of specific drugs for cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, it is significant to develop drug repositioning approaches to discover anti-inflammatory agents for patients with However, the development of promising drug repositioning approaches for the effective treatment of inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients is challenging, because the action mechanisms and biological processes are complex and elusive. Fortunately, with the rapid development of systems biology and network pharmacology, the drug research paradigm has been changed from the linear mode 'one drug, one target, one disease' to the network mode 'multi-drugs, multi-targets, multi diseases' [10] . Intuitively, the integration of multiple type of data contributes to understanding and analysis of molecular action mechanisms [11] [12] [13] . Among the advances, network-based methods provide an effective and potential paradigm to accelerate the drug development [14] [15] [16] . In most of network-based drug repositioning approaches, network representation technology, which aims to learn a low-dimensional representation vector of vertices, plays a key role. Therefore, many network-based methods integrate the promising network representation technologies to boost the treatment of COVID-19 patients [17] . Zeng et al. [18] reported a network-based deep representation learning methodology to identify drugs for COVID-19. Ge et al. [19] proposed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applied representation learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate large-scale available coronavirus-related network data to identify the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Zhou et al. [20] proposed network-based drug repurposing for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. However, these network-based drugs repurposing for COVID-19 focused on identifying antiviral drugs that are able to suppress the activity and life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 to a certain extent. Unfortunately, the efficacy of existing antiviral agents might be unsatisfactory or insufficient for patients suffering from immune imbalance in COVID-19 patients, and the mechanisms of action of these drugs in this disease are uncertain [21] . On the other hand, most of previous network representation models for drug repurposing are only focused on capture the network structure information and failed to integrate semantic feature among nodes. In other words, these network representation models to discover therapeutics for COVID-19 cannot take into account the heterogeneous types and relations defined in drug networks. Furthermore, it is fairly challenging to consider the long-range dependency and relation among nodes in heterogeneous drug networks.",

We ignore other links (i.e. disease-disease association, protein-side effect, disease-side effect, side effect-side effect). To the best of our knowledge, although there are computational methods [26] [27] for measuring disease similarity, disease-disease association cannot be verified by biology or clinical experiments. Meanwhile, links (i.e. protein-side effect association, protein-side effect association, disease-side effect association and side effectside effect association) do not exist in current biomedical question. The DDI and PDI are extracted from DrugBank [28] and ChEMBL [29] . The PPI is extracted from HPRD [30] , HuRI [31] and BioGRID [32] . The DisPA and DisDA are collected from CTD [33] and repoDB [34] . We extract DSA from CTD [33] and SIDER [35] . The protein sequence similarity network is obtained by calculating the Smith-Waterman similarities [36] of the amino acid sequence derived from UniProt. Furthermore, the drug similarity network is obtained by calculating the Tanimoto coefficient [37] from the Morgan fingerprint using the RDKit [38] . In the heterogeneous drug network, there are 11 490 nodes and 1887 041 edges; all edges are undirected.",

Therefore, we specially design 23 types of meta path as shown in Table 1 , where the first two nodes in each meta path are drugs and proteins, respectively. Then, we use these meta paths to guide random walks over the heterogeneous drug networks. Based on the above procedure, we extract 3 billion path samples from the heterogeneous drug networks. These paths reflect the interaction mechanisms and topological structures among vertices in heterogeneous drug networks. Note that all the meta paths in this work are reversible, and the lengths of meta paths is no longer than four.

The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position wise fully connected feed-forward network. Meanwhile, a residual connection [44] is employed to connect each of two sublayers, and then layer normalization is performed.

DeepR2cov follows the method used in BERT [46] to mask an input meta paths. First, 15% of nodes are randomly selected for masking. For every selected node, it has 80% chance to be replaced by <MASK> token. With 10% and 10% chance, it will be randomly replaced by any other token in the dictionary or kept unchanged correspondingly. The advantage of this procedure is that the randomness can increase the generalization ability of model and can capture bidirectional dependency relation. In addition, because random replacement occurs in only 1.5% of the time for all tokens, it does not seem to harm the model's semantic understanding capability.",

For the docking model of TNF-\u03b1, the docking result in Figure 4A shows that acarbose mainly binds to TNF-\u03b1 via five hydrogen bonds and one hydrophobic interaction. Figure 4B shows that thalidomide binds to TNF-\u03b1 via two hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. In the docking model for IL-6, seven hydrogen bonds are predicted to form interactions between acarbose and IL-6 as shown in Figure 4C . The result in Figure 4D shows that IL-6 combines with amiloride through five hydrogen bonds and form a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, respectively. These results suggest that there are some differences in the binding modes for different drugs and targets.",

In this section, we use DeepR2cov to predict potential therapeutic agents for patients infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. Researches have suggested that interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 concentrations are markedly increased in MERS-CoV patients compared with healthy controls [61] . Similarly, the expression of IL-1\u03b2 is upregulated in the blood of patients with SARS [62] [63] . These studies also indicated that the excessive of IFN-\u03b3 (or IL-1\u03b2) are related to the severity disease and death in MERS (or SARS) patients. Therefore, we are working to predicting drugs that can inhibit the release of IFN-\u03b3 (or IL-1\u03b2) to treat patients with MERS (or SARS). Based on the same procedure as DeepR2cov, we identify 11 drugs for MERS as shown in Supplementary Table S2 . The PubMed publications have reported that eight of these drugs (i.e. imatinib, bupropion, venlafaxine, arsenic trioxide, bortezomib, sunitinib, nifedipine and donepezil) are able to reduce the release of IFN-\u03b3 and revealed that these drugs can reduce the release of IFN-\u03b3 via multiple pathways of action. For example, venlafaxine and sunitinib exert inhibitory action on IFN-\u03b3 by decreasing mRNA expression [64] [65] . Arsenic trioxide alters the levels of INF-\u03b3 promoter acetylation and the combination of RNA polymerase II to the INF-\u03b3 promoter [66] . Bortezomib inhibits the express of IFN-\u03b3 by inducing T cell death [67] [68] .",

Based this heterogeneous drug information networks, DeepR2cov automatically learns the representation vectors of entities and then feed the vectors into IMC [22] model to predict potential drug-protein interactions. The performance of DeepR2cov is compared with three state-of-the-art methods (i.e. NeoDTI [13] , deepDTnet [16] and DTINet [25] ) that are designed for drug repositioning. Based on the guidance in [16] , we perform a 5-fold cross-validation test on positive pairs along with a matching number of randomly sampled negative pairs. To make a fair comparison, we adopt the hyperparameters and results from original paper [16] for deepDTnet and DTINet. The results of NeoDTI are attained by performing the source code that is provided by original work NeoDTI [13] .

Figure 6 illustrates the effects of dimension on DDI network reconstruction (k = 10 000), ATC classification and three bio-link predictions. Generally, the prediction performance is improved with increasing representation dimension. The same conclusion is described in [72] . This is intuitive since higher number of dimensions can encode more useful information. However, the performance tends to saturate or decrement when the dimension reaches to a threshold (e.g. 768). In this study, the time cost first increases gradually when the dimension is below 768, but it tends to increase sharply (note that the y-axis is log-based) when the dimensionality continue to increase, as shown in Figure 7 .

            "text": "To fight the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, this study proposes a deep representation on heterogeneous drug network to discover anti-inflammatory agents for patients with COVID-19. Based on comprehensive evaluation, DeepR2cov predicts 22 highconfidence drugs binding to cytokines to prevent excessive inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, 14 of these drugs predicted by DeepR2cov are initially proposed as anti-inflammatory therapeutic for COVID-19 patients. Eight drugs have been determined in clinical studies against COVID-19. Interestingly, four drugs (i.e. imatinib, oseltamivir, azithromycin and ribavirin) not only as immunomodulators but also as antiviral agents in clinical trial have been used to treat COVID-19 patients. A possible reason for the inconsistent result is that these studies use different experimental approaches and drug dosage, thus leading to potential data conflicts or noises. Therefore, standard assays must be carried out to measure the effects of these drugs. In addition, all predicted drugs must be validated in preclinical models experiments and randomized clinical trials before being used in patients. On five biomedical tasks, DeepR2cov significantly outperforms baseline network representation approaches. These results suggest that DeepR2cov is a powerful representation technique and can greatly facilitate the biomedical studies. A major reason for the success of DeepR2cov is that this work focuses on exploring the structural characteristics of the heterogeneous drug network and observes that the drug networks are multi-hub network. Therefore, we specially design 23 types of meta paths that integrate the structure and semantic feature among vertices in the heterogeneous drug networks. A mass of studies [42, [73] [74] have suggested that meta paths could contribute to learning meaningful representation. However, these meta path-based representation approaches are mainly proposed on nonbiomedical networks, and only a few studies are focused on biomedical issues. Meanwhile, compared with previous path-based approaches, DeepR2cov integrates a deep bidirectional Transformer encoder, which can capture longrange dependency without regarding to their distance limits in original network. In addition, DeepR2cov designs the masked meta path learning strategy to enable train deep bidirectional representation model for capturing context-dependent relation. Nevertheless, most of path-based representation approaches adopt Skip-Gram that is a left-to-right architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens [73] .",

Unfortunately, it only focuses on preserving local structure and semantic information. Therefore, the global information among vertices in heterogeneous drug networks is hard to be fully modeled. In addition, the generation of meta paths in DeepR2cov only consider the multi-hub characteristic of drug networks and ignores the attribute features of vertices in heterogeneous drug networks. However, attribute features of vertices play an important role in network-based drug discovery methods. Therefore, in the future, we will develop more self-supervised learning mechanisms and effective multi-task learning frameworks that integrate the topology, semantic and attribute characteristics of biomedical heterogeneous networks for drug discovery.",

The operation is simple and popularly applied to the recommended systems. However, the results neglect statistical significance to a certain extent. How to select associated candidate agents is also an important question for drug discovery. The selection strategy of candidates must be improved in order to promote the precision of drug repositioning. For example, the confidence score could be converted to a z-score based on permutation tests, and the corresponding P-value could be calculated. For each target, those predictions with a P-value <.05 could be treated as candidate drugs [19] .",

The representation model can capture long-range dependency and complex semantic relation among nodes in heterogeneous drug networks. Based on the representation vectors and transcriptomics data, DeepR2cov identifies 22 potential drugs that bind to TNF-\u03b1 or IL-6 to prevent excessive inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19. These drugs predicted by DeepR2cov agreed well with the previous experimental studies in PubMed publications and ongoing clinical trials. In addition, the results of five biomedical applications demonstrate that DeepR2cov significantly outperforms than other representation approaches. In summary, this study offers a powerful network representation approach and holds the potential to accelerate the treatment of the inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19.
