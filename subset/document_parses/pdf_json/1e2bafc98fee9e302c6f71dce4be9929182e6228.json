Residents of both countries cross the border for a variety of reasons, including work, shopping, healthcare, visits with friends or relatives, and others. 3 Increasingly, border resident communities cross to access care in each other's country. 4 This is in partly due to challenges of accessing the needed care in the home country where the nearest health facility may be far away into their country and the border residents are located at the periphery with physical and economic access barriers. Cross-border healthcare can also enhance individual choice, by providing added option to obtain healthcare which may either exhibit a better quality or be available at a lower cost in comparison with their national provision system. 5 6 A study by Su et al showed that one of the most significant predictors of healthcare utilisation in Mexico by US citizens were Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The study involved the use of both qualitative and quantitative data which strengthened the triangulation of results. \u25ba Having multicountry study sites in the East Africa Community strengthened the study. \u25ba This paper only presents the views of respondents that successfully navigated access barriers. \u25ba We did not include communities along the numerous informal cross points which may have different contexts and experiences.",

[8] [9] [10] However, access to care in the neighbouring country may not always be easy given the several barriers experienced along the pathway to care. 2 Some of the barriers to physical access may include challenges of poor road network and terrain and lack of identity documentation. 11 It could be an issue of financial barriers like high cost of care across the border despite of physical proximity, need for foreign currency and untransferability of health insurance policy to a neighbouring country. 5 Other hindrances include; lack of quality healthcare infrastructure, healthcare workforce shortages and language barriers that pose acceptability challenges. 3 12 These barriers to access and utilisation are often times rooted in the differences within legal and institutional frameworks that confer entitlement to healthcare between countries as well as creating differences in healthcare protocols. 13 Although states have obligations to ensure their citizens have access to all health services, 14 this is sometimes not fulfilled especially for communities residing along international borders. 15 Because the nearest health facility or health services needed may be across the border, individuals and communities usually navigate these barriers in order to access care in the neighbouring country 16 though not institutionally recognised or planned for by the country receiving the clients.

A few of the strategies include using social and kinship networks which facilitate cross-border exchange of information about where care is available and where quality can be accessed. 6 11 This literature also shows that people take advantage of the cultural context and the ethnolinguistic similarities to navigate barriers such as ineligibility or special preconditions for non-citizens to healthcare services. 17 Because some of the border residents live as one community in the two opposite countries, there are usually many informal crossings through non-official crossing points for trade and inherently promote crossborder health access.",

These threats can and have traversed borders as a result of inflows and outflows of people and goods across borders. The disease surveillance objectives have in some places forced health systems across the borders to cooperate in the control of disease outbreaks. 21 It is not clear how this cooperation is extending to support day-to-day healthcare needs of communities along the borders. As another paper that we are working on demonstrates, there are major elements of state obligations in ensuring access to health for those in need since 'health is a right'. However, these obligations are limited to citizens apart from a few aspects like epidemic control events and the high end chronic care centres of excellence that are part of the regional efforts to address cross-border health access.",

Beside distance from cities and towns, they also face administrative barriers arising from citizenship and movement to reach functional servicesespecially if from the other country. If not well articulated in policies and arrangements of health service provision, populations along the borders may remain vulnerable to poor access to healthcare and at risk of being left behind. This study set out to document experiences and feasible strategies to advance access and UHC goals especially for communities residing along the EAC borders.

The physical location of the study sights is shown in figure 1 . These border sites are mostly remote and peasant with a few trading centres acting like border posts. Only Busia (Uganda-Kenya border) is a large urban trading site. At the formal border posts there are small business enterprises to promote cross-border trade. The sites are usually located within a district (Uganda and Rwanda) or a county (Kenya). The districts or county are served by a local health facility that should provide a minimum health package to the citizens as mandated by the government. At these local health facilities, the services are only planned and budgeted to serve the citizens. In Rwanda, all citizens have health insurance and one can only receive care under insurance. The study sites have some differences in the level of care that can be provided, for example, while in Busia-Uganda there is a health centre three functioning under a 'free healthcare policy', in Busia-Kenya, there is a hospital (is higher Open access than a health centre three) and some services can only be accessed through pay by non-citizens.",

The design was informed by the health access framework. 8 This framework as conceptualised by Levesque and Harris et al (2013) provides four interrelated domains for explaining the access pathway to healthcare by communities. These include geographical, affordability, accommodation and acceptability. The questionnaire was divided into four subsections corresponding to these four adapted dimensions of the health access. Each dimension contained between 5 to 16 Likert-scale (scale of 0-4) questionnaire items developed to cover the concepts central to that healthcare access dimension in the context of cross-border settings. This method is built around exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and it is recommended for assessing multi-dimensional concepts such as healthcare access in urban setting. 24 25 The questionnaire items for each subdimension were phrased to reflect the pathway of the client's decision to seek care across the border up to the time of receiving care or failing to receive care. Each dimension also had an overall Likertscale item to assess overall contribution of that dimension to their recent experience of cross-border healthcare access.",

The ease of physical access is also enhanced by the fact that for many of the border communities, the culture and language is the same and they live as one community irrespective of the border. 17 This is evidenced from the respondents' remarks that knowledge of the local language and family relatives that reside across the border facilitated crossing for healthcare.",

This is in concordance with the linear regression analysis where the most important factor in the affordability dimension was the inverse of 'self-funded' since most services are usually free especially for the case conditions explored in our study. Studies done among US residents living along the USA-Mexico border have shown that due to the economic, financial and healthcare access barriers, border residents on the US side commonly resort to crossing into Mexico to meet their healthcare needs because of much more affordable prescription medications as well as services. 6 7 For the border residents in East Africa, there seemed to be an opportunity cost they were willing to pay in terms of other costs like transport and informal payments at border crossing. However, we acknowledge that this opportunity cost was easier for the border residents to bear since they were seeking services like childhood immunisation and HIV treatment refill which are usually free of charge in East Africa. 31 Apart from affordability in terms of cost of care, border residents who lacked health insurance also preferred to seek care across the border where national health insurance was not being implemented. There is need for East African countries to have common arrangements for example health insurance with portable benefits (or free care) that especially help poor communities along the border to access care. Although currently the non-insured community members can access care across the border, this leaves them disadvantaged in case the service needed is only available in their home country. 32 Some border residents also preferred to go where care was perceived to be acceptable in terms of quality and confidentiality. This was more important for mothers seeking delivery services and patients with HIV that preferred confidentiality. This speaks to the need for countries to improves service quality so that citizens in remote areas are more willing to use the available services at home. 33 ",

            "text": "From our study, we see the need to move from nationally circumscribed rights and entitlements to a legal environment that allows border residents to freely access care cross the border within a well-established and agreed on arrangement between countries. Although border residents are individually navigating access barriers, this leaves them vulnerable if some legal frameworks were to be enforced. For UHC to be efficiently delivered, countries may need to agree on and establish planning, resourcing and regulatory arrangements to enable border communities access the existing healthcare provision without bearing the hardship of navigating these barriers on their own. 22 This can also reduce the uncertainty and discretion of front-line officials if they were all aware of the access rights for border residents in neighbouring communities. This can span to other cross-border health issues such as having joint efforts to deal with disease outbreaks and pandemic control such as COVID-19. 34 35 At regional level, centres of excellence for healthcare are beginning to form with a view of serving people from the EAC 36 . These will require innovative cross border policies and arrangements for efficient delivery of healthcare. It would be useful to share the available healthcare resources (eg, every side of the border does not have to build a hospital if one side of the border has one in close distance). Guidelines should be developed to enable the use of a common pool of healthcare resources and optimise efficiency on both sides of the border. The European region has tried to remove legal and administrative barriers through crossborder cooperation (CBC) 37 aimed at 'identifying potential complementarities in all fields of human activities in the border regions to ease the lives of the border residents'. There are lessons that can be drawn from these and other cross-border integration initiatives. 13 During the design of any CBC initiatives, host communities should be engaged in the plans as part of the efforts to promote 'tolerance, understanding and good neighbourly relations between populations'. 38 As this paper goes to publication, cross-border health has been made more urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the border health systems -to provide testing and surveillance for interstate truck drivers in East Africa. The guidelines to manage the pandemic have come into sharp confrontation with the objectives for legal rights of interstate travel and movement of goods-in some cases threatening to dismantle the regional cooperation mission. 39 Numerous media carried stories showing long queues of trucks some extending 20 km at the border all waiting for coronavirus testing that was sometimes taking 2-3 days to offer the test results and clear the truck through emigration points. Communities around these long jams of trucks were also exposed to community transmission of coronavirus from the truck drivers-a group that had a high occupational risk of contracting and transmitting the virus. 40 This further demonstrates the need to invest in and coordinate better the economic and healthcare objectives at border points for the EAC to consolidate its integration and social economic functionality.",
