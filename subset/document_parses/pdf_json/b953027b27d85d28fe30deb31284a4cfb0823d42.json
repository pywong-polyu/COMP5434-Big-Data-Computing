Recent Findings SARS-CoV-2 predominately impacts the pulmonary system and can result in a severe lower respiratory tract infection. Early guidelines based largely on data from the SARS epidemic recommended significant restrictions on procedure volume out of concern for healthcare worker safety. Newer data suggests relative safety in performing airway and pleural procedures as long as appropriate precautions are followed and new techniques are utilized. The introduction of effective vaccines and more reliable testing has led to a re-expansion of elective procedures. Summary Many guidelines and expert statements exist for the management and practice of pulmonary procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. A flexible and individualized approach may be necessary as our understanding of COVID-19 continues to evolve.",

Newer data, however, has demonstrated important differences between the two viruses ( Table 1 ). Viral dynamic studies have shown a peak viral load for SARS at 10-14 days after symptom onset [30, 31\u2022] . This would suggest that most critically ill patients would be at peak infectivity while in the hospital and potentially while undergoing AGPs. Conversely, viral loads for SARS-CoV-2 appear to peak at the time of, or soon after, symptom onset, after which they decline progressively [32] . For most patients undergoing intubation, bronchoscopy, or tracheostomy, these procedures will occur after peak infectivity. Importantly, severity of illness does appear to contribute to viral load persistence, with patients with severe COVID-19 having higher viral loads up to 25 days after symptom onset [33] . Despite this, no studies to date have been able to isolate live virus from respiratory samples taken beyond 9 days of symptom onset, regardless of persistently elevated viral counts [30] .

Bronchoscopy was, and still remains, relatively contraindicated in COVID-positive patients. In these cases, focus has shifted to procedure prioritization. Procedural prioritization can be grouped into the following categories: emergent, urgent, time-sensitive, and elective (Table 2 ). In emergent situations, in which immediate care necessitates performing procedures in a patient with either confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, enhanced PPE precautions are recommended, including the use of gowns, gloves, hairnets, full-face shields/eye protection, and either an N95 mask or [18, 42] . All providers should have experience with appropriate donning and doffing technique and specific stations pre-arranged for this purpose. During the procedure, the minimum number of staff necessary is recommended to avoid potential exposures. When possible, general anesthesia is encouraged, with a preference for an endotracheal tube over laryngeal mask airway (LMA) given a superior airway seal. Paralytic should be considered, as its use can negate cough and further minimize aerosolization [34, 38, 43] . If rigid bronchoscopy is performed in a COVID-positive or COVID-unknown patient, a closed-circuit ventilation strategy is preferred over an open system with manual or high frequency jet ventilation, and silicone caps can be used to seal equipment and minimize air leak [41] . Negative pressure rooms with at least 12 air exchanges per hour are recommended or, if not available, a non-negative pressure room with at least 12 air exchanges per hour while allowing for 20 min of room decontamination following each procedure [44] .",

While tracheostomy does provide significant benefits to patients, it is, in nearly all cases, an elective procedure. Furthermore, initial data from the USA also demonstrated an exceedingly high mortality rate for patients with severe COVID-19 infection requiring mechanical ventilation, suggesting tracheostomy was unlikely to impact overall outcome in these patients [5] . For these reasons, early society guidelines for performing tracheostomy in COVID-19-positive patients recommended either late tracheostomy at 14-21 days or beyond [32\u2022, 52, 53] , or deferring tracheostomy entirely in favor of attempted extubation [54] .",
