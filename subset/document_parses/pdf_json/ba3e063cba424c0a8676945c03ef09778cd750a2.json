Current rehabilitation devices have failed to motivate the patients enough to continue rehabilitation exercises. The objective of this project, MIDAS (Multi-sensorial Immersive Dynamic Autonomous System) is a proof of concept by using an immersive system to improve motivation of stroke patients for hand rehabilitation. MIDAS is intended for stroke patients who suffer from light to mild stroke. MIDAS is lightweight and portable. It consists of a hand exoskeleton subsystem, a Virtual Reality (VR) subsystem, and an olfactory subsystem. Altogether, MIDAS engages four out of five senses during rehabilitation. To evaluate the efficacy of MIDAS a pilot study consisting of three sessions is carried out on five stroke affected patients. Subsystems of MIDAS are added progressively in each session. The game environment, sonic effects, and scent released is carefully chosen to enhance the immersive experience. 60% of the scores of user experience are above 40 (out of 56). 96% Self Rehabilitation Motivation Scale (SRMS) rating shows that the participants are motivated to use MIDAS and 87% rating shows that MIDAS is exciting for rehabilitation. Participants experienced elevated motivation to continue stroke rehabilitation using MIDAS and no undesired side effects were reported.",

In [6] , authors reported development of an electromyography (EMG) controlled serious game for rehabilitation. In this study subjects were instructed to control the cursor on computer screen with their non-dominant hand. The BRAVO hand exoskeleton reported in [7] , is an EMG-driven hand exoskeleton for grasping cylindrical objects. A distinctive feature of BRAVO hand exoskeleton design is its intrinsic adaptability to patient's hand size. The BRAVO hand exoskeleton uses 2 electric actuators, 1 to cause flexion and extension of the thumb and the other for remaining fingers of the subject's hand. NREX [8] , is a low-cost exoskeleton robot developed for upper limb rehabilitation from elbow to wrist. It uses two motorized axes for elbow and wrist joints. Authors claim that it can assist in reaching and drinking tasks. Another system by Hong Kong Polytechnic University [9] , enables stroke affected subjects to perform hand training at different intensities. Subject's intention from the hemiplegic side is captured using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The exoskeleton hand robotic training then assists in hand opening or hand closing functional tasks. In [10] , authors presented a wearable exoskeleton. This exoskeleton is designed as an anteriorsupport type device to achieve palmar extension. The bend angle data extracted using a glove with strain gauges from the non-paretic hand is transferred to the exoskeleton on the paretic hand to mimic the movements of the non-paretic hand. HERCULES, a 3 degrees of freedom (DoF) pneumatically operated exoskeleton arm upper limb rehabilitation is reported in [11] . The exoskeleton arm provides elbow flexion and extension, shoulder flexion and extension, and shoulder abduction and adduction. A semi-autonomous hybrid electroencephalography/ electrooculography (EEG/EOG) controlled whole arm exoskeleton is presented in [12] . The whole arm exoskeleton consisted of a shoulder-elbow module and wrist-hand module. The authors report that the new hybrid paradigm combining EEG and EOG is user-friendly. A limitation of most rehabilitation devices is non-portability. Authors in [13] , suggest avoiding conventional materials for manufacturing that could make the robot bulky, expensive and difficult to transport.",

Move-IT [22] is a game designed for upper limb stroke patients. It uses Oculus Rift Head Mounted Display (HMD) and a Leap Motion hand tracker. Authors in this study showed that subjects were pleased with the system after the session. It also motivated the subjects to perform rehabilitation exercises. A low-cost wearable device, integrated to VR environments for better rehabilitation process in patients with motor disabilities is presented in [23] . The device translates the movement of the subject's arm into the virtual jigsaw puzzle environment. A comparison between VR technology and conventional therapy for physical rehabilitation among patients with neurological deficits is presented in [24] . In this study, the patients were divided into two groups. One group used a VR instrument called Medical Interactive Rehabilitation Assistant (MIRA) for rehabilitation, and the other group used traditional therapy. The intrinsic motivation of the patients was assessed by a 22-item task evaluation questionnaire. It was reported that the VR session had a constructive influence on patients and empowered the patient to perform tasks autonomously. On the other hand, conventional exercises were boring, which decreased the motivation of patients for continuing treatment. In [25] , authors established that integrating research in game design, motor learning, and neurophysiology changes with rehabilitation science can greatly improve the quality of rehabilitation.",

Tapping on the physiological phenomenon of neural plasticity and psychological reinforcement, MIDAS engages 4 of our 5 primary senses: tactility, visual, auditory, and olfactory. In this paper, we present the design and development of MIDAS. MIDAS is intended to be a portable immersive system inclusive of an exoskeleton, a smell releasing device, and a VR game that will help stroke patients feel more motivated during a hand rehabilitation session. MIDAS uses EMG signals taken from the subject's forearm to predict their intention before activating physical assistance (tactile) in the opening or closing of the fingers of their hand. To evaluate the performance of MIDAS, a pilot study is done using established tools to quantify the user experience, comfort, pleasure, and motivation of the subjects in using MIDAS for rehabilitation exercises.",

            "text": "While the essential requirement of an exoskeleton is to be able to actuate the stroke patient's hand with a significant range of motion, works of literature and user feedback research further suggest that the device must be safe, comfortable, lightweight, easy to wear, and small [26] . These are necessary to deliver an unobtrusive user experience and to improve the patient's motivation to use the device. These design objectives were kept in mind while proposing the design of MIDAS exoskeleton. They were achieved by complying with anthropomorphic design, appropriate sizing of the components, and proper material selection for each component of MIDAS exoskeleton. The MIDAS exoskeleton is shown in Fig. 1 . The exoskeleton uses a linkage mechanism to provide flexion and extension of the patient's fingers. The rotary motion of a servo motor (MG-996R) is translated into a shaft's linear motion, which is then split four ways to actuate the mechanism on each finger. The rotary motion introduces interpolation into the linear movement, reducing sudden start and stop, allowing MIDAS to be less obtrusive while aiding the patient. To account for the difference in finger phalanx lengths and bone structures of each patient, the links connecting the shaft to the finger mechanism have been designed in such a way to allow two degrees of freedom (DoF). This prevents the device from moving the patient's fingers in an unnatural way and reduces the mechanical parts' stress, resulting in safe usage. In order to make MIDAS hand exoskeleton compact and lightweight, we choose to actuate the fore, middle, ring, and little finger by using one servomotor. This makes the MIDAS hand exoskeleton compact and lightweight. In order to facilitate quick prototyping of the exoskeleton hand, which is essential to the development of the MIDAS, 3D printing with Polylactic acid (PLA) is preferred. PLA has a good strength-to-weight ratio, hence allowing for a design that is lightweight and compact. The total weight for the exoskeleton is around 748 grams. Casted silicone pads are provided onto the parts of the device in contact with the patient's skin. These parts are namely the finger nodes, hand nodes, and wrist nodes. The soft material protects the patient's skin from the rough surface of the 3D printed parts and prolongs the duration the device can be worn. Silicone pads fabricated from Smooth-On Dragon-Skin 20 silicone is used as it is skin-safe and easily produced. Finally, attachments are provided to secure the exoskeleton on the patient's hand. For the wrist and hand nodes, a double-sided Velcro strap design that wraps around the forearm and hand is used. A tab has been stitched at the end of each Velcro strap to prevent it from coming off the lug. Providing a tab also eliminates the need to slide the straps through the lug and allows a faster and easier securing process. For the finger nodes, a cord-lock design, explicitly developed for MIDAS, is used. The cord is tightened around the finger by using the cord-locks. ",

The three electrodes of the sEMG sensors are placed on the forearm of the patient. The two electrodes of the sMG sensor are placed at the middle and end of a muscle belly group. The third electrode, which is the reference electrode, is placed on an inactive muscle group. The module has a duo mode, allowing the user to switch back and forth between a flexion mode and an extension mode, targeting two different muscle groups depending on the user's stroke condition. In extension mode for users with clenched hands, the sensor electrodes are placed on the lateral flexor digitorum superficialis, while in flexion mode for motor-impaired patients, the sensor electrodes are placed on the medial flexor digitorum superficialis. These muscle groups were chosen due to their functionality of gripping and releasing.",

            "text": "The VR subsystem of MIDAS includes an Oculus Quest 2 headset, a handheld VR controller device, and a VR game. The VR subsystem is intended to engage user's sense of sight and hearing. The environments in the game, indoor and outdoor, have been designed to allow the patient to feel relax and calm while playing the game. To accomplish this, natural locations such as the forest and the beach were chosen for the outdoor environments, while an earthy color palette was adopted for indoor environments to emulate nature. In line with the environment design direction, a toon shader was applied to all models to keep the game fun, simple, and casual. The game consists of five stages with different environments. Each stage in the game has a duration of 3 minutes. Fig. 2 shows the MIDAS VR headset, handheld control device, and the five stages of the game. Patients will attempt to squeeze their physical hand and through the other networking systems, allows for the digital VR hand to also squeeze. This parallax motion happens in real time and is sampled by each device at 115200 baud rate and communicated via Bluetooth. This allows for patients to associate physical motor nerve movements of their parable hand to not just haptic response with the exoskeleton, but also create motor imagery associations [27] . The mechanisms of the game-play designed to work for both types of stroke patients, i.e., patients with clenched hands (patients show flexion finger contractures) and patients who are stroke affected, but fingers of the hand do not curl into themselves. The mechanism of the game-play to score is by squeezing the lemons. It is based on the duration of both the contraction and extension of the patient's fingers. The number of squeezes increase as the game progresses. In each stage as the cups are filled with lemonade, they change to become bigger variations of cups. Patients can visually associate their progress to familiar household objects and their real-world properties. This association allows for patients, who would typically not be exposed to VR technologies, to easily integrate into this reality and accept the environment and situation. Game sound is also an essential feature for immersive experience. Game sound, referring to all the sonic aspects of a game-ambient sounds, dialog, discrete sound effects, background music and interface sounds, has long been established as an indispensable part of modern video game [28, 29] . It moves the narrative forward, convey emotions and enrich the experience of the player. Game music has the potential to be much more than a passive element of the background. By tightly linking the content of game play and background music, the player becomes much more immersed in the gaming experience. To enhance game immersion and elevate motivation of participants to keep using our device, different layers of game sounds were incorporated into the game, including cheerful background music, bird chirping, sound of a mouse character, the sound of squeezing lemon and pentatonic scales-high-pitched chimes after completing a stage.",

            "text": "Smell plays a vital role in the psychophysiological effects of stress, mood and working capacity. Studies show that the inhalation of smells affects brain function via receptors in the central nervous system [30, 31] . Moreover, many studies have suggested that olfactory stimulation have immediate effects on physiological aspects of humans, such as muscle tension, pupil dilation, blood pressure, pulse rate, skin temperature, and brain activity [32] . Due to the positive psychophysiological effects of smell on humans, a smell component is integrated into MIDAS for mood alteration, stress reduction, and enhancement of immersive experience of VR game. A mixture of lemon and bergamot is used to simulate the smell of lemon in the VR game. The inhalation of bergamot essential oil creates a relaxed mental state [33] and relieves work-related stress [34] . The lemon smell, on the other hand, increases theta waves in the brain [35] , produces sedative effects [36] , and exerts positive effects on anxiety and self-esteem [37] . The olfactory subsystem comprises two modules: a face shieldcum-olfactory device and a circuit board that connects the latter to the processing unit (see Fig. 3 ). This subsystem works in conjunction with the exoskeleton and the VR subsystem by diffusing a lemon and bergamot scent when activated. In line with keeping a safe operation during Covid-19, the face shield is included, as patients will have their face masks removed to smell the scent. The Fig. 3 (a) shows the exploded view of the main olfactory device. It consists of a 3D printed lid and container holding in place a piezoelectric transducer and a cotton pod soaked in lemon and bergamot scent liquid. Alternating current (AC) voltage makes the piezoelectric transducer vibrate at a very high frequency and generates ultrasonic sound. The ultrasonic sound breaks the scented liquid into a fine mist, which is instantaneously distributed in the face shield. As for the face shield, a conventional Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) frame is used. A cord on each end of the sheet is provided. When it is pulled, the PET frame forms curve.",

The circuitry runs on the Adafruit Feather nRF52832 microcontroller, SSD1306 128x32OLED graphic display, MG996 servo motor, MT3608 DC-DC voltage step up module, Adafruit MicroSD SPI card breakout board, rotary potentiometer, an electrical switch and 2 sets of 2 Panasonic NCR18650B batteries. The overall network diagram showing channel for communication between different subsystems of MIDAS is shown in Fig. 5 . The MIDAS exoskeleton circuitry receives its commands from the EMG sensor module and relays this information to the microprocessor where it will process the data through cleaning up the noise and applying an averaging algorithm, saving the data on the MicroSD card, sending the PWM data to MG996 servo to actuate the exoskeleton and, sending the real time data acquired to the VR subsystem and Olfactory subsystem. The microchip-based microcontroller (model Adafruit Feather NRF52832) is ARM based, contains the latest Bluetooth technologies and extremely energy efficient, all thanks to its single chip architecture. By utilizing the latest nRF52832 MCU, it not only allows for faster and more efficient data transfer between Bluetooth peripherals, but also allows for the microcontroller to behave as a central connection between other multiple Bluetooth peripherals. This central hub mode is still in its early stages of development but has since made this project possible with almost no more external networking peripherals.",

The second session included recording the patient's response when the hand exoskeleton along with the VR subsystem is used. In the third session, all the subsystems of MIDAS, i.e., the hand exoskeleton, the VR, and the olfactory subsystem, were used, and the patient's response was recorded. This was done to evaluate the performance of MIDAS in engaging one or more senses of the patients in stages and its acceptability by the patients.

There is no significant difference of motor functions between and first and last sessions. MoCA results in Fig. 7 (b) indicate that all participants are cognitively intact (with MoCA score greater than 26). The quality of life of participants also varies greatly (see Fig. 7 (c)). The lowest and highest scores are: 38/94 (physical), 50/88 (psychological), 50/94 (social relationship), 56/94 (environmental). Fig. 8 shows the overall user experience scores given by each subject. Table V shows the ratings provided the subjects during the 1st and 3rd session for each category of the user experience questionnaire. The user experience feedbacks of the 3rd session are higher than those of the 1st session for all subjects. 60% of the scores are above 40 (out of 56). Most subjects gave higher ratings on the 3rd session than they did on the 1st session. 80% of participants found the device complicated to use during the 1st session. However, during the 3rd session only 1 participant reported that the device is complicated. This difference may have occurred because they were more familiar with the device during the last sessions. During the 1st session only 1 participant completely agreed that the device is inventive. However, during the 3rd session 60% of the participants completely agree that device is inventive. This shift may have occurred because of subsequent addition of the VR and olfactory subsystem of MIDAS during the 2nd and 3rd session, respectively. The ratings for system being efficient also increased on the 3rd session. Fig. 9 shows the SRMS scores of the subjects for all sessions. Self-assessed motivation varied greatly, depending on each participant. Across all 3 sessions, 2 participants gave decreasing scores, 2 participants gave increasing scores, 1 participant gave full marks for all session. This indicates that 3 participants out of five were motivated to use MIDAS. D. SAM Fig. 10 shows the variation in emotional response of the subjects towards using MIDAS during the three sessions. The results indicate that there was no significant change in pleasure ratings after the device trial during the 1st session. During the 2nd session, 2 subjects reported increased pleasure after the device usage. However, during the 3rd session, 1 subject reported decreased pleasure, 2 subjects reported increased pleasure, remaining 2 subjects reported no change in pleasure. Arousal ratings also varied during the three sessions. 1 subject reported increase in arousal during the 1st session while the remaining subjects showed no significant increase in arousal rating. During the 2nd session, 2 subject reported increase in arousal. While during the 3rd session, 1 subject reported increased arousal. Although dominance ratings did not change at all during the 3rd session, 2 subjects in 1st and 2nd session reported increased dominance after the device trial.",

In order to influence user's experience and behavior, MIDAS increases the number of stimuli for rehabilitation by engaging four out of five senses. It consists of three subsystems, i.e., a hand exoskeleton, a VR headset with a handheld controller, and an olfactory device. Since most components of MIDAS are 3D printed, they can be easily reproduced in any research laboratory for further research. MIDAS is lightweight and portable. This allowed us to meet the subjects during each session at their house or a place agreed upon and perform the pilot study for this research. Every component in the subsystems of MIDAS is carefully designed to provide maximum immersive experience and pleasure to the user. The MIDAS hand exoskeleton is comfortable and easy to wear. The natural location views in the VR game environment with cheerful music, bird chirps, and a mouse character keep the user engaged and motivated. The olfactory subsystem releases lemon and bergamot scent each time the subject squeezes the lemon in the game. This keeps the subject relaxed and stable. MIDAS is a novel system that provides a more immersive experience for hand rehabilitation of stroke-affected patients.",

The subjects also reported that the device is inventive and effective in hand rehabilitation. Most subjects gave higher ratings at the 3rd session than they did at the 1st session. SRMS ratings of MIDAS indicate that the device increased the subject's motivation to use it for hand rehabilitation. The subjects find it exciting and are willing to use MIDAS for rehabilitation. MIDAS sets an example for the researchers on how multiple senses of patients can be engaged during rehabilitation exercises. It provides proof of increased motivation in rehabilitation by making the rehabilitation exercise exciting and highly immersive. Future researchers must keep in mind that needs and conditions vary for each stroke patient depending on their age, medical condition, and severity of stroke. Hardly can a device meet the needs of all stroke survivors. The first major area of improvement in MIDAS is the hand exoskeleton. High torque and power output from the motor would increase the range of movement of the patient's fingers. This would also increase the range of stroke patients who can use the system. However, for this to be possible, there are two prerequisites. The first is a higher power supply, as a stronger motor means a higher power demand. The second is a more robust material for the exoskeleton so that it can withstand higher stress. One possible material is resin. It performs well under high stress while also being cheap and fast to produce compared to other materials like Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) or carbon fiber. In our current design of the olfactory subsystem, a click sound can be heard before and after the scent's release. This might be intrusive during the rehabilitation. To reduce this disturbance, silent relays could be used to trigger the scent. Different types of fruits, along with its corresponding smell, can also be used in each stage to further make the game more engaging. Although no substantial improvements in participant's hand functions were noticed at the end of the pilot study, participants found MIDAS interesting, exciting and are supportive of it. This pilot study provides preliminary data suggesting that a device like MIDAS, which intends to engage more patients' senses and provide an immersive experience during rehabilitation exercises, is more effective than the conventional simple hand exoskeleton devices. A limitation of this study was fewer participants and a small number of sessions. Future studies need to be done with a bigger sample size, increased number of sessions, and the duration of each session He has invented 2 patents (one granted and second pending approval) in the area of biaxial stretching device and cryogenic micromachining of soft materials.
