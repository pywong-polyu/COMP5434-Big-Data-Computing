            "text": "Background Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to aneurysmal rupture is a devastating vascular disease accounting for 5% of strokes. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in elective and emergency admissions in the majority of neurosurgical centers. The main hypothesis was that fear of COVID-19 may have prevented patients with critical medical or surgical emergencies from actively presenting in emergency departments and outpatient clinics. Methods We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study searching our institutional data regarding the incidence of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and compare the admissions in two different periods: the pre COVID-19 with the COVID-19 period. Results The study cohort was comprised of a total of 99 patients. The mean (SD) weekly case rate of patients with SAH was 1.1 (1.1) during the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 1.7 (1.4) during the COVID-19 period. Analysis revealed that the volume of admitted patients with SAH was 1.5-fold higher during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period and this was statistically significant (ExpB = 1.5, CI 95% 1-2.3, p = 0.044). Difference in mortality did not reach any statistical significance between the two periods (p = 0.097), as well as patients' length of stay (p = 0.193). Conclusions The presented data cover a more extended time period than so far published reports; it is reasonable that our recent experience may well be demonstrating a general realistic trend of overall increase in aneurysmal rupture rates during lockdown. Hospitalization of patients with SAH cannot afford any reductions in facilities, equipment, or personnel if optimum outcomes are desirable.",

One-third of patients die before reaching hospital or within the first days after rupture, one-third faces long-term neurological deficits and complications, and the last third returns to normal life [2, 3] . The incidence of acute SAH has been estimated at approximately 10 cases per 100 000 persons annually, and mostly affects young people around 40-60 years old [4] . The two leading risk factors of aneurysm rupture are cigarette smoking and uncontrolled hypertension, following familial predisposition and heritable connective tissue diseases [4, 5] . Gender and region seem to influence the incidence of SAH, as women have higher predisposition than men, and black people have a two-fold greater risk than whites [2, 6] . The main symptom of acute SAH is a severe occipital headache of sudden onset (described as \"the worst of the patient's life), followed by seizures, neurologic deficits, or faint.",

They argued that the symptoms of aneurysmal SAH are often so severe that delaying contact with healthcare seems unlikely, and they wondered why the aneurysmal SAH incidence did not decrease due to the collapse in incidence of the normal seasonal influenza epidemic as it has been speculated that respiratory infections might predispose aneurysm rupture [11, 12] .",

In particular, fewer intermediate and regular neurosurgical beds were available, the number of neuro-ICU beds was lower, and most centers treated fewer ICU-treated SAH patients during the pandemic. The mean numbers were 2.7 vs 1.8 SAH patients/ 1,000,000 population in December 2019 and March 2020, respectively. Only four out of the 34 centers referred increased number of SAH patients [13] . In addition, an Australian study showed a reduction in vascular emergencies (SAH) which was attributed to public's fear of presenting to the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic [14] .",

The aforementioned reports' proposed explanations of their corresponding findings share a common theme in hypothesizing possible reluctance in seeking medical care upon warning signs of SAH, due to a perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 by the general public. Similar results and explanations have been reported with regards to hospital admissions due to myocardial infarction and stroke in the COVID-19 era [17] [18] [19] . It is worth noting that there are certain limitations relative to study design. This is a single-center study covering the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in our country, and therefore, generalization of our results should be cautious. Longer term analyses and comparisons with data regarding admissions for other emergencies in our hospital as well as with records from different SAH referral centers are essential to further elucidate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on emergency admissions in our country. Moreover, being observational in nature, the present study cannot provide a demonstration of causality. However, due to the life-threatening nature of SAH and the apparent extended duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, an attempt at providing possible reasonable explanations seems justified, albeit partial and speculative in nature. As there are no signs that the COVID-19 pandemic will be coming to an end in the near future, the widespread use of socioeconomic restrictions is probably here to stay for a significant amount of time, although several vaccines have been recently developed, and mass production is on the way. Given the heavy burden of the pandemic for the healthcare system, resource allocation will likely still continue to be shifted to tracking, diagnosing, and dealing with COVID-19 infections.",
