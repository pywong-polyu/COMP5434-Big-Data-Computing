            "text": "New cases of the novel coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continue to rise worldwide. On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared a pandemic, with 118 326 confirmed cases and 4292 deaths reported 1 with a case mortality rate of 3.6% 2 whereas the mortality can reach 62% for critical patients and 81% for those requiring mechanical ventilation. 3 A report from the Italian Superior Institute of Health based on 3200 patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 has related mortality to elderly age and other active comorbidities including cancer. 4 Patients had a median age of 80 (range 38-100 years), a relevant increase in the mortality occurred after 70 years (from 2.7% in patients aged 60-69 years to 9.6% in those 70-79 years and 16.6%-19% in those more than 80 years). 19.4% were patients with cancer; other active comorbidities were: hypertension (76.5%), cardiac ischaemic disease (37.3%), diabetes (37.3%), atrial fibrillation (26.5%) and chronic renal insufficiency (17.5%). The presence of two or three of these comorbidities was associated with 25.7% and 47% of deaths, respectively. 4 To date, no effective treatment has been identified. Management for patients who are critically ill relies on management in intensive care units. Global health organisations are scurrying to implement preventive measures, aiming to limit transmission, through public safety measures and restrictions. In Italy and the UK, as in some other countries, recommendations aimed at limiting access of patients with cancer and their caregivers to the hospital and prioritising curative treatments have been provided by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, respectively. 5 6 Patients with lung cancer are at risk of pulmonary complications from coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Liang et al report data on 18 patients with cancer for whom the use of chemotherapy had a negative impact in patient's outcome. 7 Therefore, the risk:benefit ratio of systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) has to be considered. For each patient, several factors including age and comorbidities, as well as the number of hospital visits for treatment, can influence this risk. 8 9 Each hospital around the world has issued some internal policy guidelines for oncologists, aiming to limit risks during this difficult time.

If a patient results positive and is asymptomatic 28 days of delay should be considered before (re)starting the treatment.
