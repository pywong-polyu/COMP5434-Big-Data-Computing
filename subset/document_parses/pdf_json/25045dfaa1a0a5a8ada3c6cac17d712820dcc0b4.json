Amongst them, alcohol and tobacco consumption are the most important. Studies characterizing the prevalence of alcohol consumption in low-income countries are lacking. This study describes the prevalence of different levels of alcohol consumptions in Burkina Faso and its associated factors. Design: Data from the 2013 Burkina Faso World Health Organization (WHO) Stepwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS), a population-based cross-sectional survey, were analyzed. The prevalence of alcohol consumption over the last 30 days was recorded and recoded into categories according to WHO recommendations: low, mid or heavy alcohol consumption. Multinomial logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with the different levels of alcohol consumption use. Setting: Population-based cross-sectional survey Participants: 4692 participants of both sexes aged 25 to 64 years were included in the study. Results: In the whole sample 3,559 participants (75.8% [72.5 -78.7]) were not consuming any alcohol, 614 (12.9% [10.9 -15.3]) had a low alcohol consumption, 399 (8.5% [7.1 -10.1]) a mid alcohol consumption and 120 (2.7% [2.0 -3.7]) a heavy consumption. Age was associated",

Tobacco consumption was also significantly associated with alcohol intake with a gradient effect, those with higher tobacco consumption being at higher risk of abusive alcohol intake. Our data showed an important burden of alcohol consumption in Burkina Faso with large disparities across the different regions. To effectively reduce alcohol consumption in Burkina Faso, comprehensive control and prevention campaigns should consider these associated factors.",

Currently, the prevalence of alcohol intake among the African adult population is about 30% [12] , which is lower compared to the rest of the world where 40% of the world's adult population consumes alcohol and the average consumption per drinker is 17.1 liters per year. Interestingly, the prevalence of lifetime abstention, the level of alcohol consumption, and the drinking patterns vary widely across regions of the world [13] . For example, Eastern Europe and Southern Africa had the most detrimental pattern of drinking scores. At the same time, Europe (Eastern and Central) and sub-Saharan Africa (Southern and West) are the most important consumers of alcohol [13] . In Africa, among current drinkers, the prevalence of heavy drinking varied between 7% and 77%, and the prevalence of daily light drinkers varied between 0% and 21%. Overall, drinking patterns varied significantly between and within the examined African countries [14] .",

With the expected increases in the number of potential new alcohol consumers, especially young people, and women, the African continent has indeed been identified by the alcohol beverage industry and market researchers as a key area for alcohol market growth [15, 16] . It is, therefore, of particular importance to identify subjects the most at risk of alcohol consumption. Currently, two major risk factors have been identified worldwide: gender with the male being more at risk [17] and the socioeconomic level where the effect is less clear as the associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and heavier drinking vary depending on country-level income [18] . A group that is particularly at risk because of the vulnerability of the fetus is pregnant women [19] [20] [21] .",

It is, however, interesting to note that from a medical point of view a limited and reasonable alcohol consumption could have some health-related benefits: for example, the relation between dementia and cognitive disorders is not linear and limited alcohol consumption has a protective role for dementia [41] [42] [43] or the protective effect of alcohol on cardiovascular risk, previously known as 'the French paradox' [44] [45] [46] . However, these results must be interpreted with caution, especially since it is known that even in low doses, alcohol consumption transiently increases the risk of cardiovascular accidents [47] . Another important point is that considering the prevention side experiences showed that adopting a too strong position by prohibiting any consumption or behavior will lead to poor results [48, 49] . Considering these two aspects low alcohol consumption could be considered as acceptable. Alcohol policies that regulate the physical availability of alcohol are associated with lower alcohol consumption in low-and middleincome countries [50] . Burkina Faso is at an embryonic stage in this area. Indeed, the country just had its first specifications plan on alcoholic beverages production, importation, and selling adopted in 2020 [51] . This plan was jointly approved by the Ministry of Trade and the companies involved in such activities. Some additional measurements have been adopted by the government. These include the prohibition of advertisements for tobacco and alcohol products and, since September 19, 2019 the government also banned the production, importation and marketing of liqueurs and other spirit drinks in plastic bags and in bottles of less than 30 centiliters to limit the availability [52] . This plan needs to be rigorously implemented first and then rapidly incremented to a stronger legislative law in order to positively impact behavior and health outcomes.",

Another potential limitation is that some well-known risk factors for alcohol consumption were not included in the study because data on these variables have not been collected during the STEPS survey. Part of such variables is socioeconomic status. It is a transversal study; therefore there is a risk of survival bias indicating that older participants with high consumption may die prematurely due to this consumption [53] .

Currently, the prevalence of alcohol intake among the African adult population is about 30% [12] , which is lower compared to the rest of the world where 40% of the world's adult population consumes alcohol and the average consumption per drinker is 17.1 liters per year. Interestingly, the prevalence of lifetime abstention, the level of alcohol consumption, and the drinking patterns vary widely across regions of the world [13] . For example, Eastern Europe and Southern Africa had the most detrimental pattern of drinking scores. At the same time, Europe (Eastern and Central) and sub-Saharan Africa (Southern and West) are the most important consumers of alcohol [13] . In Africa, among current drinkers, the prevalence of heavy drinking varied between 7% and 77%, and the prevalence of daily light drinkers varied between 0% and 21%. Overall, drinking patterns varied significantly between and within the examined African countries [14] , more recent studies showed the same trends in South Africa and Ethiopia [15, 16] .",

With the expected increases in the number of potential new alcohol consumers, especially young people, and women, the African continent has indeed been identified by the alcohol beverage industry and market researchers as a key area for alcohol market growth [17, 18] . It is, therefore, of particular importance to identify subjects the most at risk of alcohol consumption. Currently, two major risk factors have been identified worldwide: gender with the male being more at risk [19] and the socioeconomic level where the effect is less clear as the associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and heavier drinking vary depending on country-level income [20] . Pregnant mothers are particularly more vulnerable due to the fetus's susceptibility [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

[25] There is currently a lack of information about the prevalence of alcohol consumption in Burkina Faso and the associated risk factors. Differences in cultural factors (e.g., beliefs and practices) may influence health status, but social, economic, and structural determinants of health during people's lifespans appear to be associated with health inequities between ethnic groups as well. Therefore, cultural influences should not be overemphasized as discrete explanatory factors for health inequities [26] . [27] . In a previous study, we show that tobacco consumption was highly correlated with alcohol consumption in men [28] . Therefore, this study aims to study the prevalence of alcohol consumption and its associated risk factors. Such kind of analysis is needed to drive more efficient prevention campaigns for both alcohol and tobacco consumption.",

            "text": "The association with tobacco consumption is probably one of the most important from a public health view because of the comorbidities and the double burden it presents for the population. In a previous study, we identified people most at risk of tobacco consumption in Burkina Faso: tobacco smoking among men was significantly associated with increased age and alcohol consumption. Analysis of risk factors for other tobacco use stratified by gender shows that age, education, residence, and alcohol consumption were significantly associated with consumption for women, age, and alcohol consumption for men [28] . As recommended by the WHO, in this paper we presented risk factors associated with abusive alcohol consumption because of the proven negative effects. It is, however, interesting to note that from a medical point of view a limited and reasonable alcohol consumption could have some health-related benefits: for example, the relation between dementia and cognitive disorders is not linear and limited alcohol consumption has a protective role for dementia [45] [46] [47] or the protective effect of alcohol on cardiovascular risk, previously known as 'the French paradox' [48] [49] [50] . However, these results must be interpreted with caution, especially since it is known that even in low doses, alcohol consumption transiently increases the risk of cardiovascular accidents [51] . Another important point is that considering the prevention side experiences showed that adopting a too strong position by prohibiting any consumption or behavior will lead to poor results [52, 53] . Considering these two aspects low alcohol consumption could be considered as acceptable. Alcohol policies that regulate the physical availability of alcohol are associated with lower alcohol consumption in low-and middleincome countries [54] . Burkina Faso is at an embryonic stage in this area. Indeed, the country just had its first specifications plan on alcoholic beverages production, importation, and selling adopted in 2020 [55]. This plan was jointly approved by the Ministry of Trade and the companies involved in such activities. Some additional measurements have been adopted by the government. These include the prohibition of advertisements for tobacco and alcohol products and, since September 19, 2019, the government also banned the production, importation, and marketing of liqueurs and other spirit drinks in plastic bags and bottles of less than 30 centiliters to limit the availability [56] . This plan needs to be rigorously implemented first and then rapidly incremented to a stronger legislative law to positively impact behavior and health outcomes. The main limitation of this study is that alcohol (and tobacco) consumptions were obtained during interviews and is therefore dependent on the faith of the participants. There is, therefore, both a risk of memory bias and social desirability, probably more marked during pregnancy. It can thus be estimated that the numbers and prevalence obtained in this survey underestimate the actual consumption. Another potential limitation is that some well-known risk factors for alcohol consumption were not included in the study because data on these variables have not been collected during the STEPS survey. Part of such variables is socioeconomic status. It is a transversal study; therefore there is a risk of survival bias indicating that older participants with high consumption may die prematurely due to this consumption [57]. The last limitation is that we used data collected in 2013, these data may not represent the actual situation anymore. We have indeed seen that the government has taken measurements to restrict and limit alcohol consumption, therefore the prevalence may be more important than the current situation. However, in this paper, we mainly focus on the risk factor and we do not think that the risk factor has been much modified between 2013 and today. Another STEP survey was planned for 2020 to have more recent numbers but unfortunately, the survey could not take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future the data of this survey could be used to monitor the level of consumption and determine if these measurements are working and if other measures must be taken.",

Interestingly, the prevalence of lifetime abstention, the level of alcohol consumption, and the drinking patterns vary widely across regions of the world [13] . For example, Eastern Europe and Southern Africa had the most detrimental pattern of drinking scores. At the same time, Europe (Eastern and Central) and sub-Saharan Africa (Southern and West) are the most important consumers of alcohol [13] .

With the expected increases in the number of potential new alcohol consumers, especially young people, and women, the African continent has indeed been identified by the alcohol beverage industry and market researchers as a key area for alcohol market growth [17, 18] . It is, therefore, of particular importance to identify subjects the most at risk of alcohol consumption. Currently, two major risk factors have been identified worldwide: gender with the male being more at risk [19] and the socioeconomic level where the effect is less clear as the associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and heavier drinking vary depending on country-level income [20] . Pregnant women are particularly more vulnerable due to the fetus's susceptibility [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

Differences in cultural factors (e.g., beliefs and practices) may influence health status, but social, economic, and structural determinants of health during people's lifespans appear to be associated with health inequities between ethnic groups as well. Therefore, cultural influences should not be overemphasized as discrete explanatory factors for health inequities [26] . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   8 A first national survey was conducted in 2013 using the WHO STEPwise approach to risk factors surveillance (STEPS).

The influence of age on alcohol consumption is still unclear and not well documented in the literature, except for binge drinking, where young adults are the most at risk [43] . However, this result should be interpreted carefully, considering our study design. This could be the results of preventive campaigns as reflected by a cohort effect A large Australian study including 7 cross-sectional waves showed indeed that male cohorts born between 1965 and 1974 and female cohorts born between 1955 and 1974 reported higher rates of drinking participation (p < 0.05), while the most recent cohorts (born in the 1990s) had lower rates of participation (p < 0.01) [44] .",

            "text": "The association with tobacco consumption is probably one of the most important from a public health view because of the comorbidities and the double burden it presents for the population. In a previous study, we identified people most at risk of tobacco consumption in Burkina Faso: tobacco smoking among men was significantly associated with increased age and alcohol consumption. Analysis of risk factors for other tobacco use stratified by gender shows that age, education, residence, and alcohol consumption were significantly associated with consumption for women, age, and alcohol consumption for men [28] . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   17 As recommended by the WHO, in this paper we presented risk factors associated with abusive alcohol consumption because of the proven negative effects. It is, however, interesting to note that from a medical point of view a limited and reasonable alcohol consumption could have some health-related benefits: for example, the relation between dementia and cognitive disorders is not linear and limited alcohol consumption has a protective role for dementia [45] [46] [47] or the protective effect of alcohol on cardiovascular risk, previously known as 'the French paradox' [48] [49] [50] . However, these results must be interpreted with caution, especially since it is known that even in low doses, alcohol consumption transiently increases the risk of cardiovascular accidents [51] . Another important point is that considering the prevention side experiences showed that adopting a too strong position by prohibiting any consumption or behavior will lead to poor results [52, 53] . Considering these two aspects low alcohol consumption could be considered as acceptable. Alcohol policies that regulate the physical availability of alcohol are associated with lower alcohol consumption in low-and middleincome countries [54] . Burkina Faso is at an embryonic stage in this area. Indeed, the country just had its first specifications plan on alcoholic beverages production, importation, and selling adopted in 2020 [55]. This plan was jointly approved by the Ministry of Trade and the companies involved in such activities. Some additional measurements have been adopted by the government. These include the prohibition of advertisements for tobacco and alcohol products and, since September 19, 2019, the government also banned the production, importation, and marketing of liqueurs and other spirit drinks in plastic bags and bottles of less than 30 centiliters to limit the availability [56] . This plan needs to be rigorously implemented first and then rapidly incremented to a stronger legislative law to positively impact behavior and health outcomes. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   18 The main limitation of this study is that alcohol (and tobacco) consumptions were obtained during interviews and is therefore dependent on the faith of the participants. There is, therefore, both a risk of memory bias and social desirability, probably more marked during pregnancy. It can thus be estimated that the numbers and prevalence obtained in this survey underestimate the actual consumption. Another potential limitation is that some well-known risk factors for alcohol consumption were not included in the study because data on these variables have not been collected during the STEPS survey. Part of such variables is socioeconomic status. It is a transversal study; therefore there is a risk of survival bias indicating that older participants with high consumption may die prematurely due to this consumption [57] . The last limitation is that we used data collected in 2013, these data may not represent the actual situation anymore. We have indeed seen that the government has taken measurements to restrict and limit alcohol consumption, therefore the prevalence may be more important than the current situation. However, in this paper, we mainly focus on the risk factor and we do not think that the risk factor has been much modified between 2013 and today. Another STEP survey was planned for 2020 to have more recent numbers but unfortunately, the survey could not take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future the data of this survey could be used to monitor the level of consumption and determine if these measurements are working and if other measures must be taken.",

Interestingly, the effect of age is different regarding the level of consumption: there is an increased risk in male for low (AOR = 2.68 [1.96 -3.67]) and abusive consumption (AOR = 2.89 [1.56 -2.37]), while there is a protective effect against moderate consumption (AOR = 0.38[0.26 -0.55]). The level of education is also associated with an increased risk, regardless of mid, and abusive consumption respectively for participants who reached secondary levels in comparison of people without eduction). There is also an important gradient effect associated with tobacco consumption: the consumption of small tobacco quantity (<5 cigs/day) is associated with an increased risk of low alcohol consumption (AOR = 1.72 [1.13 -2.62]) while the consumption of high quantity of tobacco is associated with mid and abusive alcohol consumption (AOR = 6.08 [2.75 -13.4] and 6.58 [1.96 -22.11] respectively). Finally, we computed the risk of having abusive consumption in those consuming alcohol (Table 4). Sex is an important risk factor with increased risk for the men compared to women (AOR = 2.53 [1.38 -4.68]) as well as the occupational status with jobless people and housemaker associated with a decreased risk of having abusive consumption (AOR = 0.05 [0.01 -0.47] and AOR = 0.14 [0.02 -0.78] respectively).",

Studies characterizing the prevalence of alcohol consumption in low-income countries are lacking. This study describes the prevalence of different levels of alcohol consumptions in Burkina Faso and its associated factors. Design: Data from the 2013 Burkina Faso World Health Organization (WHO) Stepwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS), were analyzed. The prevalence of alcohol consumption over the last 30 days was recorded into categories according to WHO recommendations: low, mid, or heavy alcohol consumption. Multinomial logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with the different levels of alcohol consumption use. Setting: Population-based cross-sectional survey Participants: Overall, 4692 participants of both sexes aged 25 to 64 years were included in the study. for abusive consumption in comparison with no consumption).

Our data showed an important burden of alcohol consumption in Burkina Faso. Tobacco consumption is an important modifiable risk factor associated with alcohol consumption. Zone-specific interventions are needed given the higher burden in urban centers and some specific regions such as the Sud-Ouest region. Health policies in Burkina Faso must henceforth account for the control of alcohol and tobacco consumption since there is a strong relationship between those two important risk factors of NCDs. Alcohol policies that regulate the physical availability of alcohol are associated with lower alcohol consumption and should, therefore, be implemented in Burkina Faso to reduce the burden of alcohol consumption.
