The unusual design of the ceiling is based on octagons surrounded by fourpointed stars. This is used as the point of departure for a mathematical investigation of polyhedral forms. Two different polyhedra are constructed, conceived in such a way that the honeycombs generated by them, can be considered a polyhedral generalization of the planar pattern of regular octagons and four-pointed stars. Both are constructed by means of special truncations of a cube. The truncation procedure is extended to construct a polyhedral generalization of the planar pattern of fourpointed stars and 45\u00b0 rhombuses; in this case, the polyhedron obtained is a variation of one of the star polyhedra drawn by Jamnitzer. The geometric honeycombs thus defined could be used as models for new designs.",

The main coffers are juxtaposed to squared central coffers, with triangular faces filling the gaps between the two. The decoration is plain, accomplished by means of simple mouldings. The octagonal coffers finish with carved vegetal motifs; the square ones present an intermediate row of small dentils and a carved central rosette.

During the Renaissance, patterns with octagons were used in the design of the ceilings in different materials. In the early Renaisance wooden ceilings, patterns based only on squares are frequent; two of the numerous examples are the ceiling of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome and the ceiling of the Old Hall (Sala Vella) of Palacio de la Generalidad (c. 1481). However, thanks to the skill and geometric knowledges of traditional carpenters, the Spanish sixteenth-century ceilings soon developed more complex patterns with varied geometric shapes and combinations of them. Worthy of mention are the Montezumo Palace in Zaragoza, which features coffered ceilings imported from the demolished sixteenth-century Palacio Aytona, one of which is designed with elongated hexagons while another one presents an unusual design with parallel rows of symmetric rhombuses with alternating inclination. 9 Parallel rows of regular hexagons alternating with pairs of equilateral triangles 10 can be seen in the design of the ceiling of the Salon del Trono of Palacio Pastrana in Guadalajara. Hexagons surrounded by equilateral triangles 11 are used in the Sala Norte of Palacio de Miguel Donlope in Zaragoza. The ceiling of the Paraninfo of the University of Alcal\u00e1 (ca. 1516-1520) deserves a special mention. Designed with six-pointed stars surrounded by hexagonal coffers, 12 it is considered one of the masterpieces of traditional Spanish carpentry. 13 Also remarkable is the complex design of the Sala Honda of Cuenca Cathedral with rhombuses, triangles, hexagons and six-pointed stars. 14 In Spain and throughout Europe, patterns with regular octagons with side in contact and squares 15 are very frequent in sixteenth century wooden ceilings. Examples can be seen in the small Golden Hall (Sala Daurada Menuda) of Generalitat's Palace in Valencia (c. 1519-1535) and in the late sixteenth century ceiling of Palazzo Raimondi in Cremona (Grimoldi and Landi 2015) . However, the pattern using octagons with vertices in contact and four-pointed stars (Fig. 3c) is unusual.",

At that time, these were translated from the Tuscan into Spanish by Francisco de Villalpando (1510-1561) and published in Toledo in 1552 (Serlio 1552 ). Covarrubias's designs for coffered ceilings were inspired by the drawings shown in Book IV in the section devoted to the planar ceilings and their ornaments (De i Cieli piani di legname, & de gli ornamenti suoi) (Serlio 1552: LXXIII-LXXVII). An example is shown in the decoration of the church of San Rom\u00e1n in Toledo (Fig. 4d) , where Covarrubias copies one of Serlio's drawings of regular octagons surrounded by elongated hexagons and intersecting rectangles (Serlio 1552: LXXIV) . 18 It is noteworthy that the pattern using octagons and four-pointed stars does not appear in those plates; rhombuses and four-pointed In any case, the Spanish wooden ceilings and the ceiling of Qalawun complex (Fig. 5b) , in spite of their common design, are structurally different. The ceiling of Qalawun complex is a decorative panel superimposed on the structure of the ceiling. The octagonal holes are determined by the crossing of the wooden ribs; in this case, it is a hemispheric variation of the polyhedral openings, characteristic of the interlacing Islamic frames. The ceiling in Alcazar de Sevilla is another example (Fig. 6a) .",

            "text": "Note that the key to dissecting S3 is to locate an occult point P (see Fig. 7b ) to get a polyhedral kite with at least six faces, three of which are planar kites mutually meeting perpendicularly. The choice of that point is determined by the given conditions, as well as by the generalization to space of the metric properties of the regular octagon. Figure 7a shows a planar kite OGPH. Observe that the vertex P belongs to the circle whose centre is O and whose radius is the side of the tile S2, OG. Also, P is equidistant from the vertices G and H, consequently P belongs to the bisector line of the right angle \u2220HOG. Translating both properties to space for the 3D-kite ABCDEFPO (Fig. 7b) , the hidden point P should belong to the sphere whose centre is O and whose radius is the edge of the tile S3, OA. Analogously, the point P should belong to a bisector plane of a right dihedral angle spanned by two coordinate planes; and P should be equidistant from the vertices A, B, C, D, E and F. In the plane kite, the relationship between \"be equidistant from\" and \"belong to the bisector line\" is unequivocally determined. However, in space, we have three bisector planes, so the number of the involved planes could be one, two or three. In addition, in space, the condition of equidistance applied to P and a general set of six points is complex to state, because the possibility of the equality of distances depends on the position of the six points in space. In general, numerous possibilities for the coordinates of P should be considered, but in the particular case of the six vertices of the 3D-kite {A, B, C, D, E, F} the possibilities are reduced because the equilateral triangles ACE and BDF belong to parallel planes (Fig. 8b) . In fact, the point P can only be equidistant from trios or pairs of vertices {A, B, C, D, E, F} and thus two possibilities must to be distinguished, Case I and Case II. ",

Since the equilateral triangles ACE and BDF belong to parallel planes, only one point of the circumscribed sphere is simultaneously equidistant from the vertices of both triangles. Algebraically, this means that the coordinates of the point P are the solution of the equation system { x = y = z; x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1 ; x > 0, y > 0, z > 0 }. Thus, P = (\u221a3/3, \u221a3/3, \u221a3/3). The 3D-kite placed in the first octant is first determined, then by its reflection with respect to the three coordinate planes, a 3D-octagon is determined with vertices (\u00b1 1,0,0), (0, \u00b1 1, 0,), (0,0, \u00b1 1), (\u00b1 \u221a3/3, \u00b1 \u221a3/3, \u00b1 \u221a3/3), (\u00b1 \u221a2/2, \u00b1 \u221a2/2, 0), (\u00b1 \u221a2/2, 0, \u00b1 \u221a2/2), (0, \u00b1 \u221a2/2, \u00b1 \u221a2/2).

The Renaissance building we see today was built in the sixteenth century by Diego de Cazalla, a converted Jewish civil servant of the Crown. It belonged to the Buenavista counts until the nineteenth century. It was then used as a tenement house, school, carpenter's workshop and hospital until 1938. Neglected by its owners, it was finally donated to the state in 1946, and became the home of the Fine Arts Museum inaugurated in 1961.
