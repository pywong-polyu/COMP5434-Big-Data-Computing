HCWs are vital in our response to COVID-19. Of COVID-19 case reports sent to the CDC early in the pandemic (February-April 2020) that included data on HCW status, 19% were identified as HCWs [1] . Due to occupational exposure to infectious patients and materials, HCWs have the potential for increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and prior studies indicate that HCWs are at increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 [1] [2] [3] [4] 6] . Furthermore, occupational factors such as role, setting, and PPE availability have been shown to be associated with seroprevalence in HCWs [2, 3, [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, it remains unsettled whether these occupational features translate into higher risk of infection among HCWs relative to the risk of community transmission, and if so, which HCWs are at highest risk. Other studies have observed that HCWs have lower or equal infection risk to that of the community and report that hospital work was not associated with infection [7, 9] . This could possibly be explained by infection prevention strategies [7, 10] .",

Variation in findings could be due to several reasons including the stage of the pandemic at which the study was performed, variable community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, differing infection control policies, and access to appropriate PPE. Additionally, understanding the makeup of the HCW sample is important as HCWs with direct patient care responsibilities, particularly for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, clearly carry a higher risk for occupational exposure and infection compared to those in roles without direct patient contact. This is supported by our findings that work in the ICU was related to an increased risk of infection. The increased risk from working in the ICU is likely linked to increased exposure to COVID-19 patients or possibly exposure to aerosols generated by patient ventilation; these exposures would be particularly relevant to specialties directly involved in managing patients on ventilators. Accordingly, we previously observed that 30% of participants working in ICUs reported a direct COVID-19 exposure within the past two weeks as compared to 6% of HCWs in ambulatory clinical settings [15] , reinforcing the importance of obtaining more detailed specialty information in future work. Other cross-sectional serosurveillance studies have found no association between setting and seropositivity [20] . And some have reported that working in the ICU was associated with lower risk of being seropositive compared to those working in the emergency department/acute medicine [3] . Our finding that nurses, NPs, and PAs had higher seroprevalence than physicians, although not statistically significant is empirically consistent with reports from some [8] but not all prior studies [3, 20] . The timing of our study, which took place November 2020 -January 2021, is unique in comparison to the aforementioned studies which were generally conducted in the spring and summer of 2020 when community infection rates were much lower than was observed in our current study.",

As there is still limited information on the duration and variability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody response to infection, it is likely that our seroprevalence estimates are underestimates; specifically, we might have missed infections that occurred early in the pandemic for which antibody response waned or infections that occurred shortly before serology testing. Additionally, there are several potential sources of bias including information bias on reporting of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 and recall bias related to vaccination dates, albeit this potential is minimized among healthcare professionals. As noted above, lack of precise information on the specialties of healthcare providers with direct patient contact limits conclusions about where risk is highest. Finally, the imperfect test sensitivity may bias the seroprevalence estimates, although we adjusted for testing error and found little impact on our estimates. It is also possible that information on setting and role, which was collected in April 2020 -June 2020, changed before participation in our seroprevalence studies conducted in November 2020 -January 2021. Among a population of HCWs in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN metropolitan area, approximately one-in-six were infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on seropositivity. Seroprevalenc\u1ebd doubled during a three-month period between November 2020 and January 2021. Among unvaccinated individuals, physicians were at an empirically lower risk of being seropositive/ previously infected. HCWs in ICU, inpatient, EMS, or emergency department settings experienced higher risk for being seropositive/previously infected. Given the high transmission rates and increasing hospitalization rates broadly occurring the U.S. at this time, future research that can inform optimal safety protocols for healthcare workers with direct patient contact will be important.",
