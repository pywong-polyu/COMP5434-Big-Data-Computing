At the same time, recent research has underlined the importance of investigating how different sub-kinds of abstract concepts are represented. We report a pre-registered experiment, preceded by a pilot study, in which we asked participants to evaluate the difficulty of 3 kinds of concrete concepts (natural objects, tools, and food concepts) and abstract concepts (Philosophical and Spiritual concepts, PS, Physical Space Time and Quantity concepts, PSTQ, and Emotional, Mental State and Social concepts, EMSS). While rating the words, participants were assigned to different conditions designed to interfere with conceptual processing: they were required to squeeze a ball (hand motor system activation), to chew gum (mouth motor system activation), to self-estimate their heartbeats (interoception), and to perform a motor articulatory task (inner speech involvement). In a control condition they simply rated the difficulty of words. A possible interference should result in the increase of the difficulty ratings. Bayesian analyses reveal that, compared to concrete ones, abstract concepts are more grounded in interoceptive experience and concrete concepts less in linguistic experience (mouth motor system involvement), and that the experience on which different kinds of abstract and concrete concepts differs widely. For example, within abstract concepts interoception plays a major role for EMSS and PS concepts, while the ball squeezing condition interferes more for PSTQ concepts, confirming that PSTQ are the most concrete among abstract concepts, and tap into sensorimotor manual experience. Implications of the results for current theories of conceptual representation are discussed. mantic diversity (see also Hoffman, 2016).",

For example, Hoffman, Lambon Ralph, and Rogers (2013) found substantial variation across words in semantic diversity (SemD), which measures the degree of context-dependent variability in word meaning. Concrete concepts appeared in a restricted, inter-related set of contexts and consequently had low semantic diversity values; while abstract concepts tend to be used in a broad range of contexts and consequently showed high values in se-concepts activate the sensorimotor system but also the emotional dimension (e.g., Newcombe, Campbell, Siakaluk, & Pexman, 2012; Kousta, Vigliocco, Vinson, Andrews, & Del Campo, 2011; Vigliocco et al., 2014) , and the linguistic and social one (Borghi et al., 2019a; Dove, 2019; Glenberg, 2019) . Here we focus on the WAT (Words As social Tools) theory (Borghi & Cimatti, 2009; Borghi & Binkofski, 2014; Borghi, Barca, Binkofski, & Tummolini, 2018a; Borghi et al., 2019a Borghi et al., , 2019b , according to which abstract concepts are not only grounded in sensorimotor experience, similarly to concrete concepts, but activate linguistic, social and interoceptive experiences to a larger extent than concrete concepts. The WAT view proposes that the activation of linguistic and social experience during processing and use of abstract concepts might be due to different reasons. These reasons are not incompatible, and they all stem from the basic consideration that abstract concepts are more complex than concrete ones. We consider abstract concepts as more complex than concrete ones for a variety of reasons. First, they generally do not have a single object as referent, as concrete concepts, but refer to more complex scenes and elements. For example, the abstract concept of \"cause\" involves an agent, a patient, an action (Pulverm\u00fcller, 2018) . Second, they are more complex to learn because their members are more heterogeneous and different than those of concrete concepts -justice situations are certainly more diverse from each other than different tables. This complexity has a behavioral effect, i.e. the widely replicated concreteness effect (Paivio, 1986) . Abstract concepts require generally longer times to be processed, and are recalled less accurately than concrete concept.",

            "text": "The first reason for the importance of the social and linguistic dimension for abstract concepts is their particular acquisition modality: linguistic inputs offered by others are crucial in order to keep together the variety of heterogeneous events and situations that characterize abstract concepts (labels as glue of heterogeneous experiences) (Lupyan, 2019) . During abstract concepts processing participants might re-enact such verbal linguistic acquisition experience. Even if further research should clarify this, this mechanism might be present also when words are in the written modality, influential especially for learning low-frequency abstract words. Indeed, evidence suggests (e.g., Topolinski & Strack, 2009 ) that during reading we simulate the motor responses associated with verbal stimuli. The second reason and the third reason stem from the feeling of uncertainty and the metacognitive awareness that our knowledge of abstract concepts is scarce and inadequate (see Borghi, Fini, & Tummolini, 2020) . This awareness might lead to two different outcomes. The first is the need to rehearse and reexplain to ourselves the word meaning, possibly through inner speech. The second is the preparation to ask information to competent others (social metacognition; Borghi et al., 2018a ; see also Shea, 2018; Prinz, 2014) . Importantly, all these mechanisms might not only lead to the activation of linguistic and social networks, but also engage the mouth motor system more than processing of concrete concepts does. In line with an embodied account, we namely hypothesize that using both overt and inner speech implies a motor simulation that involves the mouth motor system (Topolinski & Strack, 2009; Alderson-Day & Fernyhough, 2015) . Consistently, a variety of studies have demonstrated that the mouth motor system is involved to a larger extent during abstract than during concrete concepts processing (review in Borghi et al., 2019a) , and in particular during processing of mental states abstract concepts (Dreyer & Pulverm\u00fcller, 2018; Ghio, Vaghi, & Tettamanti, 2013) . Furthermore, it is possible that \"concrete\" concepts may be more readily referenced through non-verbal/non-linguistic means e.g., deictic gestures, as they more likely refer to physical objects in space, while \"abstract\" concepts may need to be supplemented by other communicative tools (such as inner speech).",

In the domain of concrete concepts, instead, much research on sub-kinds of concepts has been conducted. Neuropsychological and brain imaging studies have focused in particular on the double dissociation between living and non-living entities and on their different neural representation (Warrington & Shallice, 1984; review: Forde & Humphreys, 2005) , behavioral studies have investigated the roughly correspondent distinction between artifacts and natural objects and on how it develops in children (Keil, 1989) .

Participants were told that their evaluations would be used to contribute to select the verbal stimuli for an experiment, and were asked to what extent they perceived the presented words as difficult and pleasant, without any further specification. We chose to avoid orienting participants toward a specific meaning of difficulty, and to use the common sense of the word. However, we think that the cover story leads them to interpret difficulty in terms of \"difficulty in processing\". Participants were assigned to 3 different conditions: in the ball condition they had to rhythmically squeeze a ball, in the gum condition to rhythmically chew gum, and in the candy condition to suck a candy. These conditions were designed to verify whether actively moving the mouth interfered with abstract concepts processing, and actively manipulating a ball with processing of concrete concepts. The candy condition was intended as a control one. A higher processing difficulty should lead to an increase in rated difficulty and a decrease in rated pleasantness.",

            "text": "The rationale of our pilot experiment builds on this previous work, but with two important differences. First, we intended to test not only the effect of the mouth active movement (gum chewing) and of the hand active movement (ball squeezing) on difficulty and pleasantness ratings, but also the effects of interoceptive experience (Connell, Lynott, & Banks, 2018; Borghi et al., 2019a) and of social experience (Borghi & Cimatti, 2009; Borghi & Binkofski, 2014; Borghi et al., 2018a Borghi et al., , 2019a on abstract concepts processing. Hence, in the Pilot study we added to the gum and to the ball condition two further conditions, i.e., the interoceptive condition, in which participants were asked to hold an instant cold or warm pack, and the social condition, in which they were required to hold the hand of a confederate. Second, the main aim of the Pilot study was not to identify differences between abstract and concrete concepts, but more subtle differences within abstract concepts. To identify sub-kinds of abstract concepts, we relied on the study by Villani et al. (2019) . In this norming study participants were asked to evaluate 425 Italian abstract words on 15 dimensions (i.e., Abstractness, Concreteness, Imageability, Context availability, Body-Object-Interaction, Modality of Acquisition, Age of Acquisition, Perceptual modality strength, Metacognition, Social metacognition, Interoception, Emotionality, Social valence, Hand and Mouth activation). We then performed a cluster analysis that led to the identification of 4 clusters of abstract concepts, i.e., Philosophical and Spiritual concepts (PS) (e.g., value, belief), Emotional and Mental State concepts (EMS) (e.g., anger), Social and Self concepts (SS) (e.g., kindness) and Physical Space Time and Quantity (PSTQ) (e.g., reflex, sum). PS concepts were more abstract than the others, i.e., acquired late (e.g. Kuperman, Stadthagen-Gonzalez, & Brysbaert, 2012) and through language, and more characterized by the tendency to ask the meaning to others (social metacognition), PSTQ concepts were more concrete, i.e., more imageable, more characterized by bodily interactions with the environment. SS and EMS were more characterized by inner grounding, i.e., interoception and emotional valence and metacognition, and by sensorimotor properties (taste, smell, etc.). Further details of four kinds of abstract concepts and their cluster distributions can be found at https://osf.io/ 4bztv/. As in the previous study by Borghi and Lugli (unpublished) , participants were required to perform pleasantness and difficulty judgments on a 5-point scale. Both scores and response times were recorded. The reason why we choose to use pleasantness and difficulty ratings is due to the fact that, in the literature, a relationship has been found between abstraction and disfluency, and concreteness and fluency (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2008 , but see one experiment for a failure to replicate https://osf.io/kegmc/wiki/home/). Increased fluency augments preference for a given stimulus (Winkielman, Schwarz, Fazendeiro, & Reber, 2003) . For example, the increased fluency of pronunciation simulation, owing to the exposure, leads to an increase of word pleasantness (Topolinski & Strack, 2009) .",

In addition, the social manipulation might have not been successful because touching someone you do not know could render it very difficult to concentrate on the experiment. Finally, in three of four manipulated conditions participants were asked to use their hand -this might have reduced the differences between the conditions. The present pre-registered Experiment was designed to overcome these limitations. We confined ourselves to difficulty rating, for which the results of the previous study were more clear-cut. We selected three kinds of concrete and abstract concepts, controlled the materials, and modified two of the four conditions. The conditions to which participants were randomly assigned were: ball squeezing, gum chewing, heart beating, and articulatory suppression. For the heart beating condition we asked participants to estimate their heart beat pace and at the end of the task to report if they had noticed any change; self-estimation of heart beating within a given time is a task often used to measure interoceptive awareness (Schandry, 1981; Garfinkel, Seth, Barrett, Suzuki, & Critchley, 2015) . In order to test whether processing of abstract concepts does not only involve the mouth but implies use of inner speech, we introduced an articulatory suppression condition, since AS is often used to test involvement of inner speech (Alderson-Day & Fernyhough, 2015) . In the articulatory suppression condition participants were required to rhythmically pronounce the syllable \"ba ba ba\". Finally, we introduced a control condition, in which participants were asked to evaluate the difficulty of the words without performing any additional task. The control condition was introduced primarily because the conditions might differ in terms of executive demands. Conditions that capture more attention could more easily lead to interference, while conditions that involve low processing load might not affect the results (Connell & Lynott, 2012) . We introduced the control condition also to better understand whether an interference or a facilitation occurred with respect to the baseline. It is worth noting that the control condition was not present in the original design and in the preregistration; we introduced it because the reviewers asked for it. Differently from the other conditions, in the control condition participants were tested online, since the lock-down due to the spread of COVID-19 did not allow us to test participants in the lab.",

Concrete words included 10 natural objects (animals, e.g., lion, camel), 10 manipulable artifacts (tools, e.g., hammer, broom) and 10 food items (e.g., carrot, eggplant) Concrete stimuli are shown in Table 3 . We selected these three categories because these can be considered almost exhaustive of the categorical space and are used in the majority of studies on concrete concepts. Since the seminal work by Warrington and Shallice (1984) , many studies on concrete concepts have focused on the distinction between artifacts and natural objects (for a review on the living/nonliving double dissociation see Forde & Humphreys, 2005) . Recent studies are targeted at investigating the specificity of food concepts, which possess a special status since they are neither natural nor artifact objects (Rumiati & Foroni, 2016) . Within artifacts, we focused on tools, more likely to activate the hand motor system (see Martin, 2007 , for a review).",

Since it would have been unfeasible to achieve that number due to objective constraints (N = 120 students enrolled in the class, and a time limited to one month), we decided to determine an effect size as the minimum amount of observations needed to have a relatively stable estimate. Based on Green (1991)'s rule of thumb for determining the smallest sample size, we would need 104 + k (where k is the number of predictors, i.e., number of groups \u22121 = 3). Therefore, any sample size greater than 107 would be enough to avoid overfitting. However, since inferences based on the Null Hypothesis Significance Testing are problematic without adequately controlling for the Type I and Type II error at the same time (Dienes, 2008) , we used a Bayesian approach, instead. The sample size consisted of around 100-120 participants (25-30 per condition).",

Our hypotheses were tested through the \"hypothesis\" function on brms, which assesses the relative strength of evidence in favor of competitive hypotheses using the Savage-Dickey density ratio method, which compares the plausibility of a hypothesis (e.g., the null hypothesis \"abstracts = concrete\" under the prior vs. under the posterior probability distribution).

It is therefore possible that the effect of suppression increases the difficulty of all linguistic stimuli, irrespective of their abstractness level. The result contrasts with recent evidence (Zannino et al., unpublished) in which we found a selective interference of articulatory suppression on abstract concepts processing, in a task in which we asked participants to judge whether words were concrete or abstract and we measured response times. It is therefore possible that the absence of a selective interference due to articulatory suppression is owing to the specific task we selected, that required participants to explicitly evaluate conceptual difficulty and did not consider their online performance.

According to the general claim of the WAT proposal abstract concepts are more characterized than concrete ones by linguistic experience (see also Dove, 2019, LENS proposal) , hence mouth activation, and by inner grounding and interoceptive experience (see also Connell et al., 2018) , and less characterized than concrete ones by sensorimotor experience related to hand experiences. This general claim was supported by our results: perceived difficulty of abstract concepts selectively increased when participants were required to perform a task requiring interoceptive awareness (heart beating condition). Furthermore, when their mouth active movement was not allowed the processing of concrete concepts and of the more concrete within abstract concepts, PSTQ, was facilitated, suggesting the presence of a higher difficulty at the increase of the abstractness level of concepts (gum chewing condition). Finally, perceived difficulty of concrete concepts, and particularly of tools, increased when participants had to manipulate an object (ball squeezing condition). Notice that, even if the instructions we gave did not specify what we intended with \"difficulty\" of the word, our results suggest that this was interpreted as difficulty of processing: the words perceived as easier were \"dog\" (cane), \"grapes\" (uva), and \"banana\" (banana), while the words perceived as more difficult across conditions were \"acceleration\" (accelerazione), \"enigma\" (enigma) and \"salvation\" (salvezza) (see supplementary materials).",
