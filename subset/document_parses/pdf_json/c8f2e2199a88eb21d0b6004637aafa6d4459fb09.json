At the same time, while institutions have increased the presence of racially minoritized people among the ranks of faculty over the last 30 years, this growth in numbers has been concentrated among non-tenure track and pre-tenure levels. This study analyzes the ways that ambiguity in the tenure evaluation process contributes to the racialized hierarchy of the professoriate. Framed by theories of strategic ambiguity and racialized organizations, we interviewed 30 pre-tenure faculty at a research-intensive university. Findings reveal that faculty in our study relate to the ambiguity of tenure evaluation primarily in one of two ways: 1) with ambivalent acceptance or 2) with a critical understanding of ambiguity as strategic, benefitting the institution. These relationships to ambiguity were differentiated by race, with White faculty describing ambivalence and racially minoritized faculty critiquing ambiguity as strategic and inequitable. Finally, we found some evidence that some White pre-tenure faculty found paths to clarity through racial privilege. Implications for research and practice include a clearer understanding of the ways ambiguity in higher education is strategic and racialized.",

The processes that we address in this paper are not a function of the individual faculty members' identities but the historical and ongoing systems of oppression and exclusion. \"Faculty of color\" places the focus on the faculty member's identities and difference from White faculty. \"Minoritized faculty\" helps the reader to focus on the systems of exclusion and oppression embedded in the organization that are in effect \"minoritizing\" the faculty members at all times. (Croom & Patton, 2011; Griffin, 2020; Turner et al., 2008) . Educational researchers and higher education administrators have primarily focused on this racial disparity as a 'pipeline' issue, connected to a broad system of social and educational racial discrimination (Griffin, 2020, p. 59) . However, organizational processes within colleges and universities facilitate the exclusion of racially minoritized faculty from the highest levels of professional authority (Croom, 2017; Wright-Mair & Museus, 2021) .",

In this study, we look at one of the mechanisms that allows for the tenure evaluation process to continue to perpetuate and legitimate inequities: through its ambiguity. The tenure evaluation process is strategically ambiguous, governed by criteria that are unclear in ways that benefit the institution but at the same time are an important part of the racialization of higher education organizations (Ray, 2019) . Among the pre-tenure faculty participants in this study, minoritized faculty articulate critiques of the ways ambiguity maintains the status quo and sustains the exclusion of people of color from positions of power within the academy. The theory of strategic ambiguity offers a way of understanding how ambiguity functions in colleges and universities. In this analysis, we apply this theory in order to understand the ways that the ambiguity of the tenure evaluation process may serve institutional ends such as deniability while at the same time mitigating against efforts toward equity and inclusion. This paper asks and answers the following guiding research questions:",

These studies characterized the tenure evaluation process as stressful, full of contradictions, and often highly conducive to reproducing racial and gender inequality (Wolf-Wendel & Ward, 2015) . One of the key features of the process is the lack of clarity in the evaluation criteria. Across institutional types and sizes, the pillars of faculty work evaluation are research, teaching, and service (Uzuner- Smith & Englander, 2015) but how excellence in each of those areas is judged is unclear (Eddy & Gaston-Gayles, 2008) . In their foundational study, Austin and Rice (1998) conducted focus groups with over 300 faculty, concluding that overall, the pathway to tenure was obscured, governed more by hidden rules than explicit guidelines. They concluded their study with a call for greater clarity in the tenure evaluation process.",

As informal social networks are key to understanding tenure evaluation criteria, minoritized faculty are more likely to report inadequate or unhelpful mentorship, which can hinder their access to important information about evaluation (Stanley, 2006; Zambrana et al., 2015) . Participants in Urrieta and colleagues' (2015) study of Latinx faculty experiences described tenure as a 'moving target,' with unclear guidelines unevenly applied. Critically informed scholarship on race and inequality, that challenges the status quo of a discipline (work often undertaken by minoritized faculty members) is often devalued in tenure reviews and can be difficult to publish in mainstream and high impact journals (Settles et al., 2021) . Other research has demonstrated that evaluation criteria may be subject to racial bias. Student evaluations of faculty teaching, for example, are commonly included among the tenure evaluation criteria across disciplines and institutional types, even though multiple studies have established that they are subject to racial and gender bias (Bavishi et al., 2010; Smith & Hawkins, 2011) .",

As an example, Eisenberg described the way organizational members are sometimes united behind the 'family' metaphor. By deploying this strategically ambiguous metaphor, organizations can influence behavior and gain a sense of unity without making specific commitments. \"Individuals believe that they agree on what it means to be part of a 'family,' yet their actual interpretations may remain quite different\" (p. 232-233).

These questions go largely unaddressed by Eisenberg (1984) and subsequent applications and variations of the theory (see Davenport & Leitch, 2006; Tracy & Ashcraft, 2001) . However, in light of Victor Ray's (2019) call to examine the racialized nature of organizational processes, we have put this theory into conversation with questions of equity. Ray's approach \"replaces the notion of organizations as race-neutral with a view of organizations as constituting and constituted by racial processes\" (p. 27). There is ample evidence that ambiguity (strategic or not) contributes to inequitable realities for students in higher education, whether through admissions policies (Rosinger et al., 2020) or graduate education for students of color (Levin et al., 2013) . This current study demonstrates that strategic ambiguity is part of a racialized process that sustains the racial hierarchy within the professoriate.",

Without useful or consistent information from official sources, the pre-tenure faculty in our study had to make high-stakes decisions about how and where to focus their energies and dedicate their time. Often these tough decisions centered on prioritizing research projects and selecting publication outlets. The participants described contradictions between principle and practice when it came to balance between the major categories of tenure evaluation-research, teaching, and service. Several White participants acknowledged the inequity embedded in the ambiguity. For example, Brenda, a White woman, considered the intersection of social identity and high-stakes ambiguity: \"The ambiguity is really hard to navigate, and I think it's additionally so for underrepresented, historically underrepresented faculty members, right?\" For many White participants like Brenda, this ambiguity was viewed with ambivalence, understood as having both good and bad aspects. \"I also think in some ways the ambiguity is meant to protect you, right? It's meant to help you understand that a successful tenure candidate can look different, right?\" From this 'good side/ bad side' perspective, the nature of faculty work necessitates some ambiguity in evaluation criteria.

Mary, a White woman, described the positive aspect as leniency. \"You need some sort of ambiguity,-You need some sort of leniency I should say, rather than ambiguity, leniency for people to make their case and their argument.\" Mary expressed what many participants described as a kind of equivocal ambiguity, with both benefits and downsides, perhaps, as one participant put it, \"a necessary evil.\" Necessary because the nature of faculty work is highly differentiated and cannot all be evaluated according to a standard rubric.

For these participants there were important unanswered questions about number and quality of publications but also about how teaching and service were evaluated. Like their White colleagues at this research-focused institution, minoritized academics were quite clear that scholarly publications mattered most but found ambiguity in the less emphasized areas of teaching and service equally unsettling. Even service, which was the least valued of the three pillars of evaluation according to participants, was an area with contradictions and ambiguity. Participants questioned what forms of service were valued and how much time to invest in them. Likewise, questions lingered in their minds about which measures of teaching excellence mattered. Were student evaluations of teaching valued more highly than enrollment numbers or type of course taught? Though participants agreed these areas were less emphasized than the number and prestige of publications, they still worried that ambiguity in how these areas were evaluated would be used against them.

In our analysis ambiguity is a part of this decoupling. The faculty handbook and its explicit discussion of tenure evaluation is perhaps the least helpful source for the participants in our study. Rather, informal social networks convey bits and pieces of advice, stories, and hints that pre-tenure faculty cobble together to guide them.

Employing strategic ambiguity in tenure evaluation criteria serves the university's ends in a number of ways. It promotes maximum productivity from pre-tenure faculty by making the goals for research and publication obscure yet ever-increasing. It protects the university from litigation in the event that tenure is denied (Ward, 2021) . Strategic ambiguity allows the university to send multiple, often contradictory, messages about what is valued in faculty performance without incurring conflict, allowing \"multiple interpretations to exist among people who contend that they are attending to the same message\" (Eisenberg, 1984, p. 231) .

Multiple studies send a clear message: racially minoritized faculty experience racism in a wide array of organizational processes from hiring (Cahn et al., 2021) , to bias in student evaluations (Smith & Hawkins, 2011) , disproportionate workloads of undervalued work such as service and mentorship (Griffin & Reddick, 2011) , exclusion from departmental networks (Urrieta et al., 2015) , and devaluation of their research (Settles et al., 2021) . Ambiguity cloaks these interlocking practices and connects them invisibly to promotion and rank. Higher education researchers and administrators must critically interrogate all the processes that surround faculty work evaluation in order to promote equity in the tenure system. For example, Emily's demands in the hiring process led to advantages in her path to tenure. Sharon's focus on racial inequality in her research led to a sense that her work would not be afforded the proper consideration. Michelle struggles with an exhausting workload of managing White colleague's emotional reactions. Though each of these dynamics happens in a different arena of faculty work-departmental, disciplinary, interpersonal-they each feed into tenure evaluation at points obscured by ambiguity. Indeed, though participants in this study were drawn from 17 different disciplines, the experience of ambiguity as a mechanism of inequality was shared by all minoritized faculty. Institutions that are serious about racial diversity among faculty should find ways to prioritize transparency in the tenure process. For example, institutions might conduct workshops for department chairs on the evaluation of tenure-track faculty that frame clarity of communication as an equity issue. Similarly, formal faculty mentoring networks should emphasize the importance of dispelling ambiguity surrounding expectations for tenure. Faculty, especially minoritized faculty should not be expected to decipher the unspoken rules of tenure.",

Department chairs and deans can support faculty and promote racial equity by eliminating ambiguity through clear, specific communication. As many participants in this study pointed out, on the surface there are compelling reasons for ambiguity and many well-intentioned departmental leaders may be sustaining ambiguity in the name of individualized evaluation.

The results of this study should encourage advisors and mentors of graduate students to be clear and specific in communications with advisees, particularly racially minoritized students who are considering a career on the tenure track. Further research could examine how ambiguity in graduate student advising is strategic, what role organizational processes play in producing it, and to what extent it contributes to racial and gender inequity. In much the same way, the findings of this study could be helpful in understanding the role of ambiguous organizational processes as it relates to a variety of facets of higher education including admissions, hiring, and undergraduate education.",

The mesolevel focus of this analysis reveals insight into the types of organizational processes that impede progress toward diversity goals. It is difficult to foster organizational change and achieve more equitable representation of marginalized groups in powerful positions if the very evaluative procedures by which they gain that power are key factors in the racialization of colleges and universities. By examining the hidden rules of the university, we can create more equitable practices in many areas.",

Despite the vast changes in the structure and function of colleges and universities, the way we determine the success of faculty work remains subjective and idiosyncratic. To some extent these characteristics endure because they are essential to keeping the university hierarchy in place and mitigating against organizational change. What is lost when the maintenance of the status quo is prioritized in a racialized organization? In Eisenberg's (1984) theory, strategic ambiguity was beneficial to organizations because it maintained the status quo, prevented disruption, and kept managerial authority intact. However, in higher education environments, maintaining the status quo is tantamount to the exclusion of minoritized groups. Colleges and universities have goals that necessitate change, requiring forthright communication in order to serve goals such as equity or innovation.",

This study demonstrates how important it is to interrogate the racialization of organizational processes in higher education. The ambiguity of tenure evaluation is, on its face, a race neutral aspect of higher education, either a burden or necessity depending on your interpretation but not apparently targeted at any racial group. However, the minoritized faculty who participated in this study spoke very clearly about the way that ambiguity was not race-neutral. By seeming racially neutral while functioning to preserve racial privilege, strategic ambiguity perpetuates and legitimates racially differentiated outcomes. The Black women participants also affirmed the gender-race nuances and how an examination of inextricable social identities is necessary. This study makes a significant contribution to our understanding of a specific organizational behavior in a specific aspect of higher education, but at the same time expands our understanding of a broader pattern of how seemingly race-neutral processes can sustain and legitimate racial inequality.",
