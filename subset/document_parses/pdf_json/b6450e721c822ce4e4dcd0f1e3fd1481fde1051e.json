We further consider a more sophisticated two-category model, where different categories of individuals infect different numbers of people.

Such a strategy cannot prevent the growth of the epidemic by itself since the lockdown is not perfect, thus a significant proportion of people 70 years old or older may still be infected. However, based on our analysis, this can reduce the proportion of infected people 70 years old or older, which decreases the global fatality rate. The overall fatality rate depends not only on the fatality rate by age, but also on the age distribution of the infected population: it is likely that older people are less infected than younger people because they have less contact with others. In one of the two-category examples presented in this article, we get a possible decrease of the fatality rate by a factor of 2 or 3 in this scenario. \u2022 Herd immunity . The current level of herd immunity is expected to play a minor role in the control of the epidemic, because only a small (but not negligible) minority of the population has been infected. Herd immunity requires a large fraction of the population to be infected. Controlling the growth of the epidemic until herd immunity is reached reduces the proportion of infected people, but not necessarily by very much. The usual formulas giving the proportion of infected people as a function of the reproduction rate are overestimated when the population is not homogeneous in terms of contagion. However, the order of magnitude is not dramatically changed. A possible situation where herd immunity could be reached earlier would be the case where a significant part of the population is, from the beginning, not susceptible to infection (for example, if there is cross immunity with other viruses). \u2022 Simulations . At the end of the article, we present some simulations of the epidemic for the coming months, until the summer of 2021, under twelve different scenarios. The simulations give very different results, depending on the values of the parameters chosen. This illustrates the great uncertainty of the current situation, and suggests that there is an important risk of a second peak around the beginning of summer 2020.",

Social distancing restrictions should be widely respected in order to keep the reproduction number at a low level. A minority of the population not respecting the restrictions may significantly increase the reproduction number. When the reproduction number becomes larger than 1, everyone is affected by the growth of the epidemic, even if those with less contagious contacts remain less infected than those with more contacts.",

During the initial lockdown, we assume that its effect on deaths should be small since the probability of sudden death of newly infected individuals is low.

Of course, this is a rough estimate since the total number of infected people is unknown.

Another remark is that the rate of growth of the number of infected people gives \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 , but not \u03b2 and \u03b3 separately. Policies such as lockdown, wearing masks, improving personal hygiene, social distancing, contact tracing, massive testing, vaccines, etc., can decrease the value of \u03b2, while treatments, quarantining infected individuals, etc., can increase the value of \u03b3 . The overall effects of all scientific policies should be seriously considered to improve the collective values of the two parameters. For example, massive testing can help detect the infected cases earlier so infected individuals can be treated earlier (increasing \u03b3 ) and isolated earlier (decreasing \u03b2 as well as increasing \u03b3 ).",

During the week between April 13 and April 19 (one month after the lockdown), there were (according to Wikipedia) 5325 deaths; during the week between May 4, and May 10, (three weeks later, still during the lockdown), there were 1485 deaths in France [1, 4] .

Indeed, R = \u03b2/\u03b3 , whereas the rate of increase is 1 + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 , and \u03b2/ \u03b3 is not uniquely determined by 1 + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 . More concretely, the rate of increase of the epidemic depends not only on the number of new infections per infected individual, but also on the time between generations of infected individuals. That is why the AIDS pandemic has a much slower evolution than most other infectious pandemics, because the average time between generations of infected individuals is some number of months or years, whereas the order of magnitude for the coronavirus is days or weeks. In order to know R , we need not only to have \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 , but also \u03b2 and \u03b3 separately. A way to estimate \u03b3 is to evaluate the average time \u03c4 for which an individual is contagious. Such evaluation is difficult, in particular for asymptomatic infected people. As we have seen before, \u03c4 = 1 /\u03b3 in the model, and so \u03b3 = 1 /\u03c4 . It is reasonable to assume that the duration of the contagion is at least 5 days. In the minimal case where \u03c4 = 5 , we get \u03b3 = 0 . 2 , and in the pre-lockdown situation where we have estimated that \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 = 0 . 3 , we deduce that \u03b2 = 0 . 5 , and then R = \u03b2/\u03b3 = 2 . 5 . On the other hand, under lockdown, we have seen that the new value \u03b2 of the rate of infection is expected to approximately satisfy \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 = \u22120 . 06 , and since \u03b2 \u2265 0, we have \u03b3 \u2265 0.06, which means \u03c4 \u2264 1/0.06, i.e. \u03c4 \u2264 16.7 days. In the case where the average infection time is \u03c4 = 14 days, we have \u03b3 = 1 / 14 0 . 07 , and so \u03b2 0.37, which gives approximately R = 0 . 37 / 0 . 07 5 . 3 .

Similarly, people over 80 years old are 6 percent of the population of the Diamond Princess, but 9 percent of the infected population [3] . Hence, one can estimate that when a person is over 80 years old, his or her probability to be infected is 1.5 times the corresponding probability for the general population.

People with higher probability of being infected, and people with a lot of contacts should be prioritized for testing. In the estimates obtained above, if we assume R = 3 . 3 (recall that R has been estimated to be between 2.5 and 4), we have \u03b2 0.43, \u03b3 0.13 before lockdown, and \u03b2 0.07 after lockdown, which gives R 0.54. A crucial question concerns the value of R after lockdown, in particular, whether it can be maintained below 1 or not. With the values just above, a scenario for maintaining R at 1 might be the following:",

Looking at the coordinates of V + , we see that in the long run, about 79 percent of infected individuals are in category 1, and 21 percent in category 2. Hence, even if people in category 1 are less infected than people in category 2 (79 percent of infections for 85 percent of the population), they are still widely infected, and are impacted by the consequences of the growing epidemic. Notice that in this example, people in category 2 still respect social distancing when they meet people in category 1. We can look at what happens when people in category 2 only partially respect social distancing when they meet people in category 1, say, dividing the contacts by 2 instead of 3.5. In this case, the matrix becomes: In this case, \u03bb + 1 . 236 , R 2.8, i.e. a very quick growth of the epidemic (by 23.6 percent per day), not dramatically different from the situation before selective lockdown. In the long run, about 1.8 percent of infected people are in category 2, instead of 15 percent in the situation before lockdown. In other words, in this model, lockdown of people over 70 is inefficient to globally control the epidemic, but it reduces the portion of older people in the infected population by a factor of 8 to 9. If we refer to the previous estimates of the fatality rates by age, we get that the global fatality rate is reduced by a factor of 2 to 3. Notice that it is likely that people over 70 years old have fewer contacts than people under 70. Then, even without social distancing restrictions, it is natural to expect that they are less infected than younger people. The estimates we have found on the fatality rate by age are not very far from the estimates given in the study by the Institut Pasteur. However, our estimates of the overall fatality rate (0.8 and 1.3 percent) are significantly larger than the estimates of Institut Pasteur (confidence interval between 0.3 and 0.9 percent). This is probably partially due to the fact that our previous estimates do not take into account that older people are likely to be less infected than younger people.",

Moreover, reaching the minimum implies that we control how much each category of the population is infected, which cannot be precisely done in practice. Notice that the numerical examples discussed here are not necessarily very relevant, since they assume that social distancing decisions are applied in the long run, whereas the main interest of herd immunity is that one can release social restrictions.
