Purpose We performed a scoping review to synthesize laboratory values described in the literature and their associations with mortality and disease severity. Methods We identified all primary studies involving laboratory values with clinical outcomes as a primary endpoint by performing data searches in various systematic review databases until 10th August, 2020. Two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts (13,568 articles) and full text (1126 articles) data. A total of 529 studies involving 165,020 patients from 28 different countries were included. Investigation of the number of studies and patients from a geographical perspective showed that the was from Asia, though there was a temporal shift in published studies to Europe and the Americas. For each laboratory value, the proportion of studies that noted a statistically significant (p < 0.05) correlation with adverse clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, disease severity) was tabulated. Results and conclusion Among frequently reported laboratory values, blood urea nitrogen was the most often reported predictor of mortality (91%); neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was the most frequent statistically significant laboratory parameter in predicting disease severity (96%). This review highlights the temporal progression of laboratory value frequencies, as well as potentially distinct utilities of different markers for clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Future research pathways include using this collected data for focused quantitative meta-analyses of particular laboratory values correlated with clinical outcomes of mortality and disease severity.",

Laboratory parameters were categorized by type: hematologic, organ function (renal, hepatic, cardiac), inflammatory, and coagulation. The heatmap colors used were created through graded color scales in Microsoft Excel. Data columns with changes (delta) were assigned color gradation from a scale of -40% to +40% with the midpoint at 0%, capturing the range of the differences, while the remainder of the data columns were assigned color gradation from a scale of 0% An observation emerged in the \"percentage of papers with significant results\" variable: for many of the highfrequency parameters, there was a decline in statistical significance from the earlier to later studies. For example, the most commonly reported laboratory value was lymphocytes, which appeared in 77% of published papers in both the January-March and April-June time ranges; Table 2 Heatmap table of the temporal distribution of frequently encountered laboratory parameters in all regions. Laboratory parameters with at least 20 papers per time range were included BUN blood urea nitrogen, AST aspartate aminotransferase, ALT alanine aminotransferase, CK-MB creatine kinase-MB, CRP c-reactive protein, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6 interleukin-6, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, PT prothrombin time however, the percentage of these papers that found lymphocyte count to be significant (p < 0.05) decreased from 78 to 57%, a decline of 27%. Similarly, among the other six most-studied hematologic parameters, there was a decline in percentage significance over time for leukocytes (\u2212 25%), neutrophils (\u2212 8%), and platelets (\u2212 25%). Among the high-frequency hematologic parameters, only hemoglobin (+ 9%) increased in the percentage significance over time. Unexpectedly, one marker of kidney function, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), exhibited an increase in predictiveness over time from 66 to 86%, while that of creatinine, another marker of kidney function, was stable from 51 to 49%. Table 3 Percentage of statistically significant laboratory values with respect to primary outcomes of mortality and disease severity. Laboratory parameters with at least 20 associated papers with each primary outcome were included N/L Ratio neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, BUN blood urea nitrogen, AST aspartate aminotransferase, ALT alanine aminotransferase, CK-MB creatine kinase-MB, CRP c-reactive protein, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6 interleukin-6, CK creatine kinase, PT prothrombin time, PTT partial thromboplastin time Clinical outcomes of high-frequency laboratory parameters Table 3 presents clinical outcomes (mortality and disease severity) with respect to percentage significance of highfrequency laboratory parameters. Although clinical outcomes such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and disease progression were also investigated, there was an insufficient amount of such papers to present high-frequency laboratory value correlates with those respective clinical outcomes. As seen in Table 3 , there was a wide range in the rate of reported significance in laboratory parameters from both mortality and disease severity. With regards to mortality, percentage significance ranged from 22% (fibrinogen) to 91% (BUN). Quite unexpectedly, BUN and creatinine were the most different in predicting mortality (91% for BUN and 71% for creatinine) versus disease severity (45% for BUN and 31% for creatinine), possibly indicating that impaired renal function significantly contributes to mortality from COVID-19. With regards to disease severity, percentage significance ranged from 22% (hemoglobin) to 96% (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio). Although a majority of high-frequency laboratory values had similar percentage significance rates between both clinical outcomes, 9/25 (36%) of the most-frequently reported laboratory parameters exhibited a greater than 20% difference in percentage significance, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (73-96%), creatinine (71-31%), and BUN (91-45%), with regards to mortality and disease severity, respectively.",

The fact that statistical significance decreased with increasing power poses some interesting implications. One possible explanation is that some characteristics of the patient population, or the treatments they received, differed between the early and late studies. For example, if a patient with leukocytosis was more likely to die in January 2020, but due to improved treatment, a patient in June 2020 with similar leukocytosis survived, that would weaken the correlation between white blood cell count and mortality.",

This geographic shift can be due to a variety of factors, including regional differences in patient characteristics, management strategies, or even study design itself. Table 3 demonstrates that reported laboratory values span a wide range of predictiveness. This is a promising finding, suggesting that there likely exists a subset of laboratory values that, when isolated, has high predictive value for clinical outcomes. High-quality meta-analyses are needed urgently to elucidate such markers. While the question is simple, the immensity of published data and the heterogeneity of study methodology make this a daunting task. Figure 2 shows that in addition to a range of significance, there is also a widespread in frequency of reporting. This allows us to categorize these reported laboratory values into four groups. The laboratory values in the top-right are both well studied and most significant; we believe these represent the best immediate candidates for meta-analyses: such parameters include lymphocyte count (398 papers, 73% significance), d-dimer level (375 papers, 78% significance), prothrombin time (294 papers, 76% significance), and neutrophil count (286 papers, 73% significance). The bottom-right contains laboratory values that are well studied, but less significant; these could represent values that are less likely to yield predictive value. The laboratory values in the top-left are promising, as they represent values that are infrequently reported, but with high significance. These values include several markers such as complement C4 (43 papers, 79% significance, eGFR (44 papers, 82% significance), and T cell count (31 papers, 84% significance), and we believe they warrant further investigation in future studies. Finally, the bottom-left values, which were infrequently reported and less often significant, likely represent niche values measured in relatively specialized studies.",

Of note, with the exception of fibrinogen, the other four values above exhibited decreased significance with respect to disease severity, as compared to mortality. An intriguing hypothesis is that organ-system specific markers are more correlated with mortality than disease severity-BUN and creatinine for renal function, prothrombin time for liver synthetic function, and CK-MB for cardiac function (in addition to troponin I, which showed a 24% decrease in significance from mortality to disease severity). While only conjecture at this point, data in Table 3 warrant further investigation.

In addition, we prioritized mortality over disease severity for categorization of primary outcome; during the course of data extraction, it was apparent that several sources included both outcomes as co-primary foci of investigation. Therefore, the disease severity analysis likely undercounts the number of papers and patients.
