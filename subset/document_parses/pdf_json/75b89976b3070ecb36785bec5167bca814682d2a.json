Individuals in the poorest quintile were 2.16 times (95% confidence interval 1.86; 2.51) more likely to test positive than those in the wealthiest quintile, and those with 12 or more years of schooling had lower prevalence than subjects with less education.

If true, this finding would be in sharp contrast with data from high-income countries, where the pandemic is disproportionally affecting ethnic minorities and poor populations (1) . In the United States (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/ us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html), African-Americans and Latinos are suffering from higher disease incidence and mortality than whites, according to reported cases. A study carried out in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre network observed that black people and those living in the more deprived areas were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (2) . Another study in the United Kingdom (3) reported that non-white ethnicity and higher deprivation scores were strongly associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. In contrast, the large national surveys carried out in Spain did not find either nationality or education as risk factors for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (4).",

The cities included Brasilia, 26 state capitals and the largest cities in each of the country's intermediate regions, as defined by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). In each city, 25 urban census tracts were selected with probability proportionate to size, and 10 households were randomly sampled in each tract. In each sampled household, all residents were listed, and one was randomly selected to be tested. If the selected individual refused to provide a blood sample, a second household member was randomly selected. If this person also refused, the interviewers moved on to the next household to the right of the one that had been originally selected. The next household to the right was also selected in case of absent residents. In the present manuscript, we pooled the data from the three survey waves that took place on May 14-21, June 4-7, and June 21-24, 2020. With 250 individuals per city, the margins of error (approximately two standard errors) for estimating prevalence figures of 2%, 5% and 10% are respectively 1.77, 2.70, and 3.79 percent points, and at national level, with total sample size of 33 250, the corresponding margins of error are 0.15, 0.24 and 0.33.",

The test detects immunoglobulins of both IgG and IgM isotypes specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in a lateral flow assay. The assay reagent consists of colloidal gold particles coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Following the introduction of the blood sample, reactive antibody:antigen:colloidal gold complexes, if present, are captured by antibodies against human IgM and IgG present on the \"test\" (T) line in the kit's window, leading to the appearance of a dark-colored line. Valid tests are identified by a positive control line (C) in the same window. If this control line is not visible, the test is deemed non-conclusive, which is uncommon.",

Due to the presence of widespread multiethnic population, the official Brazilian classification of ethnicity recognizes five groups, based on the question: \"How do you classify yourself in terms of color or race?\" The five response options are \"white\", \"brown\" (\"pardo\" in Portuguese), \"black\", \"yellow (Asian)\" and \"indigenous\". Interviewers were instructed to check the \"yellow\" option when the respondent mentions being of Asian descent, and \"indigenous\" when any of the multiple first nations are mentioned. The \"brown\" category reflects mixed ancestry including European, African and/or indigenous backgrounds. This system is endorsed by the Afro-descendants movement, which advocates for disaggregation of all national statistics to raise their visibility (9) .

But the use of such tests to estimate the seroprevalence is much less controversial, provided the test has been validated (16, 17) . The rapid test used in our study (Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 antibody test) underwent different validation studies using RT-PCR as the gold standard, including one carried out by our own team. These studies estimated the test's sensitivity and specificity at 84.8% and 99.0%, respectively. It has been suggested that using capillary blood to estimate seroprevalence tends to increase the rate of false negative results (18) ; however, this finding has not been replicated by other studies (19) . Furthermore, our validation study (8) used capillary blood and the observed sensitivity was similar to that reported in another studies. Therefore, this should not be considered as a main study limitation as all population subgroups should be affected. Recent evidence suggests that antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 fall rapidly over a few weeks, regardless of the type of test used (20) ; therefore, our results correspond to relatively recent infections rather than cumulative prevalence. Again, all population subgroups are likely to be similarly affected.",
