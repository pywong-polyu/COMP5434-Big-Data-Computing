To address this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends healthcare facilities employ universal screening for COVID-19 symptoms, universal masking, and consideration of targeted asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 testing. (6) Our institution implemented universal masking on March 24, 2020 and on April 6, 2020, began universal SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of all patients on admission, utilizing an electronic medical record (EMR) based clinical decision support tool (CDST) to ensure appropriate definition and cohorting of Patients Under Investigation (PUI).

If a patient was documented A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t to have no COVID-19 symptoms, and no clinical concern prompting testing, the screening's embedded algorithm designated the patient as non-PUI.

This was early in masking protocols and prior to community mask mandates, thus the reasons for lapse in PPE were numerous, but our findings suggest increased attention to appropriate PPE use when a patient is known or suspected to have COVID-19 significantly decreases exposures. Recent CDC guidance includes the importance of face-shields and further study is warranted to see if a similar effect would be seen using this updated definition of HRE. Our findings that universal testing further decreased exposures related to aerosolizing procedures is expected but further emphasizes the importance of testing prior to higher risk interactions.",

We chose an end-point of exposures rather than HCW testing positive to increase our number of events and due to the presence of community spread. Although using exposures did increase our total events we still have relatively few exposures documented over our intervention time periods. Though a more appropriate measure for our exposure rate denominators would be the number of days an employee worked or the number of patients the employee contacted, we did not have access to these data. Our use of patient days is the next best measure for time at risk for the hospital's faculty and staff, and it additionally accounts for fewer risk of exposures due to the decreased patient volumes from our institution's COVID-19 response.",
