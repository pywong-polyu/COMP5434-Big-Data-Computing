Finally, we found that approximately half of the participants who self-reported positive previous COVID-19 tests showed new positivity for RT-PCR, in addition to high seroprevalence rates for IgM and, especially, IgG. Considering the time between the two evaluations, it is possible that the majority were cases of reinfection. The agreement of these data can be observed through the statistically significant association between the previous positive tests report and the detection of IgG, with OR = 4.9, also corroborating the immune response against exposure to SARS-CoV-2 reported in literature [17, 18] . Similarly, other studies have reported cases of reinfection in essential service workers such as health professionals [19, 20] .
