However, the drawbacks of online teaching (e.g., students' inadequate autonomous learning, the lack of effective online instruction) forced us to modify teaching strategies during this special period, especially developing courses that are suitable for student learning at home and improving their key competencies. In order to solve these problems, this study introduces some theoretical exploration and practical work of curriculum design under the guidance of thinking-based instruction theory (TBIT) during the pandemic. We firstly introduce TBIT, and elaborate on the curriculum design under the TBIT theoretical frame. Then we describe a series of TBIT-based micro-courses with the pandemic as background. A descriptive study is reported to illustrate the effects of three micro-courses. Results showed that, compared to national curricula, the TBIT-based micro-courses not only improved the course quality but also enhanced students' motivation and facilitated their online learning behavior (such as interactive communication) for the online courses. The current study has important implications for how to design effective and interesting online courses suitable under pandemic and capable of improving students' thinking abilities and key competencies.",

For examples, students who engage in autonomous learning at home may experience a lack of motivation (Martin and Bolliger, 2018; Li et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2020) and a lack of adequate planning, monitoring, and reflection (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015; Durksen et al., 2016; Wong, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . In regards to teaching, teachers may lack proper theoretical guidance in online teaching (especially a lack of guidance for cultivating key competencies in online classes; Hu, 2017) , or may experience the lack of sufficient interactive communication between teachers and students (de Oliveira et al., 2018; Alshamrani, 2019; Srivastava, 2019; Bao, 2020) .",

            "text": "Under the circumstances, recent curriculum reform and many policy documents might give us directions to guide the curriculum innovation during COVID-19. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) emphasizes the important role of key competencies in student development (OECD, 2018 (OECD, , 2019 , and the OECD Education 2030 project suggests that \"creating new value\" and \"reconciling tensions and dilemmas\" are two important categories of competencies for future-ready students (OECD, 2018) . Creating new value mainly refers to cultivating the creative thinking, while reconciling tensions and dilemmas refers to the ability to apply knowledge of both broad and specialized kinds, to meet complex demands beyond just acquisition of knowledge; it requires students to master a wide range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge and think and act in a more integrated way to solve problems. In this case, the popular \"Maker\" movement and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education have made great strides (Bevan et al., 2015; Mart\u00edn-P\u00e1ez et al., 2019) . Meanwhile, two other promising strategies are important in curricular innovation-using \"big ideas\" to define key concepts and applying \"learning progression (LP).\" \"Big ideas\" was proposed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Project 2061 (AAAS, 2005) . The integrated course content around big ideas contributes to establishing a systematic knowledge structure in students' minds (Lelliott and Rollnick, 2009; Duncan and Rivet, 2013; Plummer et al., 2015) . LP means that the teaching of a concept should be carried out in sequence due to the gradual and even complex nature of building mental apparatus (Hu, 2019) . These two strategies have been emphasized in a new round of science curriculum reform in China since 2017 (Yao and Guo, 2018) . Curriculum innovations are made in various countries along the same line to varying degrees (Chugh et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2017; Cunningham et al., 2019; Brown and Livstrom, 2020; Lemay and Moreau, 2020) .",

(2011) developed the thinking-based introduction theory (TBIT) in the aim of cultivating students' thinking abilities through instructional activities. The most prominent feature of TBIT is that it proposes that thinking activity plays a key role in the learning process. It holds that focusing teaching efforts on the cultivation of thinking ability can promote the development of students and the cultivation of thinking ability could serve as the starting point of the cultivation of any subject or interdisciplinary content. Meanwhile, this theory proposes five principles and six instructional steps to guide the courses design and instructional activities (Lin and Hu, 2010; Hu et al., 2011; Hu, 2015) .",

On the other hand, TBIT provides a prescribed, detailed sequence of activities to cultivate active thinking. Specifically, TBIT specifies what teachers should do to achieve the goal of improving students' thinking ability. Hu proposes five teaching principles and six basic instructional steps when designing and implementing courses (Hu and Wei, 2010; Lin and Hu, 2010) . These principles and instructional steps are based on years of teaching experience and involve sequenced activities and curriculum procedures. The five principles are (1) stimulating interest and motivation; (2) cognitive conflict; (3) knowledge-construction; (4) self-regulation and metacognition; (5) application and transfer.

However, curricula in China usually place a premium on knowledge and skills, which is deemed insufficient to support the well-rounded development of students (Cui, 2016; Hu, 2016) . To face this issue, the Chinese government has proposed six basic qualities of key competency-humanistic background, scientific spirit, learning, healthy life, responsibility, and practice and innovation, that students should be cultivated in school (Lin, 2016a,b) .

How do we stimulate students' interest? According to TBIT (Hu et al., 2011) , teachers should choose materials that are appropriate and based on students' prior knowledge, experience, and interests for their ages. Therefore, the first principle of the five teaching principles in TBIT is \"stimulating interest and motivation, \" which means to use content that students are familiar with to set the situations, so as to attract students' interest and improve their motivation. For example, most of the courses in this study we designed have chosen content related to pandemic to attract students, which is familiar to students in this special period and can capture their attention more easily. Additionally, regarding the course content, due to the abilities are domain-related, the course contents we chose were also diversified, which cover almost all the domains, such as Chinese, math, English, science, arts, health, society, and life skills.

Notably, the integrated course content around big ideas contributes to establishing a systematic knowledge structure in students' minds (Duncan and Rivet, 2013) . Furthermore, teachers should design interdisciplinary contents or activities, which are more attractive to students and conducive to their flexible thinking. Meanwhile, it could facilitate their abilities to relate various information to the semantic networks in their mind, which could, in turn, enrich their knowledge network. Also, this interdisciplinary design can facilitate students' abilities of creativity and transfer, as highly creative people are found to have a more interactive, flexible, and clustered semantic network compared to less creative people (Kenett et al., 2014; Benedek et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021) .",

Therefore, every course in our curriculum should focus on cultivating students' multiple key competencies. Meanwhile, we set up some teaching steps to activate students to active thinking so as to enhance the flexibility, creativity, criticalness, agility, and depth of their thinking, and eventually help them build the corresponding key competencies through knowledge building and thinking training. For example, the \"cognitive conflict\" and \"summarize and reflection\" steps based on TBIT in our courses aim at provoking students' deep thinking about the problems they have encountered in a course; later in the course, their metacognitive skills could be improved through the summary and reflection phase.",

Vygotsky (1978) proposed that teaching should help students reach the zone of proximal development in each phase (Vygotsky, 1978) . Therefore, we need the \"learning progressions (LP)\" design, which means the development of student thinking is coherent and gradual (Hu, 2019) . When they study or research a certain concept or topic, their ways of thinking are carried out in sequence. Essentially, learning progression is the in-depth and continuous understanding of core concepts (Alonzo and Steedle, 2009 ). This kind of design can let teachers help students reach the zone of proximal development in each phase (Vygotsky, 1978) , thus achieving effective teaching. At the same time, the development of students' understanding of core concepts through progressive learning will help students form a solid knowledge structure, understand scientific concepts in-depth, and improve their ability to solve problems. This LP design also has become the core of science curriculum reform in contemporary basic education (Duncan and Rivet, 2013) and has been verified effective in various subjects, such as physics (Herrmann-Abell and DeBoer, 2018) and astronomy (Plummer et al., 2015) . Therefore, in our courses, we designed content at suitable difficulty levels for students in different grades, and appropriate for their ages and cognitive developmental characteristics.",

Cognitive conflict is used to describe a situation that students feel confused or puzzled, especially when that is inconsistent with their previous experience or understanding (Kang et al., 2004) . Rooted in Piaget's notion of disequilibrium, which drives cognitive effort to resolve discrepancies, cognitive conflict was found helpful in improving students' motivation and arousing their curiosity about the course contents (Kang et al., 2010; Bao et al., 2014) . (3) Knowledge construction. Knowledge construction includes cognitive construction and social construction. Cognitive construction is a process in which learners actively construct their internal mental representations, which are realized through the interaction of old and new experiences (Evans, 1973) . Social construction is based on Vygotsky's viewpoint that social interaction is central to children's cognitive development (Vygotsky, 1978) . Social construction here involves teacher-student interactions and student-student interactions. Teachers should design courses with discussion sessions, in which students could argue and share their views with other students. In this process, knowledge is socially constructed, and specific ways of thinking are mutually reinforced. As previous research found, compared to traditional instruction, courses that involve collaborative experimentation and interactions, or storytelling, hands-on experiments, and drama, could improve preschoolers' thinking ability (Kakana et al., 2009) . Also, cooperative learning and peerlearning partnership could increase students' motivation (Eisenkopf, 2010) . (4) Metacognition and self-regulation. Metacognition and selfregulation are the basis of all of these thinking methods. Metacognition is the awareness and control of one's thinking processes (Brown, 1987; Jang et al., 2020) . Selfregulation refers to learners' drive by the motivation or use strategies to initiate and sustain focused goal-directed activities while ignoring distractions or setbacks (Schunk et al., 2014) . A good course should guide students to improve their meta-cognitive ability to find what strategies they have used when solving problems, and teachers should help students learn to monitor their thinking, internalize the monitoring process, and make the monitoring process as part of their habitual mode of thinking . (5) Application and transfer. Given that the instructional process is based on the specific course contents or activities, we would like to develop students' ability to draw inferences from one instance or apply what they have learned from courses to the problems in real life. Thus, a good course should involve the application and transfer component, which could not only facilitate students' transfer ability but also help students gain self-efficacy when they make a successful transfer, which in turn improves their motivation to apply what they have learned in other subjects (Iswahyudi et al., 2019) .",

Does it grow?\" (3) Independent inquiry. This step is based on the principle \"knowledge construction\". This step could help students get involved in the cognitive construction process, and improve the quality of the discussion. This process encourages students to relate their previous knowledge and experiences with the new questions, and thus gain new insights into the new situation (Baanqud et al., 2020) . The previous study found that a group can think more creatively if individual members think independently before group discussion (Chen et al., 2021) . (4) Cooperation and communication. This step is also based on the principle \"knowledge construction\" and it belongs to social construction. Teachers should set up discussion sessions to facilitate social construction. For example, during the pandemic, teachers encourage students to share the questions that they have in mind about the virus or the methods to protect themselves from the virus on the online chat platform. (5) Summary and reflection. This step is based on the principle \"self-regulation and metacognition\". Here, teachers should guide students to reflect on and summarize the thinking methods, thinking strategies, problem-finding, problem-solving methods, and what they have learned from the activities. (6) Application and transfer. This step is based on the principle \"application and transfer\".

In the context of the pandemic, the school, based on TBIT, infiltrated a variety of thinking methods, integrated interdisciplinary contents related to the pandemic in various teaching activities, and independently developed a set of \"Home + X\" courses that integrate fun, depth, and implications. This course aims to develop students' cognitive understanding, inquiry skills, thinking, and other comprehensive abilities during the pandemic period, as part of the cultivation of students' key competencies. The specific meaning of \"Home + X\" is as follows. \"Home\" means a package that includes multi-faceted integration of contents, such as multi-disciplinary integration, multi-activity interconnection, multiple participants, and multi-dimensional goals and evaluations. \"+\" expresses the series under the big themes, such as the \"thinking challenge\" series to develop thinking skills, the \"interactive time\" series to build a display platform, the \"sharing and evaluation\" series to encourage creative comments, and the \"anti-pandemic methods\" series focusing on life education. \"X\" represents the small activities under the big themes. For example, all subjects and classes can carry out specific activities (involve characteristics of school and class) under the guiding principle of multiple integrations. In short, the \"Home + X\" course is presented in the form of a diversified integration of major themes with a series of small activities, to help students to relieve panic and anxiety in enjoyable activities, and turn the period of passive absorption at home into an opportunity for proactive learning and growth.",

Secondly, \"Five principles\" refers to the basic tenets of instructional design or the five basic principles of thinking-based teaching: stimulating interest and motivation, cognitive conflict, knowledge-construction, metacognition, and application transfer. Based on these five basic principles, this courses put forward five concepts of instructional design: (1) Orderly (clear classroom steps and leading the rhythm of thinking); (2) Interesting (set thinking points and stimulate students' desire for knowledge); (3) Effective (focus on problem teaching and strengthen thinking training); (4) Emotional (enhancing teacher-student interaction and improving thinking quality); (5) Useful (extending the thinking path and linking reality themes). Thirdly, \"Five steps\" adapted from the six teaching steps of teaching design, which were adapted from the six basic teaching steps advocated by TBIT (create situations, questioning, independent inquiry, cooperation and communication, summary and reflection, and application and transfer). The specific meaning of \"five steps\" are (1) Situation creation and inspiring thinking; (2) Exploring independently, and thinking quietly; (3) Teacher-student cooperation, dialectical thinking; (4) Practice implementation, feedback, and thinking; (5) Returning to life scenes (situations) and expanding thinking. Meanwhile, the teachers expanded the meaning of these five steps in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.",

The course for junior students put increased emphasis on arousing students' curiosity in science and stimulating children's interest through scientific experiments and short videos. In scientific experiments, we focus on cultivating children's observation and hands-on practical abilities, and guiding children to think about problems in a scientific way. The course in middle grades aims to arouse students' interest in hands-on activities through science games, small experiments, and short videos. Starting from simple scientific experiments, it helps students establish a scientific way of thinking that uses data to verify conjectures, gradually improves students' experimental operation skills, and establishes conceptual foundations for scientific experiments. In the upper grades, students are encouraged to design experiments by themselves and learn to explain the results of the experiments using experimental logic. This stage focuses on cultivating students' ability to collect and organize evidence independently as well as critically examine and learn from the collected data, and eventually draw scientific conclusions.",

As for teaching objectives, every course is focused on cultivating students' key competencies (e.g., humanistic background, scientific spirit, learning, healthy life, responsibility, and practice and innovation). Regarding teaching content, we focus on improving students' motivation and capturing their interests, and then we designed lots of diversified, highly conceptual, interdisciplinary, and integrated contents and activities to facilitate the development of students' thinking (e.g., flexible, critical, creative, agile, and deep thinking) and abilities (e.g., the ability of autonomous learning, independence, cooperation and communication, and follow current events, etc.). Meanwhile, according to the \"learning progressions\" principle (Alonzo and Steedle, 2009; Jin et al., 2019) , we provided content with different difficulty levels to students in different grades to reach their zones of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978) . Regarding teaching implementation, according to the five-course design principles of TBIT (Hu et al., 2011) , we set six main steps to make the class more attractive and more focused on students' thinking and key competencies. For example, we used the information familiar to students to lead-in the course, and then set the cognitive conflict to provoking their deep thinking. Besides, we used inquirybased teaching methods to improve multiple abilities of students, such as hand-on, independence, and interactive communication abilities, and so on. Late in the course, we usually let students summarize and reflect what they have learned in that class and try to transfer that knowledge to other situations they can be used, so as to transfer the knowledge they have learned to the abilities they have mastered and the competencies they have been cultivated. Thus, the detailed instruction leads to effective results.",

These results reflected that students are more desired to take the course designed based on TBIT, which is consistent with the result found by Hu et al. (2016) . These positive results may benefit from the design of the TBIT-based micro-courses. In this course, according to the course design principles of TBIT, in the first teaching step, teachers usually use lots of interesting information, which is closely related to the topic they plan to teach (e.g., teaching contents related to the pandemic in this study), to \"lead-in\" the real theme of the course (Hu et al., 2011) . Meanwhile, most of the course contents are interdisciplinary. This kind of method could arouse students' curiosity about the course, attract their attention, and engage in the course, therefore improving students' motivation about the course . Notably, motivation has been consistently found to be positively related to self-control (Schmeichel et al., 2010; Vohs et al., 2012) , and people who have high motivation have high autonomy and perform better in massive open online courses (MOOCs) (Durksen et al., 2016) . Thus, the improvement of motivation indirectly helps solve the main problem caused by studying at home-lacking autonomous learning ability on the study (Durksen et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .

            "text": "There are still few limitations that need to be mentioned. Firstly, since the design of this study is not a very rigorous randomized grouping design, it might have little influence on the generalization of the results. In this study, due to the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19, we had to collect the data after the TBIT-based micro-courses have been applied. Meanwhile, since the national curricula consist of courses that students must take, TBIT micro-courses was introduced as an added-on component, rather than implemented in lieu of the traditional one. So, it was not possible, with the unexpected COVID-19 in China, for us to conduct rigorous design-based research with up and close followup observations every step of the way. Thus, the main aim of this study was to assess how well TBIT was received as compared to the traditional curriculum, with regard to developing students' key competencies. In this sense, our study was meant to be a step of generating evidence for the effectiveness of TBIT, rather than a full-blown design-based study. Secondly, there might be the possibility of a Hawthorne effect in favor of TBIT. This concern was alleviated to some degree due to the following procedures. First, we didn't introduce the TBIT-based micro-courses in a way that would bias the students in favor of this approach. Alternating between TBIT and the traditional curriculum was made seamlessly. Second, we randomly chose the classes to assess either TBIT or the traditional curriculum; this would \"dilute\" the possible systematic effect of making TBIT more distinct to students than the traditional counterpart. And finally, we didn't ask students to compare their feelings about the two approaches but only asked them to report their feelings on one of them. This strategy also helped avoid the Hawthorne effect; that is, seeing one favored over the other. Another limitation is that some hypothesized advantages of TBIT are not substantiated. For example, only part of the dimensions in the questionnaires CEQ and OLBQ are improved, this might due to the time they took the experiment class was too short. It might have effects on a more wide range and the effects of the courses would be prolonger after long-time teaching. As our previous studies found that when received the courses \"Learn to think, \" which was designed under the guidance of TBIT, students' abstract and concrete thinking abilities were all improved after 1 year for students in grade 1 and 2, and 6 months for grade-3-students (Hu et al., 2011) . Additionally, using the same course, after a 2 years intervention, students' scientific creativity was still increased 1 year after (Hu et al., 2013) . Furthermore, after a 4 years intervention, students' deep motivation was still increased 1 year after .",
