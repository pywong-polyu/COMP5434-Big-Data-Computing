Methods Participants were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo or BoNTA with follow-up (office visit, telephone, or e-mail) at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks to assess the magnitude of pain relief post injection. Crossover of participants was then performed. Those who received placebo received BoNTA, and vice versa, with follow-up at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results Eight participants completed at least one of the two crossover study arms. Four completed both arms. The median age of the eight participants was 45 years (range 32-61 years) and 75% were male. All had traumatic, T1-L3 level, complete SCI. Although our data did not meet statistical significance, we noted a higher proportion of participants reporting a marked change in average pain intensity from baseline to 8 and 12 weeks post-BoNTA vs. post-placebo (33% vs. 0%). At 2 and 4 weeks post-BoNTA, almost all participants reported some degree of reduced pain, while the same was not seen postplacebo (83% vs. 0%). Conclusion The subcutaneous injection of BoNTA may be a feasible approach for the control of at-level SCI pain and is worthy of further study. Sponsorship The onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX) used in this study was provided by Allergan (Irvine, CA).",

It acts at the neuromuscular junction and its onset of action occurs within 24-72 h after administration, with peak clinical effect occurring 4-6 weeks after administration, then 2-6 months of effect duration [6] . At the level of peripheral nerves, BoNTA may inhibit the synaptic release of local neuropeptides associated with pain transmission, such as glutamate, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide [7] . At the level of the central nervous system, retrograde effects of BoNTA on the spinal cord via axonal transport have been proposed [8, 9] . BoNTA therapy has so far been shown to have some effectiveness in treating various peripherally mediated neuropathic pains, but the literature on BoNTA remains limited for treating centrally mediated pain [10] . To date, one randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study has successfully been able to demonstrate that subcutaneous BoNTA may reduce neuropathic pain in persons with SCI. This study by Han et al. evaluated patients with neuropathic pain associated with SCI, both at-level (n = 9) and below-level (n = 29), and found participants demonstrated significantly reduced pain at 4 and 8 weeks after BoNTA injections compared with after placebo with saline. They also showed a marginal trend towards improvements on the physical health domain of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF abbreviated form) at 4 weeks post-BoNTA vs. post-placebo [7] .",

Other local side effects include temporary injection associated pain, edema, erythema, ecchymosis, headache, and short-term hyperesthesia. Systemic side effects include nausea, fatigue, malaise, rash, and flu-like symptoms [12] . In summary, a significant percentage of persons with SCI report at-level SCI pain but there is a lack of effective treatment to date, and BoNTA has shown preliminary evidence of effectiveness for neuropathic pain after SCI in one clinical trial while having a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

Syringes were prefilled by an unblinded physician and research assistant in a separate location from where injections and assessments occurred. The physician administering the injection was blinded to syringe contents. The randomized treatment allocation for each patient was kept in a sealed envelope by another research assistant, separate from those preparing and administering injections. The area was sterilized with alcohol then localized topical anesthesia was provided with sterile ethyl chloride. Each injection was given using a 25gauge needle and administrators were allowed to provide up to 80 injections of 5 units each for a total maximum delivery of 400 units, per participant, per phase injection session. This maximum dose and injection number was determined based on the study team's review of the BoNTA manufacturer recommendations and the BoNTA literature to date at the time of protocol formation [16] [17] [18] .",

Participants were asked to rate their average pain using the 0-10 NPRS from 0 (\"no pain\") to 10 (\"worst pain imaginable\"). Secondary outcome measures included other ISCIPBDS items, such as the degree to which pain interfered with: (1) day to day activities, (2) mood, and (3) sleep, all on scales from 0 (\"no interference\") to 10 (\"extreme interference\"). We defined \"marked improvement\" as a \u22653-point difference based on the minimal clinical important difference (MCID) for the NPRS being \u22653 points [22] . At each follow-up time point, participants were asked to quantify the change in quality of life (QOL) appreciated after injections on a 7-point scale based on the Patient Global Impression of Change scale [19] .

            "text": "The largest limitation to our study was our failure to meet target sample size due to low recruitment and retention rates. BoNTA injections were offered for free but the time, planning, and costs required of participants to coordinate injection visits were inadequately accounted for. Coordinating follow-ups also proved to be difficult once participants received injections, possibly because patients lost incentives to continue participating. These issues could be better addressed with more resources for both improved recruitment and retention in the future. Based on our findings, we encourage the field to continue considering BoNTA as a potential option for treating at-level SCI pain. We further hope that sharing our limitations may facilitate additional investigations into this treatment method throughout the field.",
