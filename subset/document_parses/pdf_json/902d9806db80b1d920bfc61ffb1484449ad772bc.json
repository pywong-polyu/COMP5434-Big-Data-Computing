Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is especially critical to protect vulnerable populations who require frequent interactions with caretakers. Rapid COVID-19 tests have been proposed as an attractive strategy for surveillance, however a limitation of most rapid tests is their low sensitivity. Low-sensitivity tests are comparable to high sensitivity tests in detecting early infections when two assumptions are met: (1) viral load rises quickly (within hours) after infection and (2) viral load reaches and sustains high levels (>10 5 -10 6 RNA copies/mL). However, there are no human data testing these assumptions. In this study, we document a case of presymptomatic household transmission from a healthy young adult to a sibling and a parent. Participants prospectively provided twice-daily saliva samples. Samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR and we measured the complete viral load profiles throughout the course of infection of the sibling and parent. This study provides evidence that in at least some human cases of SARS-CoV-2, viral load rises slowly (over days, not hours) and not to such high levels to be detectable reliably by any low-sensitivity test. Additional viral load profiles from different samples types across a broad demographic must be obtained to describe the early phase of infection and determine which testing strategies will be most effective for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection before transmission can occur.",

            "text": "As of early December 2020, nearly one year after the first COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, there have been more than 65 million cases and 1.5 million deaths globally. 1 Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings often occurs before symptom onset, 2,3 putting at great risk people who require frequent interactions with caregivers, such as residents of nursing homes. Better strategies for using the available COVID-19 diagnostic tests are critically needed to decrease overall transmission, thereby reducing transmission to these vulnerable populations. 4 Transmission from asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals is considered the Achilles' Heel of COVID-19 infection control. 3 In a recent epidemiologic investigation of 183 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wanzhou, China, about 76% of transmissions occurred from individuals without symptoms (either asymptomatic or presymptomatic). 5 Numerous transmission events originating from individuals without symptoms have been documented in a variety of locations, such as dinner parties, 6 skilled nursing facilities, 2,7 correctional facilities, 8 sporting events, 9, 10 religious ceremonies, 6 and spring break trips. 11 The importance of effective testing strategies to quell transmission from individuals without symptoms is underscored by an outbreak at an overnight camp in Wisconsin 12 where a 9 th grade student developed symptoms the day after arrival, prompting quarantine of 11 close contacts. All 11 contacts were asymptomatic and released from quarantine after receiving negative rapid antigen test results. However, 6 of the 11 went on to develop symptoms, and an outbreak ensued, with more than 100 additional individuals (a total of 3/4 of camp attendees) infected. In contrast, a more successful containment of an outbreak was documented in a skilled nursing facility in Los Angeles, where serial surveillance PCR testing was initiated immediately after three residents became symptomatic and tested positive. 13 PCR results prompted isolation of 14 infected individuals without symptoms, which limited the outbreak to a total of only 19 out of 99 residents over the course of two weeks. These cases demonstrate the value of testing strategies that can detect and isolate infected individuals in the early phase in the infection, reducing the potential for transmission to others during the elicitation window (the period when a person is infectious but not isolating). 14 More than 200 in vitro diagnostics have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for identification of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. 15 These tests have a wide range of sensitivities. The most sensitive tests, with limits of detection (LOD) of 10 2 -10 3 RNA copies/mL, include the RT-qPCR assays. These tests typically involve more intensive sample-preparation methods to extract and purify RNA and most are run in centralized laboratories (with a few exceptions of point-of-care tests that integrate rigorous sample preparation and RNA detection 15, 16 ). At the other extreme are the lowsensitivity tests (LODs of ~10 5 -10 7 RNA copies/mL), such as antigen tests or molecular tests that do not perform rigorous sample preparation. These tests offer tangible advantages, such as being fast (rapid antigen tests yield results in minutes), less expensive to manufacture, and can be deployable outside of laboratories.",

The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized such tests for use in symptomatic populations. Data in several reports suggest that such tests may miss presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals early in the infection. 12, 17 However, logical arguments have also been made, 18, 19 in favor of widely deploying surveillance tests with \"analytic sensitivities vastly inferior to those of benchmark tests.\" 18 Low-sensitivity tests will be equally effective to high-sensitivity tests at minimizing transmission if the following two assumptions about the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection hold true: (i) viral load increases rapidly, by orders of magnitude within hours, and (ii) viral load reaches and sustains high levels during the infectious window, such that a rapid low-sensitivity test would have a similar ability to detect early-phase infections compared with high-sensitivity tests. These two assumptions have not been tested in humans. Viral load at the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a knowledge gap necessary to inform the use of testing resources to effectively minimize transmission. To fill this knowledge gap, and inform selection of diagnostic tests appropriate for identifying infections in the earliest phases, requires studies that monitor SARS-CoV-2 viral load with high temporal resolution (beginning at the incidence of infection) and in a large, diverse cohort of individuals.",

(i) Presymptomatic viral loads in some humans can rise over the course of days not hours, which is slower than expected. 18, 22 This slow rise increases the utility of sensitive tests (such as PCR) to enable earlier detection and isolation of infected individuals before their viral load increases to a presumably more infectious level. Sibling-2's viral load rose slowly-within PCR detection range-for 3 days until viral load reached the limit of detection (LOD) for rapid tests. This slow rise also makes it more dangerous to assume that most persons with low viral load will not become infectious 19 and therefore do not need to self-isolate: Sibling-2 produced 6 positive samples in the 10 3 -10 5 copies/mL range presymptomatically before peaking at ~10 7 copies/mL. (ii) Peak viral load does not always rise above the LOD of rapid, low-sensitivity tests, as expected. 18, 22 Of 88 positive SARS-CoV-2 samples, only one sample was well above the LOD range of rapid tests. Furthermore, in Sibling-1, the logical source of the two infections, neither the CLIA-lab test nor our testing detected viral loads above 10 7 copies/mL during the presumed period of household transmission. (iii) The LOD of a test can affect how early in infection we can diagnose an infected person, and how consistently we can detect early-phase infections. Of the 52 positive samples from the first 10 days of the study, 33 were near or above the LOD of the more sensitive rapid test (ID NOW, as determined by the FDA) whereas only 3 were near or above the least sensitive LOD of 9.3*10 6 copies/mL (Table S2) .

            "text": "The insights from this study are also supported by analysis of data by Kissler et al., 21 reporting longitudinal (but less frequent) testing of anterior nares and oropharyngeal swabs from individuals associated with the National Basketball Association ( Figure S1 ). In Kissler et al. 21 , viral loads rose slowly (for up to 5 days in some individuals) between the first PCR positive test to the LOD of rapid tests. Few of these samples ever reached viral loads well above the LODs of most rapid antigen tests (Table S2) . Low-sensitivity tests have a role in the COVID-19 testing strategies, but our limited data from this study and data from Kissler et al. 21 demonstrate clearly that for at least some individuals, low-sensitivity tests will likely be unable to reliably diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection during the early phase of infection. Our limited data are consistent with the use of low-sensitivity tests for point-of-care confirmation of suspected COVID-19 in symptomatic individuals, as authorized by the FDA, but not for universal surveillance testing of asymptomatic individuals, as has been proposed. 18, 19, 22 Additional studies are urgently needed to address several limitations of this work. High-frequency viral load measurements from the incidence of infection must be observed in a larger, diverse pool of participants to infer the distribution of viral load profiles in human SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both saliva and nasal swabs have been proposed as sample types for rapid, low-sensitivity tests; however, the LOD of these tests is better defined in nasal swabs. Our study only analyzed saliva; although saliva has been demonstrated to be a more sensitive sample type than nasopharyngeal swab by some studies, 23 other studies have arrived at the opposite conclusion. 24, 25 The details of saliva collection, sample stabilization, preanalytical handling, sample-preparation protocols, and timing of sampling may play a role in the apparent sensitivity measured in different sample types. No previous study has directly compared saliva with other sample types during the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Quantitative comparisons of multiple respiratory sample types (including nasal, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal swabs) at the same time points are needed to clarify viral load profiles in different respiratory specimen types. Lastly, to understand the relationship between viral load and infectiousness, direct comparisons of RNA viral load to culturable virus titer across the entire course of infection are needed. Data to address these limitations are needed to inform optimal testing strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",

For example, several states require recent negative test results for out-of-state visitors prior to arrival. Although some states acknowledge the risk of false negative results by low-sensitivity tests and require PCR confirmation, 19, 26 others do not specify the type of negative test result required for arrival. 27 If rapid low-sensitivity tests are used, they would risk missing presymptomatic individuals before they rise to their highest (and presumably most infectious) viral load. Such false negative tests have the potential to create a costly false sense of security; individuals who may have been recently exposed and receive a negative result from a low-sensitivity test may be more likely-compared to individuals who did not get a test-to come into contact with other members of the community, including the most vulnerable populations.",
