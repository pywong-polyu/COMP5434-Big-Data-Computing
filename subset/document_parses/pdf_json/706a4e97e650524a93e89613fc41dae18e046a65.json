It is probable that the haters of AI fear a disruption to the working lives of radiologists, or even worsea complete replacement of radiologists by machines.",

At the last Pediatric Radiology editors' meeting, held in Helsinki during the European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) 2019 conference, (I know, I knowso long ago, and the reality of COVID-19 and how it has changed our world is even now still being computed by us all), Dr. \u00d8ystein Olsen asked for ideas for future special issues of our journal. I suggested artificial intelligence, not because I'm an expert in the area, but precisely because I realized my understanding of AI in general, and particularly as it relates to pediatric radiology, was somewhat limited. Serendipitously, Dr. Safwan Halabi had floated the idea of a special issue on imaging informatics and artificial intelligence to Dr. Peter Strouse soon after Larson and colleagues [3] were awarded the Caffey for Best Basic Science Research Paper, titled \"Performance of a deep neural network learning model in assessing skeletal maturity on pediatric hand radiographs,\" at the Society for Pediatric Radiology's annual meeting in 2017.",

We were fortunate that many of the leading authorities and researchers in the realm of deep learning and artificial intelligence in medical imaging identify as pediatric radiologists and have contributed to the pediatric radiology \"augmented intelligence\" armamentarium. Not only do these domain experts represent a large swath of pediatric imaging subspecialties, but they also represent multiple continents and their respective, diverse patient populations and health care settings.",
