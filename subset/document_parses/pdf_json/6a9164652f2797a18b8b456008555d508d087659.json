However, especially in the workplace, a general lack of control groups or follow-ups limits the interpretation of the conclusions (22, 23) . This mixed pattern of results and the urgent need for effective solutions call for further development of the psychological understanding and treatment of general and work-related (chronic) stress, at least from an applied clinical perspective. Following this line of research, a first tentative of studying the possible effects of work-focused therapy using a metacognitive intervention has been carried out showing promising results (24) . Therefore, we tested the hypothesis of whether it would be possible to treat work-related stress specifically, with a Metacognitive Therapy-based intervention.",

MCT is based on the Self-Regulatory Executive Function model [S-REF; (28) ], focusing mainly on processes that result in pathological and persistent thinking. This is indeed the main characteristic of emotional suffering (29): according to the model, all psychological disorders are associated with a Cognitive Attentional Syndrome (CAS) consisting of mental processes (like worry, rumination, threat monitoring, and other dysfunctional coping strategies) that backfire and maintain psychological symptoms and all forms of emotional dysfunctions and disorders (28) . The CAS is caused by negative metacognitive beliefs, such as uncontrollability (e.g., \"my worry is uncontrollable\") and danger beliefs (e.g., \"my worry can physically harm my body\"), and positive metacognitive beliefs (e.g., \"worry helps me to cope\").",

However, very few studies have explored this hypothesis applied to stress (24, 38) , and further research should be carried out to develop a metacognitive model for stress and to test the effects of MCT on stress-related disorders.

Treatment begun if the baseline was stable, which was defined by results not having dropped more than two data points before start (see the \"Procedure\" section for a detailed description of the Assessment and Treatment procedures). This definition of baseline stability is based on previous research using the same multiple baseline design (35) . In addition, the present study includes a 3-and 6-month follow-up to measure the stability of the effects of therapy over time. Four participants received MCT once a week for eight-to-ten sessions, every session lasting between 45 and 60 min.

Our MCT protocol for work related stress-according to the original GAD protocol-consisted of 8-to-10 sessions lasting 45-60 min, conducted by ML who is MCT-trained therapist (see \"Training of the Therapist\" section for details). Yet, the fundamental difference of our stress protocol from the GAD protocol was in the socialization phase [for details see (27) ] were the metacognitive model explained how stress (rather than anxiety) is caused and maintained by worry and other maladaptive coping strategies like monitoring and avoidance, and that in order to overcome stress, the client would need to reduce time spend on these maladaptive coping strategies. Broadly, the purpose of MCT treatment is to reduce the CAS and change the psychological mechanisms that develops and maintains it (27) . In order to do so, the client has to learn to identify worry and rumination and the thoughts that trigger these dysfunctional cognitive patterns (27) . Accordingly, the focus in therapy is not the thought content but the clients' metacognition. In fact, the therapist challenges clients' positive and negative metacognitive beliefs via Socratic dialogue and behavioral experiments. The therapy provides the client with a new set of responses, alternative to the CAS, to negative thoughts and emotions. One of the objects of the therapy is to eliminate undesirable coping strategies (e.g., thought suppression, which only will make the undesired thought more frequent in the long run). Another objective of MCT is to minimize, in the client, avoidance of both situations and thoughts. Thus, the therapy effectiveness of depends on whether CAS has been reduces so that meta-worry and meta-beliefs have changed permanently (27) .",

However, for a more conservative analysis, a specific clinical significant change was also tested in each client by calculating the population-specific cut-off score (58) . The specific GHQ-30 cut-off score is therefore computed as it follows: GHQ-30 baseline: M = 13.20, SD = 4.60, cut-off r = 4.00 (M-2 * SD)-similar to Goldberg and Williams' (47) cut-off score. Results show that at end of therapy: (a) all clients reported a clinically significant change compared to the general cut-off; (b) 3 out of 4 clients reported a clinically significant change compared to the population specific cut-off; and (c) all clients maintained (or improved) the clinical significant change at follow-up.

This took place at the same time as maintaining strategies were changed, which is the aim of MCT (27) . Consistent with previous research (31) , here we show that MCT principles help reducing stress and mitigating its maintaining factors. To our knowledge, the present study is one of the first promising application of MCT on work-related stress. However, a specific protocol for such application has not been developed yet. Based on these considerations, and given the growing concerns of governments on mental health issues (62) and the mounting amount of illness associated to work-related stress (63) further worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic (13, 14, 19) , a specific metacognitive model for stress needs to be developed, and larger, randomized controlled studies need to be conducted to further develop the efficacy of MCT on work-related stress.
