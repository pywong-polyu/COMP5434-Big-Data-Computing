Patients and Methods: Thirty-five recipients post LTx from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine who received inactivated vaccine from June to October 2021 were screened. Information regarding vaccine side effects and clinical data were collected. Results: Thirty-five LTx recipients were enrolled, with a mean age of 46 years, and most patients were male (30, 85.71%). All the participants had a negative history of COVID-19 infection. Predictors for negative response in the recipients were interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) induction during LTx, shorter time post LTx and application of a derivative from mycophenolate acid (MPA). No serious adverse events were observed during the progress of vaccination or after the vaccination. Conclusion: LTx recipients have a substantially partial immunological response to the inactivated vaccine for COVID-19. IL-2R induction during LTx, a shorter time post LTx and the application of a derivative from MPA seem to be predictors for a negative serological immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response in recipients. The findings require booster vaccination in these LTx recipients.",

Among the 35 patients, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) (28 cases of tacrolimus and 1 case of cyclosporine) were used as the dominating immunosuppressor in 29 patients (82.9%), and sirolimus was used in 6 patients (17.1%). Derivative from mycophenolate acid (MPA) was given in 15 (44.8%) recipients, of them, in combination with CNIs in 13 participants and with sirolimus in 2 participants (33.3%). The remaining 10 recipients were treated with a single immunosuppressor. ",

However, little is known about the response and safety of inactivated vaccines in LTx recipients under immunosuppression who were excluded from Phase 3 trials for the vaccine. Our study was the first to investigate the response and safety of inactivated vaccines in LTx recipients. Our study indicated that the immune response to the inactivated vaccine for COVID-19 among LTx recipients was generally low, which was consistent with previous reports showing inferior vaccination seroconversion in SOT recipients in general. 5, 6, 11 However, no graft rejection or other major adverse events to the inactivated vaccine were recorded in this study.",
