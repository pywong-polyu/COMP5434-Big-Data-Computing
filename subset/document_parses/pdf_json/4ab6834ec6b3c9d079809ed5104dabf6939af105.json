Theoretical research in psychology shows that one's emotional state can influence his/her temporal orientation. We hypothesize that measuring human temporal orientation can benefit from concurrent learning of emotion. To test this hypothesis, we propose a deep learning-based multi-task framework where we concurrently learn a unified model for temporal orientation (our primary task) and emotion analysis (secondary task) using tweets. Our multi-task framework takes users' tweets as input and produces three temporal orientation labels (past, present or future) and four emotion labels (joy, sadness, anger, or fear) with intensity values as outputs. The classified tweets are then grouped for each user to obtain the user-level temporal orientation and emotion. Finally, we investigate the associations between the users' temporal orientation and their emotional state. Our analysis reveals that joy and anger are correlated to future orientation while sadness and fear are correlated to the past orientation.",

All these methodologies focus on the performance improvement of single-task learning models, by better characterizing temporal orientation itself. However, some psychological research works show that human temporal orientation can be associated with one's emotional states 28, 29 . For example, joy has been related to future orientation 30 while sadness has been related to past and present orientation 31,32 . For illustration, the sentence 'I am very excited about the upcoming movie release' has a temporal orientation as future and emotion as joy. Another sentence, 'I did everything but I failed' has a temporal orientation as past and emotion as sadness. As a consequence, we hypothesize that the measurement of human temporal orientation can benefit from the concurrent learning of human emotion.",

The first fold examines whether the performance of the tweet-level temporal orientation improves by using emotional signals in the tweets. We formulate the problem in a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously learns the temporal orientation and emotion of tweets. Here, temporal orientation classification is our primary task, and emotion analysis is our auxiliary task. We jointly learn a unified model from the shared representations of all the tasks, expecting that each will benefit from the other, and perform better compared to a single-task setting, where the tasks are performed in isolation. The second fold aims for quantifying the person-level temporal orientation in a large-scale empirical manner and find a relation with the person-level emotion. Existing person-level association between human temporal orientation and emotion mostly is in the space of psychology in limited settings (limited number of participants with a particular age distribution, for example, graduate students of an institute).",

There is no existing large gold standard training set (manually annotated) for temporal orientation tasks. In this regard, researchers built weakly-labeled training sets using limited heuristic rules (keyword-based 20 , hashtag-based 21 ). These approaches do not consider any statistical approach for labeling. Our approach, in contrast, uses both heuristics (human knowledge) as well as statistical approaches (ML models) and uses an optimization technique for generating final labels.",

The authors in 54 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ shows that there is a political argument on Twitter and the quality of public argument can be communicated by speech acts in tweets. In 55 , the authors presented a trend analysis of misinformation spread on Twitter due to COVID-19 and resolved few implications of it. In 56 , the authors proposed a Generative Adversarial Networkbased approach to detect rumours with explanations from tweets. The study reported in 57 investigated whether the social media reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic in three critically affected countries has significant relations with their observed mortality a month later. In contrast to all these studies, we make use of multi-task learning to simultaneously learn temporal orientation and emotion from tweets. The user-level data 34 that we use are of 5191 Twitter users of the UK population. In the data, the tweeters were analysed before collecting data. The authors adopted a standardised job classification taxonomy (a UK government system developed by the Office of National Statistics for classifying occupations) 58 for mapping Twitter users to occupations. The Twitter users were mapped to their occupation along with their historical tweets and profile information. The users are well balances between different occupational groups. The tweets were not used for any specific social phenomena. Rather the users were selected randomly based on the mapping of occupational classes.",

The performance of the emotional intensity is measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient r between the original score and the predicted score. For temporal orientation classification, our multi-task models achieve highest accuracies of 75.30%, 75.98% and 75.17% (Table 2) . For the emotion analysis, the multi-task models achieve 62.29% accuracy and r = 0.49 (using EI-oc data) and 63.05% accuracy and r = 0.55 (using EI-reg data) and 62.81% accuracy and r = 0.57 (using tweet covid-19 data). We see a performance improvement of all the tasks in the multi-task setting from the single-task setting. The class-wise performances (precision, recall, F1-score) of temporal orientation and emotion analysis tasks are reported in Figs. 1, and 2, respectively. We also compare our models (single-task and multi-task) with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) single task temporal orientation model (accuracy of 72.20%). For temporal orientation, we consider the baseline model as the method proposed in 21 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The baseline for original SemEval Task 1 (EI-oc, and EI-reg) 33 were different as the tasks were to predict the emotional intensity of a tweet given the class of the tweet. Thus, we can not directly compare their results. For this reason, here we report SVM-based baseline results for the single-task emotion classification. As there is no existing work that considers temporal orientation in a multi-task setting, we consider a recent framework 59 and use our dataset to make a multi-task baseline. The framework integrated a pooling layer into a Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network for each task. Then the pooling outputs of the tasks are shared and an attention mechanism between the shared layers and the task-specific layers is used to get the shared features. The results are reported in Table 2 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ We observe that both, our single task and multi-task frameworks for temporal classification, beat the SOTA performance (both single-task and multi-task). For the emotion analysis, our multi-task method performs a little better (accuracy of 63.05%, r=0.55) compared to the single-task method (accuracy of 62.07%, r=0.42) as well as the baseline (accuracy of 60.08%, r=0.32 for the single-task baseline and accuracy of 61.55%, r=043 for the multi-task baseline) for the emotion analysis using EI-OC data ( Table 2) . We see the same pattern when we use the other emotion data, i.e. EI-reg and Tweet covid-19 (Table 2) . We believe that our multi-task method is of acceptable quality as our primary task is the temporal orientation while we portray the emotion analysis as an auxiliary task. We perform a Statistical t-test 60 and find that the performance improvement in our proposed multi-task models over the single-task models as well as the baselines is statistically significant (p < 0.001).",

Precisely, we checked the instances where multi-task and single-task models differed. We noticed that the multi-task model tends to perform better for tweets having implicit temporal signals. For example, the tweet 'I miss those days so badly. ' has underlying temporal orientation as past. Our single task model predicts it as future while the multi-task model correctly predicts it as past. The emotion involved in the tweet is 'sadness' which has been related to past orientation 31,32 in psychological literature. Here, emotion adds an extra signal to the model which helps to decide temporal orientation. Another example, 'Lightning in the eastern sky look like they may add to firework-y excitement' has a temporal orientation as future, our single task model fails and classifies it as past but our multi-task does not and correctly classify it as future. The reason for this is the presence of a joyful word 'excitement' which adds a signal to the model (joy has been related to future orientation in the literature 30 ). Confusion matrix shows that our multi-task model mostly misclassifies present tweets into future. For example, the tweet 'Good evening Here we go.' is present oriented but our multi-task model predicts it as future due to a joyful signal associated with it.",

In literature, where temporal orientation was measured on a large scale using the social media data, we see that low correlation coefficient www.nature.com/scientificreports/ values have made a significant contribution 19, 21 . The statistical method needs context. Since we do not have and do not expect to have breakthroughs via Twitter data-driven approach, low correlation coefficient values carry significance in the context of this current study. Although we have backed our empirical findings with psychological references, here we report some limitations which may require more future research in this direction. Firstly, we use a particular data set of Twitter which we believed to have potential information for studying the language-based analysis (here temporal orientation). It would have been better if we could also calculate the self-report measure of the temporal orientation of these Twitter users and compare them with the language-based assessments. However, the existing user-level data is anonymous (for ethical concern) and the number of users is large (5191). So, the self-report study is not feasible for a large number of users. Whether using another type of data (Blogs, news articles) can vary the measurement and relationship is a matter of further research. Secondly, the user-level data is of the UK population and socio-cultural differences have effects on the temporal orientation. In psychological literature, we see that people's age, gender, education and other factors influence the temporal orientation [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . For example, females are more future-oriented than males. So, if the dataset has more samples of females than males then it will be biased towards the future orientation. Similarly, if people of only a young age group are considered then it will also be biased towards the future as young people are more future-oriented. The temporal orientation also varies over culture. For example, people in some cultures are more future-oriented and some are more past-oriented. It is also true for emotion. Our user-level Twitter dataset has ages distributed between 10 and 60, where males and females are almost balanced. However, the data is of the UK population and the measurements may vary if we could use a dataset of the other socially or culturally different regions.",

Although more fine-grained emotion detection from texts would be a very difficult task and can add more errors when mapped to large-scale data. It is possible to have more than one temporal or emotion tag in a tweet. Those tweets will get a single tag based on the current model and dataset. As we don't have a dataset for the multi-label temporal orientation we place this in the scope of future work. We also agree that the context of the tweet matters, but the contextual information is not available in any of the datasets. So, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ we have to rely on the tweet itself, i.e. hashtag information, mentions, keywords, or the implicit meaning of the tweets to resolve contexts. However, the data is well-chosen and annotated with experts. Thus we believe that it has much information for the machine learning model to learn. From our experiments, we observe that emotional information helps the temporal orientation in the multitask setting. Multi-task learning is useful when one task has more data available and another task has limited data and there is a dependency between the two tasks. In the current scenario, there are lots of data (marketing strategy, review data, etc) available for the emotion analysis but limited in the case of temporal orientation. Both temporal orientation and emotional impact on applications like compulsive vs impulsive buying, political, financial aspects, author profiling, etc. Natural language applications in commerce, public health, disaster management, and public policy can benefit from knowing the affectual states of people-both temporal orientation, and the categories and intensities of the emotions they feel.",

The temporal orientation may have more nuances which can be grasped by glancing at valence and/or arousal first and then more fine-grained emotion classes. As our present model is not discussing this because of the unavailability of such tags in the dataset, new findings can be obtained when emotions are models in different ways. To exemplify this, in our current work a tweet about 'failure' is taken in the class 'sadness' , but it can also elicit some more emotions, comprising social emotions (e.g. shame, embarrassment), which are not encompassed by our current model. This may guide us to sum up that 'sadness' may have other types of emotional differences which are the real basis for its correlation with the past orientation.

The tweet vectors for both the tasks are then given as input to a Bidirectional-GRU (Bi-GRU) 71 as well as a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) 72 . The outputs of Bi-GRU and CNN are concatenated, and this is then fed to a shared Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layer. This MLP layer represents the hard parameter sharing of the multi-task framework. The output of the MLP layer is passed through an individual dense layer and then subjected as an input to two different Softmax classifiers for the prediction of two tasks.",

The Semantic Evaluation Task (SemEval) is a well-known competition for extracting and analyzing different semantic tasks like sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, etc from texts. The EI-OC data has tweets with four emotion classes (joy, sadness, anger, and fear) and emotion intensity value in an ordinal scale (0-3) where no intensity (0), low(1), moderate(2), and high(3) intensity scores are present. As we are considering intensity as a regression task, we convert the ordinal values in a range of [0-1] using the formula EI \u2212 new = EI \u2212 oc \u00d7 0.25 + 0.125 as followed in 73 . The EI-reg data also have tweets with four emotion classes (joy, sadness, anger, and fear) and the emotional intensity values are between 0 and 1.

The evaluation shows that the multi-task model achieves better performance than the single-task model. The user-level association reveals that future orientation has associations with joy and anger while past orientation is related to sadness and fear. We also find that emotional intensity also helps in temporal orientation accuracy. We believe that our study will open up more aspects of digital sociopsychological research where human temporal orientation can be studied on a large scale using various social media data. We also hope that it will provide a more generic approach to measure temporal orientation across cultures, regions, etc.",
