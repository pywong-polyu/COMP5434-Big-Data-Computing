Method: We used the Kermack and McKendrick model with varying basic reproduction number to estimate number infected and age stratified percentages to estimate number of in-patients, ICU-patients and cumulative number of deaths. Changes in basic reproduction number was estimated based on current in-patient numbers. Results: The basic reproductive number in the time period of February 27th to March 18th was found to be 2.65, however, this number was reduced to 1.99 after March 18th.",

As of March 20th 2020 the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark have killed 34, while more than 80 people have been admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) with the first case confirmed by February 27th 2020 [3] . Learning from other countries the Danish government have imposed new legislation as well as other means of interference [4] with the purpose of avoiding catastrophic numbers of deaths and total collapse of the health care system. Actions to reduce stress of the health care system includes; home isolation of confirmed cases, closing of schools, non-essential businesses and public workplaces, closing of country borders and restriction on gatherings of more than 10 people. These actions may help to create a much-needed delay of the peak number of infected, in order to establish the necessary resources to overcome the COVID-19 epidemic with fewest adverse outcomes.",

We used a grid search approach on a 16-core Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz hyperthreaded machinery, to find the optimal parameters measured by mean absolute error. To investigate whether the model develops as more data is added, we fitted three models using data available up until March the 23rd, 24th and 25th, respectively. Once models was fitted, we projected number of in-patient and ICU beds needed as well as cumulative number of deaths. Projections were only presented for the model fitted on all available data. All projections was compared to the observed data. All analyses were conducted using Python version 2.7 (Python Software Foundation. Python Language Reference, version 2.7.
