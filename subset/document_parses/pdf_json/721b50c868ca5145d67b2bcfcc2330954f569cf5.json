Airborne infections pose a particular threat to susceptible individuals whenever they are placed together with the index case in confined spaces [4] . e risk of airborne transmission has been shown to be directly related to the number of susceptible individuals in many population studies [5] . Person-to-person transmission primarily occurs via a direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing from an infected individual [6] . ese infected droplets, containing virus that can remain viable on surfaces for days in favourable atmospheric conditions, can spread 1-2 m and deposit on surfaces [7] . e transmission of infectious diseases can be very rapid in confined spaces, such as prisons, nursing homes, chronic care conditions, detoxification centres, refugee camps, hospitals, and schools with transmission occurring in situations where infected persons are in close contact with others [8] . However, studies addressing station platforms are scarce. Station platforms present a particular challenge, especially during a train departure or arrival where some passengers may have potential conditions that make them vulnerable to infections due to the high density and close proximity of passengers. e majority of the urban population relies on high-speed railways for travel and business purposes [9] . erefore, it is important to understand the potential infection risks faced by susceptible individuals on station platforms [10] .",

By comparison, very little work has been undertaken to quantify the risk of airborne transmission with overcrowding in confined spaces. Overcrowding in platform spaces manifests as evacuation of passengers during the departure or arrival phase [14] . Regions with high and low infectious droplet concentrations will simultaneously exist within the same confined space, with the highest concentrations usually occurring close to overcrowded areas. Consequently, the variation of overcrowded areas in platform spaces reflects the effects of passengers' movements on the distribution of the infectious agent throughout the confined spaces during evacuation.",

First, the infection risk, especially during overcrowding, is quite different (Figure 8 ) in each case of the exposure scenario under a constant quantum generation rate. e building science model provided more data of the volume of the ventilated space ( Figure 5) , which was the primary vector for airborne infections. Moreover, controlling the number of susceptible individuals per unit time by strengthening guidance on the platform is more likely to reduce the risk of infection disease transmission. Second, departing passengers are at a lower risk of becoming infected than arriving passengers during an evacuation. Departing passengers, who are less overcrowded in the platform space than the arriving passengers (Figure 7) , had a direct connection with the findings in the simulation.",

Here, we measured the trajectory area of all passengers from three modes to successfully solve the contradiction between the uneven spatial distribution of passengers and completely mixed air mentioned in the Wells-Riley model assumption (Figure 3) .

Our results reinforce the importance of a correlation between overcrowding and the risk of airborne transmission in developing engineering or administrative solutions to artificially minimise the spread of airborne infection in platform spaces.",
