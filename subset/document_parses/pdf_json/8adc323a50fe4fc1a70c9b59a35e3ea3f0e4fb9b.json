It occupies 47% of South America's area, mainly in the tropical region, and has more than 200 million inhabitants. 2 More than 10 million Brazilians have been infected by the virus that causes COVID-19, with more than 250 thousand deaths. 3 The pandemic has been a worldwide challenge. Efforts to \"flatten the curve\" and keep hospital beds and intensive care units available for COVID-19 patients, along with the restrictions imposed by Brazilian policymakers and medical societies, have forced a reduction in the number of procedures performed in the Brazilian Health Care System. 4 Recently, the outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in the Brazilian public health system (SUS) from January 2008 to December 2017 have been published. 5 The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of CABG over the next years (2018 to 2020) in the SUS and to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the number of procedures and death rate of CABG performed in 2020 through the database DATASUS.",

Nearly all of the decrease in case volume over the study time frame occurred in the Southeast Region. The Southeast was responsible for almost 50% of CABG surgeries. Together, the Southeast and South were responsible for almost 75% of all surgeries (see Figure 1C ).",

By the end of March over 4500 cases had been diagnosed, and policymakers and medical societies were beginning to raise the red flag. Figure 2A shows the COVID-19 new cases and deaths by day of notification. Clearly, as the cases of COVID-19 began increasing during March, the number of CABG decreased as surgeons needed to postpone elective procedures (see Figure 2B ). By August the number of cases and deaths had begun to decrease and as hospital beds and intensive care units (ICUs) were becoming available the number of procedures increased again. Interestingly, during the South region increased its volume of surgeries in 2020 by 5%, probably affected by the number of procedures performed in the Southeast (see Figure 2C ).",

In Israel there was a decline in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and an increase in surgical death rate. 7 The daily routines of society, world economy and practice of cardiac surgeons has changed. 8 It is well established that the extracorporeal circulation generates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from COVID-19 may lead to \"cytokine storm\" resulting in shock and death, as reported by a cardiovascular division in Italy. 9, 10 It has been reported that patients who underwent cardiac surgery during 2020 have been infected with COVID-19, and that patients with CVD are more likely to have a severe presentation of SARS from COVID-19. 11 Another major concern is that patients with CVD disease are afraid to call emergency assistance or go to emergency rooms for fear of contracting COVID-19 or burdening an already-overwhelmed health-care system. 12 One possible explanation to the increase in death rate is that in most of the time only emergency surgeries were allowed, characterizing more severe patients.",

CABG with concomitant procedures was excluded. We used the TabNet software 6 from the DATASUS website to generate reports. While SUS contains verified patient identifiers to track individuals across hospital admissions within and across the states, DATASUS contains completely deidentified data (i.e., no social security numbers or patient-specific identifiers) using unique patient keys that are tracked by the state. Because DATASUS is a publicly available deidentified database, this study was exempt from patients' consent to have their data included in this report by our Institutional Review Board.

The institution was transformed into a COVID-19 reference center, with more than 60% of hospital beds rearranged to receive COVID-19 patients, and the opening of new ICUs. It was necessary to postpone elective surgeries as suggested by the policymakers of our state. Even though we continue to receive CVD patients in the emergency room, many refuse surgery due to the risk of contracting COVID-19. In general, patients who underwent surgery were in an emergency situation. A comparison of volume of procedures between 2019 and 2020 showed that while some hospitals in the State of Parana managed to increase their volume by 100%, others experienced volume reductions of 66%.The State had an average reduction of 21.5% in CABG. Our institution reduced its procedures by 39%. One possible explanation would be that some hospitals, mainly larger institutions, were transformed into COVID-19 reference centers, and smaller centers were able to continue cardiac surgery expansion. This seems to be the new reality in the worldwide health care system. As we write this paper, we are living through an even more severe, second wave of the pandemic, which has led the state Governor to impose a lockdown. The year 2021 may see a continued reduction in thenumber of cardiac procedures nationwide and at our service, with continued postponement of elective surgeries where possible.",
