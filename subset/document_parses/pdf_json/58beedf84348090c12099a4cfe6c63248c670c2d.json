            "text": "Anomaly detection and explanation in big volumes of real-world medical data, such as those pertaining to COVID-19, pose some challenges. First, we are dealing with time-series data. Typical time-series data describe behavior of a single object over time. In medical data, we are dealing with time-series data belonging to multiple entities. Thus, there may be multiple subsets of records such that records in each subset, which belong to a single entity are temporally dependent, but the records in different subsets are unrelated. Moreover, the records in a subset contain different types of attributes, some of which must be grouped in a particular manner to make the analysis meaningful. Anomaly detection techniques need to be customized for time-series data belonging to multiple entities. Second, anomaly detection techniques fail to explain the cause of outliers to the experts. This is critical for new diseases and pandemics where current knowledge is insufficient. We propose to address these issues by extending our existing work called IDEAL, which is an LSTM-autoencoder based approach for data quality testing of sequential records, and provides explanations of constraint violations in a manner that is understandable to end-users. The extension (1) uses a novel two-level reshaping technique that splits COVID-19 data sets into multiple temporally-dependent subsequences and (2) adds a data visualization plot to further explain the anomalies and evaluate the level of abnormality of subsequences detected by IDEAL. We performed two systematic evaluation studies for our anomalous subsequence detection. One study uses aggregate data, including the number of cases, deaths, recovered, and percentage of hospitalization rate, collected from a COVID tracking project, New York Times, and Johns Hopkins for the same time period. The other study uses COVID-19 patient medical records obtained from Anschutz Medical Center health data warehouse. The results are promising and indicate that our techniques can be used to detect anomalies in large volumes of real-world unlabeled data whose accuracy or validity is unknown.",

Examples include the analysis of the impacts [1] , diagnosis [2] , treatments [3] , and pre-symptom detection [4] of COVID-19 based on the available data collected from radiography, chest CT, chest X-ray, wearable devices, and COVID-19 tracking reports. Such data records are assumed to be accurate. However, the records may get corrupted in the non-trivial data collection and transformation processes. Anomalous data may lead to incorrect inferences and research findings. Thus, it is critical to automatically find inaccurate or anomalous data before doing any analysis and explain how the data is anomalous to the healthcare professionals.

Machine learning approaches [9] [10] [11] have also been used for data quality assurance in other domains. Many of these techniques use supervised machine learning, which assumes the existence of labeled training data which in real-world is unavailable for new forms of outbreaks such as COVID-19. Moreover, outlier detection using machine learning fails to explain how records are anomalous to the domain experts. Finally, most works [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] identifying anomalous records in a data set cannot be used on time-series data as anomalies may span multiple attributes and records in a sequence [18] . We aim to eliminate the above shortcomings by detecting anomalies in COVID-19 time-series data without having access to labeled data and explaining the anomalies to domain experts in a comprehensible manner.",

            "text": "This approach, called IDEAL, builds upon our previous work on data quality assessment approach [19] that uses an LSTM-autoencoder [10] network to find anomalies in unsupervised data. Anomalies are data records or subsequences of data records whose behaviors (i.e., attribute values or change in the values over time) are significantly different from the majority of records and subsequences in a timeseries data set [5] . IDEAL automatically (1) discovers different types of constraints from the sequence data, (2) marks subsequences and records that violate the constraints as suspicious, and (3) explains the violations. IDEAL automatically generates three types of visualizations to explain the anomalies. The plot showing the suspiciousness score per attribute indicates which attributes make the subsequence anomalous. The second visualization uses decision trees to illustrate the violated constraints. The third plot compares a suspicious subsequence detected by IDEAL with normal subsequences belonging to the same data set. The approach incorporates feedback from domain experts to improve the accuracy of constraint discovery and anomaly detection. We proposed an autocorrelation-based reshaping technique that automatically adjusts the LSTM-autoencoder input window size based on how far the records are related to their past values. We evaluated the effectiveness of IDEAL using data sets from Yahoo servers [20] , NASA Shuttle [21] , and Colorado State University Energy Institute [22] . We demonstrated that IDEAL could detect previously known and injected anomalies in these data sets.",

The Yahoo servers [20] and NASA Shuttle [21] data sets that we previously used contain time-series data associated with a single entity; COVID-19 time-series data belongs to multiple entities (e.g., cases and deaths for states and counties, or lab test type and test name for different patients. Thus, in COVID-19 data there are multiple subsets of data each of which belongs to a single entity. Records in each subset are temporally dependent but they are unrelated to records in other subsets. Moreover, in each subset there are multiple grouping attributes (e.g., test type and test name) which requires the data to be preprocessed to make the results correct. We extend IDEAL using a two-level reshaping approach to transform data into a shape that is suitable for analysis. This approach removes the restriction that all data records in a sequence data set must be temporally dependent and are describing behaviors of the same object over time. Instead, IDEAL supports data sets in which a subset of records are temporally related to each other but are unrelated to the records from other subsets in the same data set. For example, a health data store may contain medical records of multiple patients over time. The records of each patient are temporally dependent but independent from those of other patients.",

Decomposition techniques, suitable only for univariate time series, break a time series into level, trend, seasonality, and noise components and monitor the noise components to capture the anomalous records [28, 29] . Modeling techniques represent a time series as a linear/non-linear function that associates each current value to its past values, predict the value of a record at a specific time, and report as anomalies those records whose prediction error falls outside a threshold. Stochastic modeling techniques, such as Moving Average (MA) [30] , Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [31] , and Holt-Winters (HW) [32] use statistical measures to calculate the correlation between the data records. These techniques assume that the time series is linear and follows a known statistical distribution, which make them inapplicable to many practical problems [33] . Machine learning modeling techniques support non-linear modeling, with no assumption about the distribution of the data [33] . Examples are multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) [34] , long short term memory (LSTM) [9] , and hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) [11] . Some of these techniques can model multivariate time-series.

            "text": "Existing techniques for anomalous sequence detection split the data into multiple subsequences, typically based on a fixed-size window [35] or an exhaustive brute-force approach [36] . Clustering-based anomalous sequence detection techniques extract subsequence features, such as trend and seasonality, and group the subsequences based on the similarities between their features. An anomalous subsequence is detected as the one that is distantly positioned within a cluster or is positioned in the smallest cluster. These approaches only detect anomalous sequences without determining the records and attributes that are the major causes of invalidity in each subsequence. Autoencoderbased techniques (1) take subsequences as input, (2) use an autoencoder network to reconstruct the subsequences, (3) assign invalidity scores based on the reconstruction errors to the subsequences, and (4) detect as anomalous those subsequences whose scores are greater than a threshold. These techniques can learn complex non-linear associations among the attributes in the time series but are not able to model the temporal dependencies among the records in the input subsequence. An LSTM-autoencoder extends an autoencoder for time series data, and captures long-term temporal associations among data records in the form of complex equations that are not human interpretable. Our work aims to fill this gap by illustrating the cause of anomaly to the domain experts. Figure 1 shows an overview of our approach. The input is in the form of data records and the output consists of a report showing subsequences of suspicious records accompanied with an explanation of the violated constraints. There are five components, namely, data preparation, constraint discovery, anomaly detection, anomaly interpretation, and anomaly inspection. These components form the basis of IDEAL [19] and are briefly described in the following paragraphs. \"Extension to data preparation\" and \"Evaluation\" describe how the data preparation and anomaly interpretation components are extended in this paper.",

For each subsequence, IDEAL plots the s-score values for all the attributes in the subsequence. Moreover, IDEAL uses a decision tree [41] based technique called random forest [42] classifier to determine the constraints that are violated by each suspicious [19] subsequence. For each attribute of the subsequence, a set of time series features, such as Mean, Max, and Curvature are extracted using Tsfeatures [43] CRAN library. Next, decision trees are generated using these features. The decision trees represent a set of if-then-else decision rules, which describe the constraints that identify sequences as valid or invalid based on their feature values.

However, real-world data sets including the ones used in this study typically contain records of multiple objects over time. For example, a COVID-19 tracking data set can store case records of multiple states over time in the US. A medical data set may contain clinical records for multiple patients over time. Each object (i.e., state in the COVID-19 data set and patient in the medical data set) has a unique id, which distinguishes the records concerning that object from the other records in the data set. Single-level reshaping techniques cannot be used to split the data records into multiple subsequences in such data sets. These techniques may generate subsequences with temporally unrelated records, which can result in generating false alarms.

A data set may have one or more grouping attributes, which are domain-dependent. Figure 4a shows an example of a medical data set of laboratory results for multiple patients over time. This data set contains three levels of grouping attributes to describe the data records. The first-level grouping attribute (i.e., Patient_ID) indicates the objects in a data set, each of which is represented by a unique Id. The second-to h-level grouping attributes indicate features about those objects. For example, in Fig. 4a , the second-level grouping attribute (i.e., Test_Type) represents the type of laboratory test. Each patient can receive multiple types of test. The third-level grouping attribute (i.e., Test_Name) is the name of the laboratory test performed on the patients. Each Test_Type includes multiple Test_Name. We identify the domain-dependent grouping attributes with the help from domain experts. In the future, we will use statistical autocorrelation-based [48] techniques to automatically identify the grouping attributes and their hierarchy from an input data set. 2. Concatenate non-first-level grouping attributes. Our approach converts all the non-first-level grouping attributes into a single data set column to reduce the complexity (i.e., dimensionality) of the problem. We call this new column the second-level grouping attribute. Figure 4b shows the new generated column from all the non-first-level grouping attributes. At this step, we can use the first-and second-level attributes to group the data into multiple temporally dependent subsequences. However, using the resulting subsequences generated by this approach, time-series analysis techniques will not preserve the associations among the values of second-level attribute if any. For example, if there are associations among \"Blood-Sugar\" and \"Blood-Pressure\" of a patient, grouping at this stage would not preserve this association. To address this issue, our approach uses another step for pivoting the second-level attribute into multiple temporal attributes based on the attribute values. 3.

The input size is adjusted based on how far the records in a group are related to their past values. By feeding the LSTM-autoencoder network with highly correlated records, this reshaping approach prevents the network from incorrectly discovering associations among non-correlated records. For each group G i , IDEAL uses the autocorrelationbased approach to identify the window size w i for that group. Autocorrelation is defined as the correlation of sequence data records with the records in the previous time steps, called lags [39] . An Autocorrelation Function (ACF [48] ) at lag k for an attribute identifies to what extend the attribute is correlated to its kth past value. IDEAL calculates ACF to identify the lags at which the attribute values are highly correlated to set the window size. As the LSTM-autoencoder window size must be similar for all the data records in a data set, IDEAL sets the final value of window size W to the smallest value of window sizes calculated for the groups (Eq. 1).

Next, IDEAL plots values of that attribute for all the groups (i.e., G i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m ) over time. The attribute values of the suspicious subsequence are represented by red points. Figures 5 and 6 shows the visualization plots generated for a suspicious subsequence detected from the laboratory results in the Anschutz medical data. Figure 5 shows that e_TOTGLOB attribute (i.e., total serum globulin) is the major cause of invalidity (i.e., attribute with the highest s-score value) in this subsequence. The data visualization plot in Fig. 6 shows the values of the e_TOTGLOB attribute over time for this subsequence (in red) as well as other subsequences (in colors other than red) in the same data set. We can visually observe from this figure how the values of e_TOTGLOB for this patient deviate from those of the majority of the patients in the data set. As the value of this attribute is elevated in certain immunological diseases, this deviation can be caused by an immunological disease of the patient.",

For example, data records of the Alabama state collected from three sources of data during March to April 2020 form three equivalent subsequences. We formalized possible observations on equivalent subsequences to validate a suspicious subsequence based on whether (1) the same subsequence is detected by IDEAL as suspicious from all available sources of data or (2) the subsequence is detected as anomalous only in some of the available sources.

            "text": "We ran two experiments. Table 2 shows the attributes from the COVID-19 data sets used for each experiment. Figure 7 shows data visualization plots for suspicious subsequences detected by IDEAL from data sets of the first experiment. In this figure, each color represents data of a state. There are 50 plots for the 50 states of the US. The red plot represents the data of the suspicious subsequence. We used Fig. 8 to validate the suspicious subsequences by comparing the attribute values of the suspicious subsequences with those of their equivalent subsequences from the first experiment data sets. These attributes are major causes of invalidity in each suspicious subsequence. In this experiment, the threshold T is set at 0.03 based on our observations of the values of MSE in these data sets. Figure 7a : A suspicious subsequence s JH was detected from JH in California data. An equivalent subsequence s T was detected from T. The Confirmed attribute was the major cause of invalidity in these subsequences. The data visualization plot in Fig. 7a shows how the Confirmed attribute values of the suspicious subsequence from California data in JH (red points) deviate from other subsequences from other states in the same source (i.e., JH). The constraint violations reported by the decision trees for this suspicious subsequence were over the Minimum and Mean features of the subsequence. In Fig. 8a , MSE(s JH , s T ) < T , Page 10 of 17 MSE(s JH , s NT ) < T , and MSE(s T , s NT ) < T . This result indicates that in California, the numbers of confirmed cases over time reported by all three data sources for this suspicious subsequence are close to each other. Based on the case A, s JH , s NT , and s T are either (1) abnormal but valid or (2) anomalous data that have been obtained from the same source. Figure 7b : A suspicious subsequence s T was detected from T in New York data. Equivalent subsequences s JH and s NT were also detected from JH and NT. The Deaths attribute was the major cause of invalidity in these subsequences. The data visualization plot in Fig. 7b shows how the Deaths attribute values of the suspicious subsequence from New York data in T (red points) deviate from other subsequences from other states in the same source (i.e., T). The constraint violations reported by the decision trees for this suspicious subsequence were over the Linearity (i.e., strength of linearity, which is the sum of squared residuals of time-series from a linear autoregression) and Burstiness (i.e., ratio between the variance and the mean (Fano Factor) of time series) features of the subsequence. In Fig. 8b , MSE(s JH , s T ) > T , MSE(s NT , s T ) > T , and MSE(s JH , s NT ) < T . This result indicates that the number of death cases in the New York state collected by the data source T was considerably less than that of the other two sources of data. Based on case B, s T is anomalous and s JH , s NT are valid. Figure 7c : A suspicious subsequence s NT was detected only from NT in Florida data. The Confirmed attribute was the major cause of invalidity in this subsequence. The data visualization plot in Fig. 7c shows how the Confirmed attribute values of the suspicious subsequence from Florida data in NT (red points) deviate from other subsequences from other states in the same source (i.e., NT). The constraint violations reported by the decision trees for this suspicious subsequence were over the Mean and Curvature (i.e., strength of curvature, which is the amount by which a time series curve deviates from being a straight line and calculated based on the coefficients of an orthogonal quadratic regression) features of the subsequence. In this figure, MSE(s JH , s T ) < T , MSE(s JH , s NT ) < T , and MSE(s T , s NT ) < T . This result indicates that in Florida, the numbers of confirmed cases over time reported by all three data sources for this suspicious subsequence are close to each other. Based on case A, s JH , s NT , s T are either valid or anomalous collected from the same source. Figure 9 shows data visualization plots for suspicious subsequences detected by IDEAL from data sets of the second experiment. We used Fig. 10 to validate the suspicious subsequences by observing the actual values of attributes for the suspicious subsequences and their equivalent subsequences from the second experiment data sets. These attributes are major causes of invalidity in each suspicious subsequence. In this experiment threshold T is set at 0.0004 based on our observations on the values of MSE in these data sets. Figure 9a : A suspicious subsequence s JH was detected only from JH in Kentucky data. The Hospitalization_Rate attribute was the major cause of invalidity in this subsequence. The data visualization plot in Fig. 9a shows how the Hospitalization_Rate attribute values of the suspicious subsequence (red points) from Kentucky data in JH deviate from other subsequences from other states in the same source (i.e., JH). The constraint violations reported by the decision trees for this suspicious subsequence were over the Mean, Maximum, and Vchange (i.e., maximum difference in variance between consecutive blocks in time series) Fig. 10a , MSE(s JH , s T ) > T . This result indicates that the hospitalization rates reported by the two sources of data for the Kentucky state were considerably distinct. Based on case D, s JH and s T are abnormal subsequences that need more investigation. Figure 9b : A suspicious subsequence s T was detected only from T in Ohio data. The Hospitalization_Rate attribute was the major cause of invalidity in this subsequence. The data visualization plot in Fig. 9b shows how the Hospitaliza-tion_Rate attribute values of the suspicious subsequence from Ohio data in T (red points) deviate from other subsequences from other states in the same source. The constraint violations reported by the decision trees for this suspicious subsequence were over the Mean, Curvature (i.e., strength of curvature, which is the amount by which a time series curve deviates from being a straight line and calculated based on the coefficients of an orthogonal quadratic regression), and Highlowmu (i.e., ratio between the means of data that is below and upper the global mean of time series) features of the subsequence. In Fig. 10b , MSE(s JH , s T ) > T . This result indicates that the hospitalization rates reported by the two sources of data for the Ohio state were considerably distinct. Based on case D, s JH and s T are abnormal subsequences that need more investigation. Figure 9c : A suspicious subsequence s T was detected only from T in Oregon data. The Hospitalization_Rate attribute was the major cause of invalidity in this subsequence. The data visualization plot in Fig. 9c shows how the Hospitalization_Rate attribute values of the suspicious subsequence from Oregon data in T (red points) deviate from other subsequences from other states in the same source. The constraint violations reported by the decision trees for this suspicious subsequence were over the Variance and Burstiness (i.e., ratio between the variance and the mean (Fano Factor) of time series) features of the subsequence. In Fig. 10c , MSE(s JH , s T ) > T . This result indicates that the hospitalization rates reported by the two sources of data for the Oregon state were considerably distinct. Based on case D, s JH and s T are abnormal subsequences that need more investigation.",

We identified as normal (false positive) those suspicious subsequences of patients whose attribute values changing pattern over time are not different (i.e., not visually observable) from other patients in their population. Figure 11 shows a visualization plot generated by IDEAL for a suspicious subsequence detected by IDEAL from data set ID = 1. In this example, the e_Meancorpusc3 attribute is the major cause of suspiciousness of the subsequence. We can visually observe that the suspicious subsequence represented by red data points shows a considerable difference with other subsequences of the same population (i.e., COVID-positive with diabetes). As a result, this subsequence is a true positive. The constraint violations reported by the decision trees for this suspicious subsequence were over the Mean and Variance features of the subsequence. Figure 12 shows a visualization plot generated by IDEAL for a suspicious subsequence detected by IDEAL from data set ID=3. In this example, the Phart attribute is the major cause of suspiciousness of the subsequence. We cannot visually observe a considerable difference between the suspicious subsequence represented by red data points and other subsequences of the same population (i.e., COVID-positive with hypertension). As a result, this subsequence is a false positive. The constraint violations reported by the decision trees for this suspicious subsequence were over the Maximum, Curvature (i.e., strength of curvature, which is the amount by which a time series curve deviates from being a straight line and calculated based on the coefficients of an orthogonal quadratic regression), and Linearity (i.e., strength of linearity, which is the sum of squared residuals of time series from a linear autoregression) features of the subsequence. Table 4 shows number of true positives (TP), number of false positives (FP), Precision = TP (TP+FP) and total time (TT) it took to run the automated steps of IDEAL against each data set under test. As the data is unlabeled, we cannot calculate the recall metric, which is based on the number of false negatives. The number of true positives and false positives are calculated based on our observation on the data visualization plots. It took between 58 and 108 s to run IDEAL against the data sets. IDEAL could detect between 1 and 4 abnormal subsequences in these data sets. The precision was between 75 and 100%.",

We ran two experiments to validate the suspicious subsequences detected by IDEAL from Johns Hopkins, New York Times, and COVID-19 tracking project. We compared the attribute values of the suspicious subsequence detected from a source with those collected from other sources of data. IDEAL could find an anomalous subsequence in COVID-19 Tracking data set in the number of deaths in the New York state.

An RNN can be represented as multiple copies of a neural network, each passing a value to its successor. The original RNNs can only learn short-term dependencies among data records using the recurrent feedback connections [45] . LSTMs extend RNNs using specialized gates and memory cells in their neuron structure to learn long-term dependencies. The computational units (neurons) of an LSTM are called memory cells. An LSTM has the ability to remove or add information to the memory cell state using gates. The gates are defined as weighted functions that govern information flow in the memory cells. The gates are composed of a sigmoid layer and a point-wise operation to optionally let information through. The sigmoid layer outputs a number between zero (to let nothing through) and one (to let everything through). There are three types of gates, namely, forget, input, and output.",

The encoder compresses the data from the input layer into a short representation, which is a non-linear combination of the input elements. The decoder decompresses this representation into a new representation that closely matches the original data. The network is trained to minimize the reconstruction error (RE), which is the average squared distance between the original data and its reconstruction [52] . An LSTM-autoencoder [44] is an extension of an autoencoder for time-series data using an encoder-decoder LSTM architecture. An LSTM-autoencoder can capture the temporal dependencies among the input records by using LSTM networks as the layers of the autoencoder network. Figure 13 shows the LSTM-autoencoder architecture. The input and output are fixed-size time series matrices. X i,j = [x 0 i,j , \u2026 , x d\u22121 i,j ] is the jth record with d attributes, T i is the ith time series that contains w records, and w is the window size. The network output has the same dimensionality as the network input. The network is composed of two hidden layers that are LSTMs with d \u2032 units. The first LSTM layer functions as an encoder that investigates the dependencies from the input sequence and produces a complex hidden context (i.e., d \u2032 encoded time series features, where the value of d \u2032 depends on the underlying encoding used by the autoencoder). The second LSTM layer functions as a decoder that produces the output sequence, based on the learned complex context and the previous output state. The TimeDistributed layer is used to process the output from the LSTM hidden layer. This layer is a dense (fully-connected) wrapper layer that makes the network return a sequence with shape (d * w) . The reconstruction error for this network is defined as follows [52] : where T i and T \u2032 i are the ith network input and output and m is the total number of subsequences.",
