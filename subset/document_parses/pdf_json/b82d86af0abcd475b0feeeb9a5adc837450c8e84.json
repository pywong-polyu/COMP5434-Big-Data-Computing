Particularly notable is the effect size for each additional hour of exposure to Riff Video during the first half of the course, which is associated with a doubling of the odds that the student completes the course and earns a certificate. Although this is an observational experiment, it again strongly suggests that the Riff platform may be having a significant impact on students' course completion rates and participation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "These experiments and the corresponding results, though they signal strong correlations between the usage of Riff Platform and all measured output variables, are not without limitations. Clearly, the results are based only on this set of experiments with this cohort of students in a single course. It is better to repeat these experiments in a variety of settings (different cohorts in different countries in different types of learning environments and tasks) to see if the results can be generalized. Secondly, we did not have any control variables (demographic variables such as age, gender, prior job experience or other variables like prior online learning experience or prior performance in similar online or offline courses) on the subjects for whom we collected the data. It just may be that students who are successful (i.e. high grades and/or achievement of the certificate) using Riff would have been successful anyway because they have prior experience using online learning platforms or they are high-performing students anyway regardless of the learning environment or tools.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Further experiments can be designed as future work to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of the Riff Platform, and Riff Video in particular. For instance, one can run a controlled trial experiment using Riff Diagnostic in an A/B test setting to see the net effect of the Meeting Mediator nudging tool. An experiment as depicted in Table 5 where, for instance, 4-person groups would work together in a non-learning environment to complete 2 rubric-assessed tasks with treatments would help us identify the net effect of the nudging tool under consideration. In such an experiment, subjects would be compensated for their participation with no specific consequence of performing well or poorly on the tasks (e.g. loss of funds, course failure, etc).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 343, "end": 350, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the case of learning environments, one must take care when setting up control structures such that all students are given equal opportunities for learning.

In no case can there be an experimental design in which one group of participants is given a treatment with the expectation of diminished performance .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Even with the limitations noted, the experiments we report in our study are a solid first step towards showing that online learning platforms with the right user-facing components that provide relevant and prompt feedback to participants are indeed likely to be effective in enhancing the learning experience.
