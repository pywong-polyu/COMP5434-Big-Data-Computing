            "text": "Postgraduate researchers (PGRs), also called doctoral or graduate students, are vulnerable to mental health problems. 1 Recent largescale studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and suicidality among PGRs in several countries. [2] [3] [4] [5] Rates of depression and anxiety have robustly been found to be greater for PGRs compared with the general public (i.e. working professionals) and other student populations, [3] [4] [5] and this difference does not appear to be explained by pre-existing mental health problems that predate embarking upon PhD study. 3 Despite this high prevalence, access to support is limited. 6 Previous research has focused mainly on PGR demographic characteristics and aspects of the PhD and institutional environment, 1, 4 and often involved small sample sizes and the failure to disaggregate doctoral from other postgraduate students. 1 Moreover, few studies have considered the relative importance of different mental health influences. We aimed to test associations among a comprehensive set of potential determinants of mental health problems in PGRs, derived from factors commonly mentioned in the doctoral well-being literature and as influences on the clinical development of depression, anxiety and suicidality.",

Females report greater anxiety and depression generally 10 and among PGRs. 9, 11 However, males are more at risk of suicide in the general population, 12 with no large-scale data available on this for PGRs.

Impostor thoughts and perfectionism appear particularly salient in the competitive academic atmosphere, in which PGRs feel continually evaluated. 16 Impostor thoughts reflect perceived 'intellectual phoniness', i.e. that one has fooled others into believing one is clever or skilled, and that apparent achievements are accidental or misappropriated. 17 Impostor thoughts are associated with depression, anxiety and suicidality. 17, 18 Similarly, perfectionism influences mental health, especially in educational contexts. 19 Having high standards for oneself (perfectionistic standards) is typically considered adaptive, whereas the perceived failure to meet these standards (perfectionistic discrepancy) is typically considered maladaptive. 20 The latter is associated with greater anxiety, depression and suicidality among PGRs. 9, 21 Social factors Social factors additionally appear to be important. Social support is robustly related to reduced stress among PGRs, yet social isolation is a core and salient aspect of the doctoral experience. 1 PGRs have expressed a need for a dynamic balance between their PhD as a social versus individual experience, 22 emphasising complementarity between desired and experienced social connection. Loneliness, a mismatch or deficiency in one's social relationships, is a way of conceptualising when this does not occur. 23 Loneliness predicts student psychological distress to a greater extent than other academic and non-academic factors. 24 Multiple social identities may additionally be important because PGRs commonly feel 'enmeshed' with their PhD. 1 The greater number of social groups to which people feel they belong, the greater number of social identities they possess, the more positive self-attributions they have and the better their mental health and well-being. 25 ",

We used hierarchical linear regression to test predictors of each symptom score in turn. In each model, we entered putative predictors in blocks representing conceptual clusters: demographic, occupational, psychological, social and relational. This hierarchical approach facilitated testing whether all clusters predicted significant variance in symptoms, in addition to identifying specific contributions of individual variables. We did not enter variables that did now show bivariate associations with symptoms. The block order followed the perceived nature of evidence relating to proposed effects on symptoms, with the first two blocks considered 'background' factors less amenable to change.

With respect to individual demographic covariates in the final models, greater depression was significantly predicted by younger age, BAME ethnicity and having a non-mental health disability. Greater anxiety was predicted by younger age, female gender and non-UK citizen status. Suicidality was predicted by disability and pre-existing mental health problems. For occupational covariates, greater depression and anxiety were predicted by a longer duration of PhD study. Greater anxiety was additionally predicted by more hours of weekly occupational activity. No individual coefficients were significant for occupational predictors of suicidality. All standardised coefficients representing demographic and occupational covariates reflected small effect sizes. For psychological covariates, all three final models showed that greater symptoms were predicted by greater impostor thoughts and perfectionistic discrepancy. Greater anxiety was additionally predicted by perfectionistic standards. For social factors, greater loneliness significantly predicted greater symptoms across all models. Finally, lower perceived communion in the supervisory relationship predicted greater depression, anxiety and suicidality. Greater depression was additionally predicted by lower perceived agency. Again, all standardised coefficients reflecting psychological, social and relational covariates were small in size, although larger than those associated with demographic and occupational covariates. Most individual coefficients remained significant when corrected for multiple testing. Across all models, loneliness had the largest individual effect size (see Fig. 1 ).",

Consequently, it is possible that mental health problems cause loneliness, potentially by affecting social skills and withdrawal, or that this association is reciprocal. Nevertheless, loneliness does cause new onsets of mental health problems, 41 and should be considered an important intervention target for the mental health of PGRs. Conversely, multiple group memberships were not a significant multivariate predictor of symptoms. This is surprising, considering associations with depression found previously, 42 and the apparent importance of multiple social identities to PGR well-being. 1 However, multiple group memberships were bivariately associated with reduced depression, anxiety and suicidality. It could be that in the multivariate model, loneliness is such a powerful influence that multiple group memberships, which covary with loneliness, fail to explain additional variance. Alternatively, it may be that multiple group memberships mediate or moderate the effect of risk factors such as loneliness. It is additionally acknowledged that the multiple group memberships scale asked only about PGRs' perceptions of having lots of group memberships and social ties. It may be that other aspects, such as the importance or compatibility of different social groups, are more important for PGRs in the context of potential role conflicts. 22 The present sample mean for impostor thoughts suggests, on average, the sample are in the 'high' range and experience frequent impostor thoughts, with 27.4% scoring in the highest ('intense') range. 34 The current mean is similar to that of PGRs in a previous study. 43 The means for the perfectionistic standards and discrepancy subscales are also similar to those reported previously for PGRs. 9 These factors were consistent predictors of mental health symptoms in the present study. These associations are in keeping with research evidencing that PGRs with greater perfectionistic discrepancy experience more stress and negative emotions, 21 and that impostor thoughts are associated with greater depression and anxiety across many different employment contexts. 44 That perfectionistic standards predicted greater anxiety contradicts previous findings that 'adaptive perfectionists' with higher standards experience less stress and negative emotions than 'non-perfectionists' with lower standards. 21 However, this may be explained by adaptive perfectionists in this previous study having the lowest discrepancy, indicating that they believed they were meeting their high standards, which perhaps differs from the present sample.",

Current findings fit with evidence that problematic supervisory practices are associated with greater mental health symptoms. 9, 15 Specifically, the prediction of depression by a lack of perceived supervisory agency emphasises the need for supervision to achieve a dynamic balance between exerting influence and leadership, and making space for PGR autonomy. 22 Nonetheless, current findings suggest that the proximity and cooperativeness (communion) of supervision is most associated with mental health symptoms. This is in keeping with a growing emphasis that supervision needs to be more than an asymmetric professional relationship focused on teaching research skills, and more an authentic mentorship; characterised by positive communication, collaboration and flexibility. 45 Our findings undermine the notion that instrumental support matters more than emotional support. 46 Present QSDI octant scores suggested, similar to supervisor profiles described previously, 38,47 that current supervisors were perceived to be high in leadership, helping/friendly behaviours, understanding, and encouraging PhD student responsibility/freedom, but were moderately low in uncertain and strict behaviours, and low for dissatisfied and admonishing behaviours. Nonetheless, current supervisors were perceived to demonstrate more admonishment than their European counterparts. 38, 47 Therefore, UK institutions may wish to explore and emulate European practices in supervisor training.",

Associations between occupational factors and symptoms were again inconsistent and very small, but indicated that a longer duration of PhD study predicts greater depression and anxiety. Existing studies are in disagreement: one study in Scotland found that the duration of PhD study was not associated with depression or anxiety, but did predict greater suicidality, 9 whereas a study in Argentina found longer duration to predict greater anxiety and depression. 5 Berry et al in this study refers only to the year of study, and is neither adjusted for full-time/part-time status nor interruption/intermission periods, nor does it reflect whether PGRs are completing their studies to time and target. Therefore, it may be that findings are confounded by the effect that feeling 'behind schedule' has on mental health, 9 as opposed to more years of PhD study per se being associated with greater risk of mental ill-health. Interpreting the effect of the number of years of study is complicated for UK PGRs because of the presence of a 4-year deadline (full-time study). Consequently, the effect of more years of PhD study may be linked to the approach of a deadline that may reinforce feelings that one is behind schedule. This would suggest that the imposition of a 4-year deadline should be re-examined.",

Foremost, this study uses cross-sectional data and, therefore, attempts to explain associations but not to test causal relationships. It is possible that mental health symptoms influence those variables specified as predictors in models tested here; at least those amenable to change. It is also possible that unobserved factors influence associations tested here. For example, hopefulness may explain the association between perfectionism and depression. 48 Other aspects of doctoral study, such as perceived progress, 49 may also contribute to symptom prediction. In addition, we did not control for situational factors affecting PGRs, such as historical or current trauma or bereavement, which will influence the presentation of mental health symptoms and experiences of PGRs. 22 Associations between some putative predictors representing only a small minority of study participants (e.g. continuation or disability status) and mental health symptoms must be taken very cautiously. Although there does not appear to be marked multicollinearity, it is acknowledged that the presented regressions test a large number of variables, which were often intercorrelated, complicating the conceptual interpretation of what individual significant predictors then represent. Moreover, the present sample are a self-selecting sample of UK PGRs who participated in an online survey and, although sizeable, may not be representative. As in other studies of PGRs, this study is limited by the mental health symptoms being measured by a self-reported and not expert psychiatric assessment.

For example, loneliness may moderate the association between perfectionism and depression. 50 As noted, other psychological factors, such as hopefulness and meaning in life, 22 and PhD study factors, such as environmental demands and resources, 4 require additional study as related to mental health problems in PGRs. Moreover, we have demonstrated associations in the present sample between a lifetime prevalence of mental health problems and absenteeism and presenteeism, 27 yet the contribution of symptoms and other psychological factors to attendance and completion of the doctorate would benefit from further study.

Clinical and public health evidence indicates that interventions that incorporate cognitive and educational components, and support social skills development, are most effective. 51 In place of specific loneliness interventions developed for PGRs, institutions can provide support through the adequate provision of talking therapies. Nonetheless, the (co)development or adaptation and evaluation of specialist loneliness interventions for the PGR context is warranted. Moreover, institutions should consider a whole-university approach to reducing loneliness. Loneliness is not unique to PGRs, but is a huge global public health issue 52,53 further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, felt by other student groups 24 and the general public. 41 A key practice implication is for universities and the wider sector to consider how loneliness may be structurally caused and exacerbated, and how changes to higher-order structures may improve the social and mental health of all who work and study there. Impostor thoughts and perfectionistic beliefs, which are also associated with mental health problems in PGRs, are similarly amenable to change through psychological therapies. 54 Academic interventions, such as those focused on research literacy, may additionally be helpful. 55 Yet research is very limited, and interventions (co)developed or adapted for the PGR context would be beneficial. Another key practice implication is for institutions to consider the adequacy of their supervisor training, and how this does (or does not) help to foster agency and communion in relationships with PGRs. It seems likely that supervisory practices could exacerbate loneliness and perfectionist-type beliefs; for example, supervisors may themselves be isolated and unable to help connect PGRs to peers, and they may inadvertently reinforce PGRs' sense of failure and impostor thoughts through modelling and critical communication. Therefore, research and training initiatives should both consider how best to support supervisors, and in doing so, consider how supervisors can help to reduce PGR loneliness and perfectionism, alongside fostering a sense of communion and agency in the supervisory relationship.",

Being younger, female and more years of PhD study predicted greater symptoms. However, the strongest and most consistent associations were with psychological, social and relational factors. In particular, greater impostor thoughts, perceived failure to meet one's own standards, greater loneliness, and reduced sense of communion in the supervisory relationship predicted greater depression, anxiety and suicidality. The identified predictors of mental health symptoms among PGRs encompass risk factors relevant to mental health problems in other students and the general population (including perfectionistic thoughts and loneliness) and factors more unique to the PhD study environment (including supervisory relationships). Institutions are encouraged to consider the systemic practices that exacerbate loneliness and encourage self-criticism among PGRs. Institutions are urged to evaluate and improve the provision of supervisor training and support to foster positive supervisory relationships. Institutions must additionally ensure adequate provision of accessible psychological therapies for PGRs. More research is needed to identify the most effective, context-appropriate and sustainable interventions for reducing loneliness and improving the mental health of PGRs.",
