Starting from June 2020, the Directorate of Health and Hygiene returned near to average pre-COVID-19 volumes for medical procedures even if the pandemic condition imposed a new agenda with increased time between appointments to allow disinfection procedures. When comparing with other countries, our results look promising; in fact, recent studies have shown that, after the lockdown of the initial period, a stable decrease in medical procedures could be found due to delays in restoring pre-COVID schedules and to patients' fear of contracting the infection at the hospital [16] [17] [18] .",

            "text": "According to our analysis of the volume of specialty consultations, the number of visits performed during 2020 in the Directorate of Health and Hygiene decreased for nearly all specialties compared to 2019. The most affected specialty was occupational medicine; the decrease may be explained by the temporary suspension of hiring procedures in 2020 in the Vatican City State in addition to the rescheduling of most employees' annual health checkups. Occupational medicine was followed by dermatology, general surgery and ophthalmology, for which in-office appointments were mostly rescheduled. These findings are in line with reports from healthcare systems of other countries, where COVID-19 pandemic seriously impacted specialty consultations, leading to concerns regarding the impact of these changes on non-COVID chronic or acute conditions and screening procedures with potential consequences on patients' life [16] [17] [18] [19] . Diversely, the number of legal medicine, angiology and psychiatry consultations increased in 2020. Legal medicine, the specialty that deals with the application of medical knowledge to legal proceedings, in the Vatican City State is also in charge of authorizing and verifying employees' absences. This branch showed a growth of 1628 procedures compared to the previous year; the increase can be explained by the high number of employees reporting symptoms or close contacts with positive cases that prevented them from going to work and required legal medicine evaluation to authorize their absence and their return to work. The increase in psychiatric consultationsalthough potentially influenced by the limited number of total consultationsmay reflect the impact of the pandemic on mental health and well-being of patients, including effects on people already living with mental health condition and new onset triggered by restrictions and uncertain future, leading to increased demand for psychological support, as also reported in the literature [20] . This is the first study to publish data on the volume and type of medical activities of the Directorate of Health and Hygiene of the Governorate of the Vatican City State during the pandemic and provides a first step in assessing the indirect impact of COVID-19 on the State's healthcare services. Future studies to assess healthcare outcomes related to foregone care, such as an increase in rates of chronic disease, are necessary to evaluate the long-term effects of the adopted measures.",
