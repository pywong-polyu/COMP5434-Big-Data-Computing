Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, the reversible sulfur oxidation process in AlCl 3 /carbamide ionic liquid, where sulfur is electrochemically oxidized by AlCl 4 \u2212 to form AlSCl 7 . The sulfur oxidation is: 1) highly reversible with an efficiency of~94%; and 2) workable within a wide range of high potentials. As a result, the Al\u2212S battery based on sulfur oxidation can be cycled steadily around~1.8 V, which is the highest operation voltage in Al\u2212S batteries. The study of sulfur oxidation process benefits the understanding of sulfur chemistry and provides a valuable inspiration for the design of other high-voltage metal\u2212sulfur batteries, not limited to Al\u2212S configurations.",

Sulfur is normally coupled with metal anodes and is electrochemically reduced with metal cations to form metal sulfides 7, 8 . Despite high specific capacities based on sulfur reduction, the reverse oxidation of these sulfides back to sulfur needs to overcome a high energy barrier 9,10 , leading to a large overpotential and poor reversibility. Additionally, the reduction of sulfur occurs at low electrochemical potential (~\u22121.0 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, Fig. S1 ), and results in low operation voltage of metal-sulfur batteries 5, 6 . For example, Al-S batteries based on sulfur reduction usually demonstrate ultralow cell voltage of about~0.5 V 11, 12 . Therefore, the limited reversibility and low electrochemical potentials are the main obstacles for the practical use of sulfur electrodes.",

However, these prior attempts failed to basically address the low-voltage concerns of metal-sulfur batteries because the cell voltage is determined by the redox pathway of sulfur but these efforts did not alter the sulfur reduction path. Therefore, the batteries based on the sulfur reduction remain far from satisfactory for the high-voltage applications [5] [6] [7] [8] [16] [17] [18] . It is highly important to examine new redox pathways of sulfur to achieve viable applications of metal-sulfur batteries.

Unfortunately, the oxidation process of sulfur has been rarely studied. Due to the inert nature of sulfur, a high voltage needs to be applied to drive its electrochemical oxidation. This is normally accompanied by electrolyte decomposition, leading to a poor reversibility [21] [22] [23] . Meanwhile, the electrochemical oxidation of sulfur undergoes an electron-loss process involved with anions. The common anions in metal-sulfur batteries such as bis (trifluoromethyl) sulfonate, hexafluorophosphate are weak oxidants, which are not able to oxidize sulfur into high-valence sulfur compounds 24, 25 . Therefore, anions with strong oxidizing power in an electrochemically stable electrolyte are necessary to oxidize sulfur in a highly reversible manner, but this concept has not been explored yet.",

The AlCl 4 \u2212 anions can oxidize sulfur to form aluminium sulfide chloride (AlSCl 7 ), which can be reversibly reduced back to sulfur with a high efficiency of~94%. This oxidation-reduction process is workable within a wide range of high electrochemical potentials. Benefiting from the high reversibility and high electrochemical potential, the Al-S battery can run steadily over 200 cycles around~1.8 V, which is the highest operation voltage in Al-S batteries reported so far. By sharp contrast, the previously studied Al-S battery based on sulfur reduction can only run tens of cycles with a much lower operation voltage of~0.5 V. This work sheds new light on the understanding of sulfur chemistry and presents sulfur oxidation as a new pathway to achieve the high-voltage applications of metal-sulfur batteries.",

            "text": "Evolution of AlSCl 7 during electrochemical sulfur oxidation. AlSCl 7 is an ionic crystal with SCl 3 + cations and AlCl 4 \u2212 anions 26 . AlCl 3 /carbamide ionic liquid contains AlCl 4 \u2212 , Al 2 Cl 7 \u2212 anions, and [AlCl 2 (carbamide) n ] + cations 27, 28 . Al anode demonstrates high reversibility and stable electrochemical potential in AlCl 4 \u2212 and Al 2 Cl 7 \u2212 containing electrolyte, and therefore Al anode is used as the reference electrode in this work [29] [30] [31] [32] . Figure 1a shows the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curve for sulfur/carbon nanotube (S/CNT) composite cathode with 10 wt.% polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder in AlCl 3 /carbamide electrolyte (Fig. S2 ). It should be noted that sulfur is not stable under high oxidation voltage in the commonly used AlCl 3 /1-ethyl-3methylimidazolium chloride electrolyte (Fig. S3 ). The sulfur content in S/CNT is 20 wt.% and the molar ratio of AlCl 3 to carbamide is 1.3:1 (details in the \"Methods\" section). The observed current densities in Fig. 1a are above~2.0 V and below 1.0 V, corresponding to the electrochemical oxidation and reduction of sulfur, respectively. Figure 1b summarizes the electrochemical potentials of different materials, and the potential of sulfur oxidation in this work is much higher than most of the previously reported materials (Table S1) 11, 12 . Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves are compared to demonstrate the overall process of sulfur oxidation and reduction. The electrochemical oxidation from sulfur to AlSCl 7 starts from~2.0 V, and the reverse reduction from AlSCl 7 to sulfur occurs at~1.8 V (Fig. 1c) . For the sulfur reduction (Fig. 1d) , sulfur starts to be reduced to sulfides below~1.0 V. The electrochemical potential of sulfur oxidation is much higher than that of reduction. The potential difference is clearly seen in the galvanostatic charge-discharge curves. The sulfur oxidation presents obviously high discharge voltage plateau of~1.8 V (Fig. 1e) . However, the reduction of sulfur only shows a much lower operation voltage of~0.5 V (Fig. 1f) . To detect the phase evolution during the oxidation and reduction process, we carried out the in situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) upon charge and discharge (Fig. 1g, h) . The elemental sulfur, Al 2 S 3 , and AlSCl 7 are orthorhombic, hexagonal, and monoclinic crystals with space groups of Fddd, P6 1 , and Pc, respectively (Fig. S4 ). During sulfur oxidation process, the orthorhombic sulfur transforms to the monoclinic AlSCl 7 , while during reduction process, sulfur is reduced to hexagonal Al 2 S 3 . Specifically, for sulfur oxidation process (Fig. 1g) , the peaks assigned to the (102), (013), and (110) facets of AlSCl 7 sequentially appear when the Al-S battery is charged to 2.4 V. For the reverse process from AlSCl 7 to sulfur, those peaks assigned to AlSCl 7 gradually disappear, and only the characteristic peaks of sulfur remain. It should be noted that the diffraction peak at 10.8\u00b0is assigned to the characteristic peak of sulfur and it remains during charge-discharge due to the incomplete electrochemical oxidation of sulfur. The above evidence confirms the efficient electrochemical oxidation of sulfur to AlSCl 7 , and the reversibility from AlSCl 7 back to sulfur. During sulfur reduction process (Fig. 1h) , the (011) and (016) diffraction peaks of Al 2 S 3 appear at 8.5 o and 16.6 o , respectively. For the reverse charge process, these peaks gradually disappear due to the conversion of Al 2 S 3 to sulfur. However, the (100) and (016) characteristic peaks of Al 2 S 3 can be also found during the charge process, which is due to the difficulty of reversible decomposition of Al 2 S 3 to sulfur. Both AlSCl 7 and Al 2 S 3 are also verified by the XRD plots at different cut-off voltages (Fig. S5) . The above evidence confirms sulfur oxidation and reduction chemistry, which is based on the AlSCl 7 and Al 2 S 3 products, respectively.",

The details for determination of the Gibbs free energy are specified in the \"Theoretical computations\" part.

Meanwhile, Al 2 Cl 7 \u2212 is reduced into AlCl 4 \u2212 with Al plated on Al anode. The change in the Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) can be calculated by using the electron-transfer numbers (n) and the difference in the electrochemical potential (\u0394U). With single-electron transfer, the difference in \u0394G between cathode and anode is the operation voltage 33 .

However, the energy barrier from Al 2 S 3 to S is as high as 3.98 eV (blues lines in Fig. 3b ). This comparison suggests the ease of reverse conversion from AlSCl 7 to S and therefore better reversibility of the sulfur oxidation-reduction process. Figure 3c , d schematically compares the sulfur oxidation and reduction process. The AlCl 4 \u2212 and Al 2 Cl 7 \u2212 anions serve, respectively, as the oxidizing and reducing agents reacting with sulfur, and Al anode is used as referenced electrode to pair with these redox reactions for charge balance.",

We combined synchrotron-based near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and in situ Raman spectra to identify the reaction intermediates during the sulfur oxidation process. As shown in the S K-edge NEXAFS spectra (Fig. 4a) , the characteristic peak of sulfur located at~2472 eV presents an obvious positive shift with higher voltage from open circuit potential (OCP) to 2.4 V. The shifted peak position of oxidation products from 2.2 to 2.4 V is nicely located between the peaks of 0-valence and +6-valence sulfur as compared to the reference samples of elemental sulfur, N 2 S 2 O 3 , and Li 2 SO 4 . This suggests the efficient oxidation of sulfur to higher valence at high voltages 34 . The positive shift of Cl characteristic peak is also identified from the Cl L-edge spectra at~201.3 eV (Fig. 4b) . This is attributed to the formation of S-Cl bonds in AlSCl 7 . The electronegativity of S is stronger than Al, and therefore the photon energy of Cl atoms among Cl-S bonds is higher than those among Cl-Al bonds 35 . By contrast, there is no peak shift for Al characteristic peak because the chemical state of Al remains unchanged during the sulfur oxidation process (Fig. S10) . To quantify the sulfur valence during its oxidation, we carried out the XPS measurement at different oxidation voltages (Fig. 4c) . According to the S 2p XPS spectra, peaks located at 169.4 and~168.3 eV gradually appear between the +2 thiosulfate and +6 sulfate 36 . These doublets are assigned to the +4 sulfur, confirming the stable presence of AlSCl 7 oxidized products. To detect the oxidation intermediates, we further carried out in situ Raman spectra measurement (Fig. S11) 37 . As shown in Fig. 4d , Raman peaks located at~145,~210, and 462 cm \u22121 are assigned to sulfur (Fig. S12) 38 . During the charging process, the intensity of these peaks gradually weakens, indicating the conversion from sulfur to AlSCl 7 . For the reverse process, these Raman peaks of sulfur reappear, which is a strong evidence of the high reversibility of sulfur oxidation. Notably, a new peak located at 530 cm \u22121 emerges (Fig. 4e) , which is attributed to the vibration of SCl 3 + cations 39 . These cations are soluble in the electrolyte, which may trap into separator and shuttle to Al anode. Therefore, the sulfur valence and reversibility are well characterized by spectroscopic analysis. AlSCl 7 tends to decompose to AlCl 4 \u2212 and SCl 3 + intermediates, leading to the loss of sulfur during electrochemical cycling.",

            "text": "High-voltage Al-S batteries based on sulfur oxidation. To demonstrate the possible application of sulfur oxidation, we assembled Al-S batteries based on the oxidation and reduction process and compared their operation voltages and cyclic stability. Al-S batteries were assembled with S/CNT cathode, Al referenced anode, AlCl 3 /carbamide ionic liquid, and a glass fiber separator using a 2032-coin cell type (more details in the \"Electrochemical tests\" section). The specific surface area of the cathode with 20 wt.% S in S/CNT composite is 154 m 2 g \u22121 (Fig. S13) . As shown in Fig. 5a , Al-S batteries based on the sulfur oxidation (AlSCl 7 product) run steadily over 200 cycles with a highest specific capacity of 225 mAh g \u22121 (Fig. S14) . Reversible redox reactions are defined as a pair of oxidation-reduction reactions with high reversibility. Coulombic efficiency (CE%) is a good parameter to describe the reversibility of electrochemical reactions on the electrodes in batteries. In this work, CE% is defined as the percentage ratio of the specific discharge capacity to the charge capacity. For Al-S batteries based on the sulfur oxidation, the CE% stabilizes as high as~94% upon cycling. This is ascribed to the efficient electrochemical oxidation of sulfur to AlSCl 7 and then highly reversible reduction from AlSCl 7 back to sulfur. However, it should be noted that the Al-S battery based on the sulfur oxidation also exhibits capacity decay upon long cycles. This is attributed to the gradual dissolution of SCl 3 + into the electrolyte (as evidenced by the in situ Raman spectra), leading to the loss of active sulfur (Figs. S15 and S16). Future work needs to be carried out to restrain the dissolution of SCl 3 + for more stable cycling performance. For the previously studied batteries based on sulfur reduction with Al 2 S 3 product, the sulfur cathode showed an ultrahigh specific capacity over 1000 mAh g \u22121 at the first cycle. However, it dramatically declined after tens of cycles due to the irreversibility (Fig. 5b) [40] [41] [42] . Figure 5c , d shows a comparison of the charge-discharge curves at different cycles. The Al-S battery based on the sulfur oxidation exhibits a high voltage of~1.8 V, and the voltage plateau remains stable during cycling. However, the Al-S batteries based on the sulfur reduction feature a much lower voltage of~0.5 V with severe voltage decline and capacity decay. Additionally, the Al-S battery based on the sulfur oxidation demonstrates high-rate performance. The sulfur cathode still has a high specific capacity of 120 and 95 mAh g \u22121 at 0.5 and 1 A g \u22121 , respectively (Fig. S17) . The Al-S battery maintains stable cycling at high current densities (Figs. S18 and S19). However, it is noteworthy that the specific capacity of sulfur decreases with higher sulfur contents and areal mass loadings (Figs. S20 and S21). Therefore, more attention should be paid in future on the design of sulfur host to improve the sulfur utilization with sulfur oxidation process. Despite the above advantages of Al-S batteries, we should also evaluate their pros and cons. The maximized energy density based on the active sulfur is estimated at~405 Wh kg \u22121 considering a specific capacity of 225 mAh g \u22121 with an average voltage plateau of~1.8 V at the beginning cycles. However, it should be noted that this value decreases upon battery cycling, and the energy density will be also compromised while considering the practical devices, including Al anode, electrolyte, separator, cell case, etc. Further work still needs to be carried out to optimize the energy density by improving the sulfur utilization and the areal mass loading of sulfur while decreasing the dosage of non-active parts. In addition, another advantage of Al-S battery is the low cost of electrode materials such as sulfur, Al, and the AlCl 3 /carbamide electrolyte ( Fig. S22 and Table S3 ). However, it should be also noted that the carbon nanotubes used in this work raise concerns about the cost-effectiveness. In the future works, it would be highly desirable to explore low-cost carbon or noncarbon hosts with lower cost and higher sulfur utilization.",

The electrochemical oxidation from sulfur to AlSCl 7 is highly reversible with a stable CE% of~94%, and the oxidation process is workable within a wide range of electrochemical potentials. As a result, the Al-S battery based on sulfur oxidation process can run steadily over 200 cycles around~1.8 V, which is the highest operation voltage for Al-S batteries.

By comparison, the oxidized product of sulfur at 2.4 V shows a periodic layered structure with (100), (102), and (30 6) planes in the FFT patterns. The observation of (102) plane corresponds well with the in situ XRD patterns. The ordered atom distribution can be clearly identified inFig. 2e.
