            "text": "Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the risk of mortality during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) episodes, and some reports have underlined the high incidence and severity of this infection in dialysis patients. Information on COVID-19 in nondialysis CKD patients is not available yet. Case Reports: Here we present 7 patients with grade 4-5 CKD who developed symptomatic COVID-19; they comprise 2.6% of our 267 advanced CKD patients. The estimated GFR was between 12 and 20 mL/min during the month prior to COVID-19. The 3 major symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, and 5 patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and steroids were the most frequently prescribed drugs. Two patients needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation. All patients showed minimal to moderate kidney function deterioration during admission, with an eGFR decline below 5 mL/min in 6 cases. No patient required acute dialysis. Six patients were discharged alive and remained dialysis free athe t the time of reporting, and one 76-year-old patient died. Conclusions: COVID-19 affects grade 4-5 CKD patients, but prognosis may be acceptable if prompt supportive measures are applied. These findings should be confirmed in larger cohorts, and further observations will be needed to understand the full spectrum of clinical features and the optimal approach to COVID-19 in patients with advanced CKD.",

The reported fatality rate in the general population with COVID-19 admitted to a large tertiary Spanish hospital was 20.7%, with 34% in the subgroup aged 70-79 years [2] . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have several conditions that make them a target population for the virus, i.e., an older age, comorbidities, and a frail immunological system. There is scarce information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on renal patients. In descriptive studies in Spain that have included more than 20,000 people, CKD in COVID-19 patients has been found to be directly related to mortality [3] . Patients on hemodialysis attending treatment centers have a high risk of acquiring the infection [4, 5] and our group early designed a protocol to limit the spread of the infection in dialysis facilities [6] .",

Only 1 of those patients died, and the majority were cured and discharged safely. The symptoms upon admission were those currently described for this entity. Fever was the most common, followed by cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. Chest x-ray findings showed pneumonia in 6 cases, with bilateral lung involvement in 5 of them, in agreement with many other studies [2, 7, 8] . Interestingly, as previously noted in hemodialysis patients in a short series [9] , 2 patients did not present respiratory symptoms but showed a gastrointestinal pattern, with nausea and diarrhea as the presenting features. These patients showed a favorable evolution. Acute kidney injury superimposed to CKD was frequent but mild in these patients; all patients showed minimal kidney function deterioration during admission, but the estimated GFR decline was lower than 5 ml/min in most cases and none required acute dialysis. As a result, some of these patients showed lymphopenia, and in fact the lowest lymphocyte count was noted in the patient who died. Other laboratory findings such as high levels of C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, and procalcitonin were seen in some patients but without a clear pattern associated to severity. No effective treatment is available for COVID-19, but most of our patients received combinations of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. It is not possible to establish any therapeutic advantage for any of those treatments.",
