Public health measures had different intensities across European countries but all had significant impact on people's daily lives and economic activities, causing a drop of CO2 emissions of about 10% for the whole year 2020. Here, we analyze changes in natural gas use in the industry and built environment sectors during the first half of year 2020 with daily gas flows data from pipeline and storage facilities in Europe. We find that reductions of industrial gas use reflect decreases in industrial production across most countries.",

The share of this fossil fuel in the energy mix has been growing since 1990 at the expense of oil and coal, as it is viewed as a cleaner source of energy. The main sectors using natural gas are the built environment (residential, public and commercial buildings), the industry, and the electricity production. In addition to steadily growing natural gas use, the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted economic activities and the energy demand, beginning in early March of 2020. Specifically, the government policies restricted mobility and confined people at home during \"lockdowns,\" and reduced or closed industrial and nonessential commercial activities, with impacts on gas use and pertaining CO2 emissions.",

For both residential and commercial buildings, gas consumption is typically inversely proportional to daily air temperature when temperatures fall below a comfort threshold \"critical temperature\". Therefore, the lockdowns occurred during a decreasing trend of the heating demand, as temperatures increased from winter to spring. One interesting research question is to quantify and understand the sign and magnitude of natural gas consumption changes, given the opposing effects of people's confinement in households (likely more gas use), the closure of commercial and public buildings (likely less gas use) and the industry temporary shut-down (likely less gas use). Given different national characteristics and different reductions of industrial activities between European countries during lockdowns, a second interesting question is how industrial gas use was affected in 2020. Natural gas use variations in the power sector have been addressed by refs. ( 3, 4 ) and will not be discussed here.",

Overall, across all fuels and sectors, the reduction in socio-economic activities due the pandemic caused a strong decrease of CO2 emissions in Europe, and the globe. Two recent estimates of the reduction of CO2 emissions during 2020 have been produced, using activity data, by refs. (5, 6) . In both studies, CO 2 emissions from the built environment were the most poorly constrained of all sectors because no direct activity data was available to estimate them. Lacking natural gas consumption data for buildings, Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. made the simple assumption that buildings emissions were reduced in every country according to observed residential use of electricity in the United Kingdom under different levels of confinements. Furthermore, the focus of their study was to estimate the fraction of emissions reductions attributable to COVID-19, not the total emission changes due to COVID-19 and other factors. The contribution of climate factors was thus ignored, even though climate and weather variations strongly influence the heating demand and emissions from gas. In contrast, Liu et al. (2020) estimated daily residential CO2 emissions changes during 2020 by assuming that only climate variables were influential. They used daily air temperature data from ERA5 7 with pre-established temperature functions from ref. ( 8 ) to calculate daily residential emissions in 2020, disaggregating annual baseline emissions from the EDGAR database 9 to daily residential emissions with population-weighted heating degree days in each country.",

In addition, we collected specific natural gas use data for the city of Paris (Methods).

Paris is an easy case with the same temperature exposure and rather homogeneous housing types, dominated by collective buildings equipped with centralized gas heaters. Figure 1 illustrates the relative impact of temperature anomalies and lockdown measures. We then analysed daily gas supply data at national scale (Methods) for eight countries that provided separate estimates for different sectors. Compared to the Paris case, one additional difficulty is the definition of a temperature that is representative for each country. For this, we used the ERA-5 re-analysis 7 and calculated a population-weighted average of air temperature over each country's area, accounting for a temporal-lag impact of temperature: the consumption is not only dependent on the temperature of the day, but also to that of the previous days (a building has some heat capacity). Namely, we computed an effective temperature based on the temperature at days D-2, D-1 and D-0, with respective weights 0.55, 0.30 and 0.15, which offers the best correlation between effective temperature and gas consumption.",

Examples of this behaviour are shown on Figure 2 for the industry and the buildings sectors in France. For the buildings sector, it is interesting to see in Figure 2 that the consumption during week days is larger than during weekends (Table 1 ). There is little difference on slope of the T-consumption relationship for France, but the component independent of the temperature is very significantly different between week-days and weekends. This is counter-intuitive as one could expect a larger residential consumption during the weekend when people spend more time at home. A likely explanation is that the distribution data include commercial and public administration buildings that are closed during Saturdays and Sundays. The weekday-weekend difference is rather small for Germany, but goes up to \u224850% for France ( Table 1 ). The industry sector shows a number of \"low\" outliers for France in Figure 2 , most of which are for 2020 and they all occur during the lockdown period, according to Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker data 10 (OxCGRT). Similar negative outliers are observed for the industry in Italy and Spain, but Poland, Germany and UK show positive outliers in the first half of 2020 ( Fig S1) . On the basis of these figures, we devised piecewise linear models to describe the consumptiontemperature relationships. The models were fitted against 2016-2019 daily data points with three parameters: Tcrit, the base gas consumption for temperature above Tcrit, and the slope of the linear relationship between temperature and gas consumption for temperatures below T crit.",

The temperature-dependant sensitivity varies between 0.16 and 0.39 m 3 cap -1 day -1 deg -1 , again with Poland outside of this range. Poland appears to be an outlier because it has a smaller share of dwellings and population using gas as a heating source ; Gas represents only 7% of the heating consumption in terms of final energy use in Poland, against 41% for coal, 20% for biomass and 29% of district heat 11 .

The country with the largest per capita gas heated floor area is the Netherlands, and the smallest is Poland. The strong correlation shown in Figure 3 implies that the temperature sensitivity of natural gas use per capita depends primarily on the heated floor area per capita, in other words that country differences in insulation for gas heated buildings are of secondary importance. Using detailed subnational data at city or district level instead of national data as in this study, may reveal that other factors control the temperature sensitivity of gas consumption, like the types of building (collective vs. individual) and their insulation characteristics / energy efficiency which generally decrease with building age. It is also possible that other meteorological variables such as humidity, surface radiation, and sunshine duration play an additional role in determining the amount of natural gas use in the distribution sector.",

The winter 2019-2020 has been exceptionally mild over Europe, with a warming anomaly of \u2248 1\u00b0C from December to March, compared to the climatology of our study period 7 . At the beginning of lockdowns however, between mid-to-late March and early-April, a succession of colder than normal weather events occurred, bringing cold spells over western Europe. When removing the effect of these cold spells using the piecewise linear models described above, we display in Figure 4 the relative changes of buildings' gas consumption in France that are not explained by temperature during the lockdown period (March 1 st to June 1 st ) compared to the pre-lockdown period (January 15 th to March 1 st ). In Italy, France, Belgium, Germany and Poland, we found a relative reduction, larger than one standard deviation of variations between the two periods during other years. On the other hand, in the UK and the Netherlands, there is a small relative increase during the lockdown periods as compared to the pre-lockdown reference period, but this change remains within the one standard deviation of other years. This difference might be explained by the large share of houses heated by natural gas in UK and Netherlands, and by less stringent lock-down measures that allowed a fraction of people to continue to remain in workplaces. This result indicates that despite nearly all the population being confined at home all day long in Spain, Italy and France, and the strong mobility reduction, e.g. by 75% in France 12 , the natural gas consumption rather decreased than increased. This may be due to some houses being empty compensating for other full households, and to closed commercial and public buildings with reduced or no heating.",

Regressions with Google mobility data were also weak, but and they show the same negative correlation sign than with OxCGRT data. These generally negative correlations suggest that overall, empty commercial and administrative buildings accounted a drop of gas consumption larger than any increase from fully occupied households.

For the 8 countries considered, daily gas deliveries in kWh/day were downloaded from the ENTSO-G platform 16 for the period of 1-1-2016 to the latest available data. For most countries, the gas data was separated between distribution and final consumers, the latter one typically representing industry and power plants. For Belgium, final consumption was further divided in industrial use and power plants. For Germany, the data available on the ENTSO-G platform appeared to be incomplete. For this reason, daily gas consumption data was downloaded from online portals of GASPOOL (2020) and NetConnect Germany (NCG, 2020), the two main consortia of transmission system operators in Germany, and used instead of the ENTSO-G data. Since CO2 emissions are highly correlated with the energy content of the gas, no further conversion was necessary. The so-called distribution sector in ENSTO-G corresponds to the consumption of gas in the built environment as a whole, and dominates the total gas consumption in each country. The data did not separate commercial, public and residential private buildings. For this sector, gas is mainly used for space heating and secondarily for cooking and hot water production. The distribution sector therefore shows a strong seasonal cycle with a peak consumption in winter, and fluctuations that relate to temperature anomalies. The power sector gas consumption shows very large variations linked to the total electricity demand, the weather-driven supply of solar and wind renewable electricity, the availability of nuclear, the relative distribution between coal, oil and gas that depends on market prices and climate policies. It is difficult to identify the impact of lockdown measures on gas consumption time series for the power sector, given the combined effects from other sources of electricity. The power sector is therefore excluded from our analysis. Additionally, we obtained daily consumption data for the City of Paris, (administrative jurisdiction, 2.18 million people 17 ) based on local pipeline flows. Since there is almost no industry in the jurisdiction of Paris, all the use of natural gas can be assumed to come primarily from the residential sector.",
