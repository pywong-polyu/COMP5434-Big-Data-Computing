Inflammation has been shown to cause the escape of serum albumin into the interstitial space due to increased capillary permeability, and eventually lead to increased volume distribution of albumin. 2 Interleukin 6 (IL-6) contributes to vascular hyperpermeability, leakiness, hypotension, and pulmonary dysfunction. 3 The study could not correlate the magnitude and the rate of albumin change with inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or IL-6 which were not consistently available over the course of admission. 1 This means that the study could not make a conclusion that the albumin decline of 0.9 g/dL or greater within 5 days of admission was solely due to COVID-19-induced inflammatory state. Correlating the albumin level with CRP and IL-6 would have helped to rule out the effect of comorbidities and confounders which might have affected albumin levels.",
