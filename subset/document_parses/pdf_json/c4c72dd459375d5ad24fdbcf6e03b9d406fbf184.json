We report the changing epidemiology of travel-related illnesses over a 12-year period. Methods: A single site GeoSentinel surveillance analysis was undertaken for 3460 ill returned travellers presenting to two public hospitals in Marseille, France from March 2003 to October 2015, with travel-related illnesses. Demographic characteristics, travel history, presenting symptoms and information on pre-travel consultations were collected. Results: There was a predominance of travel to sub-Saharan Africa, in particular to Comoros archipelago. Tourism was the main reason for travel (1591/3460, 46%), followed by visiting friends or relatives (VFR) (895/3460, 26%), with a mean duration of 29 days; 35% (1212/3460) of travellers reported a pre-travel health consultation. The most common syndromic diagnoses were febrile systemic illness (1343, 39%), dermatologic (716, 21%), gastrointestinal (340, 10%) and respiratory/ear-nose-throat (331, ENT) (10%). Hospitalization rates were highest amongst travellers from sub-Saharan Africa (858/ 1632, 53%), and VFR (573/ 895, 64%, P < 0.001). Frequent diagnoses included malaria (797, 23%), dengue (96, 2.77%) and chikungunya (75, 2.17%), reflecting global trends. Comparison of two periods (2003-10 to 2011-15) demonstrated an increase in chikungunya and decrease in malaria and influenza-like illness. We report an increase in ill travellers from the Caribbean, Middle East and South-East Asia.

Similar rates in terms of sex, median age, travel duration and predominance for tourism as the reason of travel are reported. 6, 7 However, our results are characterized by the predominance of travellers returning from Africa, in comparison to Asia in a previous global GeoSentinel study. 4 This can be explained by the local demographics in Marseille, particularly related to the migrant African population. Marseille is historically associated with Comoros migrants, with a large Comorosoriginated population estimated at 50 000-70 000 in early 2000s, although more recent figures are unknown. 3 This results in differences of traveller characteristics in comparison to other GeoSentinel sites, notably higher rates of VFRs, more frequent hospitalizations and low levels of pre-travel consultations. We report a disproportionately high rate of hospitalizations in patients from sub-Saharan Africa and amongst VFRs. This highlights the need to target our travel health prevention messages towards VFRs, a sub-group with known barriers to accessing pre-travel health advice. 8, 9 The African migrant population in Marseille may have specific barriers to pre-travel consultations, including financial constraints for malaria prophylaxis and lack of information. Potential strategies include primary care physicians routinely questioning immigrant patients about future travel plans. 8 Sentinel surveillance amongst travellers can be used to collect important epidemiological and virological information to alert international authorities to the changing epidemiology of infections, especially in countries with limited active public health surveillance. 10, 11 This is demonstrated by the decline of malaria in the Comoros. We confirm that P. falciparum malaria remains the most frequent cause of febrile illness in international travellers returning to Marseille, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. This is similar to both global studies 4 and previous local studies in Marseille from 1999 to 2003. 12 An overall decreasing trend in the number of monthly malaria cases can be noted from 2007 to 2015 (Figure 3 ). This is consistent with a global general decreasing trend since 2000. 4 However, in our study, the sudden drop in 2011 is most likely due to a decrease in the numbers of cases acquired in the Comoros archipelago ( Figure 3) ; decomposition of monthly non-Comoros malaria cases demonstrated a gradual decreasing trend in comparison to the sudden drop of cases in Comoros travellers from 2011. This is in line with local malaria surveillance data demonstrating a major decline in malaria morbidity and mortality in the Union of Comoros between 2010 and 2014, which is attributed to malaria prevention and control interventions. 13 This is an example of a local single site analysis in Marseille providing accurate sentinel surveillance information for malaria epidemiology in Comoros. Alongside sentinel analysis for diagnosis, important information on rates of malarial drug resistance can also be collected from travellers. 14 Our results highlight VFRs as disproportionately at risk for malaria, which corroborates recent French national data and from a London tropical hospital. 15, 16 Other at risk groups in our series were business travellers and military personnel, as previously observed. [17] [18] [19] Other examples of the use of travellers as sentinels for public health surveillance includes the identification of dengue outbreaks (1) Echinococcosis (5) Dermatological Lyme disease (7) Tungasis (1) Herpes simplex infection (7) Chikenpox ( (1) Wide range of symptoms Leptospirosis (9) Q fever (8) Melioidosis (1) Toxocara infection (7) Toxoplasmosis (1) Trichinellosis (1) (26.53) in Luanda and Dar es Salaam 11 and for the Indian Ocean and West Africa. 20, 21 Due to a large number of our patients returning from Africa, travellers returning to Marseille may be useful sentinels for future arboviral African outbreaks. Rapid testing for dengue is essential in patients presenting with a fever from Africa. Similarly, the geographical profile and number of travellers presenting with chikungunya in Marseille (Table 3 and Figure 1B ) is a reflection of increasing global expansion, providing further examples of vital sentinel surveillance in travellers. 22, 23 As our survey ended in October 2015, we only report one case of Zika virus; however, this is now an important differential amongst febrile travellers. 24 Marseille may be a vital sentinel site to document possible Zika epidemics on the African continent. 25 Public health surveillance of these arboviral infections are of particular interest in the Mediterranean region, due to the local emergence of arthropod-borne diseases given the presence of the Aedes albopictus vector in the Mediterranean region and risk of autochthonous transmission, particularly around hospitals. 26 Arthropod-borne diseases accounted for 68% of the top 20 diagnoses. Dengue was the second most common diagnosis during our study period, with 35% of patients from Asia, consistently with global data. 4,7 Furthermore, we report a significant increase in chikungunya cases between the two periods. This high rate of imported arboviral diseases is likely to increase, given the trend of increasing numbers of unwell travellers returning from the Caribbean and South East Asia. This indicates the need for improved prevention strategies, both before travel, by reinforcing pre-travel advice toward prevention of insect bites and malaria chemoprophylaxis, and after, with improved epidemiological surveillance and healthcare professional training. Pre-and post-travel advice should also include advice on reducing respiratory transmission (such as local emergence of multiresistant tuberculosis or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus), and improved hygiene practices to reduce nosocomial transmission of multi-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, improved diagnostic tools after travel, such as multiplex PCR, may help increase the number of etiological diagnoses amongst syndromic diarrhoeal and respiratory illnesses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 328, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 329, "end": 330, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 489, "end": 490, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 796, "end": 797, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1277, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1279, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1583, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1856, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1857, "end": 1859, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2141, "end": 2142, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2202, "end": 2204, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2386, "end": 2387, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2942, "end": 2944, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3240, "end": 3242, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3401, "end": 3403, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3512, "end": 3516, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3517, "end": 3521, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3522, "end": 3526, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3901, "end": 3908, "text": "(26.53)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3982, "end": 3985, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3986, "end": 3988, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 4483, "end": 4486, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 4487, "end": 4489, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 4641, "end": 4643, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4745, "end": 4747, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 5065, "end": 5067, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2303, "end": 2312, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2530, "end": 2539, "text": "Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 4337, "end": 4345, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 4350, "end": 4359, "text": "Figure 1B", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another specificity of Marseille are the large numbers of Muslim Hajj pilgrims each year returning from Mecca. 27 We demonstrate the increasing trend of travellers returning from the Middle East, demonstrating the importance of Marseille as a sentinel surveillance site to the Middle East.

We house the national reference centre for rickettsioses, and so provide an opportunity to document high risk geographic areas for these emerging, underestimated infections. 29 Similarly, the centre for rabies vaccination is situated in Marseille, providing sentinel surveillance on patients seeking rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. We highlight the potential for rabid animal exposure in travellers, notably in Asia and the need to reinforce pre-exposure prophylaxis. 30 Previous studies local to Marseille have used a prospective cohort design, providing a denominator, amongst Hajj pilgrims 31 and travellers to Senegal. 32 This approach allows an estimation of risk of travel-associated diseases, including mild self-limiting conditions but is biased by traveller selection. Here, we use a different approach that describes the spectrum of diseases in patients returning from any foreign destinations and being referred to a specialized structure. Limitations include an important recruitment bias, with an underestimate of self-limiting conditions, a lack of denominator and disease prevalence estimates. However, it captures more severe and uncommon travel-related illnesses and provides vital sentinel information on the changing epidemiology of infectious diseases across the globe, most notably for dengue and chikungunya, as well as identifying less common infectious disease outbreaks in the tropics where laboratory facilities may be limited. 33 In conclusion, we demonstrate the need to understand the local population and corresponding travel risks, particular amongst those visiting friends and relatives who have higher hospitalization rates post-travel.
