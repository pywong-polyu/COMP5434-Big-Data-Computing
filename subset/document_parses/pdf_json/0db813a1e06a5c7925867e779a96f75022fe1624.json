            "text": "There is growing diversity within the Black population in the U.S., but limited understanding of ethnic and nativity differences in the mental health treatment needs of Black women. This study examined differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, their persistence, and unmet treatment needs among Black women in the U.S. Data were from the National Survey of American Life, a nationally representative survey that assessed lifetime and twelve-month mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, and mental health service use among those meeting disorder criteria. One in three African American women met criteria for a lifetime disorder, compared to one in three Caribbean women born within the U.S. and one in five Caribbean women born outside the U.S. About half of African American women with a lifetime disorder had a persistent psychiatric disorder, compared to two in five Caribbean women born within the U.S. and two in three Caribbean women born outside the U.S. African Americans had more persisting dysthymia and panic disorder and less persisting social phobia compared to foreign-born Caribbean women. Of the three groups, Caribbean women born within the U.S. were most likely to seek mental health treatment during their lifetime. These results demonstrate, despite a lower prevalence of psychiatric disorders in Black women, that there is a great likelihood their disorders will be marked by persistence and underscores the need for culturally specific treatment approaches. As Black immigrants in the United States are increasing in number, adequate mental health services are needed.",

Indeed, prior studies of the general population found that disorder prevalence is often lower in Black versus White populations, and when present these disorders are more severe, persisting in their course, and more often untreated [22, 34] . In one study of Black men's mental health from the NSAL, foreign-born Caribbean men were more likely than other Black men to have persisting anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia [35] . Thus, the sometimes-observed lower prevalence of disorders can mask the real burden of mental health disorders within the Black population.",

Research into the mental health of Black women is especially important at present when the Black Lives Matter movement has called attention into the ways in which systemic racism weighs on Black women in the U.S., from increased interactions with the justice system for themselves and others in their households [37] to disparities in maternal mortality [38] . Understanding the history of the psychiatric disorder patterns experienced by diverse groups of Black women could help with developing culturally tailored solutions to improve women's mental health currently and provide cause for acceleration in addressing inequities in the field of mental health treatments going forward.",

The rates of persistence were generally comparable for the foreign-born Caribbean women and U.S.-born African American women. It was the U.S.-born Caribbean women who, except for panic attacks and drug dependence, stood out as having particularly low rates of persistence. Foreign-born Caribbean women had the highest rate of persisting social phobia. We might expect persistence to be lower among U.S.-born Caribbean Black women if they are differentially exposed to stressors commonly associated with mental illness or if there are differences in the amount, quality, or access to mental health treatment. Another possible explanation is that Caribbean Black women differentially weather stressors. One NSAL study found more social stressors to be associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms for African American women than for Caribbean Black women [31] . In our study, the U.S.-born Caribbean women generally had more favorable socioeconomic standing in terms of their education and household income compared to African American women, which could be another contributing factor to the differences in persistence we see [62] .",

            "text": "Two unique issues are raised by our findings of ethnic and nativity differences in persistence. First, it is assumed that the marginalized position of being Black in the U.S. will result in greater exposure to stressors often shown to be associated with worse mental health outcomes [63] [64] [65] . Yet there is something about the social patterning of race plus nativity that results in differences in mental health experience, as well as in seeking treatment. The advantage of household income and education may confer resources to better weather stresses and potentially results in fewer cumulative exposures. The U.S.-born Caribbean women may be unique from the other groups of Black women in their available resources or in the urgency or intensity of treatment when a mental health problem arises. Indeed, in the current study, U.S.-born Caribbean women had higher rates of lifetime mental health service use, even when compared to African American women. This raises a second point in need of further research, which is that differences in cultural socialization between being Black in the U.S. versus early socialization of mental health coping in the foreign-born Black woman. Additional research into mental health coping and other resources to weather stressors could inform the design of interventions to address unmet treatment needs within various groups of Black women in the U.S.",

These findings parallel those for Latino and Asian immigrants [66, 67] . Immigrants often face additional barriers to treatment due to residency status or concerns about bringing shame to their community [68] . A few studies have documented high rates of mental health stigma among Caribbean immigrants [69, 70] , which may contribute to their low rates of treatment seeking. Whether these barriers have a differential harmful impact on Caribbean women is unknown. Because untreated mental health disorders are so closely linked to cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders [71] [72] [73] [74] , failure to engage Caribbean women in evidence-based mental health treatment is likely to have cascading consequences for not only their emotional health, but for their physical health as well.",

Unfortunately, we do not know, and this is an area for further study.

Currently, the NSAL remains the only data set with enough cases within a representative population sample of Black racial and ethnic minority adults to conduct meaningful analyses on psychiatric disorders. Before the advent of the NSAL data set, reliable, nationally representative information on psychiatric disorders for Black women was scarce or relied on data that could be only abstracted from treatment settings [1] . In light of the historic scarcity of national probability-based data sets on Black mental health, the rising numbers of suicides in Black Americans, and the worsening of factors that contribute to mental health, as highlighted by COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter, the NSAL remains the best and most comprehensive data for the study of representative mental health in the Black female population of the U.S., despite its age.",

Critical to extending our findings would be larger subpopulation samples and assessment of migration characteristics (e.g., age, generational status) to further investigate the treatment and health service needs of different subpopulations of Black women. This is particularly important as ours and other studies have indicated significant differences in help-seeking patterns, perceived need for treatment, and stigma concerns of Caribbean women compared to U.S.-born African American women [27, 69] . Moreover, there has been a surge in African migration in recent years [11] , and the mental health service needs of African immigrants remain poorly understood from a population-based perspective [1] . As demonstrated in our study, failure to not separate Black women in terms of ethnicity and place of birth would obscure the true rates of perceived need and pathways of seeking treatment for U.S.-born African American women and fail to help us to identify those social and cultural conditions of immigrants adjusting to life in the U.S. that may put them at risk for psychiatric disorders [96] .",

Our result illustrate there was wide variation by ethnicity in the prevalence, course, and unmet treatment needs of their psychiatric disorders. As the U.S. continues to be the number one choice for a growing number of African and Caribbean women to live and raise their families, researchers and policymakers must attend to differences in this diversity that will allow us to target prevention efforts and mental health service planning to the specific needs of these Black subpopulations in the U.S. Results of this study help to underscore that despite being racially the same, variations in ethnicity and nativity result in distinctive vulnerabilities and mental health treatment needs.
