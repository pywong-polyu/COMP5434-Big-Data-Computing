Validated international serologic assays for the detection of different anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are essential to obtain information on the kinetics of the antibody response in infected and vaccinated subjects [17] [18] [19] . However, the serological tests available on the international market differ in the type of chemistry used in the assay, in the class of antibodies detected and in the targeted antigen. A further complication is the lack of a clear interpretation of the results and the various cut-offs established by the manufacturers. For this reason, a new international standard unit of measurement named \"Binding Antibody Units\" (BAU/ ml) was introduced by the World Health Organization, with the aim of eliminating the discrepancies of the results and to improve the harmonization of data [20] .",

A median neutralization titer of 1:80 in paucisymptomatic and vaccinated groups, and a higher median neutralization titer in symptomatic cohort (1:160) was found using the SARS-CoV-2 original strain for both assays. As expected, a lower median neutralization titer was observed in paucisymptomatic and vaccinated subjects (1:40), using the British variant strain, whereas symptomatics have shown similar results (1:160), confirming a possible more heterogeneous immune response against different SARS-CoV-2 antigens in these patients. Since the vaccinated cohort median VNT titer was calculated combining first and second dose individuals, this group showed the same paucisymptomatic median VNT titer, despite the higher anti-RBD Abs levels. However, analyzing only vaccinated subjects after the second dose, the median VNT increased and was comparable to the median VNT of symptomatic patients. To note, the same trend and the same median neutralization titers were obtained on these cohorts of subjects in our recently published study with a surrogate assay [15] .",
