Due to the gravity of the pandemic, other areas of healthcare such as cancer diagnosis and treatment may be negatively impacted. The classical Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) of polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are pathologically related malignancies characterised by an expansion of mature haematopoietic cells, a propensity for thrombosis and haemorrhage, and the ability to transform into acute myeloid leukaemia. The most commonly acquired somatic mutation in these MPN is the JAK2 V617F, present in 95% of PV patients and in 50-60% of patients with ET and PMF [1] . An initial study in China found that patients with haematological malignancies had more severe COVID-19 and a higher fatality rate than a control group [2] . In order to assess any impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency of testing and JAK2 V617F positivity rate, an audit was performed by a referral centre for the molecular diagnostics of haematological malignancies.",

JAK2 V617F mutations were detected by an allele-specific PCR approach unchanged throughout the audit period with the laboratory continuing a \"business as usual\" approach. A reduction in both the number of requests (Fig. 1) This brief but informative audit describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the molecular diagnosis of MPN patients with a projected thirty patients not molecularly identified in the initial 15-week period of national COVID-19 restrictions. The reasons for this reduction in test requests are not immediately apparent though it cannot be attributed to a lack of an available service. Delays in the diagnosis of an MPN have previously been shown to result in an increase in potentially preventable thrombotic complications [3] . Followup of MPN patients with a potentially delayed diagnosis is planned. Data is beginning to emerge on the similar impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the molecular diagnosis of other cancers [4] . Hopefully, patient attendance and JAK2 V617F testing referral from regional haematology services is likely to improve in the forthcoming months with potential for the (albeit delayed) diagnosis of MPN enabling appropriate therapeutic intervention.",
