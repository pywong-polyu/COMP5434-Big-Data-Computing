            "text": "In recent years, obesity has become an epidemic in the United States, and globally it was three times as prevalent in the year 2016 compared to the 1970s [1] . There are 340 million children and adolescents aged between 5 and 19 years who are overweight or obese, and 41 million under 5 years of age are overweight or obese, worldwide [1] . As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the obesity prevalence in the United States was 42.4% in adults during the 2017 to 2018 period among adults, and 19 .3% (which is about 14.4 million) in children and adolescents [2, 3] . Obesity is a major risk factor for many primary causes of mortality, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, specific categories of cancers, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [4] . The development of obesity is caused by several factors, such as dietary, metabolic, environmental, and genetic. Such factors modify the gene expression related to obesity formation in children, adolescents, and adults [5] . Numerous data have revealed that body mass index (BMI) is strongly affected by genetic factors, with heritability [6] . The genetic contribution to obesity has been established through family, twin, and adoption studies. High heritability was shown in a twin study-between 40 and 77% [7] . Previous studies found single gene mutations causing obesity by involving different obesity-related pathways. Copy number variants (CNVs) are among of the under-studied genetic variations which can explain the heritability of obesity.",

CNV of DNA sequences from 270 individuals with four different populations was first identified in 1447 CNV regions [9] . A recent update from the Sangers Institute database shows more than 38,092 CNV from 36,000 patients [10] . Though CNVs are not directly caused by disease, there are several occurrences CNVs affecting critical developmental genes that cause disease. The distal CNVs of 16p11.2 determine the basal ganglia volume in developing neurodevelopmental disorders [11, 12] . An investigation of the deletion or duplication of 16p11.2 in eating behavior, cognitive traits, and BMI suggested that the satiety response in children is related to BMI. This was also observed in adults [13] .",

The combined analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and CNV conducted on European Americans (EA) and African Americans (AA) showed an association of BMI with only 16p12.3 CNV among the 84 previously identified CNV regions [15] . Genomic CNVs using Affymetrix genomewide human SNP array 6.0 showed a similar association between BMI and 16p12.3 in European and Chinese populations [16] . Previous studies on obesity-related CNVs and dietary behaviors among control and obese children showed that unusual copy numbers suggested genetic susceptibility to obesity [17] . Our previous study demonstrated that overweight/obese children expressed low salivary AMY1 CNV, and copy number inversely correlated with obesity, especially in AA children [18] .",

Previous studies showed that high BMI is correlated with olfactory dysfunction [21, 22] .

With the sample sizes, the assumption of a two-group t-test, and the prior assumptions, we had 80% power to detect effect sizes of 0.5 (d)-and greater for comparing pairs of the racial groups' weight-based groups-as statistically significant. An initial survey by phone or email was conducted with the parents of interested participants to discover the existence of major health problems, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or taking long-term medications, which were disqualifying for the study. The children were brought to Auburn University to participate, and written consent was collected from the parents and participants. Auburn University Institutional Review Board approval was obtained.",

The CNV grouped data showed normal distributions of age and height, and the other variables, including CNV, were non-normally distributed. The normally distributed sample's skewness falls within the liberal z-range of samples with 50-300 participants (\u00b13.29) [28, 29] . We analyzed a two-way ANOVA for age, height, BMI, weight, and CNV using CNV groups with other covariates-gender, race, and BMI category-as the grouping variables. The cross-tabulation and binary logistic regression analysis were performed with the respective covariates to analyze the proportional graphs data. The bar graphs were prepared with GraphPad Prism V 8.2.0, and a student t-test was used to measure the BMI z-score difference between the two groups.

In AA, there was a significant difference in the LCNV and HCNV proportions between OW/OB boys and girls. NW AA girls were significantly differently distributed in LCNV and HCNV groups (p = 0.013). In boys, the proportion of LCNV in OW/OB AA participants was significantly lower than in OW/OB EA participants (p = 0.017). A comparison of proportions between the LCNV and HCNV showed significantly more HCNV prevalence (p < 0.035) in OW/OB AA boys (33.33%) compared to low copy number variant prevalence (8.33%). AA girls in NW (11.43% vs. 37.14%) and OW/OB groups (16.67% vs. 41.67%) were significantly more likely to fit into HCNV than LCNV. The results suggest that the higher 11q11 copy numbers in girls are mainly due to the higher proportions of OW/OB of EA and AA, and NW of EA, being in the HCNV group. BMI z-scores of boys and girls of AA and EA ethnicities with LCNV and HCNV were analyzed with a t-test and are expressed as bar graphs in Figure 4 . LCNV and HCNV did not show a significant difference in BMI z-score between EA and AA boys and girls (Figure 4) .

Table 1 discusses the differences in the age, BMI, and 11q11 copy number of participants with low and high copy number variants of 11q11. The mean copy number of 11q11 was found to be higher in girls compared to boys. The proportion of participants with high CNV among girls correlates with a study conducted on 150 individuals of three different populations that showed gender specificity in the CNV of the olfactory receptor gene family [30] . A previous study conducted in children of German descent suggested a genetic link between obesity and 11q11 copy numbers [24] . A family-based genome-wide study revealed a lower 11q11 copy number in obese children than normal weight ones [24] . Our results showed a higher BMI z-score in AA girls with LCNV compared to boys with LCNV ( Figure 4A ), which correlates with previously published data. Increased BMI was also found to be associated with a low 11q11 copy number in Chinese children [17] . Zhang et al. observed a significant increase in the risk of obesity in Chinese children with deletions at the 11q11 locus. In addition, a cumulative effect was seen in Chinese children when deletions accompanied this at two other loci related to obesity: 10q11.22 and 4q25. This indicates a robust cumulative association between loci with high copy numbers and childhood obesity [17] . In contrast, Le\u00f3n-Mimila et al. reported a positive association in Mexican children aged 6-12 years. A lower 11q11 copy number was significantly associated with lower obesity risk in children. The same association was not seen in adult subjects [25] . We separated the children into 11q11 low and high copy number groups. There was no significant difference in 11q11 copy number (according to LCNV and HCNV groups) between NW and OW/OB children. Interestingly, when the participants were separated based upon gender, the NW and OW/OB boys were significantly more likely to belong to the LCNV group than the NW and OW/OB girls. This result suggests that the difference in the 11q11 copy number is gender-specific in children.",

Additionally, the OW/OB EA girls are significantly more likely to have a HCNV than a LCNV. AA participants were more likely to have a HCNV, except NW boys. AA girls had higher BMI z-score compared to boys with LCNV. This suggests that the 11q11 copy number in children is race and gender-specific.",
