In March 2020, to reduce viral spread, general practices in the UK were advised to consult remotely with patients where possible. Patients deemed at highest risk from COVID-19 were advised to 'shield' themselves, including patients with severe asthma. 1 For acute asthma care, interim guidance advised that, where possible, following risk assessment and determination of severity, mild and low-risk moderate asthma exacerbations could be managed remotely during the pandemic period. [2] [3] [4] [5] Chronic asthma care has also been affected. The majority of chronic asthma care in the UK is delivered in general practice. The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), the key method of remuneration for chronic asthma care in general practice, was paused at the start of the pandemic to shift resources and focus to acute care.",

When compared with faceto-face consultations, a previous randomised controlled trial found telephone consultations enabled more people with asthma to be reviewed, without clinical disadvantage, or loss of satisfaction. 6 A previous systematic review of RAC investigated its use in addition to, rather than instead of, face-toface consulting, and concluded that current evidence did not support widespread implementation of additional remote visits. 7 Asthma consultations can be considered complex interventions, meaning (among other things) that they are composed of multiple interacting components. 8 Consulting remotely adds a further layer of complexity. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) is a mid-range theory, which identifies factors that promote and inhibit the routine incorporation of complex interventions into everyday practice. 9 NPT predicts that for any new way of working to become fully embedded into everyday practice, continuous work is required in four domains of activity: sense-making (coherence), engagement, action, and monitoring ( Table 1 ). NPT has developed over time, with the most recent iteration of the framework, extended NPT (eNPT), enabling examination of how context-intervention interactions affect implementation. 10 This study aimed to evaluate the rapid and reactive implementation of RAC in general practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the lens of eNPT, to identify factors that promoted or inhibited implementation, and identify the 'work' that is required for 'normalisation' into routine clinical care.",

There was general consensus among staff that RAC supported the ongoing delivery of acute asthma care within pandemic restrictions. However, physical examination presented a challenge for implementation. Beyond pandemic restrictions, some staff felt the need for examination could be identified during initial remote consulting, while others felt the inability to perform physical examination remotely limited the usefulness of RAC for acute asthma care: For chronic asthma care, while some staff thought the components of a chronic asthma review were amendable to remote consulting, others questioned the accuracy of some of the required assessments, including inhaler technique.

'Work' can be done to support implementation and integration of RAC into everyday clinical practice. Specifically, practices can do the following: strive to communicate the value, purpose, and possibilities associated with RAC; identify a practice champion; and engage all members of the multidisciplinary practice and wider primary care team. However, this goes beyond 'work' that can be done at an individual staff or practice level. Practices need standardised access to equipment, guidance, and training. Guidance is required on an implementation approach, which is evidence-based, safe, and adapts to patient and practice needs to ensure implementation doesn't further exacerbate existing healthcare inequalities.",
