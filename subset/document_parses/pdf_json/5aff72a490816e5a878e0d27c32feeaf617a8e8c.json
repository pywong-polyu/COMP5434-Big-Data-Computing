We decided to prompt ordering at the time of admission to facilitate finding enough patients to open a vial without delaying discharge (all three authorized vaccines come in multidose vials with a limited shelf life once opened). The panel displayed eligibility criteria (updated multiple times as New York State expanded eligible populations) and contraindications to ensure providers were following rapidly evolving guidelines (Appendix, Section A). The order panel included hyperlinks to the current paper versions of the screener, consent, and attestation forms.

We transitioned to the distributed model approximately 2 weeks into the vaccination program, sooner than originally anticipated, because there was a greater need for the dedicated vaccinators to return to the NYP mass vaccination site. In the distributed model, the lead pharmacist at each site is responsible for monitoring the EHR for vaccine orders. The primary nurse now completes the prior responsibilities of the vaccinator (delivering the vaccine, filling out patient information on the vaccine card, and monitoring the patient).",

Clinicians had access to the New York State and Citywide Immunization Registries through the EHR, but this initially required manually entering the registry and reconciling the information; therefore, clinicians had to ask patients about their vaccination history or to show their vaccination cards. The team updated the Epic settings to automatically import vaccination data from city and state registries, removing the need for manual reconciliation. We created a report in Epic that generates a list of potentially unvaccinated patients to be used by the teams to proactively engage patients and encourage vaccination.

To reduce waste, vaccinators and pharmacists were initially instructed to wait until there were five orders for vaccines at a single site before opening a vial. It was sometimes not possible to simultaneously identify five eligible consenting patients, especially at smaller sites. We observed a vicious cycle in which a declining pool of eligible patients led to fewer orders; having fewer active orders decreased the likelihood of opening a vial; and teams and patients were frustrated with delays, which discouraged vaccine ordering. As the vaccine supply improved and federal and New York State regulators revised guidance to allow for \"responsible wastage,\" 10, 11 pharmacists now open a vial when needed to vaccinate an eligible and interested patient before discharge.

Therefore, we added an alert in the EHR to remind teams 48 hours after admission to reassess eligibility for vaccination if not ordered or previously administered and no contraindication is documented.

This patient hesitancy was one factor that catalyzed the decision to transition to the Pfizer vaccine for the inpatient program in August. Discussions about this switch were accelerated by the approval of the Pfizer vaccine for patients age 12-15 and by patient and clinician concerns about the relatively lower efficacy of the J&J vaccine. We anticipate that switching to the Pfizer vaccine could address some concerns about patient and provider hesitancy. However, it has created a new logistical challenge in needing to ensure second doses are scheduled.
