We report here a synthetic biology-based vaccine platform that employs an expression vector with an inducible gram-negative autotransporter to express vaccine antigens on the surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance interaction of vaccine antigen with the immune system. As a proof-of-principle, we utilized genome-reduced Escherichia coli to express SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) fusion peptide (FP) on the cell surface, and evaluated their use as killed whole-cell vaccines. The FP sequence is highly conserved across coronaviruses; the six FP core amino acid residues, along with the four adjacent residues upstream and the three residues downstream from the core, are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV. We tested the efficacy of PEDV FP and SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccines in a PEDV challenge pig model. We demonstrated that both vaccines induced potent anamnestic responses upon virus challenge, potentiated interferon-\u03b3 responses, reduced viral RNA loads in jejunum tissue, and provided significant protection against clinical disease. However, neither vaccines elicited sterilizing immunity. Since SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP vaccines provided similar clinical protection, the coronavirus FP could be a target for a broadly protective vaccine using any platform. Importantly, the genome-reduced bacterial surface-expressed vaccine platform, when using a vaccine-appropriate bacterial vector, has potential utility as an inexpensive, readily manufactured, and rapid vaccine platform for other pathogens.",

The HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP) has garnered considerable interest as a vaccine target (32) . Several potent broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognize the HIV-1 FP (32) (33) (34) . For coronaviruses, proteases cleave S into S1 and S2 to activate entry. S1 binds to its receptor, while S2 includes an FP that mediates fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Coronavirus FPs consist of 15 to 25 apolar amino acids that reorder the membranes after receptor binding. For SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, an \u223c18-aa sequence [SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGF], with a strong homology across different coronaviruses, is typically considered as the FP (35) (36) (37) (38) . FPs are attractive vaccine candidates because of their minimal sequence variation across the Coronaviridae family (39) , with the 93% of the 39 aa, including those surrounding the FP conserved among all betacoronaviruses and the 39 aa completely conserved among SARS-CoV-2 sequences (40) . It would likely be difficult for a virus to evolve so that it would no longer be affected by an immune response directed against the FP (41) . For all coronaviruses across four genera, the FP core [IEDLLF] is identical (https:// nextstrain.org). The SARS-CoV-2 FP is one of the sites targeted by preexisting antibodies presumably induced by non-SARS-CoV-2 infection (38, 42, 43) . A human SARS-CoV monoclonal antibody provided protection in a passive challenge infection in a nonhuman primate model (44) , suggesting that a vaccine that elicited an analogous immune response would be protective. The binding sites of neutralizing antisera from SARS-CoV-2 patients were also mapped to the FP region (38) .",

In 2013, PEDV emerged in the United States, killing millions of pigs and causing immense economic losses to the United States swine industry (53) (54) (55) . Sequence analysis revealed that the 13-aa residues surrounding and including the core FP sequence [IEDLLF] conserved in all coronaviruses were identical for SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV. This suggested that the efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccine could be tested using a PEDV challenge model in pigs. Pigs are very similar to humans in their genetics, physiology, and anatomy, perhaps the closest model to humans next to nonhuman primates. They have been used as model systems for many infectious disease vaccine studies (reviewed in ref. 56) . While the syndromes accompanying PEDV infection in pigs largely involve diarrhea, COVID-19 can include significant GI tract symptoms and pathology, with significant GI viral shedding (57, 58) .",

After the AT amino terminal signal sequence, pRAIDA2 has a cloning site flanked by type IIS BbsI restriction sites, enabling \"scarless\" cloning into the expression cassette.

However, sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV FP sequences used in this study (Fig. 3A ) revealed that the 13-aa residues surrounding the core FP sequence, including the six core residues, four adjacent residues immediately upstream from the core, and three adjacent residues immediately downstream from the core are identical between SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP, suggesting that the efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccine may be tested by using the PEDV challenge pig model as well. We also produced rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the PEDV and SARS-CoV-2 FPs, respectively. We transformed pRAIDA2-SARS-CoV-2 FP and pRAIDA2-PEDV FP into the wild-type E. coli strain ME5000 (0% genome-deleted) and strain ME5125 (29.7% genome-deleted) and conducted flow cytometry A B experiments using the rabbit anti-FP antibodies to demonstrate that the FP antigens were successfully expressed on the bacteria. We verified the expression of the FP-AT recombinant protein by immunoblot (Fig. 3B ). We conducted repeated binding experiments, assessing binding of a rabbit polyclonal anti-FP antibody to the surfaces of the bacteria expressing the FP by flow cytometry (two to four experiments summarized in Fig. 3C ), and the flow cytometry dot plots of an additional experiment is shown in Fig. 3D . The experiments showed that the FP antigens are present on the surfaces of the genome-reduced E. coli, and also showed that, for both these FP antigens, expression on the highly deleted ME5125 strain yielded substantially increased binding ( Fig. 3 C and D), as we had similarly observed for the surface-expressed HA immunotag shown in Fig. 2B .",

Fecal samples and swabs were collected daily and blood was collected weekly. The production of antibodies recognizing the FPs was examined by ELISAs ( Fig. 4 A and B) . We found that vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 FP or PEDV FP vaccines did not elicit a strong anti-FP response by week 5, 2 wk after boosting, although we noticed that the SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccine elicited a low, but statistically significant response against the PEDV FP (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test). The immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 FP is not statistically significant (P = 0.25). Importantly, both vaccines primed the pigs for a potent anamnestic response against either FP after the pigs were infected with PEDV. At the end of the challenge experiment, anti-FP ELISA values for the pigs vaccinated with the FP vaccines were all significantly (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test) higher than values for the pigs vaccinated with the control vaccine. At necropsy (7 d postchallenge, dpc), anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies were detected in 1:40 diluted sera from five of seven PEDV FP-vaccinated pigs, two of seven SARS-CoV-2 FP-vaccinated pigs, and in two of seven control pigs challenged with PEDV. The neutralizing antibody (NA) responses in the two animals from the control group are likely induced by the challenge PEDV.

There were significant differences at 5 wk postvaccination (wpv, P < 0.05) and 1 wk postchallenge (wpc, P < 0.05). The results showed that the serum IFN-\u03b3 levels significantly increased 2 wk after the vaccine booster dose (5 wpv) and 1 wk postchallenge (1 wpc or 6 wpv) in the vaccinated groups as compared to the control group. The IFN-\u03b3 levels at 1 wpv and 3 wpv are similar, but the IFN-\u03b3 level at 5 wpv (i.e., 2 wk after booster) increases in vaccinated groups, suggesting that the vaccine prime dose likely has activated T cells, and the booster dose further amplifies the activation. The results suggested that the FP vaccines potentiate IFN-\u03b3 response in vaccinated animals. The PEDV-related clinical signs of diarrhea and body condition were scored (Fig. 4 D and E) . At 2 dpc, one pig in the unvaccinated control group began to show clinical signs of diarrhea, and in total, six of the seven pigs developed diarrhea during the course of study. Most of the pigs developed marasmus along with diarrhea. In both vaccinated groups, most of pigs remained healthy and only one to two pigs showed mild diarrhea and marasmus during the study. Friedman rank sum tests comparing the vaccinated groups after day 3 to the control for both diarrhea and body condition scores were highly significant (P < 0.01 for all groups), suggesting that the vaccines significantly reduced the clinical signs after virus challenge.",

We embarked on this project to explore whether expressing foreign antigens on the surface of genome-reduced gram-negative bacteria using gram-negative AT expression systems could allow antigens to interact more effectively with the immune system, and so yield a synthetic biology-based new vaccine platform to rapidly produce inexpensive vaccines. While the candidate vaccines we produced in this initial proof-of-concept study did not elicit strong neutralizing humoral immune responses using the arbitrarily chosen dose, immunization route, and vaccination schedule, we observed The P values for comparison of control vs. PEDV vaccine in the small intestine content collected at necropsy was P = 0.158, and in the colon tissue P = 0.11. Similar to PEDV FP, the SARS-CoV-2 FP-vaccinated pigs also have numerically lower, but not statistically significant, PEDV loads compared to control pigs. Killed whole-genome reduced-bacteria surface-expressed coronavirus fusion peptide vaccines protect against disease in a porcine model significant protection against severe disease in the PEDV pig challenge model. We demonstrated a strong anamnestic response upon virus challenge, and evidence of differences in clinical correlates of disease and virus production. The FP vaccine we used was also encouraging in that it provided protection against viral pathologic effects, since a previously produced dendritic celltargeting PEDV S protein vaccine given to sows, reduced viral shedding in their experimentally infected piglets, but was associated with enhanced gross pathologic lesions (70) . SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly a respiratory disease; however, it does have significant GI symptomatology and substantial amount of virus is shed in feces (71, 72) . GI infection with SARS-CoV-2 can cause pneumonia and GI dysfunction in rhesus macaques (58) . PEDV causes predominantly a GI disorder. While the two diseases have distinct characteristics, as pandemic coronaviruses transmitted across a mucosal barrier the two diseases have useful parallels in GI symptoms, and the fact that vaccine prevention of PEDV can be studied in its native host enhances the model's realism.",

For example, it is possible that an immune response elicited by genome-reduced E. coli against the bacteria themselves might have harmful effects on the host or host microbiome. However, we did not observe significant adverse effects in the pigs vaccinated with the vaccines or with the control bacteria not expressing a vaccine antigen during the 6 wk before virus challenge. A number of preclinical (6) (7) (8) and human clinical studies (10, 11) with various E. coli KWCVs failed to show adverse effects from the vaccinations, including specific effects on the microbiome (9), and the clinical experience with approved veterinary E. coli KWCVs suggest that a genome-reduced E. coli KWCV would unlikely have significant adverse effects. Nevertheless, long-term safety studies, beyond the scope of this study, would clearly be needed prior to the clinical use of any genomereduced E. coli vaccine. It may be advantageous to use, instead of a commensal genome-reduced E. coli as the vaccine vector, a genome-reduced pathogenic E. coli strain, or even a genomereduced Salmonella Typhi, Bordetella pertussis, or Vibrio cholera as a bacterial vaccine vector, so that any immunity elicited against the vector would likely be beneficial. There exist numerous licensed human KWCVs employing B. pertussis, and V. cholera, and Salmonella human and animal vaccines with good safety profiles, although older parenteral killed whole-cell typhoid vaccines were reactogenic (73) .",

We selected the FP because it is extremely well-conserved among coronaviruses, and because the FP of other viruses with type 1 viral fusion proteins have also been the target of considerable vaccine development efforts. The finding that the SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP vaccines exhibited similar protective effect in the PEDV challenge pig model system was welcome, but not surprising, since the six FP core amino acid residues along with the four adjacent residues upstream the core and the adjacent three residues downstream the core are identical between PEDV and SARS-CoV-2. The core 6-aa residues are identical in FPs of all other coronaviruses. The finding that the FP vaccines from different genera of coronaviruses (alpha-and betacoronaviruses) were similar in protective effect suggests that the FP may be a useful target for development of a broad coronavirus vaccine, and that it may be helpful to include an FP-specific antigen in future, next-generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, since SARS-CoV-2 evolution is becoming problematic.",

Some licensed animal coronavirus vaccines protect against clinical diseases but not against infection (74) . For example, canine coronavirus vaccines protect dogs from disease but not from infection (75) . A recent passive immunization study in nonhuman primates suggested that high-level neutralizing humoral immunity may not be essential for protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease (76) . A very inexpensive, easy to manufacture vaccine with forgiving supply chain requirements and logistical challenges that does not elicit sterilizing immunity, but still helps protect against clinically significant disease, and is resistant to viral evolution or mutation may yet be helpful in a global context. Given estimates that sufficient courses of the current COVID-19 vaccines may not be available to vaccinate much of the global population in developing countries until substantially later than the industrialized countries (77) , and that the cost of many of these current vaccines and their requirement for very low temperature storage and transport may present a challenge for the poorer countries in the world, additional, globally targeted SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may prove helpful.",

The expression cassette has a cloning site with type IIS BbsI restriction sites to enable \"scarless\" cloning. The stuffer in the parental version of the plasmid encodes an influenza HA immunotag to enable verification of expression. The sequence of pRAIDA2 has been deposited into GenBank with accession number MW383928. Plasmids were prepared using Qiagen Plasmid Mini Prep kit, quantitated, and assessed for quality spectrophotometrically. The construction of vaccines employing a synthetic gene cloned into the pRAIDA2 expression cassette and then expressed on genome-reduced bacteria is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1B. Bacteria.

To determine the infectious titer, 100 \u03bcL serially diluted virus stock (10 \u22121 to 10 \u22125 ) was inoculated with each well of Vero cells in a 96-well plate at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . After 3-d incubation, the inoculated cells were analyzed via immunofluorescence assay with a PEDVspecific antibody as previously described (78) . Infectious viral titer was calculated using the Reed-Muench method and expressed as TCID 50 /mL.",

Pigs received a booster dose at 21 d postvaccination (dpv). Serum samples were collected from each pig prior to vaccination and at 1, 3, 5, 6 wpv. At 35 dpv, the pigs were challenged with PEDV 2013 Colorado strain via oral route of inoculation with 3.0 \u00d7 10 5.0 TCID 50 per pig (70) . After virus challenge, samples of fecal swab materials and scores of clinical signs were collected daily. At 7 dpc, all pigs were killed and necropsied. Samples of intestine tissues and intestinal contents were collected for pathological evaluation and quantification of PEDV RNA loads, respectively. This study was approved by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval no. IACUC 20-070).",

Design features include a high copy origin of replication, a kanamycin-resistance marker, and an AIDA-I AT expression cassette under the control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter. The expression cassette has a cloning site flanked by BbsI type IIS restriction sites. In its original, parental version, pRAIDA2 expresses an influenza virus HA immunotag. (B) A schematic diagram of the general process of candidate vaccine production using pRAIDA2 and genome-reduced bacteria. Genes with imputed locations on the surface of the genomereduced bacteria and increased binding of a monoclonal antibody against a recombinant antigen expressed on the surfaces of genome-reduced bacteria transformed with pRAIDA2. (A) Genes removed with imputed locations on the surface of E. coli strains ME5000, ME5110, ME5119, and ME5125 as a function of percent genome deleted. (B) Binding of a commercial anti-HA monoclonal antibody to the surfaces of the genome-reduced bacteria as a function of percent genome deleted. (C) Immunoblots of extracts from the wild-type and genome-reduced bacteria, transformed with pRAIDA2, and with expression of the HA immunotag with or without rhamnose induction (indicated at the top). Also indicated is whether the bacteria were pretreated with trypsin prior to protein extraction. Rhamnose induces expression of the HA immunotag expressed via the AT expression cassette. Trypsin treatment removes the HA immunotag from the bacterial surface. DNAK was probed as a loading control. The normalized amount of AIDA-HA differed by <16% from strain to strain, with the ME5125 29.7% deleted strain expressing the least normalized AIDA-HA. Maeda et al.

The efficacy of the two genome-reduced bacteriavectored surface-expression FP vaccine candidates (SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP) was evaluated in a pig vaccination and challenge study against PEDV (strain 2013 Colorado). Since severe disease is usually found in younger PEDV-infected piglets while the pigs used in this study were \u223c10-wk-old at the time of virus challenge, a higher dose of PEDV (3.0 \u00d7 10 5.0 TCID 50 per pig) was used to challenge the pigs. Clinical observations were conducted for the immediate 2 to 4 h after vaccination and daily thereafter, and included an assessment of the pig's body condition and stool/diarrhea output. A few vaccinated pigs exhibited lethargy, labored breathing, and vomiting immediately after vaccination, which resolved shortly after intramuscular administration of diphenhydramine. Pig humoral and IFN-\u03b3 responses after vaccination with killed whole-cell genome-reduced vaccines expressing FPs using pRAIDA2 and pig clinical responses after vaccination and PEDV challenge. (A and B) Pig humoral immune responses against the PEDV FP (A) or SARS-CoV-2 FP (B) following vaccination with the PEDV FP or SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccine and subsequent virus challenge. Normalized OD (sample OD \u2212 negative control OD/positive control OD \u2212 negative control OD). At challenge day, there was a small, but statistically significant increase in anti-PEDV FP antibody in the pigs vaccinated with the SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccine (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test), while not significant against the SARS-CoV-2 FP itself (P = 0.25) in pigs vaccinated with the SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccine. At necropsy day, there was a strong and statistically significant (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test) anamnestic response against both PEDV FP and SARS-CoV-2 FP in pigs vaccinated with PEDV and SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccines, respectively. (C) IFN-\u03b3 responses in serum samples of vaccinated and control pigs. There were significant differences at 5 wpv (P < 0.05) and 1 wpc (P < 0.05) between the vaccinated groups and control. (D) Diarrhea scores following PEDV challenge. (E) Body condition scores following PEDV challenge. Both PEDV FP and SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccines provided substantial and highly statistically significant protection against adverse clinical effects observed following the PEDV challenge infection (P < 0.01 for all groups, Friedman rank sum test, comparing each vaccinated group to the control for both diarrhea and body condition scores). Diarrhea scores range from 1 to 3, where 1 is normal to pasty feces, 2 is semiliquid diarrhea with some solid content, and 3 is liquid diarrhea with no solid content. Body condition scores range from 1 to 3, where 1 is undetectable spinous processes and hook bones, 2 is spinous processes and hook bones were slightly felt, and 3 is spinous processes and hook bones were easily felt and visible.Maeda et al.
