            "text": "Adjusted hazard ratio VHA Veterans Health Administration ICD-9/ 10 INTRODUCTION Opioid use disorder (OUD) has had a significant impact in the United States (US) with nearly 450,000 people dying from an overdose involving opioids between 1999 and 2018. 1 Veterans in the US represent a unique cohort that is at risk for OUD due to their greater rates of concurrent substance use, psychiatric comorbidities, trauma, and homelessness when compared to the general population. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Among US Veterans, the estimates of diagnosed OUD increased to over 69,132 in 2017 from 25,031 in 2003. 10, 11 Treatment for OUD is available through pharmacotherapies (such as buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, or naltrexone), and behavioral interventions including counseling. 12 The added component for optional or ancillary psychological services for those who need it the most, however, may be cumbersome depending on the frequency and duration of treatment, availability of counselors and providers, and distance to the provider. [13] [14] [15] [16] This could subsequently influence retention in treatment or length of stay in treatment, which is the most consistent predictor of post-treatment outcomes. 17, 18 Continued engagement in counseling services, however, may especially be challenging for rural communities or Veterans living in rural areas. 11, 19 Rural areas struggle with long waiting lists for MOUD, and the combination of high rates of opioid prescriptions with fewer treatment options is a continued challenge. 20 Telehealth, the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide or support clinical care, has increased as a service to overcome logistical, financial, and stigma-related challenges in mental health care. [21] [22] [23] A review of telehealth services within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) noted three key findings: (1) telehealth utilization increased over 300% between 2009 and 2015; (2) utilization proliferated most significantly among rural Veterans; and (3) approximately 50% of telehealth encounters were for mental health care. 24 Telehealth for OUD management has gained momentum in recent years due to shortages of certified providers in rural areas and logistical barriers of in-person visits. If comparable to in-person counseling in improving OUD outcomes through buprenorphine treatment retention, telehealth could be considered as an additional means to provide care. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the incorporation of telehealth services for Veterans treated for OUD within the VHA was associated with buprenorphine treatment retention and to evaluate whether this association varied between rural and urban Veterans and those with combined inperson and telehealth visits.",

We excluded those receiving buprenorphine patches as these suggest pain management, those with a documentation of a metastatic tumor diagnosis (as this may influence subsequent medications, treatment retention, and mortality) within 2 years prior to buprenorphine initiation, and those without geographical information on rurality.

Telehealth was defined using a strict definition that included stop codes indicating clinic-to-clinic (CCVT) or clinic-to-home (CHVT) video telehealth derived from previous work by Adams et al. and other resources (Appendix A). 24, 27 We identified stop codes specifically for substance use disorder (SUD) counseling and services as the primary exposure, and a broader, general mental health services as a secondary exposure that encompassed SUD and other mental health services. 24 Both SUD and mental health exposure variables were coded as telehealth (whether alone or in combination with in-person encounters), in-person only, or a gap between encounters. As there is no specific rule or guideline for the frequency of therapy visits for OUD management, we determined that at least one encounter or contact every 4 weeks with the VHA would be the minimum needed to stay engaged. The exposure was evaluated as a time-varying covariate such that each telehealth encounter was the start date of a 28-day period in which the Veteran was considered exposed to telehealth, and the start date was reset with each new telehealth visit (Appendix B).",

Telehealth has been touted as a means to rapidly overcome several barriers and challenges in mental health care. [21] [22] [23] The American Psychiatric Association identified numerous advantages telehealth offers including improving access to mental health specialty care that may not be otherwise available, helping integrate behavioral health care and primary care, reducing delays in patient care while improving continuity of care and follow up, and reducing transportation barriers. 36 As buprenorphine is an effective means to reducing overdoses and adverse events, 37 perhaps providing additional services such as programs, therapies, counseling, or medication management through telehealth as a medium for those who need it the most is a viable option for facilities and providers to consider to improve treatment retention. From the current design and approach, we can speculate that there may be two additional reasons for the observed associations. First, there may be additional individual-, facility-, or system-level factors that not only drive the decision to incorporate or implement telehealth services, but may also be associated with treatment retention. As previous work has demonstrated, there is significant diversity in OUD management and care across the country such as buprenorphine implementation, geographical variation of OUD within non-VHA settings, and types of behavioral interventions in addition to buprenorphine management. 10, 38 We attempted to account for a potential selection bias issue by examining the association within a cohort that was previously exposed to telehealth, and then separately in one that was telehealth-na\u00efve at the start of buprenorphine treatment. We could find no significant difference between the two, and overall associations in the sensitivity analysis were similar to the primary analysis.",

The inherent challenge with this approach is that rather than telehealth encounters motivating treatment retention, medication adherence and longer treatment retention times may be motivating the incorporation of telehealth into SUD management (i.e., a reverse causal relationship). To address this issue, we analyzed Veterans who stayed in treatment for at least 28 days (thereby examining encounters after 4 weeks of continuous treatment) and found no difference in the exposure and outcome associations. This, however, does not preclude the possibility that Veterans who were doing better may have been preferentially selected for telehealth.",

This may seem paradoxical to the literature or other documentation that consistently report rurality as a risk factor for adverse outcomes of OUD or as a barrier to buprenorphine treatment and other mental health care. 11, 20, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] Two phenomena may be taking place within both the VHA system and rural Veterans. First, we followed a cohort of Veterans who were diagnosed with OUD and initiated buprenorphine treatment. This may present some selection bias, particularly if the adoption of buprenorphine as a line of treatment for OUD occurs less frequently in rural areas; those who start buprenorphine in some areas may be systematically different or have different access to care from those who do not start buprenorphine. Second, in order to address urban-rural disparities for Veterans and improve health outcomes, the VHA expanded or increased services such as the flexibility to incorporate non-VHA providers into coordinated care or the incorporation of telehealth as examined in this study. [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] We suspect that some of these efforts by the VHA could explain some of the improvements in access and health outcomes, particularly in rural areas.",

            "text": "In this study of pre-pandemic use of telehealth, we were able to assess the extent to which this modality was used for both mental health and SUD services. The use of telehealth increased each year since the start of the study period for both mental health and substance use disorder services. Despite the potential promise of telehealth, we found that it was relatively rarely used; only 3% and 5% of Veterans had telehealth for a SUD and mental health encounter, respectively. However, it is important to recognize the role that the VHA plays in mental health and SUD care for Veterans beyond the delivery of telehealth as a mode of care. There are factors that are associated with qualifying someone to access VHA services. 50 Substance disorders, mental health conditions, service-related injuries, and homelessness are positively associated, and there are programs and outreach efforts targeting Veterans who have such conditions. [50] [51] [52] This may also lead to a selection of Veterans who are diagnosed and treated for OUD that might additionally utilize services such as therapy and counseling. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in economic and psychosocial challenges, which further exacerbated the opioid crisis and mental health inequities. 53 Due to the disruption in social services, there were numerous changes that took place to reduce barriers to receiving care after the onset of the pandemic. Some of these included expanding telehealth use for OUD management (by relaxing Ryan Haight Act restrictions), waiving the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act penalties for good faith use of telehealth, increasing access to telehealth for buprenorphine management and takehome medications, and covering additional telehealth services through Medicare. 54 In order to increase telehealth services for SUD, we will still need to investigate the patient-, provider-, and facility-level characteristics that lead to telehealth incorporation. We investigated additional elements of buprenorphine prescribing for our sample: provider specialization for prescribers and the use of telehealth for Veterans treated for OUD in primary care. Interestingly, 18% of providers who prescribed buprenorphine in this sample were primary care or general internal medicine providers, whereas the vast majority (74%) of buprenorphine prescriptions were written by mental health providers. An estimated 27% of the general internal medicine and/or primary care providers also had a mental health sub-specialization and 11% had an addiction specialization. The second area that was further examined was the use of telehealth within the primary care setting for these patients. When we limited stop codes to only account for primary care or general medicine clinics, only 0.2% of patients had a telehealth encounter within this setting during follow-up. This presents an opportunity for expansion as increasing clinical \u2021Telehealth encounters include telehealth services alone or in combination with in-person services. Telehealth is defined as encounters that used video-specific delivery of care capacity among general medicine and primary care providers would rapidly increase the availability of buprenorphine providers and could reduce inequities in access to care. There are some limitations to this study. First, we relied on administrative data for exposure assessment, co-morbidities and other characteristics, and outcome ascertainment of buprenorphine treatment. This may have underestimated some treatment effects, despite our efforts to address concerns through multiple sensitivity analyses. There may also be significant variation in access and availability of treatments and services across facilities, potentially confounding some of the observed associations. There was no significant difference in our outcomes when we limited the analyses to facilities that more rigorously incorporated telehealth. Finally, the appropriate time to discontinuation is highly variable and debatable. We chose a timeline of 1 year, though the length of time on buprenorphine is a patient-centered concern and decision. As a result, we might have treated discontinuation as a \"failure\" or gap in healthcare when, in fact, discontinuation within 1 year may have been related to treatment success in some cases.",
