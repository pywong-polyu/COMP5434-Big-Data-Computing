The way in which policy makers respond to the current pandemic could have large effects on how the world looks after the pandemic subsides. A region that has been defined by liberalism and freedom for the better part of a century has experienced a rise in nationalism and populism that has not been seen since after World War I. Historically, limitations on individual freedoms and new waves of legislation impeding freedom have accompanied the rise of nationalism and populism in Europe. These developments have also been accompanied by increased xenophobia and out-group distrust, which have negative effects on economic cooperation globally and economic mobility locally. Therefore, understanding what motivates and drives populist and nationalist movements from a psychological and social perspective is critical to promoting policies that can promote individual freedom in Europe.",

In particular, there is a lack of attention to the role of evolved human psychology in responding to persistent threats, which can fall into four broad categories in the literature: predation (threats to one's life via being eaten or killed in some other way), contagion (threats to one's life via physical infection), natural (threats to one's life via natural disasters), and social (threats to one's life by destroying social standing; exile from a group would have been equivalent to a death penalty in ancient ancestral environments) (Li\u00e9nard & Boyer, 2006; ; . These threats have been discussed in light of their effects on religion and other forms of behaviour, but they have not been employed to study nationalist and populist behaviours.",

            "text": "Although many theories from a variety of disciplines bear on the relationships between threat and populism/nationalism studied in this paper, two sets of sometimes overlapping literatures are particularly important for our purposes here. The first is identity fusion theory (Bonin & Lane, n.d.; Jong et al., 2016; Swann et al., 2012; Whitehouse et al., 2017; Whitehouse & Lanman, 2014) , which is closely linked to the concept of \"sacred values\". points out that the current challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic is converting some citizens into \"devoted actors\" and increasing fusion with various groups. When contagion threats strengthen nationalism, this intensified sense of unity may make an in-group stronger, but it also poses a number of potential problems for out-group dynamics and intergroup conflict. Gomez argues these changes may include \"denial of the group's wrongdoings\u2026 willingness to participate in extreme forms of protest on behalf of the group; maximizing the ingroup's advantage over the outgroup even at one's personal expense; protecting the group's reputation\u2026 relative intergroup formidability\u2026 and the desire to retaliate against outgroup members\" (p.2-3). All of this contributes to out-group hostility. In the US context, culpability has sometimes been consigned to the Chinese with major media outlets and government officials, including the president, repeatedly using the term \"Chinese virus\", which further entrenches the notion that the pandemic is the fault of \"others.\" This perpetuates the idea that \"foreigners are also associated with semantic concepts that connote disease\" (Faulkner et al. 2004: p.333) .",

            "text": "A second body of literature that is relevant for our current purposes is the literature on moral foundations theory. The basic idea here is that human morality evolved with five distinct \"foundations,\" which are differentially distributed within human populations. Some combination of these five emotionally charged moral foundations form the basis of each individual's normative preferences: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and purity/degradation. The first two foundations are sometimes referred to as \"individualizing,\" while the latter three are considered \"binding.\" Liberals tend to be guided primarily by the first two of these dyads, suppressing the other three, while conservatives rely on all five when making moral judgments (Alizadeh et al., 2019; Graham et al., 2009; Iyer et al., 2012) . Previous research testing this theory suggests that \"individualizing\" moral foundations can have a negative relationship with negative behavioural intentions (and a positive relation with positive intentions), while \"binding\" moral foundations are correlated oppositely. This is relevant for our purposes because both of our studies were motivated by our interest in discovering the causal interactions among threats (of the four types mentioned above), religiosity, nationalism, and intergroup conflict. However, our evolutionary framework focuses on the role of threat perception, rather than moral belief commitments, as a factor in differences between poles in the political spectrum.",

It could be that the same underlying cognitive capacities or tendencies are the foundation for both religion and nationalism, but that religion and nationalism per se have independent effects on anti-immigrant sentiment.
