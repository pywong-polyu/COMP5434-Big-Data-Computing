Evidence that has emerged to date suggests cancer patients may be at a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, may have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness, and may have a higher fatality rate compared to the general population [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Accordingly, prescribers are challenged with balancing the risks and benefits of treating cancer patients who are also impacted, both directly and indirectly, by COVID-19. As countries try to contain the spread of COVID-19 and manage active COVID-19 infections, cancer patients may face treatment interruptions or delays in accessing standard diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities, including curative surgeries, radiation, and systemic therapies [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

A number of factors were considered, including: access to other treatment modalities (e.g., surgery, radiation, stem cell transplants) may be significantly delayed; hospital visits may need to be reduced due to patient risk or limited workforce capacity; less immunosuppressive therapies may be warranted due to patient risk; overall patient and budget impact; and the administrative burden of applying for drug coverage should be reduced for clinicians who may be facing an increased workload during the pandemic.

Systemic therapy was proposed as an option in the event that surgery and radiation were not readily available to patients during the pandemic [14, 29] . Our findings suggest that this was a useful strategy. Ontario did experience limited access to surgery and radiation during the first wave, with 38% fewer cancer surgeries in April 2020 compared with April 2019 [11] . Breast cancer is a common cancer for which radiation therapy is needed. To reduce patient visits, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PMCC), the largest cancer centre in Canada, instituted mitigating measures for breast cancer patients who may require radiation therapy. Based on their oncologic risks, radiation therapy could be shortened, deferred, or omitted. During the first wave, PMCC reported a decrease of 39% in breast radiation therapy starts during March-April 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 [12, 30] . During this time, the NDFP interim funding measures were available to support clinicians who wanted to prescribe adjuvant regimens in the neoadjuvant setting, or use systemic therapy where access to surgery or radiation was limited or not preferred.",

This finding is slightly higher than was noted in a survey conducted by the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists (CAMO) in May 2020, which showed that 21% of respondents reported changing chemotherapy plans for more than 20% of their patients [31] . There are a number of possible reasons for differences in these findings, including timing of the survey (our survey was conducted at a later stage of the pandemic), population surveyed (our survey included a broader group of clinicians other than medical oncologists), and geography (our survey was limited to Ontario). Of note, in a global survey of oncologists (n = 343) from 28 countries, 61% said that the COVID-19 outbreak would \"definitely affect\" treatment decisions, further highlighting the need to support clinicians with flexible public funding initiatives [27] . System-wide cancer drug funding policies must be flexible and responsive as the pandemic evolves. During the initial wave of COVID-19 in Ontario, the extent of lockdown measures varied by region [32] . Our survey was conducted a few months after the restart of all deferred and non-essential and elective services began to occur [33] . Broadly, respondents anticipated less use of specific COVID-19 management strategies in the coming months. Based on detailed comments provided from respondents, this may highlight clinician uncertainty regarding the extent of the restrictions that may be needed as the pandemic continues. A global survey of 351 cancer centres, conducted in April/May 2020, reported that 88.2% of centres reduced their usual care, and the most common reason was due to precautionary measures [10] . However, centres in Canada and other countries are also reporting fewer referrals from general practitioners to oncology providers for diagnosis or treatment [8, 34, 35] . This may mean Ontario could see a reduction in treatment volumes and the need for the interim funding measures in the coming months may be reduced.",

Our survey findings indicate that OH(CCO) guidelines and funding policies have given clinicians options to adapt treatment plans considering the changing landscape of delivering cancer care during a pandemic. However, it is important to note that the outcomes of modifying treatment plans for cancer patients is not currently well established. When OH(CCO) first released the NDFP interim funding measures, clinicians were informed that interim cancer drug funding measures might not be appropriate for all patients. The onus was on prescribers to determine whether adopting a suggested interim funding measure for a given patient was clinically appropriate based on a thorough risk-benefit assessment. A recent patient survey conducted in the Netherlands found that more than 50% of patients were concerned about the consequences of delays and discontinuation of treatments [38] . These patient concerns are validated in a recent systematic review showing that \" . . . a four week delay of cancer treatment is associated with increased mortality across surgical, systemic treatment, and radiotherapy indications for seven cancers\" [39] . Collectively, these findings highlight the need to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of treatment adaptations, to assess the overall impact on cancer outcomes.",

The representation by provider type was not evenly distributed across the regions so we were not able to make meaningful comparisons. For example, physicians, pharmacists, and nurses may have different perspectives depending on the information that is directly available to them.
