Contact tracing systems for SARS-CoV-2 aim to interrupt transmission chains by investigating people who had contact with a probable or confirmed case, and quarantining or isolating infected and exposed individuals in a timely manner, thereby reducing the occurrence of future transmission events [3] . While identifying and notifying contacts is a core part of contact tracing, other closely related activities like case investigation, testing of contacts, and case isolation and quarantining of contacts, are commonly understood to be part of contact tracing [4] .",

The infectious period is defined as two days before until ten days after symptom onset for symptomatic cases, and two days before until ten days after a positive test for asymptomatic cases [3] . The implementation of contact tracing and related activities varies widely across countries depending on local public health guidance and resources. For example, prioritization of high-risk contacts according to risk classification is often done in high burden settings and/or low-resource contexts, e.g. by focusing on household members or other close contacts, contacts exposed during crowded or closed settings, or contacts exposed to cases at the peak of their infectiousness [3] . Similarly, local guidance varies on whether or not all contacts should be tested or whether only selective testing of close contacts should be done, and whether or not quarantine is recommended or compulsory, and whether it is organized at designated facilities or at the contacts' home [2, 5] .",

In addition to SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, the two other known human coronaviruses with epidemic potential, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, were included in the search since indicators developed to trace contacts of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were considered of potential relevance for SARS-CoV-2.

We only identified a very small number of input indicators and no outcome or impact indicators (see S4 Table and Table 1 ). The vast majority of our identified indicators were either process or output indicators. This focus on the mid-level indicator types is not uncommon in health systems assessments [17] . For process indicators it is often the availability of data that explains their frequent use, and for output indicators this is largely due to the immediacy of the measured effects [16, 18] . Outcome and impact indicators, on the other hand, measure more distal long-term effects, and are harder to measure and to attribute to a specific system, hence their absence in our study was hardly surprising given that COVID-19 contact tracing systems were built or adapted under immense time pressure in the midst of a global pandemic.",

All thematic areas of process and output indicators were heavily covered by the identified indicators, but we found important gaps in the input, outcome and impact categories. Showing and validly attributing the interruption of ongoing transmission chains and a subsequent decline in incidence to contact tracing requires properly planned research studies, in particular in high-transmission settings, which might explain the absence of indicators in these thematic areas. Lacking such impact indicators puts contact tracing in a disadvantageous position with regards to the strategic distribution of limited resources compared to other interventions such as vaccination, where impacts appear better documented. However, indicators on human and financial resources were clearly underrepresented, which can hardly be explained by lack of data availability for these indicators. Instead, this gap could indicate that efficiency is not a priority. It is likely that program managers were generally more concerned about the middle and proximal front end of the system, i.e. process and output, instead of the back end (input). This is somewhat expected although counterintuitive given the large amount of resources that contact tracing consumes, especially in community transmission settings. Given that adequate human resources and in particular training has been identified as a main factor of successful contact tracing systems, this area requires better evaluation tools. WHO provides specific guidance for member states to estimate workforce needs depending on the specific transmission scenario [19] , which could be used to develop additional indicators to address these gaps.",

Most of the identified sources did not provide clear definitions of the terms used. There is a need to harmonize the understanding and use of terminology and concepts related to contact tracing. Also, the benchmarks that were proposed for about a quarter of the identified indicators were often not contextualized, which made it difficult to establish whether these were considered minimum standards or indicators of success, and to determine the rationale behind the choice of certain thresholds. Furthermore, indicators using measures of centrality were based either on averages (means) or medians, but none of the identified indicators aimed to measure the dispersion of transmission risks between cases and contacts, which is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the control of COVID-19 [20] .",

Second, we restricted our search to the three known human coronaviruses with epidemic potential due to their similar epidemiological profiles. Contact tracing indicators for other epidemic-prone infectious diseases were thus missed. Third, we did not assess system-wide indicators, e.g. those relating to coordination across units and/or levels, or governance. Fourth, we were not able to record the total number of websites searched during our internet search, and could therefore only report the number of websites from which indicators were included for this study (see Fig 1) . Fifth, it is possible that there is publication bias across indicator categories, with input indicators being underrepresented in published or online documents compared to process and output indicators due to perceived lower operational relevance by public health officials in charge of contact tracing systems. This might be particularly the case for indicators that are more relevant at peripheral levels of health systems compared to priorities at central levels. Sixth, though we applied a very systematic search strategy for the peer-reviewed and grey literature, this was not a full systematic review and therefore did not include or adhere to all items recommended for full systematic reviews [21] .

The importance yet absence of comprehensive guidance on how to assess performance of contact tracing systems across countries has been recognized [2, 5] . The centerpiece of such global guidance should be a set of core indicators that are widely accepted, operationally relevant, and easy to report across contact tracing systems. This core set might even be useful in future epidemics with similar epidemiological characteristics as SARS-CoV-2. The development of such a core set of indicators will require a coordinated, methodologically robust ranking and consensus seeking undertaking, and our study provides important insights to inform such initiatives.",
