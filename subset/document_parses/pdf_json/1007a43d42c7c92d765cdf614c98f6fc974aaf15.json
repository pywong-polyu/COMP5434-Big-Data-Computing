Samples experiencing covariate shift but not semantic shift are either excluded from the test set or treated as OOD, which contradicts the primary goal in machine learning-being able to generalize beyond the training distribution. In this paper, we take into account both shift types and introduce full-spectrum OOD (FS-OOD) detection, a more realistic problem setting that considers both detecting semantic shift and being tolerant to covariate shift; and designs three benchmarks. These new benchmarks have a more finegrained categorization of distributions (i.e., training ID, covariate-shifted ID, near-OOD, and far-OOD) for the purpose of more comprehensively evaluating the pros and cons of algorithms. To address the FS-OOD detection problem, we propose SEM, a simple feature-based semantics score function. SEM is mainly composed of two probability measures: one is based on high-level features containing both semantic and non-semantic information, while the other is based on low-level feature statistics only capturing non-semantic image styles. With a simple combination, the non-semantic part is cancelled out, which leaves only semantic information in SEM that can better handle FS-OOD detection. Extensive experiments on the three new benchmarks show",

Such a behavior makes realworld deployments of neural network models untrustworthy and could endanger users involved in the systems. To solve the problem, various OOD detection methods have been proposed in the past few years [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . The main idea for an OOD detection algorithm is to assign to each test image a score that can represent the likelihood of whether the image comes from in-or out-of-distribution. Images whose scores fail to pass a threshold are rejected, and the decision-making process should be transferred to humans for better handling.",

To this end, we design three benchmarks, namely DIGITS, OBJECTS and COVID, each targeting a specific visual recognition task and together constituting a comprehensive testbed. We also provide a more fine-grained categorization of distributions for the purpose of thoroughly evaluating an algorithm. Specifically, we divide distributions into four groups: training ID, covariate-shifted ID, near-OOD, and far-OOD (the latter two are inspired by a recent study [10] ). Figure 1 -a shows example images from the DIGITS benchmark: the covariate-shifted images contain the same semantics as the training images, i.e., digits from 0 to 9, and should be classified as ID, whereas the two OOD groups clearly differ in semantics but represent two different levels of covariate shift.",

While none of the previous softmax/logits-based methods (e.g., MSP, ODIN, and EBO) are capable to solve the notMNIST problem, the proposed SEM largely reduces the FPR95 metric from 99% to 10.93%, and the AUROC is increased from around 30% to beyond 95%. One explanation of the clear advantage is that, the previous output-based OOD detection methods largely depend on the covariate shift to detect OOD samples, while the feature-based MDS (partly rely on top-layer semantic-aware features) and the proposed SEM uses more semantic information, which is critical to distinguish MNIST and notMNIST. In other words, in the MNIST/notMNIST scenario where ID and OOD have high visual similarity, large dependency on covariate shift while ignorance on the semantic information will lead to the failure of OOD separation. Similar advantages are also achieved with the other near-OOD dataset.",

Therefore, more semantic information is encoded in the previous output-based methods. Nevertheless, the proposed SEM method still outperforms others on most of the metrics. We also notice that SEM score does not reach the best performance on MNIST and FashionMNIST. One explanation is that two black-and-white images in these two datasets inherently contain significant covariate shifts comparing to both training ID and covariate-shifted ID, so that the scores that efficient on covariate shift detection (e.g., ODIN) can also achieve good results on these datasets.

The reason can be that output-based methods use too much covariate shift information for OOD detection, which by nature cannot distinguish between covariateshifted ID and near-OOD. The proposed SEM score also outperforms the similar feature-based baseline MDS. 2) SEM score sometimes underperforms on far-OOD, with a similar reason that classic OOD detectors use covariate shift to distinguish ID and OOD, which is sometimes sufficient to detect far-OOD samples. Nevertheless, SEM reaches more balanced good results on near-OOD and far-OOD. Table 3 : Comparison between previous state-of-the-art methods, the proposed SEM score, and the low-level probabilistic component p(x n ) on classic OOD benchmarks, without the existence of covariate-shifted ID set. The previous methods of MSP [2] , ODIN [3] , EBO score [4] , and MDS [5] reaches a good results on the classic benchmark. However, the value of p(x n ) can exceed all the previous methods and achieve a near-perfect result across all the metrics, showing that only taking covariate shift score can completely solve the classic OOD detection benchmark, which, in fact, contradicts the goal of OOD detection. This phenomenon also advocates the significance of the proposed FS-OOD benchmark. Table 3 shows the performance on the classic OOD detection benchmark. The result shows that without the introduction of covariate-shifted ID data, the previous methods reach a near-perfect performance on the classic benchmark, which matches the reported results in their origin papers. However, by comparing with Table 2, their performance significantly breakdown when covariate-shifted ID is introduced, showing the fragility of previous methods, and therefore we advocate the more realistic FS-OOD benchmark. Furthermore, we also report the results that by using the value of p(x n ), the score from low-layer feature statistics for detecting covariate shift is shown surprisingly effective on classic OOD benchmark, which exceeds all the previous methods and achieve a near-perfect result across all the metrics. This phenomenon shows that only taking covariate shift score can completely solve the classic OOD detection benchmark with MNIST, which, in fact, contradicts the goal of OOD detection.

AUROC is reported for performance evaluation. Several options can be applied to estimate p(x n ) and p(x) in Equation 3 . FS denotes the usage of feature statistics, and FF denotes flattened features. T and L means top-/low-layer feature, e.g., L-FS means low-layer feature statistics. The results show the effectiveness of our SEM score. p(x n ), there are actually several options for the estimation, which is discussed in Table 4 . In this analysis, we set top flattened features as the default usage for p(x) and only explore p(x n ), which is the key part of SEM score. Exp#1 shows the result that only uses p(x) as the final score, which can be interpreted as a simple method using GMM to estimate ID likelihood on the final-layer features. Compared to the MDS result in Table 2 , this simple method already obtains a better performance on near-OOD. Notice that we use LeNet-5 on DIGITS, the final-layer features are identical to their feature statistics (ref. Exp#2). Therefore, everything is cancelled out if p(x n ) is top-layer feature statistics (ref. Exp#3).",
