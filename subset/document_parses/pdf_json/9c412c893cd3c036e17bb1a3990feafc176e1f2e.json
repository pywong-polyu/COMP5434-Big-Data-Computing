In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, app developers have joined the response effort in various ways by releasing apps that target different user bases (e.g., all citizens or journalists), offer different services (e.g., location tracking or diagnostic-aid), provide generic or specialized information, etc. While many apps have raised some concerns by spreading misinformation or even malware, the literature does not yet provide a clear landscape of the different apps that were developed. In this study, we focus on the Android ecosystem and investigate Covid-related Android apps. In a best-effort scenario, we attempt to systematically identify all relevant apps and study their characteristics with the objective to provide a first taxonomy of Covid-related apps, broadening the relevance beyond the implementation of contact tracing. Overall, our study yields a number of empirical insights that contribute to enlarge the knowledge on Covid-related apps: (1) Developer communities contributed rapidly to the COVID-19, with dedicated apps released as early as January 2020; (2) Covid-related apps deliver digital tools to users (e.g., health diaries), serve to broadcast information to users (e.g., spread statistics), and collect data from users (e.g., for tracing); (3) Covid-related apps are less complex than standard apps; (4) they generally do not seem to leak sensitive data; (5) in the majority of cases, Covid-related apps are released by entities with past experience on the market, mostly official government entities or public health organizations.",

At the time of writing, AndroZoo contains more than 11 million Android apps (June 2020) that have been collected from different sources, such as Google Play and other thirdparty providers (F-Droid, Anzhi, AppChina, etc.). As it is continuously growing, researchers still heavily rely on AndroZoo for collecting apps and experimenting on it (Ranganath and Mitra 2020; Shar et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020) .",

For common Java applications, the source code is compiled into Java bytecode and run into the Java virtual machine. However, Android apps are compiled into Dalvik bytecode (Dalvik Executable, i.e., Dex), which is the distribution format of app code in app packages. This bytecode is then targeted to be executed on the Android Android Runtime (which now replaces Dalvik Virtual Machine on recent Android versions). Still, the DEX files do not constitute an application. Indeed, an Android app is a collection of files packaged together in the so-called Android Application Package (APK). This format is used for distributing apps on devices, not only via official and unofficial markets but also via any other channels where an independent file can be distributed. Indeed, Android devices allow users to install applications from any sources once a configuration option is toggled off.",

For instance, the english Wikipedia page 1 related to COVID-19 (Wikipedia 2020) defines Covid-related apps as \"mobile software applications that use digital tracking to aid contact tracing in response to the i.e . the process of identifying persons (\"contacts\") who may have been in contact with an infected individual.\". We quickly considered this definition as too restrictive since we found several Covid-related apps that are not about \"digital contact tracing\". As a result, rather than relying on a definition of what is a Covid-related app we (1) implemented several heuristics based on assumptions, and (2) performed several quality checks to filter out irrelevant apps.",

Indeed, the presence of some packages can characterize the fact that a smartphone is rooted. Among such packages, one is named com.ramdroid.appquarantine and another is named com.ramdroid.appquarantinepro. To verify the presence of these two packages, developers often use these package names as string, and thus the regular expression using quarantine matches.

Sometimes, these apps are developed directly by an entity that itself carries credibility as a source of information, such as national healthcare authorities. An example is the MyHealth Sri Lanka app 10 developed by the national ICT Agency, which presents to the user verified information on the current COVID-19 status. -A number of apps appear to provide unfiltered information regarding COVID-19. Their developers are not always themselves entities that would traditionally be assumed to have any specific credibility on the matter. For example, the Diag-noseMe app, 11 which claims to provide the user with all the information on the virus, is proposed by an association with unrecorded expertise in health.",

            "text": "[2] Upstream Collection Most apps in our dataset perform data collection from users. This suggests that many app providers consider data to be key in the mitigation of the COVID-19 crisis. App providers indeed collect a variety of information, including user personal information (e.g., name, age, address, etc.), some medical information (e.g., whether a user is infected with COVID-19, the therapies that are used). Some apps are even used to keep a health diary (sharing information about symptoms every day), or to report the infection of people in the app user's acquaintances. Overall, we have identified three different ways in which apps collect user data, as summarized in Fig. 9 . Note that in the case of data collection and spread tracking apps, we did not try to qualify whether apps were as privacy-preserving as their developers claimed they were (e.g., data is deleted after N days), nor to determine to what extent the collected data is shared with third parties. Similarly, for this paper, we did not analyze the inner workings of contact-tracing apps, and we did not evaluate the merit nor the opportunity of contact-tracing, this having already been-and still being to this date-discussed by security researchers (Culnane 2020; Anderson 2020; Baumg\u00e4rtner et al. 2020) .",

To that end, we extracted for all sets of apps the top ten most requested permissions. First, a notable difference is that Covid-related apps tend to use the wake lock permission more than standard apps. This permission is used for preventing the screen of the device from being turned off, and/or to ensure an app remains active. Such a feature is often used for keeping the phone awake while locating the phone (e.g., for contact tracing). In the same way, access fine location and access coarse location tend to be used more by Covid-related apps. This is in line with the use of the wake lock permission to facilitate user location tracking. Figure 13 shows the distribution of the number of permissions requested by Covidrelated apps and other apps per category. The MWW tests revealed no statistically significant difference between the number of permissions used by Covid-related apps and by other apps Therefore, for Covid-related apps and our dataset of apps by category, we computed the number of apps using at least one common library and one advertisement library. Table 7 presents our results. First, we notice that almost all the apps (Covid-related and other) use common libraries, which is not surprising since Android software developmentjust like non-mobile software-heavily relies on reusable libraries and frameworks. However, the difference is significant regarding the advertisement libraries. Indeed, while advertisement libraries are used by more than 80% of other apps, they only appear in less than 20% of Covid-related apps. Furthermore, only 3 out of 240 advertisement libraries flurry. This strongly suggests that the primary goal of Covid-related apps is not to obtain a financial gain from advertisement, in opposition to the vast majority of standard apps.",

[Privacy leaks] As we have seen in Section 4.1, most of the Covid-related apps are made for collecting personal and sensitive data, e.g., health data and/or the location of users. Therefore, the security and privacy aspects of these apps are crucial, and many people started to share concerns related to this topic (Page 2020; Parliament 2020; Stolton 2020) . In order to assess the privacy of Covid-related apps, we applied the state-of-the-art data leak detector FlowDroid-IccTA (Arzt et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015) .

Table 11 shows the number of outliers detected per cluster. The three outliers in \"Spread tracking\" have been detected because, contrary to other apps in the cluster, they use Android vibration API and Android MediaPlayer API. Similarly, in the cluster \"Sharing health information\", the two outliers use Bluetooth APIs, which is not the case for other apps in the cluster. Regarding the cluster \"Sharing general information\", the outliers use the SmsManager API, the TelephonyManager API, and the SpeechRecognizer API. In the \"Data collection\" cluster, the use of the Bluetooth API is common: outliers do not use this API. Finally, in the \"COVID-19 self-diagnosis\" cluster, the outliers use the MediaPlayer API, which is not used by the rest of the cluster apps. CHABADA allowed us to identify several Covid-related apps that deviate from the expected behavior given their description. Although the outliers do not necessarily present a danger for end-users, because, in general, they only deviate with respect to non-sensitive APIs (e.g., MediaPlayer, Vibrator, etc.), our empirical results show that descriptions do not always reliably approximate the expected app behavior.

Our empirical findings reveal that Covid-related apps have mainly three purposes: (1) inform users, (2) collect data, and (3) provide tooling capabilities for users.
