The current COVID-19 pandemic, the first recognized to be caused by an HCoV, has focused attention on the seasonal coronaviruses in comparison to SARS-CoV-2. Of particular importance are questions around possible cross protection or enhancement of COVID-19 disease from prior seasonal virus infection and duration of infection following SARS-CoV-2 infection [5] [6] [7] . Few have examined antibody response to seasonal infection, antibody waning, or cross response between the 4 seasonal HCoV or with SARS-CoV-2 in large prospective cohort studies [8] [9] [10] .",

Participants with ARI attended an illness visit within 7 days of symptom onset where study staff collected nasal and throat swabs (nasal only in children <3 years) combined in a single vial of viral transport media; asymptomatic infections were not assessed. Specimens were assayed for detection of respiratory viruses, including the 4 seasonal coronavirus types (229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63). Specimens collected prior to the 2016-2017 study year were tested by singleplex RT-PCR using primers and probes developed by the CDC Division of Viral Diseases, Gastroenteritis, and Respiratory Viruses [15] . Specimens collected in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 years were tested using the FTD Respiratory Pathogen 33 multiplex PCR kit (Fast Track Diagnostics). Co-infections were defined ARI associated with the detection of 2 or more HCoV in the same specimen. Reinfection was defined as detection of the same or different HCoV type during an ARI with new onset of symptoms 14 or more days from the onset of a previously reported illness.",

This has become more urgent currently given the importance of knowing how long immunity might last after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Given the age structure of our cohort, and high levels of pre-existing antibody, nearly all infections observed in this study are likely reinfections. However, nearly a third of all identified infections were confirmed reinfections during enrollment with an average duration of 505 days between infections. In primary analyses, we observed that the risk of infection with beta coronaviruses was higher if an individual had a beta coronavirus infection in the immediately prior study year. This effect was attenuated in sensitivity analyses conditioning only on those with a prior infection suggesting that this result is likely due to confounding by unmeasured shared risk factors for infection rather than a specific biological effect. Regardless, this finding underscores the frequency of reinfection in this cohort.",

            "text": "While there have been several recent studies on antibody to the seasonal HCoVs in those infected with SARS-CoV-2, there have been few looking at the antibody response of RT-PCR confirmed seasonal infection [23, 24] . We used a multiplex binding assay that included SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, seasonal coronavirus prefusion-stabilized spike protein constructs made using techniques developed for studying vaccine response [19, [25] [26] [27] . We found high levels of antibody binding the spike protein of the seasonal viruses and very low levels binding SARS-CoV-2 antigens in this pre-Covid-19 population. Individuals in this study were infected with seasonal HCoV despite these high levels of binding antibody, and had very modest increases in antibody following infection suggesting a ceiling effect. Consistent with this observed infection despite high antibody levels, there was no significant evidence that homologous binding antibody correlated with protection. This analysis was limited by lack of antibody measurements A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 15 in a completely uninfected control group, and by a relatively narrow distribution of pre-infection antibody binding levels in this population. We also did not measure neutralizing antibody which is likely to be a better correlate of protection. While binding assays for SARS-CoV-2 have correlated well with neutralizing antibodies in recent studies of response to infection or vaccination with the novel virus [26, [28] [29] [30] [31] , it is possible that is not the case with the repeat infection that occurs with the seasonal viruses.",

However, we have not determined precisely how frequently this occurs in a broad population nor is it evident whether this will apply to A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 16 SARS-CoV-2 reinfection or infection after vaccination. Still, it does suggest that duration of immunity will probably be limited by either waning immunity or viral antigenic drift, at least in some of the population, and supports careful determination of the need for booster vaccinations as time from original immunization increases. Careful monitoring of the ways in which repeated vaccination and reinfection shape the development of immunity are also warranted. This has implications for the use of immune assays as it is possible that the close relation between binding and neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 relates to the novelty of the virus. The need for periodic revaccination should not be viewed with alarm, since it has been the practiced for many years with influenza. Such booster immunizations, through updated reformulation, could also address possible antigenic changes, now becoming a major concern as novel variants continue to be identified globally.",

For each study year, only an individual's first HCoV infection was respective any type, type-specific, and genus-specific analyses; subsequent HCoV infections during the same study year were ignored. Because individuals could contribute to multiple years and be infected multiple times, robust variance was calculated for Cox proportional hazards models.AUC values from the ECLIA were adjusted by subtracting the BSA AUC value, and if any negative values resulted, adding a constant such that the minimum value for each target antigen was equal to 1. AUC values for each antigen were log 2 transformed and the geometric mean calculated at each time point: pre-infection, post-infection, and subsequent post-infection. Changes in antibody binding from pre-to post-infection were calculated as the difference in geometric mean AUC. The number and proportion of individuals with 2-fold and 4-fold increases in AUC from pre-to post-infection were also calculated. Analyses of geometric means and infection response were only calculated among individuals with single infections; participants who had coinfections or more than one infection per year were excluded. The rate of antibody waning and half-life was estimated in linear generalized estimating equation models predicting log 2 AUC by time. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated comparing multiplex and singleplex AUC at each time point (Supplemental",

To investigate the possibility that the increased risk of reinfection might be due to confounding by unmeasured risk factors for infection, we performed a sensitivity analysis restricting to only those individuals with any seasonal HCoV infection in the prior year. Hazard ratios consistently shifted lower in this analysis(Table 1); the increased hazard of beta coronavirus reinfection was attenuated and no longer statistically significant, while the reduced hazard of alpha coronavirus reinfection was strengthened and statistically significant.Serologic studies: We selected all individuals with common coronavirus infection between 2011 and 2018 who had paired serum collected in the in the fall or summer prior to their infection and in the spring or summer following their infection for serologic studies (201 of the 1004 total infections). Of these 201, 42 were from individuals infected with 229E, 41 with HKU1, 40 with NL63, and 78 with OC43. Of these, 167 had a subsequent post-infection specimen collected in a later study year. The ages of individuals included in serologic studies ranged from 3 to 67, mainly from younger adults (median: 38 years). Pre-infection specimens were collected between 2 and 216 days prior to infection (median: 60); post-infection Antibody against seasonal coronaviruses: Individuals included in the serologic portion of this analysis were infected despite high binding antibody levels against the coronavirus with which they were infected. In general, pre-infection antibody levels were high against the all 4 seasonal HCoV, with geometric mean AUC ranging from 155,751 against NL63 to 2,225,663 against OC43 (Table 2, Supplemental Figure 2). These geometric mean AUCs were approximately 25 to 360-fold higher than those binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Geometric mean AUCs were remarkably similar overall at pre-infection, post-infection, and subsequent time points (Supplemental Figure 2). Only modest increases in antibody levels to homologous HCoV types were observed following single infection (Table 2, Figure 4). Homologous geometric mean AUC values increased from pre-to postinfection by 1,450,426 for individuals infected with 229E, by 278,799 with HKU1, by 44,706 with NL63, and by 618,993 with OC43. Antibody levels did not substantially change from pre-to post-infection for other non-homologous common coronaviruses, although, sporadic individuals had cross-reactive responses following infection. Antibody levels post infection were durable; statistically significant waning of homologous antibody was not observed (Figure 4, Supplemental",
