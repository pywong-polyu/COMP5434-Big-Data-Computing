The current study synthesizes the literature on e-mentoring to affect the health and well-being of youth (10-24 years) through a systematic review and evidence quality assessment. A total of 833 records were identified, of which 14 met eligibility criteria (published in English since 1995, targeted youth health and/or youth with health issues, and communication was entirely digital or combined with in-person interaction). The results showed that the majority of health-focused e-mentoring studies were conducted with young people with existing health conditions rather than on the use of e-mentoring to promote overall health and wellness. The included programs focused largely on bringing mentoring to youth subpopulations that may be challenged by in-person models. Quality assessments of the included studies showed that the strength of the evidence is mediocre. The findings suggest that e-mentoring has the potential to reach youth with unique health concerns and to promote independent management of health conditions as youth transition to adulthood; however, more rigorous evaluation of e-mentoring programs with larger sample sizes is needed.",

While technology is now being incorporated into a variety of mentoring programs targeting multiple youth subgroups and outcomes of interest, evidence regarding the effectiveness of using technology to facilitate mentoring is still nascent. Digital technology has been used with some success in the context of health behavior interventions, such as health-focused apps and telehealth, and may inform the incorporation of technology into health-focused youth mentoring. However, the state of the literature on the combining of mentoring and technology as it impacts youth health has not been synthesized to date.

Mentors provide guidance, support, and encouragement to cultivate healthy development (DuBois et al., 2011; Stoff, 2016) . Mentoring has been widely adopted as an intervention strategy to promote the academic success, social-emotional growth, and career readiness of youth and to prevent harmful behaviors that lead to poor outcomes (e.g., delinquency, truancy, substance use) as young people enter adulthood (USAID, 2016) . Unlike mental health treatment and other types of health care, mentoring is provided by an individual without advanced professional training as a health care provider (e.g., licensed therapist).

The objective of this systematic review was to examine the empirical literature on e-mentoring initiatives designed to improve youth health outcomes, as mentors are well positioned to guide youth on engaging in healthy behaviors that they can carry into late adolescence and young adulthood. E-mentoring could enhance the ability for mentoring relationships to address sensitive health topics or increase access to mentors for youth with particular health concerns. The current review sought to address what populations of youth (age range, gender, health status, etc.) are being targeted for healthrelated e-mentoring (Research Question 1) and to assess evidence for the efficacy of e-mentoring interventions for improving youth health outcomes (Research Question 2).",

Given the interest in both adolescent and young adult health in the context of mentoring, studies of young people (aged 10-24 years), in line with the World Health Organization's definition of youth, were included. For this review, e-mentoring refers to a meaningful relationship between a young person and an adult or an older peer with shared life experience who is acting in a nonprofessional capacity. The mentoring could be conducted entirely or in part using digital communication, such as email, text, social media, messaging applications, video calls, or computer platforms used as tools to develop the relationship. This includes the use of technology to support and/or enhance in-person mentoring relationships (e.g., using email communication to stay in touch between in-person meetings to further grow the relationship). For the purposes of this review, e-mentoring does not include the use of web or mobile device-based resources intended for in-person use by a mentor and mentee together. For example, if a mentoring pair uses a website to practice skills while together in person, this was not included as e-mentoring, but if they use a website/mobile app to interact and keep in touch between in-person visits, that was included. In addition, studies of mentoring programs that consisted of only digital mentor training modules (training tools viewed only by mentors) were not included in this review.",

Some mentoring programs include e-mentoring in their program design but do not have the resources to conduct evaluations or publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals. Thus, the published literature included in this review may be biased towards those programs that have sufficient support to conduct evaluations and publish findings. Figure 1 presents a PRISMA diagram to illustrate the literature search, screening, and review process. Following the key word search, two study team members independently screened titles and abstracts in separate steps for inclusion based upon review criteria. Screeners placed an article in a \"proceed\" or \"do not proceed\" folder, which was compared and reviewed by the study team. In cases where there was disagreement, team members discussed the specific study in accordance with the inclusion criteria and determined whether the article in question would proceed along the review cascade. Following the preliminary title screen, article abstracts were read to determine whether the article had the potential to fit all inclusion criteria. These articles then proceeded to full review. Data abstraction for each study included the following: year of publication, characteristics of mentees and mentors, sample size, e-mentoring intervention, outcomes assessed, and outcome statistics. Included articles were reviewed in detail using the National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE) quality appraisal checklists for qualitative and quantitative studies (NICE, 2012) to determine the strength of the evidence presented. Each included article was coded and scored by one of the authors, with 20 percent of the articles double coded. ",

Rather, studies reported on factors that may precede such health behaviors, such as social-emotional outcomes, self-efficacy of the mentees to manage their health condition, perceived social acceptance, or an overall sense of emotional well-being because of the mentoring. Studies that have been published to date have focused on reporting e-mentoring interventions that targeted a subpopulation of youth with a given health issue and the impact of said mentoring on amelioration of the particular health challenge (such as pain management or reduction in depressive symptoms). The quality of the quantitative studies was mediocre, with just two that were coded as fulfilling most items required for the quality assessment (Gregg et al., 2017; Stinson et al., 2016) , five fulfilling some of the criteria, and one fulfilling few or no items in the checklist. The quality of the qualitative studies was much higher, with six fulfilling all or most of the criteria in the checklist and two fulfilling some of the criteria (see Table 2 ). While studies often mentioned the ages of the mentees and mentors, and sometimes the gender or other demographic characteristics, they tended to not analyze results by mentee developmental stage or gender. Findings are described relating to these factors for studies in which they were included.",

A vast majority of the mentors (90.9%) and the mentees (93%) were female. The studies reported that mentees demonstrated improvements in their perceived ability to manage JIA (Stinson et al., 2016) and may have provided unexpected support for mentors' own illness self-management, as mentors were slightly older peers who also had JIA (Kohut et al., 2017) . Peer mentors provided and received both informational support (knowledge, facts, advice on actions) and emotional support (caring, concern, empathy, sympathy) from both mentees and fellow mentors (Kohut et al., 2017) . Mentoring pairs tended to spend time discussing the impact of their illness and self-management, but they also focused on nonillness related issues relevant to youth (e.g., post-secondary goals, hobbies, social environments) (Kohut et al., 2018) .",

In a content analysis of the email messages, the e-mentoring relationship seemed to develop in a similar way to in-person mentoring relationships (personal acquaintance phase, exploring mutual interests, etc.). Data showed that mentees enjoyed the program, felt accepted by their mentors, and that mentors appreciated the opportunity to assist others. A second study also analyzing email exchanges from this program reported evidence that email communication may have helped to reduce the visibility of participant disabilities and helped mentees to feel like more \"typical\" youth (Shpigelman et al., 2009) .",

If youth with health concerns or disabilities feel like more \"typical\" youth as a result of guidance from a mentor Letourneau et al., 2012; Shpigelman & Gill, 2013) , particularly one with a shared experience, this may help facilitate longer term outcomes, such as academic achievement, disability or illness management, or coping with health issues. E-mentoring could potentially impact positive identity development, serving as a mediator for achieving desired program outcomes. There may also be benefits to mentors in these digital mentoring programs (Kohut et al., 2017; Shpigelman et al., 2008) , as they are provided with an opportunity to share their own journey with health challenges with a young person just beginning that path (if the mentor has a shared experience). While mentor benefits were not a focus of this review, few studies examined any impact on the mentors working with youth, despite the mentors often sharing health experiences similar to the mentees.",

The focus was on e-mentoring interventions that targeted health and wellness outcomes for youth; however, the state of the research showed a focus on e-mentoring for young people with existing health challenges. The next phase in research on digital mentoring should include examination of the use of e-mentoring platforms for use with larger, more diverse youth populations as a form of disease prevention and health promotion. This review was also limited in that it is focused on published peer-reviewed papers. Gray literature, doctoral dissertations, and other unpublished articles could add more substance to the body of knowledge in this nascent field of study, especially given that so many programs tend to have small numbers of participants, thus making it difficult to find statistically significant effects in evaluations and potentially leading to publication bias.",

This review was systematic and utilized a quality assessment checklist to determine the strength of this evidence to date. This review's focus on health issues revealed additional potential benefits of e-mentoring beyond its ability for mentoring to be accessed by hard-to-reach youth. Such technology-driven or -enhanced mentoring programs allow young people who suffer from a potentially stigmatizing condition or characteristic to receive mentorship even if they are physically unable to engage in more traditional community-based mentoring programs. E-mentoring also allows youth with health conditions to be matched with other individuals with a similar experience regardless of the mentor's geographic proximity, which may allow the youth to normalize their feelings and challenges and to receive practical guidance from someone who understands their experience first-hand. Although preliminary, existing findings suggest that such mentorship may allow youth with health concerns to learn more productive coping strategies and the life skills necessary for a successful transition to adulthood and independent management of a health condition.",

Despite its popularity, knowledge about the effectiveness of e-mentoring for young people is limited, particularly in the context of health-focused mentoring. This study summarized and assessed the existing literature on e-mentoring to affect youth health through a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and an assessment of the literature quality. The review showed that e-mentoring in the context of health is focused largely on youth with specific health conditions, with assessed outcomes focused primarily on youth selfefficacy and the social-emotional aspects of dealing with a health condition. The currently available literature does not shed meaningful light on the impact of e-mentoring on the health of mentees by developmental stage or gender, with many studies too small in sample size to conduct meaningful analyses by youth subgroups. The quality of the literature is variable, with higher quality found in qualitative studies compared to quantitative-focused studies, for which quality was mediocre. Despite the early stage of the literature on e-mentoring to improve youth health, findings of the available studies indicate promise for e-mentoring's ability to reach subpopulations of youth that may be physically unable to meet with mentors in person or that have unique health conditions where a mentor may be difficult to find. Results also are consistent with a potential for e-mentoring for youth health to help youth learn the skills necessary to manage a health condition or disability as they transition to independence in adulthood. Given the ubiquitous use of digital technology to facilitate communication, specifically health communication, it is incumbent upon mentoring programs and health researchers to continue to study the potential effectiveness of e-mentoring to improve the health and well-being of young people.",
