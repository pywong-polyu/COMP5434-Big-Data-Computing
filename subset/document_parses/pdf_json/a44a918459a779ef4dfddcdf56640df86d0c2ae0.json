Lung macrophages are commonly collected through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or tracheal aspiration for subsequent analysis. To minimize the potential impact lag time may have on AM metabolism from the time of macrophage removal from the lung microenvironment to subsequent experimentation, cell ex vivo time should be minimized. Often, BAL samples may not get analyzed immediately after collection (e.g., BAL taken during clinical care) or may need to be shipped to remote sites for analysis. As an alternative, collected lung macrophages can be cryopreserved and revived upon future studies. Although cryopreservation is a common technique for cell culture studies, cryopreserving primary cells can be context-specific and may require fine-tuning of the protocol for better cell revival for subsequent analysis.",

The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was placed on ice and shipped within~2.5 h to the remote site for imaging analysis. We found ozone exposure shifted NAD(H) to a more oxidized redox status in these freshly isolated AM compared to controls [5] . In the present study we used the same technique to investigate and compare the NAD(H) redox status of cryopreserved AM to that of fresh cells with a lag time on ice prior to experimentation which we previously published [5] . In both cases mice were exposed to ozone or FA prior to AM isolation. Because fresh cells were found to be more oxidized compared to the cryopreserved cells when mice were exposed to ozone, but no such redox difference was observed when mice were exposed to FA, we hypothesized and investigated the following. We postulated that the~2.5-h time interval during which the fresh cells were kept on ice led to nutrient starvation and that the double \"hit\", i.e., ozone exposure and nutrient starvation, placed the fresh cells at a disadvantage for full recovery. Using a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line, we show that this is indeed the case.",

The fresh AM in BAL fluid were on ice for ~2.5 h before being cultured in RPMI 1640 medium for imaging. The redox data for the fresh AM were from our previous report [5] . As shown in Figure 4 , there is no significant redox difference between revived and fresh AM when the mice were exposed to FA ( Figure 4A-C) , indicating revived AM and fresh AM had the same redox status.

We suspected that this significant redox contrast was the result of ozone-induced oxidative stress that prevented AM from a full recovery after resuspension and that the fresh AM were at a disadvantage due to nutrient starvation during shipment.

During this shipment, the cells were under nutrient starvation.

It is known that glucose-starvation results in a more oxidized redox state compared to glucose supplementation [12] [13] [14] . As expected, we observed that nutrient starvation resulted in a significantly higher Fp (by 75%, p < 0.0001), lower NADH (by 56%, p < 0.0001), and a higher redox ratio (by 110%, p < 0.0001) compared to the control, whereas replenishing the cells with 11 mM glucose and 2 mM glutamine immediately fully restored the NAD(H) redox status ( Figure 5A ). The three redox indices, Fp, NADH, and the redox ratio, all went back to their original values. In contrast, when the cells were first exposed to 135 \u00b5M hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) for 0.5 h followed by rinsing off the H 2 O 2 , then underwent nutrient starvation for 2.5 h in 2 \u2022 C, the same nutritional replenishment only partially restored the redox status despite that the H 2 O 2 was removed ( Figure 5B) . Specifically, the hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress plus the nutrient starvation resulted in a 142% Fp increase (p < 0.0001), a 67% NADH decrease (p < 0.0001), and a 147% increase in the redox ratio (p < 0.0001). Apparently, the oxidative stress plus nutrient starvation shifted the cells to a much more oxidized state than nutrient starvation alone. Upon nutrient supplementation, neither Fp nor NADH went back to their original values, and the redox ratio stayed at 0.41 \u00b1 0.034, which is significantly different from the original 0.26 \u00b1 0.013 (p < 0.0001). This indicates that exogenous H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress profoundly affected an alveolar macrophage's capacity to regain its redox status upon nutritional replenishment.

This indicates that exogenous H2O2-induced oxidative stress profoundly affected an alveolar macrophage's capacity to regain its redox status upon nutritional replenishment. The NAD(H) redox status was fully restored upon replenishing with glucose and glutamine when AM had no prior oxidative insult before nutrient starvation (n = 4), where \"starv\" = AM in nutrient-free medium at 2 \u00b0C for 2.5 h; \"starv + nutri\" = cells replenished with 11 mM glucose + 2 mM glutamine after \"starv\".

We observed that revived AM had a similar density of attached cells and a similar morphology to fresh AM. This is the first study to our knowledge that investigated cryopreserved mouse alveolar macrophages, as lack of cryopreserved mouse AM analysis has been mentioned as a major limitation in the literature [17] . Nevertheless, our overall observations are consistent with literature reports from other species. For example, using rabbit AM, Lamb et al. reported that no morphologic or adherence characteristics changes occurred after AM were frozen, stored (1 week), and revived; cryopreservation also maintained the primed state of cells [18] . McLemore et al. reported no decrease in human AM viability after 2 weeks of cryopreservation, but a slight decrease in viability after storing in liquid nitrogen for 4 weeks or longer was observed [19] . More recently, Shanthikumar et al. reported 88 vs. 90% live cells between fresh and cryopreserved AM in BAL of three children with cystic fibrosis, using single-cell flowcytometry [20] .",

Using a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line, we further investigated why fresh AM had larger redox shifts than the cryopreserved ones by studying the hypothesis that the~2.5 h lag time of fresh cells on ice prior to experimentation resulted in nutrient starvation. We further hypothesized that this, along with ozone exposure, contributed to a significant difference in redox status between fresh and cryopreserved cells. The results obtained are consistent with this idea. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reports that with prior oxidative stress, fresh mouse AM in BAL fluid placed on ice for 2.5 h may not be fully recovered to their original metabolic state after resuspension, even if the cells are still viable. The results also indicate that revived AM from cryopreservation could be adopted for future metabolic studies of AM, unless the isolated fresh AM can be immediately placed in culture.",

The redox ratio of AM from female SP-A2 mice was more resistant to ozoneinduced change than that from males. However, such a sex difference was not significant in AM from SP-A KO mice. Thus, it is likely that cryopreservation will exhibit similar effects on AM from female SP-A KO mice. Studies with additional mouse models are needed to confirm whether sex and SP-A status play a significant role in the beneficial effects of cryopreservation.",

We also found the NAD(H) redox status in cryopreserved AM was shifted to a more oxidized state after mice were exposed to ozone, consistent with the results obtained with fresh AM. However, with prior oxidative stress induced by ozone, fresh AM were more oxidized in their NAD(H) redox status compared to immediately cryopreserved ones. The degree of oxidation difference between the two sets of cells is likely due to the additional oxidative \"hit\", i.e., nutrient starvation. This study has major implications for clinical studies where lung macrophages from human tracheal aspirates and BAL may not be possible to be analyzed the same day or at the same location, and thus the cryopreservation of the alveolar macrophages will provide flexibility towards translational bench research. Therefore, the optical redox imaging modality in conjunction with this cryopreservation method may be applied to human lung macrophages to study the alteration of the NAD(H) redox status in patients exposed to oxidative stress.",
