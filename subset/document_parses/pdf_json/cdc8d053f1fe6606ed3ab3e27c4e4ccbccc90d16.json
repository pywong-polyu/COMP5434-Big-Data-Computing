Instead, both the Resilient and Vulnerable groups with early family risk, showed a steeper diurnal slope unique to higher stress and a flatter slope unique to higher negative affect.

In humans, the cortisol diurnal rhythm is the daily circadian pattern of cortisol secretion peaking around 20-30 min after awakening followed by a decline throughout the day to its nadir 2 to 3 h after sleep onset 1 . Cortisol's diurnal slope is derived from this decline from wake cortisol levels to pre-sleep cortisol levels, with a steady decline indicating healthy cortisol regulation 2 . Flattened cortisol diurnal slopes occur when there is lower wake cortisol levels or sustained elevation of cortisol levels at pre-sleep 3 . Flattened cortisol diurnal slopes are linked to poorer emotional and physical health such as cardiovascular diseases in a meta-analysis of 80 studies across all ages ranging from children to older adults 4 .",

Individuals with high resilience capacity, defined as the trait of bouncing back from hardship 11 , evaluate challenges as manageable and respond better to stress. However, few studies have examined the role of resilience capacity, stress, and affect with cortisol diurnal slope on a daily basis, with most studies focussing on momentary cortisol levels or reactivity. To our knowledge, no studies have examined whether resilience capacity moderates the links of naturally occurring daily stress and affect with cortisol diurnal slope. Impact of daily stress and affect on cortisol diurnal slope. Daily stress refers to the daily demands of everyday living, including commuting, arguments, and work deadlines 20 . Daily stress and chronic stress impact cortisol diurnal slope differently but daily stress is rarely uniquely studied 21 . Yet, the daily variations in cortisol to daily changes are important to study as they exert downstream biological processes relevant to disease 1 . A naturalistic daily study showed cortisol diurnal slopes are steepened due to higher wake cortisol levels among older adults who reported higher frequency of stressors 20 . Overall, there is a lack of daily studies examining the relationship between daily stress and cortisol diurnal slope, with most examining momentary cortisol levels. These studies found momentary cortisol increases during the anticipation and experience of stressors 7, 22 , and to higher perceived stress 23 . The association between higher momentary and wake cortisol levels with higher stress may be explained by the higher engagement of HPA-axis to meet the demands of the situation 24 . This adaptive response of diurnal cortisol activation if sustained can result in long-term physical and mental health issues 25 .",

High-risk individuals with high emotional regulation show minimal dysregulation in average basal cortisol across time 32 . Among children of parents with HIV, resilience (measured by Connor-Davison Resilience Scale) was associated with steeper cortisol diurnal slopes via less experienced stigma 33 .

Median completion time was preferred over mean time as it was possible that participants partially attempted surveys and completed them at a later time, leading to artificially longer completion duration. Participants received hourly push notifications (an average of 4 prompts), with backup SMS or automatic calls if surveys were not completed within time window. Surveys were completed via MetricWire mobile application on Android or iOS operating system. Participants attended a 1-h orientation session before starting the daily study, where they were trained in data collection protocol and provided with instruction manuals for completing surveys and saliva collection. *Participants who joined the study during COVID-19 restrictions were given the instructions through a recorded video and supported through teleconference platform Zoom.

Instead, the Resilient and Vulnerable groups both demonstrated a steeper diurnal cortisol slope with high stress compared to the Control group. Additionally, the Resilient group showed a flatter diurnal slope with high NA compared to the Control or Vulnerable groups. Hypothesis 1 was partially supported. Higher PA was associated with a steeper, negative cortisol diurnal slope, consistent with previous research 3, 29 . There were no significant associations between daily stress and NA with cortisol diurnal slope. The absence of a significant association for daily stress is consistent with similar null findings in other studies that controlled for affect as our study did 3, 7, 22 . Other studies also found null associations between NA with cortisol diurnal slopes or associations in the opposite direction to our hypothesis, requiring the consideration of arousal levels of NA or the interpretation of NA as harmful or not in measuring these associations 3, 58 . Differences in our findings compared to existing literature also may be attributable to our collection of 2 saliva samples daily for 14 days, which better characterizes between-subject differences on cortisol slope 2 . Contrary to our prediction, the Vulnerable group did not exhibit an overall flatter cortisol diurnal slope than the Resilient or Control groups, perhaps because their early family risk was not at the severity or chronicity of abuse or maltreatment where flatter cortisol diurnal slopes previously have been shown.

The Resilient group did not show the hypothesized weakened interaction with stress/affect on cortisol diurnal slope. Instead, for high stress, both the Resilient and Vulnerable groups had steeper diurnal slopes compared to the Control group. The Resilient group's steeper slope accompanied by higher wake cortisol levels may be explained by a greater engagement of the HPA-axis in approaching and managing demands 23 . The wake cortisol levels in the Vulnerable group did not change by stress, which may be explained by controlling NA (i.e., emotional distress) that often accompanies managing stress. Curiously, the Control group showed a flatter diurnal slope to high stress, contrary to existing literature 20 . The reason is unclear but our study 59 . At high NA levels, the Resilient group showed a significantly flatter cortisol diurnal slope compared to both the Vulnerable and Control groups. Our assumption was that the better psychological outcomes found among individuals with high resilience capacity compared to those with low resilience capacity 60 would translate to healthier physiological outcomes in adverse situations. The flatter cortisol diurnal slope among the Resilient group compared to the similarly high-risk Vulnerable group may be interpreted as a heightened physiological sensitivity to emotional distress, reflecting a physiological cost for psychological adjustment 61 . These speculations need further exploration. Nevertheless, both the Resilient and Vulnerable groups showed flatter diurnal slope to high NA, which is indicative of the allostatic load of higher family risks resulting in heightened vigilance to threat (i.e., negative experiences) and therefore greater physiological reaction 62 or greater susceptibility to the detrimental effects of emotional distress 63 . The non-significant association between NA and cortisol diurnal slope for the Control group may be explained by their perception of NA as non-threatening 58 .",

However, the steeper cortisol diurnal slope at high PA for the Control group suggests that the riskier family backgrounds of the Vulnerable and Resilient groups may predispose them to less physiological responsivity to PA. It is also possible that the different groups experienced different arousal levels of PA, which has been shown to affect cortisol diurnal slope. Specifically, high arousal PA has been linked to steeper cortisol slope 29 . However, our study did not differentiate between arousal levels. Nevertheless, these findings collectively suggest a unique pathway between resilience capacity and cortisol diurnal slope responses to negative vs positive emotions 64 . Further, there may be a difference in physiological sensitivity to affective valence between those from high and low risk families, such that the high risk Vulnerable and Resilient groups were more physiologically sensitive to demands and distress whereas the low risk Control group was more responsive to positive emotions.",

This conjecture finds a basis in studies that proposed the programming of HPA-axis at sensitive early periods of development 65 . Additionally, the different cortisol diurnal slope changes to stress (i.e., demand) compared to NA (i.e., distress) support the need to look at these variables separately in future studies. Despite the groups not significantly differing in diurnal slope on average, meaningful differences emerged by stress and affect with the Control group showing opposite trends in cortisol diurnal slope responses when compared to their high risk Vulnerable and Resilient counterparts. These findings suggest that some of the conflicting results in cortisol research may be attributable to the lack of differentiation by resilience and family risk. Future cortisol studies may benefit from differentiating individuals by early risks and resilience capacity 66 .",

Moreover, cortisol levels only index part of physiological health 68 and are not a pure estimate of HPA-axis functioning 69 . As with most daily studies, missing data was inevitable. Although the participants were grouped into high and low-risk families, the overall family risk is still low. Further, the sample size of each group varied, and family risk was measured retrospectively.

The compliance rate in our study was comparable to the 73-81% cohort compliance rate found in a meta-analysis of mobile EMA studies examining health-related and psychological constructs within a non-clinical adult population 71 . Also, we cross-checked reported saliva collection time against survey completion time and self-reported wake and sleep time, allowing higher confidence in our cortisol data accuracies 49 . Reviews on salivary cortisol collection have emphasized maximizing compliance while maintaining low participant burden as priorities 72 . We collected two saliva samples daily for 14 days, which should better characterize between-subject differences on cortisol slope 2 . Most prior studies collect more saliva samples across fewer days, some only on a single day 52 . The EMA design helped reduce retrospective recall bias. Given that the definition of resilience necessitates the presence of adversity, we measured the resilience of our participants against a context of early family life risk and current transitory stress by studying emerging adults at a developmental transition who moved at least interstate often internationally for tertiary studies. Most studies measure resilience based on self-report without the reporting of risks 34 . We also categorized participants from low-risk families into the Control group as demographically similar comparisons. However, our results could be even more confidently stated if we had an additional comparison group with low family risk and high emotional distress.",
