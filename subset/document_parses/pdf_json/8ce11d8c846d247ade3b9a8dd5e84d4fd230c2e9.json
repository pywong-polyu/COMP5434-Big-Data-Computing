This completes the ward likelihood for direct transmission pairs (Supplementary Fig. 5), which describes the probability of a primary case on ward k infecting a secondary case on ward l on the day of infection of the secondary case and is given by D(0)[F, 2]. To extend this model to account for unobserved infections, we analytically integrate over potential ward states (the unobserved ward of an unobserved infection on a given day) in a manner similar to the convolution over possible infection times of unobserved infections used in the generation time likelihood + ! # . Formally, we calculate the probability of the most recent sampled ancestor 5 ! , registered on a given ward k, causing infection in case i, registered on a given ward l, after 6 ! generations of infection. This approach requires knowledge of the ward of 5 ! on the day the unobserved chain of infections leading to case i begins, which in turn requires knowledge of the time of infection of the first unobserved infection between 5 ! and i (Supplementary Fig. 5). Infection times of later cases in the unobserved transmission chain are not required as these infection events are not linked to either of the observed cases 5 ! or i and therefore do not feature in the ward likelihood. As the default Outbreaker model does not impute infection times of unobserved infections, we extended the model to impute an additional set of augmented data H ! /01 , called the ancestral infection time and defined as the infection time of the earliest unobserved infection in an unobserved transmission chain separating 5 ! and i.",

Given this parameterization it is possible to integrate over the unobserved transmission pathways linking a given ward k to a given ward l over 6 ! generations of infection. We do so by first defining all potential transmission routes between any two wards in a single unobserved generation of infection (Supplementary Fig. 6). Fast integration over these transmission routes that accounts for all combinations of ward transfers and infection events can be achieved by matrix multiplication of J(1) and D(0) such that the elements of J(1) \u00d7 D(0) describe the probability of an unobserved individual that was infected on ward k causing infection on ward l after one unobserved generation of infection.The probability of each route(Supplementary Fig. 6)is conditional on the primary case becoming infected on that given ward in the previous generation of infection. The matrix product J(1) \u00d7 D(0) can therefore be multiplied by itself in a recursive manner to integrate over transmission pathways for greater numbers of unobserved infections, where each multiplication by J(1) \u00d7 D(0) represents the movement of infection in one unobserved generation.",

Thus, our model captures 'observed' secondary cases which are either themselves detected, or whose own descendants of transmission are detected. In contrast, unobserved secondary infections are those which are not detected by the model. These infections are unobserved because both they and their descendants are undetected by the model. To calculate the true number of secondary cases (Z), including both observed and unobserved, calculate the unconditional probability distribution of true cases using the expression: \"(N = [) = \u2211 !67 \"(N = [ | D = :)\"(D = :). We then define the distribution of the number of unobserved secondary infections by, \"(J = F) = (\u2211 18\" \"(X =^)(1 \u2212 /) 1 ) , for k>0 \"(J = 0) = 1 \u2212 \"(J \u2265 1) where / is the reporting probability and \"(X) is the probability distribution of the number of cases in a cluster of descendants (including itself).

Circles represent infection times, triangles dates of symptom onset, squares dates of onward infection. Red curved lines indicate the generation time distribution. (A) A case i and its infector are both sampled. The wards of the infectee and infector are directly observed and the probability of infection between these wards on the day of infection can be directly calculated. (B) A case i and its most recent sampled ancestor! ! are separated by an unobserved infection. The ancestral infection time \" ! \"#$ is imputed and the potential ward states of the unobserved individual on the day of infection and day of onward infection are integrated over. (C) A case i and its most recent sampled ancestor ! ! are separated by two unobserved infections. The ancestral infection time \" ! \"#$ is imputed and the ward states of both unobserved infections integrated over. Supplementary Fig. 6. Integrating over transmission pathways to a given ward l. Each row represents a ward. Black circles represent the ward the primary case is infected on. Black squares represent the ward of the primary case on the day of onward infection. Grey circles represent the ward the secondary case is infected on. A case remains on the ward it was infected on with probability #. An infection occurs within a ward with probability $. All probabilities described in this figure are conditional on the primary case becoming infected on that",
