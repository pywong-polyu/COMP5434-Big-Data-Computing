This is due to a high amount of uncertainty and ambiguity particularly in the early stages of a crisis (Mirbabaie, Bunker, Stieglitz, Marx, & Ehnis, 2020) . Problems of information overload, rumors, conflicting information, and mis-or disinformation (Mirbabaie et al., 2020) can result from this behavior. Whereas misinformation means propositional content that is false but unintentional, disinformation is propositional content that is false on purpose (Mingers & Standing, 2018) . Previous research showed that the virality of misinformation increases during crisis events (King & Wang, 2021) .",

The avalanche of information mixed with misinformation on social media was in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic referred to as an \"Infodemic\" (Zarocostas, 2020) , which illustrates the issues which need to be dealt with in crisis social media communication. The uncontrolled diffusion of mis-and disinformation leads to an increased demand for reliable and up-to-date information by the general public (Elbanna, Bunker, Levine, & Sleigh, 2019) . Emergency Management Agencies (EMAs) are struggling to cover the demand , and thus, sophisticated solutions for filling the information gap are needed. This is also due to challenges in information exchange and management such as inaccessibility of information, inconsistent formats, inadequate information streams, a low priority of information diffusion, a difficult source identification, a media storage misalignment, unreliability or unwillingness of stakeholders (Altay & Labonte, 2014) . As governmental actors (Aladwani & Dwivedi, 2018) , EMAs need resources or approaches to interact with a large quantity of concerned citizens (Zhang, Fan, Yao, Hu, & Mostafavi, 2019) . The social media communication pattern is a one-to-many (EMA-to-public) and many-to-one (public-to-EMA) communication for which robust practices and solutions still need to be developed.",

            "text": "One important solution space to improve crisis response and emergency management is the use of information and communication technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) (Fan, Zhang, Yahja, & Mostafavi, 2021) . AI can be used not only for direct crisis response during natural disasters, but also to support long-term aims such as sustainability (Nishant, Kennedy, & Corbett, 2020) . During hard to predict crisis situations such as during the Covid-19 pandemic, AI-based systems can assist managers and leaders in making effective and efficient decisions . Thus, AI-based systems can be used to analyze crisis-relevant images and assign them to a region using semantic content classification or to assess damage to specific objects, such as bridges or roads. Furthermore, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining techniques can be applied to detect and predict critical events and identify patterns based on social media data (Fan et al., 2021) . Another approach of applying NLP is the use of Conversational agents (CAs) (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2021a , 2021b . They can not only interact with users in natural language (McTear, Callejas, & Griol, 2016) but also provide an enjoyable user experience (Diederich, Brendel, & Lichtenberg, 2019) . CAs are capable of assisting users in a variety of tasks such as answering frequently asked questions or providing ideas and inspiration at the workplace (Lembcke, Diederich, & Brendel, 2020) .",

In contrast, EMAs facing crisis situations have unique requirements such as speed, effectiveness and efficiency (Fan et al., 2021) that directly or indirectly affect the safety of human lives. This makes it problematic to rely on knowledge about CA design that was solely developed in the context of commercial organizations and businesses. We think that existing knowledge cannot simply be adopted in an emergency management environment but needs to be carefully transferred and developed. The requirements of EMAs for structure, responsibilities and operations' management significantly differ from those of commercial organizations Hofeditz et al., 2019) . Thus, it is crucial to derive specific design principles of CAs in crisis communication so that they can suit the needs of EMAs in crisis situations. We therefore aim to answer the following research question from a lens of interpretivism and a constructivism ontology (Goldkuhl, 2012) :",

Our aim was to understand how CAs need to be designed to support EMAs in their crisis communication. For this, we needed to conduct data for further interpretation. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with crisis management experts in Australia and Germany. Through this research, this study will enrich knowledge about CAs in crisis situations and about fighting disasters by revealing the special requirements that EMAs have for CAs, and by comparing these against current CA design principles in IS research. Furthermore, by introducing specific design principles for CAs in crisis situations, this study provides a foundation which practitioners may use to develop more sophisticated CAs, and thereby help the fight against \"Infodemics\" by reducing information overload and reducing false information during large scale crisis events.",

EMAs are operating in two distinct modes, an operational mode, when they are responding to a crisis event, and a non-operational mode in between crisis events . Although cooperation between different EMAs is highly important during crisis events, prior research showed that EMAs often lack interoperability due to vastly different goals among organizations (Shareef et al., 2019) . Altay & Pal (2014) therefore examined, how information diffusion can be increased by establishing trust and a high level of information quality. Following an agent-based modeling approach, they concluded that cluster leads should act as hubs and establish long-term relationships in order to facilitate and filter information between agencies. For this, humanitarian operations also need to lead complex interaction between deployed technology and humanitarian groups. Considering the complex character of humanitarian operations that arises, among crisis-related issues, from rapidly formed teams, intergroup leadership might reduce complexity and increase performance among the various subgroups (Dubey et al., 2020; Salem, Van Quaquebeke, Besiou, & Meyer, 2019) .",

EMAs realized the value social media can provide and adopted various social media platforms to their communication portfolio to provide timely trustworthy information, counter rumors and misinformation, and provide recommendations for individual actions (Elbanna et al., 2019; Hofeditz et al., 2019) . Previous research highlighted that demographic characters and ethnical groups differ in responses and behaviors during crisis events, resulting in different communication strategies for EMAs (Yuan, Li, Liu, Zhai, & Qi, 2021) . While EMAs have adopted social media platforms for communication with the public, they often lack the ability to systematically track and analyze social media data . However, activities such as identifying and analyzing potential emergency and crisis situations, developing coping strategies, and initiating and tracking countermeasures are crucial for successful crisis management (Mirbabaie et al., 2021) . While some of these strategies overlap to some extent with the approaches used by commercial organizations to engage with their audiences, a distinction must be made between the motives of commercial and EMA organizations. In contrast to traditional commercial organizations whose actions are mainly based on their own economic needs, EMA's overriding goal is to protect people and the common good. To this end, various strategies are applied by EMAs such as (local) community management, volunteer management and research (Fischer-Pre\u00dfler, Schwemmer, & Fischbach, 2019) . These emergency management strategies are aligned to the prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery phases of a crisis (Wenger, 2017) . Emergency management activities include the provision of reliable real-time information during and between crises. EMAs use social media to provide information to the public and only to a much lesser extent to protect their own reputation. Commercial organizations, on the other hand, focus in their crisis communication predominantly on the protection of their own reputation.",

At the same time, EMAs need information from the public, for example, to maintain supply chains during crisis events (Shareef, Dwivedi, Kumar, Hughes, & Raman (2020) . Furthermore, EMAs need to adapt to the ongoing development of the situation and may change communication strategies over time. Therefore, EMAs can distribute information towards non-institutional actors (Abedin & Babar, 2018) , such as members of the general public, and institutional actors, such as media organizations (Mirbabaie et al., 2020) . In this context, it is important that policy makers of the involved (non-) governmental organizations do not only consider crisis response and preparedness but also pursue the prevention of potential crises as well as the reconstruction of the damaged economy (Shodhi, 2016) . The planned operations still need to be communicated and coordinated between the participating parties. For example, Shodhi & Knuckles (2021) highlight the various flows of information, money, and materials among several stakeholders of a development-aid supply chain. The number of different stakeholders including different requirements emphasizes that proper information technology is pressingly needed for successful coordination and collaboration. EMAs are often information starters within the emerging communication networks during a crisis (Nabity-Grover et al., 2020) , whereas individuals are often information amplifiers and information transmitters (Mirbabaie et al., 2020) . While social media technologies are beneficial to support emergency management-relevant tasks (Oh, Eom, & Rao, 2015) , EMAs still seem to struggle with adopting these technologies into their crisis-related operations . Resources, particularly in the early stages of an event, are limited (Power & Kibell, 2017) , and many tasks rely on manual processes .",

Consequently, EMAs cannot just unreflectively implement chatbots which were designed for commercial organizations; there is a need to rethink and critically assess the design requirements which are necessary to successfully utilize social media chatbots in an emergency management environment.

CAs are ISs which can communicate with human users by using and processing natural language (Laumer et al., 2019) . They have been examined in areas such as healthcare (Denecke, Vaaheesan, & Arulnathan, 2020) , education (Demetis & Lee, 2018) or customer service (Gnewuch et al., 2017) . In research, the terms CA, chatbots and digital assistants are sometimes used synonymously (Gnewuch et al., 2017) . Nowadays CAs can act more sophisticatedly and they are applied to several tasks and processes using machine learning (Mirbabaie et al., 2020) . CAs can be embodied which means that they have an animated visual representation that engages face-to-face with users (Norman & Kirakowski, 2018) . CAs are actively used to assist companies in communicating with customers and have been tested in many different cases such as medicine and education (Griol, Carb\u00f3, & Molina, 2012; Laumer et al., 2019) . In a commercial context, CAs are an established technology and they have been found to be very helpful in automating tasks and communication.",

To reduce the problems of rumor spreading and increase reliable information on social media, Ahmady & Uchida (2020) examined the utilization of chatbots providing earthquake-related information in Japan to foreigners. This application showed that chatbots could be used to reduce language barriers and provide reliable real-time information to a specific audience. Furthermore, Tsai et al. (2019) evaluated a CA that is connected to a crisis-related data base. They showed that the CA can help crisis-affected people by providing personnel access to crisis-related data in a flood context. This allowed individuals to follow corresponding response strategies. By this, people mitigate potential harmful information related to the individual decision-making process. Beside the problems of conflicting information, rumors, or information overload, spontaneous volunteers are often a crucial factor for saving lives during a crisis. Gerstmann et al. (2019) investigated the role of CAs for coordinating the behavior of spontaneous volunteers. The scholars emphasized the potential of CAs being applicable for individual assignment and scheduling of volunteers during a crisis. This automated coordination may reduce the work-load of EMAs in crisis situations. Regarding research about CAs and task-support showed that CAs are able to reduce the cognitive load of an individual (Brachten et al., 2020) that may lead to an improved crisis management. CAs such as social media chatbots are already applied and evaluated (Maniou & Veglis, 2020) . The authors investigated a working CA that disseminate accurate, timely as well as customized information. They argue that the CA's ability of providing customized information to the public is helpful to fit the individual preferences of information selection.",

Further research in the context of citizen participation derived distinct design principles describing that CA should provide social cues and conversational capabilities to ensure goal-oriented facilitation as well as display messages in simple and understandable language (Tavanapour, Poser, & Bittner, 2019) . Likewise, Meier, Beinke, Fitte, Behne, & Teuteberg (2020) suggest that CA should meet the user's expectation to enable goal-oriented conversation. To this end, distinct input and output devices should be supported by the CA that is based on an information-focused interface.

Therefore, we followed an exploratory approach to identify design principles for CAs that can be applied by EMAs to improve their crisis communication. As this qualitative research takes the perspective of an \"interpretivist\" ontology, we argue that individuals \"do not passively react to an external reality but, rather, impose their internal perceptions and ideals on the external world and, in so doing, actively create their realities\" (Suddaby, 2006, p.636) . Thus, to obtain and understand the individual perspectives and relationships (Morgan & Smircich, 1980 ), we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews (Myers & Newman, 2007) with representatives of EMAs from Australia and Germany. Two trained researchers coded the transcripts of the interviews. Based on a random interview sample including 62 code segments, a reliability score for coding data of \u03ba = 0.95 could be reached (Cohen, 1960) . Based on the strength of agreement classification by Landis & Koch (1977) , this score can be understood as almost perfect agreement.",

However, we found that in crisis communication there are also specific requirements for CAs to support both organizations and the public. For example, three interviewees (CL, EMI, REC) stated that CAs supporting crisis communication should actively ask users for further information about the crisis in their environment: \"Then you might have a bot that might go, \"Hey, your photo looks really interesting to us. We'd like to use it to help respond better. Could you please tell us when you took the photo, where you took it?\" (EMI).

(2019) who emphasize the importance of CA's social cues for several CAs In the context of disasters, excluding social cues of a CA might lead to a lower application of stereotypes, e.g., gender stereotypes (Nass, Moon, & Green, 1997) . Following, people focus on the information itself and are less biased by entrenched stereotypes. This may allow those affected by the crisis to save cognitive resources and directly convert helpful information into action. This may help EMAs to receive valuable information in order to obtain their supply chains during crisis events (Shareef et al., 2020) . CAs can thus also provide important information as a basis for decision making, which according to Dwivedi et al. (2020) is one of the great potentials of AI-based systems. However, this could differ between types and phases of crises as these differ in terms of crisis communication strategies (Gupta et al., 2016) . Furthermore, the CA needs to consider the EMA's function during the crisis as those might be responsible for specified activities such as forecasting, the distribution of supplies, or the coordination with other (non) government organizations (Gupta et al., 2016) .",

Particularly in the context of transparency and AI, it is important to explain how the users' input is processed and which source is subject to the CA's message. This becomes evident, especially during crisis situations which are characterized by ambiguity and uncertainty (Mirbabaie et al., 2020) , therefore, the CA as a transparent and trustworthy information provider is crucial for resolving these issues. Balakrishnan & Dwivedi (2021a) argue that is important to design the CA transparent in order to help the users perceive the CA intelligent and competence. Transparency by indicating sources and timeliness of a CA's information can also help stakeholders to distinguish real news from fake news, which is often spread during crisis events (King & Wang, 2021) . A next possible step could be an integrated Fake News Detector, which enables people to ask the CA whether information is factual or fake news. This could be realized via a database linked to a fact checking tool. Not only affected citizens could benefit from the implementation of a CA that follows DP2. A CA with this functionality could also be very useful for the communication and exchange of information among EMAs, as the arising trust can lead to a better diffusion of information (Altay & Pal, 2014) . It is therefore highly recommended to consider CAs when developing new and appropriate strategies to deal with crises.",

Providing the CA with the functionality of processing multiple input types and languages allows EMA to collect comprehensive information about the crisis. While users in commercial applications of CAs are usually not able to send information such as videos or location data, these rich information sources become essential in crisis situations (Konicek, Netek, Burian, Novakova, & Kaplan, 2020) . Although our interviews mentioned this in the context of floods in Germany and bushfires in Australia, previous studies also highlighted the usefulness of location data in other countries ( (Holderness & Turpin, 2015) Holderness and Turpin 2015). DP3 is not only relevant for crisis communication during natural disasters, but also for man-made disasters such as terrorist attacks, where information symmetry, completeness of information, private information about terrorist secrecy and deception are important (Gupta et al., 2020) . Here, CAs could use different media types to gather and match information for EMAs. It should also be emphasized that the combination of location data and other data such as images or videos is also of great value for emergency management, since image data of destroyed roads, bridges or other buildings, for example, can be assigned to specific regions (e.g., by means of an AI-based system) (Fan et al., 2021) . The complex and dynamic nature of disaster situations raises the need for supply chain agility (Dubey et al., 2020) and enhanced cooperation between subgroups (Salem et al., 2019) that can be managed by intergroup leadership. In this way, disaster relief material movements can be coordinated and organized. Taking knowledge from operations research, EMAs may use AI-based CAs for (inventory) management of relief materials or the alignment of relief workers (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2021a) . However, collaborative relationships between the various EMAs and relief workers are crucial as no single organization may manage the crisis by its own. This becomes apparent regarding the coordination between different types of organizations such as governmental and non-governmental organization among the supply chain (Shaheen & Azadegan, 2020) .",

This allows the organization to better process and analyze the heterogeneous data, and therefore, quickly provide reliable information. As demographic characters and ethnical groups differ in terms of their responses and general behavior during crisis events (Yuan et al., 2021) , people need to access the CA through multiple contact points such as social media platforms or official websites to reach various target groups as well as the majority of the public. For example, geographical IS and social media are already used to organize local response efforts. However, this is often based on a non-organized open-source approach (Shodhi & Tang, 2014) . Deploying a CA that is connected to EMAs' systems can address challenges raised by Altay & Labonte (2014) such as inaccessibility of information, inconsistent formats, inadequate information streams, a low priority of information diffusion, a difficult source identification or a media storage misalignment by providing a natural communication channel for citizens. Furthermore, it is crucial that gathered information and resources are stored, verified, and distributed to coordinated collaboration partners. To realize this, the collaboration between different departments and EMAs needs to be improved initially, since in some cases they do not function well due to different objectives (Shareef et al., 2019) . However, receiving location-based information raises further challenges on a governmental level (Aladwani & Dwivedi, 2018) as well as for EMA . This highly sensitive information has to be stored, processed and provided to align to the legal requirements of the state. At the same time, the data needs to be protected against abuse.",

This leads to the CA having to refer to a human if he cannot give a reliable answer to the user.
