Factors such as age, underlying disease and antineoplastic treatment confer negatively to the immune response due to vaccination. The degree of immunosuppression though may be lessen by targeted treatments like the androgen receptor-targeted agents (ARTA) that are commonly used in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Herein, we report our data on 25 patients with prostate cancer under treatment with ARTA who were vaccinated for COVID-19. Our data suggest that these patients develop neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 similarly to healthy volunteers. No safety issues were noted.",

Prioritized vaccination of this group of patients has been recommended throughout the world, including European Union. In accordance with the criteria for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, patients with cancer who were undergoing systemic treatment were excluded from trials [3] , triggering the need for further investigation regarding the impact of malignancy and of anticancer drugs on vaccine efficacy. We therefore initiated a large prospective study (NCT04743388), enrolling patients with solid cancers and hematological malignancies, along with a control group of healthy volunteers, for monitoring the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination [4, 5] . Part of this study consisted of the analysis of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination with the BNT162b2, AZD1222 or mRNA-1273 vaccine in patients with prostate cancer who were receiving treatment with an androgen receptortargeted agent (ARTA), namely abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. Several lines of evidence suggest that androgen receptor signaling is implicated in antigen presentation and cellular immunity providing an additional scientific rationale for this cohort of patients [6, 7] . The eligibility criteria for this cohort included: (I) age above 18 years, (II) histologically confirmed prostate cancer under treatment with ARTA and (III) eligibility for vaccination. None of the participants, patients with cancer or control subjects, had a known history of COVID-19.",

Measurement of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 was conducted using FDA approved methodology (ELISA, cPass\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 NAb Detection Kit; GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Samples from the same patient or control subject were measured in the same ELISA plate. The study was approved by the relevant Ethical Committees and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice. All patients and control subjects provided written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. Baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and the NAb levels were compared between the study group and the control subjects, Chi-square test was applied for categorical variables and unpaired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (as appropriate) for continuous variables. To adjust for potential confounding effects of differences in covariates, we used case-control matching to match the two groups for age, and type of vaccine with the calipmatch command in Stata. All data extraction and analyses were conducted using Stata 16.0 (Stata Corp 2019, Stata Statistical Software: Release 16. College Station, TX: Stata Corp LLC).

In our dataset, COVID-19 vaccination was safe and the level of NAbs in these patients was similar to matched healthy volunteers at days 22 and 50 after the first vaccination dose. The magnitude of the immune response was not impaired by the low dose corticosteroids (5 mg prednisone twice a day) co-administered with abiraterone. These data provide significant information regarding the optimal management of prostate cancer patients until completion of vaccination.",
