For the calculation of negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values, we estimated the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow. The data on total cases of COVID-19 from March 6, 2020, to July 20, 2020, were taken from the Rospotrebnadzor website.

For example, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) requires expensive equipment, highly trained operators, and can take days to provide results.

Despite the good fit with the training data, ARIMA(0,2,1), ETS ZZZ, and ETS ANN model predicted almost linear accumulation of COVID-19 cases. In contrast, the actual data showed a gradual decrease in daily incidence ( Figure 1 ). The only model that followed the trend was ETS MMM (multiplicative trend, error, and season type), and we used it to estimate the number of total COVID-19 cases in Moscow. According to the ETS MMM model, the COVID-19 incidence tended to 270,000 subjects. Note that the model provides a very rough forecast horizon; there might be a second wave of the disease and seasonal patterns that we can not reliably predict using the current data. The Federal State Statistics Service reported that, as of January 1, 2020, the Moscow population was 12,678,079 [16] . From these data, the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow, defined as the percentage with the disease in the population at risk, would be 2.1%.",
