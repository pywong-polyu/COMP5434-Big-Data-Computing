Working as a data courier, Johnny smuggles data from a pair of scientists in Beijing who need to get the information to Newark, New Jersey.

And analyses of educational futures-what will pedagogy, posthuman and machine learning, and capital networks influencing educational processes and systems look like in various future scenarios-stand to benefit from more creativity and imagination. We have any number of examples to explore, from novel approaches to mapping out educational futures (such as a wonderful piece by Costello et al. (2020) ) to illustrations of our contemporary condition, such as that provided by Johnny Mnemonic.

There is also the idea of the plasticity of the brain: here, Johnny's brain is able to adapt to the data overload he endures, surviving the ordeal of exceeding the storage capacity in his head. Both of these cases suggest some sort of engagement with questions of postdigital pedagogy and learning, as well as issues of the ethics of posthumanism.",

I had to dump a chunk of long-term memory.' Jane: 'You had to dump a chunk of what?' Johnny: 'My childhood.' Later, Johnny remarks, 'I needed the space for the job'. In the original short story, Johnny tells the reader, 'I had no idea at all of what was really happening, or of what was supposed to happen. And that was the nature of my game, because I'd spent most of my life as a blind receptacle to be filled with other people's knowledge and then drained' (Gibson 1986: 23) . It is worth wondering, in a possible future, what it would take to learn in this way, and what the cost would be. In the case of Johnny, there is a loss of innocence, suggesting that childhood is both expendable and not actually meaningful in terms of the ability of the brain to adapt to technological advances (Simpson and Gibbons 2019) .

In her short story 'Girl in Wave: Wave in Girl', Kathleen Ann Goonan (2014) posits a posthuman future in which medical procedures to eliminate learning difficulties give way to biological enhancements such as children with wings (or, in the case of Johnny, the ability to carry large packets of data in one's brain).

In so doing, it is pioneering fields such as neurobotics and neuromorphic computing with the aim of reconstructing the human brain.

To add yet another wrinkle, Ernest Cline (2020) takes this concept a step further in Ready Player Two, in which the protagonist, Wade Watts, discovers that he can make a copy of anyone to live in the OASIS virtual universe, seemingly forever. Wade makes copies of himself and his friends (as well as the rest of humanity) and uploads them to the OASIS. But something new happens, in which you and your avatar then split off and begin to lead separate lives.

Scott Galloway (in Reed 2021) offers the following scenario: Stanford, which, due to its endowment, now operates effectively like a hedge fund that happens to also run a university, decides it wants to raise $100 billion by issuing its own Stanford crypto-coins. Each coin goes for $1 million dollars, and those who buy them get a set of perks based on contracts written on top of each coin: tuition to Stanford, access to sports events, university parties, and perhaps even to allocate admission for students from communities of color and low-income neighborhoods. This situation, which is certainly possible (if not probable), begs a few questions. What happens to the lie of the meritocracy? How does Stanford fulfill its mission of educating the brightest students from across the socio-economic spectrum? How long does the system hold together when the shareholder class-in this case, the wealthy who own a Stanford coin-literally gets to play god with the futures of students of color and students from poor areas, deciding who gets in and who doesn't?",

            "text": "The future of college admission and tuition here exists squarely in a space of postdigital capitalism. And for universities that do not have the endowment or financial pull of Stanford, such as state schools, there is now also the option of raising funds by auctioning off NFTs. It seems that anyone can sell an NFT. The woman behind the Disaster Girl meme from 2005 raised half a million dollars auctioning the NFT of the image of her smirking as a house burns in the background. Certainly mid-and lower-tier colleges and universities will begin to sell NFTs of, say, graduation ceremonies, homecoming parties, and perhaps even campus tours. So is this the true future of the postdigital university, one in which tuition is paid for-and admission available-now only in blockchain? And if so, what does this portend for higher education in an age of already unsustainable economic inequality?",

We do not get to see what happens next, and how (or if) society resets itself. Left unanswered is the question of what cyberpunk becomes once there is an antidote for the ravages of technology. There is no resolution to issues of technological enhancement of humans as data couriers, no consideration of the ethics of postdigital technology's role in the daily lives of average people, no exploration of the use of NFTs in the evolution of a postdigital capitalism. Matters of pedagogy and the movement of learning-and living-to virtual spaces are left unsettled.",

With the push to return to 'normal'-especially in a return to schools and schooling-will anything have changed? After a year on Planet Zoom, will we reconsider our trajectory towards a postdigital future? Will we, finally, start to consider the multiple educational futures that should (and those that should not) await us? The fear, I think, is that, once we pull off our masks and 'resume' our lives, we will look at 2020-2021 as a blip, an interruption, rather than as an opportunity to reset. If we do that, we will miss the chance to rewire different futures. We need more dispatches from the future (Costello et al. 2020; Kupferman 2020a) . Postdigital science is a wide-open field. How it intersects with educational futures should be wide open as well (see Knox (2019) , for an opening salvo in this regard). We need to dream up what comes next and let our imaginations run wild, so that we begin to anticipate the various potentials of postdigital educational futures, rather than backing into them and hoping that we get it right.",
