Health professionals involved in dysphagia care are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in their day-to-day practices. Otolaryngologists, gastroenterologists, rehabilitation specialists, and speech-language pathologists are subject to virus exposure due to their proximity to the aerodigestive tract and reliance on aerosol-generating procedures in swallow assessments and interventions. Across the globe, professional societies and specialty associations are issuing recommendations about which procedures to use, when to use them, and how to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during their use. Balancing safety for self, patients, and the public while maintaining adequate evidence-based dysphagia practices has become a significant challenge. This paper provides current evidence on COVID-19 transmission during commonly used dysphagia practices and provides recommendations for protection while conducting these procedures. The paper summarizes current understanding of dysphagia in patients with COVID-19 and draws on evidence for dysphagia interventions that can be provided without in-person consults and close proximity procedures including dysphagia screening and telehealth.",

For some, symptoms are much more severe including acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged intubation, severe muscle weakness, dysphagia, cognitive deficits, thrombosis, cerebrovascular events, encephalopathy and multi-organ failure [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .

Airborne transmission refers to infection resulting from inhalation of smaller, pathogen-laden particles that can occur without direct contact or proximity to the source. Critically, pathogens capable of airborne transmission are small enough to pass through or around the edges of a standard surgical mask [14] . Aerosols, defined as collections of particles suspended in a gas, are increasingly recognized as a vector for both droplet and airborne transmission [12, 15] . The difference between respiratory droplet spread and aerosolization is the size of the particles produced and, therefore, the ability for such particles to be deposited within the upper and lower airways and then carried further distally into the respiratory system. Droplets generated by cough vary in size, with larger particles at > 4 \u03bcm settling rapidly, thereby reducing the amount arriving in the lower respiratory tract [16] . Loss of infectivity within 15 min after a cough is estimated to be near 90% even at low RH [16] . In contrast, particles of < 1 \u03bcm are aerosolized and remain viable for hours within room air with approximately 32% loss of infectivity within 15 min [16] . These aerosols can remain viable in the atmosphere for hours and result in delayed exposure.",

Interestingly, some studies have found speaking alone produces a similar number of emission droplets as coughing, with one study estimating that the total number of droplets expelled ranged from 947 to 2085 per cough, 112-6720 for speaking, and lasted 8-14 min in stagnant air [18] .

The magnitude of transmission risk is related to the density of aerosolized particles generated (concentration), proximity to the airway, and duration of exposure [11, 23] . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), procedures commonly recognized as AGPs include: open suctioning of airway secretions, sputum induction, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, endotracheal intubation and extubation, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, bronchoscopy, and manual ventilation prior to intubation [3] (Table 1) .

Additionally, these procedures differ significantly from routine clinical assessments in terms of exposure risk due to the following factors: (1) inability for patients to wear masks or face coverings, due to the necessity for oropharyngeal examination or oral intake; (2) requirement of close proximity to the airway; and (3) prolonged duration of exposure [23] . As a result of their potential as AGPs and involving direct, proximal, and prolonged exposure to the airway, these procedures have been determined by professional societies worldwide, to be high-risk for airborne transmission and requiring the use of enhanced PPE (i.e., air-purifying respirators (PAPR) or N95 masks with face shields) [22, [27] [28] [29] [30] (Table 1) .",

At present, there are no studies addressing the diagnostic accuracy of swallowing screening in patients with COVID-19. However, patients should continue to be screened by trained nurses when possible. Referrals to SLP and otolaryngology should continue in patients with COVID-19, when there are known swallowing concerns or after a failed screen. The nursing role in monitoring nutrition, hydration, and oral intake safety becomes more critical when physical distancing reduces patient contact with other healthcare professionals.

As our understanding of COVID-19 emerges, it is clear that some patients are taking longer to wean than others, with resultant increased incidence of ICU-acquired weakness [52] . The dysphagia team's expertise in management of swallowing and laryngeal functions is essential for tracheostomy weaning and decannulation decisions [53] . Cuff deflation trials and oneway valve trials potentially increase virus transmission by opening the tracheal airway during exhalation and increase coughing [22, 30] . The National Tracheostomy Safety Project (2020) also recommends that in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the decision to deflate the cuff and progress respiratory weaning (including speaking valve trial) should be made in consultation with the care team, carefully weighing the benefits to the individual against the risks of the intervention to both the individual and healthcare staff [54] .",

There is an imminent need to provide effective, appropriate rehabilitation for the large volumes of patients recovering from COVID-19 to ensure they make the best possible recovery.

For patients who were intubated in ICU, there may be multiple mechanisms contributing to dysphagia [56] , including edema, vocal fold immobility, reduced sensation and muscle disuse. Patients who were never intubated may present similarly to patients with influenza or similar respiratory illnesses based on the symptom profile of COVID-19 [57, 58] . ICU survivors, especially those who are mechanically ventilated, often suffer from impairments in physical function, cognitive function, swallowing, and/ or emotional health collectively known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) [59] . These deficits may persist for months or years after a critical illness, and have substantial impact on quality of life, return to work, and disability in activities of daily living [60] . Neurologic symptoms manifest in a notable proportion of patients with COVID-19 [7] . Emerging clinical data suggest approximately 25-30% of COVID-19 survivors are presenting with new neurological impairments, including impaired consciousness, agitation and confusion, dysexecutive syndrome, acute cerebrovascular events, encephalopathy, critical illness myopathy/neuropathy and hypoxia [61] . COVID-19 is being regarded as the newest risk factor for stroke [6, 62] . Delirium may develop in up to 80% of patients in the critical care setting, and in patients with COVID-19, the prevalence of delirium is not only common, but persisting longer, likely due to prolonged use of sedatives (e.g., benzodiazepines) required for intubation. Sedatives may impair swallowing through increased pharyngeal weakness and perturbed respiratory-swallow coordination, contributing to increased risk for aspiration [63] .",

Minimum criteria for safe discharge to a skilled nursing facility or home may need to be fast tracked and implemented at scale. This will require multi-stakeholder engagement, training, and cooperation. Where services are being restored in outpatient facilities, international Association guidelines recommend a staged approach as well as mechanisms for stepping services back down again if needed [56] .

In response, organizations began advocating for telehealth or telepractice where possible to reduce unnecessary person-to-person contact [68] . Telehealth, or the use of telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, is a model that has been used in prior public health emergencies and disasters [69] , and has been implemented as part of standard care in several countries and healthcare systems prior to the current global health crisis. Indeed, prior to this pandemic, telehealth had gained momentum in a variety of disciplines, including the management of dysphagia in research and in clinical practice particularly in countries with rural and remote populations (for example, Australia) [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . A growing body of literature has provided overall positive research evidence for the use of both synchronous (live interaction) and asynchronous (store and forward) telehealth to assess and treat dysphagia, mainly in adults but in some pediatric populations as well. Regarding assessments, both tele-clinical (bedside) and tele-videofluoroscopic swallowing assessments conducted remotely have been repeatedly shown to be safe, valid, and reliable when compared to traditional in-person swallowing evaluations [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] .

As a result, in many settings, clinicians were asked to switch to telehealth or virtual therapy rapidly and without any preparation.",

In outpatient settings, many clinics have partly or fully switched to telehealth using whatever technology is available to them and to their patients. Understandably, many clinicians have expressed feeling unprepared for this sudden shift, and many more remain apprehensive towards dysphagia tele-care mainly due to lack of physical engagement with the patient and concerns about safety and efficacy when the clinician is remotely providing care. It can be argued that providing services with heavy PPE, the use of face shields or with a plexiglass separating patient and clinician pose many of the same challenges as telehealth. Also, years of both research and clinical practice in this area show that the use of telehealth for swallowing management can be safe, feasible, and reliable, but several safeguards and considerations need to be in place (See Table 3 ). According to statements by several professional associations, the use of telehealth should not be viewed as a 'better than nothing' solution, but should be equivalent to services provided in-person [84, 85] . In the current healthcare climate this may not always be possible without significant adaptations. Any adaptations, however, will have to be made with extra care for procedural, legal, and practical standards established by nationally recognized professional organizations [86] . Detailed guidance and training resources on this topic are now available and continue to be developed on a regular basis [87, 88] . In Table 3 we summarize the main considerations and safeguards clinicians need to examine and implement.",

While the evidence-base for its efficacy in assessing and treating dysphagia is mounting, missed diagnoses can be possible owing to lack of skilled telehealth practitioners, inadequate training or telehealth infrastructure. One should be cautious not to miss evolving pathologies related to neuromuscular pathology, cancers, pharyngo-esophageal dysmotility, aerodigestive and pulmonary inflammation, as delays with accuracy of diagnosis and early/definitive therapies can be detrimental. Sometimes, an in-person assessment or treatment is necessary, and prior triaging using telehealth approaches can identify the right patient for the right procedures with limited interactions among the personnel exposed. At the same time, we acknowledge and emphasize the urgent need for research under the current conditions that could be rapidly translated and help determine best practices, safety, and effectiveness of this service delivery model during this pandemic and beyond.",

            "text": "As the prevalence, short and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are still not firmly established, the incidence and patterns of dysphagia in these patients are uncertain. Reports from clinicians around the world suggest that dysphagia is a fairly common problem, either directly due to the trauma of intubation or secondary to respiratory damage, neurologic and cognitive deficits, deconditioning, or critical illness myopathy and neuropathy [67] . Evaluation and treatment of dysphagia falls to the specialist who may be an SLP, otolaryngologist, phoniatrician, gastroenterologist, physiatrist, or critical care physician. By definition, many of our dysphagia evaluation and treatment procedures can be considered AGPs or likely to trigger aerosol generation from patients by eliciting coughing or loud vocalizations. There are no evidence-based controlled trials yet published showing an increased incidence of transmission of the virus or contraction of COVID-19 in providers who evaluate or treat patients with dysphagia, but there is widespread expert consensus that our procedures place the healthcare worker at risk of infection. In the context of the available evidence on the nature of COVID-19 and how transmission is likely to occur, expert consensus has emerged on how to lessen the risk of transmission. It is strongly advised that all healthcare workers should take precautionary steps outlined above to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission and infection, while continuing the aforementioned dysphagia assessment and treatment procedures when indicated. Over time, as we learn how to maximize safety of transmission, these recommendations may change. For example, with rapid testing becoming more accurate and available to hospitals, patients who test negative may be evaluated within a short time of testing, with no need for extra precautions that are necessary with COVID-19 suspected or positive patients. As patients with COVID-19 are followed and we learn more about secondary effects of the disease and stages of recovery, guidance will need to be updated. With the many uncertainties we face now, one fact is certain: the post-COVID world will not be the same as the pre-COVID world. Some dysphagia assessments and treatment sessions will likely be carried out via telehealth and new technologies that will emerge. Increasing knowledge of viral transmission of current and future diseases will likely permanently alter our way of interacting with patients, families and co-workers. Hopefully, our patients will be the biggest beneficiaries in this changing world.",
