We use multioutput Gaussian process prior distributions to model different infection rates in populations containing multiple types of individuals. Further challenges arise because the transmission process itself is unobserved, and large outbreaks can be computationally demanding to analyze. We address these issues by data augmentation and a suitable efficient approximation method. Simulation studies using synthetic data demonstrate that our framework gives accurate results.

We ran all MCMC algorithms for 25,000 iterations, discarding the first 5,000 as a burn-in period. This took around 1 d to complete using the University of Nottingham High Performance Computing Service. MOC model. We used the MOC model with two correlation parameters, assuming the correlation between the sheep-only and sheep-and-cattle farms is the same as the correlation between the cattle-only and sheep-and-cattle farms. The results in Fig. 2 show that farms with both sheep and cattle are more susceptible to contracting the disease than farms with only one type of animal. With regard to the shape of the infection rate functions, the function for sheep-and-cattle farms decays more quickly than the other two functions, and for farms of all types the probability of an infected farm infecting a susceptible farm farther than 7 km away is negligible. Fig. 2A shows strong similarity between the infection rate functions for sheep-only and cattle-only farms. Fig. 2B shows the correlation between these two functions is high and the 95% credible interval is (0.914, 0.982). The correlation between the functions for farms with one type of animal and for farms with both types of animals is not as high, but still indicates considerable positive correlation [95% CI: (0.652, 0.891)]. The posterior median for the infectious period distribution rate parameter \u03b3 is 0.508, which gives an expected infectious period of 7.86 d. This is in line with estimates reported in refs. 12 and 27, namely 7.55 and 7.69 d, respectively, obtained using parametric methods. Discrepancy-based model. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and are similar to those for the MOC model. In contrast to the MOC model, we can compare the functions to a baseline, chosen to be the infection rate function for sheep-only farms. Fig. 3 shows that there is little difference for cattle-only farms, but that the infection rate function for sheep-and-cattle farms is significantly higher than the sheep-only infection rate function for distances less than around 3 km. The posterior median for \u03b3 is 0.517 [95% CI:(0.469, 0.570)], which gives an average infectious period of 7.74 d. Assessing Disease Control Strategies. We implemented a further simulation study, the details of which are given in SI Appendix, section 4A, to demonstrate the benefits of our Bayesian nonparametric framework by directly comparing it to a parametric approach.

We fitted six models, the only difference between them being the assumption about the functional form of the infection rate function (Table 2) . We fixed the infectious period distribution shape parameter as \u03bb = 3 and inferred the rate parameter \u03b3, assuming \u03b3 \u223c Exp(0.01) a priori. The results show that only the Bayesian nonparametric model (M6) can detect the mixture nature of the true infection rate (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ).

The results in Table 2 show the resulting predicted mean final size and probability of a severe outbreak, the latter defined as one in which 10% of farms were infected. Model M1 is the true model, and models M2 and M4 estimate the probability of a severe outbreak fairly well but fail to predict the correct final size. Model M2 correctly estimates the infection rate over short distances, but the infection rate function decays more slowly than that in the true model. Models M3 and M5 have better estimates of final size but do not estimate the outbreak probability well. The existence of longrange transmission in the simulated data causes the decay rate parameter in model M 3 to be underestimated, and in consequence the infection rate over short distances in the model is an order of magnitude smaller than in the true model. Thus, using models M2 to M4 for planning purposes would inevitably lead to misleading conclusions. Conversely, our nonparametric approach matches the results from the true model M1 for both mean final size and the probability of a severe outbreak and does so without having to specify the parametric form of the infection rate function. An additional simulation study that further demonstrates the benefit of our approach is given in SI Appendix, section 4B.",

Although motivated by models for livestock diseases, the methodology is applicable to a wide class of epidemic models, including household models, network models, and age-structured models. The key benefit of our approach is that it removes the need to make specific parametric assumptions about infection rate functions. Instead, we need only make more general assumptions, such as the smoothness of the function we wish to infer. We have also demonstrated that our approach can be used successfully for large datasets by employing MPA methods.",

Updating the length-scale parameter is a bottleneck in the MCMC algorithm as this step involves decomposing and inverting a covariance matrix, and there is also considerable correlation between the infection rate function and length-scale parameter samples. Issues can also arise via the data-augmentation MCMC scheme due to inherent correlations between the unobserved infection times and the model parameters. There are various potential approaches to dealing with these computational difficulties, one of which is to use the approximate-likelihood method described in ref. 29 to remove the need for data augmentation. This in turn would increase the utility of our methods for realtime inference during an outbreak. Furthermore, it would also be of interest to demonstrate the utility of our modeling framework in different contexts beyond spatial epidemic models, such as static network diffusion processes (30) .
