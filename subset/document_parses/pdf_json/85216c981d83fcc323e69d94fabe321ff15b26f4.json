Notably, the IOIBD panel surmises in the latter that cyclosporin be preferentially used as induction or salvage therapy for moderately-severely active ulcerative colitis. However, although evidence regarding safety of biologics in this setting continually accumulates, we argue that infliximab is overall a more favourable medical therapy for hospitalised patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis [ASUC] and COVID-19.",

The safety profile of cyclosporin has not been demonstrated in patients with COVID-19, and cyclosporin may result in adverse cardiovascular events 4 which have been associated with poorer outcomes in COVID-19. 5 Contrastingly, there is growing interest in the role of tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFa] in the aberrant inflammatory phase of COVID-19, 5 with the SECURE database suggesting that anti-TNF therapies are safe and may confer benefit in IBD patients who develop COVID-19. 5 Finally, concerns regarding health care acquisition of COVID-19 1 also lend to infliximab being advantageous by negating the requirement for frequent trough level monitoring, thereby reducing health setting exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and enabling shorter duration of initial hospitalisation. 4 Allez et al. have neatly presented a set of recommendations for the management of IBD patients during COVID-19. Whereas we agree with the majority of these suggestions, we wish to emphasise the importance of expedient biologic therapy in ASUC to avoid prolonged hospitalisation, excessive monitoring, and rapid corticosteroids taper, and believe that infliximab should be considered in preference to cyclosporin in most cases in hospitalised patients with ASUC and COVID-19.",
