            "text": "CT image of COVID-19 is disturbed by impulse noise during transmission and acquisition. Aiming at the problem that the early lesions of COVID-19 are not obvious and the density is low, which is easy to confuse with noise. A median filtering algorithm based on adaptive two-stage threshold is proposed to improve the accuracy for noise detection. In the advanced stage of ground-glass lesion, the density is uneven and the boundary is unclear. It has similar gray value to the CT images of suspected COVID-19 cases such as adenovirus pneumonia and mycoplasma pneumonia (reticular shadow and strip shadow). Aiming at the problem that the traditional weighted median filter has low contrast and fuzzy boundary, an adaptive weighted median filter image denoising method based on hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed. The weighted denoising parameters can adaptively change according to the detailed information of lung lobes and ground-glass lesions, and it can adaptively match the cross and mutation probability of genetic combined with the steady-state regional population density, so as to obtain a more accurate COVID-19 denoised image with relatively few iterations. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm under different density of impulse noise is significantly better than other algorithms in peak signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), image enhancement factor (IEF) and mean absolute error (MSE). While protecting the details of lesions, it enhances the ability of image denoising.",

            "text": "Since December 2019, COVID-19 has spread widely around the world. According to the data released by the Johns Hopkins University, as of September 18, 2020, there were 30065728 confirmed cases in the world. The disease is highly infectious and it can cause severe acute dyspnea. Studies have shown that computed tomography (CT), as a noninvasive imaging method, is of great value in detecting lung lesions in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, CT can be used for detection and diagnosis of COVID-19. However, CT images will produce high-dose radiation in the process of acquisition, which will pose a great threat to the patient's health. Therefore, at present, the damage to the patient's body is usually reduced by decreasing the CT dose. But CT images taken with low dose usually have noise. The generation of noise will affect the quality of CT images, which will seriously affect the doctor's diagnosis for the patient's condition. Lung CT images are inevitably disturbed by various noises in the process of acquisition, transmission and storage, which will cause some random, discrete and isolated pixels on the image, that is, image noise will bring bad interference to lesion image segmentation and doctors' judgment of patients' condition.",

            "text": "At present, nucleic acid detection is the most common method to diagnose COVID-19 [1] . This method combines RNA reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the viral RNA fragments [2, 3] , and the diagnosis can be confirmed by the positive nucleic acid test. However, the screening of RT-PCR has the problem of low sensitivity. Even if the RT-PCR result of suspected patient is negative, the possibility of SARS-Cov-2 infection cannot be completely ruled out [4] . In addition, nucleic acid testing has the disadvantage of timeconsuming and it requires a special test kits. Therefore, it is necessary to further accelerate the detection speed and reduce the cost [5] . Through the comparative experimental analysis of CT and RT-PCR, Ai [6] pointed out that the diagnosis based on chest CT image is faster and more efficient than RT-PCR. Generally speaking, the lungs of patients with COVID-19 have typical imaging features [7] , including groundglass opacities (GGO), pulmonary sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis and multiple lesions. In addition, related studies [8] have shown that the imaging information can play a vital role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. The autonomous diagnosis of COVID-19 based on artificial intelligence can minimize the contact between doctors and the virus, which reduces the chance of infection [9, 10] . However, the manual analysis and diagnosis process based on CT images are highly dependent on professional knowledge [11] , and the analysis of CT image features is timeconsuming, which is difficult to observe hidden lesions in the early stage, and it is hard to distinguish other viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia [12] . The automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 can convert the visual image into the deep-level feature information [13, 14] , which can be quantified. It helps to reduce manual operation and improve the efficiency of accurate quantitative analysis. Standard median filter can preferably filter impulse noise. However, the traditional median filter takes the median value of the neighborhood pixels, the information points in the image may be filtered out and replaced by noise points, which will lead to the loss of some details in the image. Therefore, many scholars have proposed some improved algorithms. Verma [15] proposed adaptive median filter (AMF) algorithm, which shows good filtering performance in low-intensity noise, but when the noise density is too high, a large number of noises needs to be filtered, and the filtering window will expand. The current pixel and the replaced median may lack correlation, resulting in information loss and image blur. Sheela [16] proposed the switching median filter (SMF) method. This method determines whether each pixel is noisy. Due to the threshold needs to be defined in advance when judging the noise, the threshold remains unchanged in the processing process, the final filtering effect is not very ideal. Gupta [17] proposed a discrimination-based dual threshold median filter (DBF) method to judge whether the pixel is noisy by comparing the current pixel with the dual threshold. However, when dealing with high-intensity noise, this method is easy to produce \"tailing effect\", and the filtering performance is greatly reduced. Ahmed [18] proposed an improved discriminant-based asymmetric clipping median filter algorithm. This method can obtain good filtering effect under lowintensity noise, but under high-intensity, the filtering effect is very poor and some details are lost. There are some state-of-the-art methods about denoising algorithm reported. Zhao [19] obtains the residual spectrum according to logarithmic amplitude spectrum of the image, and then the inverse Fourier transform is used to obtain the saliency map. Although this method can suppress the image noise, the subtraction operation is used in the process of calculating the log amplitude. It not only suppresses the noise, but also restrains the detail information, which is not conducive to the denoising of the COVID-19 image. The CNN denoising method [20] can effectively use the global features of the image to significantly improve the denoising effect. The lower the number of CNN layers, the more primitive the extracted low-level features, such as color and edge lines. However, with the deepening of the network, the features extracted by the CNN method become more advanced, and a large number of low-level features will be lost. Yan [21] proposed a KSVD image denoising algorithm based on K-means and singular value decomposition (SVD). This method is based on the bayesian reconstruction theory, and it uses the K-means clustering to obtain an optimal signal sparse representation dictionary set. Through the linear combination of the dictionary elements, various signals are constructed to remove the noise in the CT image. However, dictionary learning brings high computational cost, resulting in too long time for image denoising. In addition, the KSVD method is also insufficient for denoising of highproportion noisy images. Yahya [22] proposed block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) algorithm, which has achieved good results in various image denoising processes, but it is easy to cause tissue contour blur when denoising low-dose CT image. Moreover, there are a lot of parameters in the BM3D algorithm that need to be set manually, which severely limits the effect of the practical application. Gu [23] proposed a weighted kernel norm minimization (WNNM) denoising algorithm. This method can characterize the difference of image effect according to the matrix singular value, given different weights, and it highlights the important information for the image. However, this algorithm needs time-consuming SVD calculation and iterative approximation, which is slow and inefficient.",

The traditional extreme noise points judgment [24] [25] [26] [27] can easily cause misdiagnosis of COVID-19 lesion signals. For the single threshold filtering method, the pixel whose value exceeds the preset threshold will be judged as noise [28] [29] [30] . Therefore, using a single threshold method may increase the probability of error detection for noise. Hence, a median filtering method based on adaptive multi threshold discrimination is proposed. In this method, the noise pixels will be discriminated in a relatively narrow interval. Thus, this will improve the accuracy of noise detection.",

A weighted sub coefficient w 2 (i, j) is set in the weighted coefficient w(i,j), and w 2 (i, j) is used to characterize the similarity between the current pixel and the nearest noise point. According to the pixel space distance value, a distance correlation function Q(i,j) is designed to characterize the correlation between the current pixel and the noise points. The weighted coefficient w 2 (i, j) should meet the following conditions:\u2460w 2 (i, j) is a non-decreasing function with Q(i, j), that is, the greater the Q(i,j), the greater the weight value to be added;\u2461w 2 (i, j)When Q(i,j) is small, w(i,j) should increase slightly, and when Q(i,j) is large, w(i,j) should increase greatly, that is, w(i,j) is positively correlated with Q(i,j). Setting the current pixel as f(i,j), and f (s,t) is the noise point pixel nearest to the current pixel. Combined with the weighted distance and its normalization, the following weighted function is obtained, which meets positive correlation and the requirement of human vision. Setting the weighted function is: Where, c is the distance constant, which is related to the size of the filter window, c = 1 (n\u00d7n+1)/2 . Therefore, the c value of 5x5 detection window used in this paper is c = 1 (5\u00d75+1)/2 = 1 13 .Through the optimal combination for (\u03b1 1 ,\u03b1 2 ), the relatively optimal denoising effect in the spatial domain can be obtained.

In this method, the pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions of the pixels to be processed, the multi-level threshold for detecting impulse noise is selected by comprehensive estimation, because the threshold changes with the movement of the window, which reflects the adaptability of threshold selection. In this paper, the algorithm gives different weight values to each pixel according to the gray distance between the pixel and the central pixel and the spatial distance between the pixel and the noise point to filter out the noise. The adaptive hybrid genetic algorithm combined with the doppler effect simulated annealing algorithm is used to determine the weight value of the improved median filter. The simulation results show that this method has greater advantages in denoising ability than other filtering methods of the iteration and the processing time, and the performance of detail protection is also greatly improved.",
