Associations between the use of the Calm app (i.e., adherence to the intervention) and changes in sleep quality was also explored in the intervention group only. Adults with sleep disturbance were recruited (N = 640). Eligible and consenting participants (N = 263) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 124) or a wait-list control (n = 139) group. Intervention participants were asked to meditate using the Calm app \ufffd10 minutes/day for eight weeks. Fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal were assessed at baseline, mid-(4-weeks) and post-intervention (8-weeks) in both groups, whereas sleep quality was evaluated only in the intervention group. Findings from intent-totreat analyses suggest the use of the Calm app for eight weeks significantly decreased daytime fatigue (p = .018) as well as daytime sleepiness (p = .003) and cognitive (p = .005) and somatic (p < .001) pre-sleep arousal as compared to the wait-list control group. Within the intervention group, use of the Calm app was associated with improvements in sleep quality (p < .001). This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that the Calm app can be used to treat fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal in adults with sleep disturbance. Given that the Calm app is affordable and widely accessible, these data have implications for community level dissemination of a mobile app to improve sleep-related symptoms associated with sleep disturbance.",

Short-term effects of sleep disturbance are associated with decreased performance (e.g., job productivity, school performance), fatigue and daytime sleepiness, while longer-term effects may have more detrimental consequences such as premature mortality, risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and psychiatric disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression) [1, 6, 7] . Those with sleep disturbance, particularly with insufficient sleep, are more likely to report being obese, physically inactive, and current smokers [8] and has been declared a major public health problem [1] . Additionally, up to 10% of adults reporting sleep disturbances have severe and chronic symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for insomnia [9] , with fatigue being one of the most frequent complaints [10] . There is an urgent need to identify strategies, which can be delivered broadly at the community level, to address sleep disturbance and improve health outcomes.",

Indeed, whereas sleep medications are effective in the short-term management of insomnia, the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment is not durable due to intolerance and use is further complicated by side effects of fatigue and cognitive changes. In contrast, CBT-I is effective and durable, yet has not been widely disseminated because this treatment is intensive, poorly tolerated, costly, and/or has limited accessibility due to the need for specialized providers [13] , travel, or cost of services. Novel treatments that effectively and conveniently address sleep disturbance need further investigation.",

Such treatments are especially attractive to address sleep disturbance as they appear to reduce insomnia-related symptoms of anxiety and depression, are relatively low cost, and more accessible than clinician-administered treatment [16, , 17] . A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examined the effect of mindfulness meditation on sleep quality in 18 trials [18] . The findings suggest mindfulness significantly improves sleep quality (moderate strength of evidence) when compared to non-specific controls (e.g., timeand attention-matched) and may have similar effects on sleep quality as compared to evidence-based sleep treatments (e.g., CBT, sleep hygiene therapy). These findings were also durable at five-and 12-month follow-up periods, suggesting long-term benefits of mindfulness meditation on sleep quality and that mindfulness meditation is non-inferior to CBT-I. However, other systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining the effect of mindfulness meditation on sleep have been mixed with some concluding no effect of mindfulness meditation and others concluding moderate positive effects in favor of mindfulness meditation [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . It is clear there is a need for more studies examining the effect of mindfulness meditation on sleep outcomes.",

Approximately 81% of US adults own a smartphone and the high utilization of this technology has opened up many opportunities for delivering mindfulness meditation via mobile apps [24] , yet there are no studies to our knowledge that have examined whether a mobile app that delivers mindfulness meditation is effective in the treatment of sleep disturbance. Mobile apps may also be especially appealing to the consumer as they may mitigate common barriers and limitations to participation reported in face-to-face interventions, and thereby provide an opportunity to receive treatment and maintain necessary social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, travel is a common barrier to face-to-face interventions, and the use of mobile apps allows the participant to engage in the comfort and privacy of their home [25] .",

The availability of mindfulness meditation mobile apps has grown exponentially over the past decade [26] but the majority of these apps have not been adequately evaluated. As noted, no meditation mobile app has been tested in a randomized controlled trial for their effects on sleep disturbance [5, 27] . Previous feasibility studies testing mindfulness meditation mobile apps to improve stress or fatigue, have reported that participants enjoy using the apps and report perceived improvements in sleep [28] . Interestingly, one large cross-sectional study reported that Calm app (i.e., commercially available mindfulness meditation mobile app) users (N = 11,870) typically downloaded the app to improve sleep (62.9%) and adults with sleep difficulties were more likely to notice changes in their sleep after using the app compared to those without sleep difficulties [29] . The absence of rigorous research to investigate the potential benefit of commercially available mindfulness meditation mobile apps such as the Calm app to improve sleep disturbance is striking given the prevalence of sleep disturbance, widespread use of mobile apps, and emerging data that mindfulness meditation may improve sleep.",

Within the intervention group, associations between using Calm and changes in sleep quality were also explored. We hypothesized that fatigue, daytime sleepiness and pre-sleep arousal would significantly decrease compared to the wait-list control group. We also hypothesized that participants using Calm would report improvements in sleep quality during the intervention period, and that more time spent using Calm would be associated with improvements in sleep quality.

Inclusion criteria were: 1) sleep disturbance defined by a moderate level of elevated insomnia symptoms (i.e., score >10 on the Insomnia Severity Index) [33] . Because we recruited participants from the general population, we chose the cutoff score of 10 as Morin and colleagues [33] determined it to be optimal for detecting at least subthreshold insomnia in a community sample, 2) 18 years or older, 3) could read and understand English, 4) willing to download the Calm app to their smartphone, 5) had not practiced meditation for more than 60 minutes a month in the past six months, and 6) willing to be randomized. If eligible, participants were emailed a link to a video explaining the informed consent and study procedures. If interested in participating, participants completed a quiz to assure they understood study procedures. Participants then completed an electronic informed consent delivered via Qualtrics. Once consented, participants completed baseline questionnaires and then were randomized to intervention or wait-list control group and emailed study instructions.

Previous studies reported minimally important differences (MIDs) for improvement in fatigue to be between 0.08 and 0.4 points [48] , which suggests that the improvements observed in the current study are clinically meaningful. To our knowledge, there are no studies to date that have examined the effects of a mindfulness meditation mobile app on fatigue in adults with elevated insomnia symptoms. Studies testing mindfulness-based interventions (not app-based) in chronic disease patients [49, 50] or cancer survivors [51] have demonstrated improvements in fatigue, however, the delivery of mindfulness meditation in most of these studies were face-to-face. In a study testing the same app as tested in this study, in cancer patients, data suggested significant decreases in self-reported fatigue. In open-ended interviews with those cancer patients reporting fatigue, 23% believed that improvements in their fatigue was a result of the meditation due possibly to sleeping better (less tired in daytime) or that the meditations allowed them a brief rest to recharge their energy levels [52, 53] . Though the mechanisms of mindfulness meditation on sleep have not yet been determined, fatigue is a common complaint in those with sleep disturbance and should be investigated in future trials.",

            "text": "The findings in this study also show promise in reducing daytime sleepiness, and cognitive and somatic pre-sleep arousal in the intervention group at eight weeks when compared to the wait-list control group. Similar to the literature in fatigue, there is limited data related to mindfulness meditation mobile app use and its effects on daytime sleepiness or pre-sleep arousal in adults with elevated insomnia symptoms. A review by Garland and colleagues (2016) suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may be particularly useful for cognitive deactivation and physiological de-arousal by allowing the individual to disengage from daily concerns and strivings and ultimately encouraging a shifting of ones relationship to sleep-related thoughts (e.g., letting go, acceptance, non-striving) [54, 55] . Our findings presented here are promising and warrant future exploration on the utility of other commercial-based meditation mobile apps on various sleep related outcomes (e.g., fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal). In fact, two reviews on mindfulness-based interventions highlighted the need for accessible, scalable, and affordable interventions to improve sleep outcomes such as digital interventions (e.g., web-or smartphone-based) that could be encouraging directions for future research [5] . However, as noted, limited data exists on the efficacy of these platforms. Thus, there is a major opportunity for researchers to investigate the effects of commercially available mindfulness meditation mobile apps on sleep outcomes and future research in this area is warranted. Intervention group participants reported significant improvements in perceived sleep quality over the course of the intervention period and more time spent using the mindfulness meditation app was associated with greater improvements in sleep quality. These findings are similar to mobile apps delivering CBT-I (no meditation component) suggesting that mindfulness meditation apps could be a less intensive and more affordable alternative, or adjunctive treatment, to gold standard treatment for those with sleep problems [56, 57] . For example, the app used in the current study costs $59.99/year compared to a CBT-I app at $300/year [58] . Other mobile app interventions with a meditation component have produced mixed sleep quality outcomes. One study conducted in Canada tested DeStressify, a mobile app for stress that includes meditation, in a sample of University students compared to a wait-list control group on mental health outcomes with sleep quality (measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) as a secondary outcome [59] . No significant differences in sleep quality were reported between groups [59] . This is likely because the (1) the intervention duration was too short to impact sleep outcomes (only four weeks) or (2) the sample did not present with significant sleep problems at baseline making it difficult to detect changes in sleep quality. Rung and colleagues (In press) evaluated the feasibility of a commercial-based mindfulness meditation mobile app (i.e., Headspace) and its association with changes in various health outcomes including sleep quality in a sample of women (N = 43) [60] . Women were asked to download and use the app for 30 days, 10 minutes per day. Findings suggest that using Headspace was associated with improvements in sleep quality sleep duration, and sleep latency [60] . However, as there was no control group and it is not possible to determine if the observed changes were due to the intervention or non-specific effects such as expectation for benefit. A review by Donker and colleagues (2013) concluded that the research regarding mental health-based mobile apps and sleep disturbance was particularly weak and there is a need for future research in this area [61] . It is clear that there is a need to test mindfulness meditation mobile apps and their effects on sleep quality, especially those currently available to the public.",

            "text": "Adherence to intervention. Participants reported robust usage of the mindfulness meditation mobile app with an average of approximately 14.98 minutes/day (6.36 sessions/week). Interestingly, participants spent substantially more time using the general meditations (i.e., not specifically designed for sleep) than other sleep-specific components of the app (e.g., Sleep Stories, sleep-specific meditations). However, the most common time for to meditate was at night (made up 52% of sessions). Despite participants using general meditations rather than sleep-specific meditations, changes in sleep outcomes were observed. It would be interesting to test if the magnitude of changes would be greater (or the same) if participants were instructed to use sleep-specific meditations prior to bed. Perhaps the effects of meditation are driven via other processes (i.e., changes in mental health) rather than directly impacting sleep. Future studies testing different types of meditation (e.g., daily, sleep-related) on sleep outcomes as well as mechanisms of change is warranted.",

However, this is better than studies using digitally delivered CBT-I which have reported average attrition rates of 21.6 \u00b1 16.9% or non-completion rates of 35.2 \u00b1 19.4% [62, 63] . In our study we used objective data provided by Calm to determine adherence, providing a more accurate measure of participation in the app compared to self-report. Similar to our study, Rung and colleagues (In press) collected objective adherence data from Headspace. Participants logged onto the app an average of 36 times (SD 80) for an average of 24 days (SD 36) with a 26% attrition rate. Their attrition was higher than our study and because objective adherence was reported as number of logins and days of use, it is unclear how many minutes of meditation were actually completed. A review by Donker and colleagues (2013) suggests that app-based health interventions may have high adherence rates because of the portability and flexible usage of mobile apps [61] . Even so, future studies should aim to provide more descriptive details regarding adherence (e.g., number of sessions completed, minutes of meditation completed, content accessed) as this information is important to further our understanding of the optimal dosage of meditation for maximal benefit. As the adherence in our study declined over time (similar to other studies), creative strategies for encouraging adherence throughout the program such as push notifications, weekly reminders, or peer support should be considered in future studies. Regardless, mobile meditation apps appear to have better attrition and completion rates than even digitally delivered CBT-I programs and should be considered as potential strategies to improve sleep in individuals with insomnia symptoms.",

            "text": "Although the findings in this study are promising, there are important limitations noted. The sample recruited was primarily female and highly educated, and therefore limits the generalizability of our findings. Although there were fairly high rates of sleep-related diagnoses in our sample (40%), it is also unclear whether the effects of the intervention would be similar in clinical settings or in populations with very severe sleep disturbance. In addition, we collected data online which may result in unrepresentative samples. Due to the remote nature of the study, we cannot determine whether or not participations were actually meditating or actively engaging with the Calm app (i.e., distracted while listening to a meditation, not paying attention, accidently left on). This is common in digitally delivered interventions [64] . Fatigue was measured as our primary outcome, but we did not require participants to report fatigue as part of our inclusion criteria. This could have attributed to the restriction of range from pre-post scores and future studies should consider adding a fatigue assessment as part of inclusion criteria. Sleep quality was not comprehensively assessed as we only analyzed one question on the sleep diaries, which provided information on subjective sleep quality, but does not capture other components which may provide a more complete representation of sleep quality (e.g., sleep latency, sleep duration, etc.) [65] . In addition to sleep diaries, future studies should include validated and reliable surveys as well as objective methods to assess sleep quality. Selfreported data presents inherent limitations (biased results, participant burden, potential data errors, incorrect interpretation of survey items) and the addition of objective measures may be less subject to bias. Additionally, sleep quality was only measured in the intervention group and therefore the intervention group is confounded by monitoring of sleep and group differences were unable to be explored on this outcome measure. Without comparison to a control group, it is unknown whether the effects observed are due to the intervention. Although, we used a wait-list control to compare our secondary outcomes. Future mHealth studies should consider using an active app-based control group to control for non-specific effects of the intervention on sleep. Finally, due to the nature of the study, participants were not blinded to treatment condition which may affect behavior especially if randomized to the wait-list control group. However, we did ask wait-list control group participants to not use any mobile apps for relaxation, meditation, or sleep during the 8-week intervention period.",
