Organizational capabilities can be supported by Information Systems during their design and run-time phases, which often requires the capabilities' adaptation. Currently, enterprise modeling and capability modeling facilitate the design and analysis of capabilities but improvements regarding capability change can be made. This design science research study introduces a capability change meta-model that will serve as the basis for the development of a method and a supporting tool for capability change. The meta-model is applied to a case study at a Swedish public healthcare organization. This application provides insight on possible opportunities to improve the meta-model in future iterations.",

ISs are significant for every organization since they help in simplifying the organization's activities and processes and have gradually become integrated with almost every aspect of the business [11] , to the level where business and IT have been \"fused\" into one [5] . This integration has raised several challenges for EM, especially regarding the organizations that are in motion, changing and evolving. Due to a high rate of change in modern enterprises, the maintenance of models that are sufficiently capturing the architecture from the perspective of involved stakeholders does not seem to be feasible. One of the main challenges for EM is how to capture the motion of an organization, that is, its current and desired affairs [5] . Capability modeling, as a specialization of EM, also needs to tackle this challenge. This can be achieved by optimizing existing approaches or developing specific modeling approaches for depicting capability change.",

Following the exploration of the field [14] , the elicitation of requirements for the artifact [15] , and the introduction of a typology for changing capabilities [16] , the present study belongs to the project step that concerns the initial development of a meta-model. This is a design artifact that will serve as a basis for a capability modeling method. In addition, the meta-model is demonstrated by applying it to an existing case, in particular, a public healthcare organization in Sweden which is undergoing changes.",

The three functions are observation, decision and delivery, which reflect capturing information from the organizational internal and external environment, deciding on a change based on analyzing the observed conditions and applying criteria based on intention elements and finally, delivering the change in the capability's configuration, taking into consideration the interrelation of existing capabilities. In this way, the adaptive characteristics of capability meta-models that have been explored in the literature, have been analyzed to identify the concepts that may be useful to include in a meta-model aiming to capture changing capabilities. Furthermore, the literature review, combined with a case study involving inter-organizational capabilities have resulted in a set of goals [15] for the meta-model under development. These goals are: The manner in which these have driven the development of the meta-model is discussed below. In addition, the dimensions of capability and change have been researched and this resulted in introducing a state-based capability typology [16] , where the possible states of capability change have been presented as a UML State Machine diagram.

This change will make it possible for a caller to be guided directly to a provider having, in the meantime, avoided the need to reach a diagnosis of the case. There are several benefits involved from the implementation of this change. First of all, the caller is guided to a provider with the optimal expertise. Additionally, the capability gains increased efficiency, reducing the required cost and effort. Furthermore, it improves the usage of human resources, having the physicians handle the cases that are most relevant to their expertise. A group of expert physicians is currently working on mapping healthcare providers to symptoms, in order to facilitate the development of a web system for direct use and an .xml file that could be compatible for usage in other systems. In practice, the change concerns the modification of a capability, which translates to a different configuration according to our approach. The case has been modeled as an instantiated version of our meta-model, which results in an object diagram, as shown in Fig. 2 . The Health Guidance capability has a goal-fulfilment purpose and is enabled, as depicted through the association with the Health guidance state object of the Capability state class. The Capability object is also associated to an instance of the Organization class to depict its ownership by RH. The Change object, named Health guidance improvement, has an enabled state, and it is characterized through its attributes as a planned, continuous, incremental, desirable, intentional, and slow adaptation. Its type is Modification and consists of three objects, the Health guidance monitoring Observation object, the Change configuration Decision object, and the A to B Delivery object. Observation leads to Decision and then to Delivery. Observation consists of three measurement objects which depict the assessment of three context factors, Employee proposals, Partner proposals and Political influence, which are all included as objects and associated to the respective measurement objects. The first factor concerns internal context, and is associated to the RH object, while the other two are external context factors. The external factor objects are also resulting in a Reduced cost Criterion which determines the Decision object. This is also motivated by Improved efficiency, which is an Intention element object. Additional associations of the capability object are connecting it with two configuration objects, namely Configuration A and B. The former is the one enabled before the change and the latter is the one enabled after the change. This is captured in the Delivery object, which is associated to both Configuration objects to depict the transition. The delivery of change disables Configuration A and enables configuration B. The difference between the two configurations is depicted through their allocated resources. Configuration A is only associated to the Guidance system and Provider catalogue system, while B is also associated to the Symptom -provider system. An 1177 Behavior element object is associated to both configurations. It is interesting to note that the Provider catalogue and Guidance system are associated to the Private provider and National public provider respectively, so as to represent ownership. This means that while RH owns the capability, the two collaborating organizations own involved resources. Especially when it comes to the symptom -provider system, the object, which is part of Configuration B, is owned by RH along with the System development capability, on which Health guidance depends, and the Expert physicians used to develop it. However, the Provider catalogue system and the Provider data are owned by Private provider, so the Collaboration Interaction type object is not enough to represent the case. A Data availability Organizational boundary and a Contract Boundary control object complement the required information for this part of the diagram.",

During the instantiation of the meta-model to an object diagram, the complexity of the object diagram exceeded our initial expectations and what can intuitively be seen as practical for the purpose of communicating with domain experts. For this reason, several pieces of information have been omitted in order to reduce the complexity of the result, in terms of a less cluttered model. For example, many resources involved in the configurations of the capability are missing because their role in the undergoing change was deemed of lower priority. For example, the specialized nurses that perform the guidance, the telephone system and the journal system are not affecting the change project. Yet, omitting pieces of information is not feasible in every case, and this should be addressed in the meta-model.",

For this reason, certain aspects of capability change were slightly neglected, which means that a higher level of abstraction was applied, a fact that resulted in more generic meta-elements, for example, Intention element and Behavior element. However, it is not a coincidence, that all the generic meta-elements reflect aspects that could be decomposed into entire models. For example, decomposing Intention, Behavior or Context elements may require the integration of a goal, process [18] or context model [29] respectively. Among the elements that were included in the meta-model, the point of emphasis that stands out as the epicenter of change is the Configuration class and its recursive association that depicts transitions between configurations. Any further decomposition of this part will only promote the initial goal, to model capability change. Nevertheless, decomposing goals and processes may be useful, yet, it is not the main focus point of this project.",
