Here, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the impact of social, municipal, and individual factors on the COVID-19 pandemic in working-age population living in Mexico City. To this end, we used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System; furthermore, we used a multidimensional metric, the social lag index (DISLI), to evaluate its interaction with mean urban population density (MUPD) and its impact on COVID-19 rates. Influence DISLI and MUPD on the effect of vehicular mobility policies on COVID-19 rates were also tested. Finally, we assessed the influence of MUPD and DISLI on discrepancies of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality compared with death certificates from the General Civil Registry. We detected vulnerable groups who belonged to economically active sectors and who experienced increased risk of adverse COVID-19",

Marginalized municipalities with high population density experienced an accentuated risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, policies to reduce vehicular mobility had differential impacts across marginalized municipalities. Finally, we report an under-registry of COVID-19 deaths and significant excess mortality associated with non-COVID-19 deaths closely related to MUPD/DISLI in an ambulatory setting, which could be a negative externality of hospital reconversion. In conclusion, social, individual, and municipality-wide factors played a significant role in shaping the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City.",

Although clinical risk factors for severe outcomes and lethality, such as increased age and a high burden of chronic health comorbidities, were identified soon after the first reported cases in Wuhan (1-3), these do not fully explain the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 pandemic experienced by historically marginalized population groups, as has been widely documented in Europe (4-7) and North America (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . A possible hypothesis according to the 'Social Determination of the Health-Disease Process' (SDHDP) approach expresses that the cumulative and yet dynamic interplay between historically, spatially and socially shaped processes of exposure/imposition, susceptibility and resistance, which dialectically affects health at the singular, particular and general levels, could have contributed within the current world-health situation (15). Going beyond the better-known Social Determinants of Health approach, the SDHDP approach focuses on the social processes that underlie the inequitable distribution of risk factors and poor health (15) (16) (17) . Similarly, eco-social epidemiology focuses on the cumulative interplay between exposure, susceptibility and resistance which leads to health, and the notion of embodiment (18). Both of these approaches, regard empirical data on health disparities along socioeconomic, geospatial, racialized and gendered lines as a starting point to understand the processes that shape population healththe COVID-19 pandemic being no exception.",

We also calculated the mean urban population density (MUPD) for the City's 16 municipalities using the standard method proposed by the National Institute for Geography and Information (INEGI). We observed that SLI was highly correlated to MUPD; since we intended to evaluate inequalities independent or urbanization, we regressed MUPD onto SLI values using linear regression and extracted the residuals to obtain a MUPD-independent SLI index (DISLI)(33). To assess cut-offs for both DISLI and MUPD, we used the Jenks optimization method to identify natural breaks in continuous variables. This allowed us to divide the municipalities into four categories by Low MUPD /Low DISLI, High MUPD /Low DISLI, Low MUPD /High DISLI and High MUPD /High DISLI. Details of DISLI distribution and municipalities classification in Mexico City is presented in Supplementary Material. For population-weighted analyses by DISLI categories and for adjustments by MUPD we extracted data from 2020 population projections obtained by the Mexican National Population Council (CONAPO) for Mexico City (34).",

These models considered the interaction effects between MUPD/DISLI quadrants with the individually assigned mobility index, with population offset assigned according to sex and corresponding DISLI population as the denominator. To determine if there was temporal causality on the effect of vehicular mobility reduction on COVID-19 rates, Granger causality tests were performed considering relative mobility decrease as both the predictor and as the result. To clarify the nature of the behaviors of these rates in time, and to evaluate their behavior as functions of themselves when adjusted by mobility, we fitted Autorregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) models for incidence and mortality rates, dividing data by MUPD/DISLI quadrant and adjusting with work-group categorization.

The precise pathways of embodiment and the processes of social determination through which mean urban density and marginalization lead to higher rates of COVID-19 related adverse outcomes requires further quantitative and qualitative research. Broadly, they can be conceptualized as structural factors and factors related to healthcare provision. The map of COVID-19 mortality and excess mortality is remarkably similar to the map of lower life expectancy, perhaps suggesting that structural factors which increased risk for transmission and adverse outcomes play a larger role than those related to healthcare provision. This is relevant, as life expectancy is generally thought to be more closely related to standards of living than to healthcare provision (19).",

Although these actions have probably attenuated the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities, our results show that the pandemic has had differential impacts along socioeconomic lines. This is clear when considering that social isolation policies had a heterogeneous impact on the way the pandemic has hit different municipalities across Mexico City. What we observed from the behavior of vehicular mobility is that there is indeed a key cutoff where vehicular mobility decreases influences COVID-19 rates in Mexico City. As shown by our results, untargeted strategies to reduce urban mobility may not be effective for all areas of Mexico City, considering the influence of marginalization and MUPD may inform future public health policy measures.

Systematic policies are required to guarantee equitable access to health services, prompt detection of SARS-CoV2 infection, and sufficient stipends which facilitate self-isolation to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection for vulnerable groups.",

            "text": "Finally, our findings also reveal that excess mortality from non-COVID-19 deaths increased considerably, most notably in outpatient settings. Excess mortality was predicted as an unwanted effect of the pandemic, which varies according to each country (47-50). Excess mortality in Mexico City may result from deficiencies within the infrastructure of healthcare systems along with a fragmented hospital framework which complicates interoperability (50,51). These factors coexisted within Mexico City and overall in Mexico well before the COVID-19 pandemic (20,52); furthermore, insufficient number of HCWs and the burden that this sector had during the pandemic created a triple overload for the Mexican healthcare system (31,53,54). As a result of this urgent need, local authorities sought to create a strategy based on hospitals' reconversion and modified patient admission criteria to prioritize patients with severe COVID-19. This systematic hospital reconversion led to undesired negative externalities, where a vulnerable sector of the population living in marginalized municipalities had to restrict attention for non-COVID-19 related medical ailments and were less likely to seek urgent medical attention in an emergency setting. Furthermore, it is likely that the effects of the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic has had a larger impact precisely on marginalized populations, creating further difficulty in meeting essential needs and thus leading to higher excess mortality. This excess mortality could also be accounted for by unregistered COVID-19 deaths, indirect effects of the pandemic or increased mobilization of medical urgencies coming from neighboring states seeking attention given potential unavailability of medical services. Further work is required to elucidate underlying causes of excess .

All the estimations made in our population analyses were based on projections of the economic population of the first quarter of 2020 and may not capture the dynamics around employment occupation and changes in population structure within the study period. Furthermore, since there are no data on the demographic structure of the working categories, we were unable to perform age-adjustment for this section of the analysis. Second, our categorization by MUPD/DISLI categories was based solely on Mexico City, which may not represent the country's socio-economic disparities or heterogeneity within smaller communities or individual socioeconomic levels. Third, the NESS may not fully capture patients with mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, which represents a bias towards cases with moderate and high risk for COVID-19 complications. Finally, excess mortality data does not report disaggregated etiology of non-COVID-19 deaths, which prevents further assessment of areas which may have required further attention during the pandemic to prevent excess deaths.",

Notably, despite higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in economically active workers, a higher burden of adverse COVID-19 outcomes was observed in non-specified workers, retired adults, home related, and unemployed workers. MUPD independent municipal social lag was a risk factor for COVID-19 adverse outcomes and its effect was modified by urban population density; furthermore, DISLI also influenced the protective effect of vehicular mobility reduction on Mexico City. Finally, excess mortality was dependent on social lag, whilst underreport of COVID-19 deaths is related to MUPD. The inequalities highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic call for urgent actions to reduce socioeconomic disparities, increase healthcare access and promote healthier lifestyles in Mexico City and beyond.",
