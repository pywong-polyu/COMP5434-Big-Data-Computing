            "text": "The global widespread of coronavirus disease 2019 has caused shortage of medical face masks and led to developing of various types of cloth masks with different levels of protection and comfort to meet the market demands. Breathing comfort is a significant aspect that should be considered during the design of cloth masks along with the filtration efficiency; otherwise, the wearer will feel suffocated. In this work, different types of cotton and polyester knitted fabrics blended with spandex yarns were produced and treated with silver nanoparticles to be used as antiviral cloth masks. Scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and EDX were used to characterize the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Antiviral activity was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus as well. The influence of using different fabric materials, number of layers, and hybrid layers on their air permeability and breathability were investigated to evaluate the comfortability of the cloth masks. Physiological impacts of wearing the cloth masks were evaluated by measuring oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and heart rate of the wearers while doing various activities. The results indicated that AgNPs have low cytotoxicity and considerable efficiency in inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Adding spandex yarns with different count and ratios reduced the porosity and air permeability of the fabrics. Moreover, the combination of three hybrid layers' mask made of polyester fabric in the outer layer with 100% cotton fabric in the inner layer showed high comfortability associated with high air permeability and breathability. Also, wearing these masks while doing activities showed no significant effect on blood oxygen saturation and heart rate of the wearers.",

            "text": "workers. 5, 11 Consequently, researchers and manufacturers had worked on developing reusable face masks to meet the market needs. 12 Also, many people have resorted to make their household masks, recycling used masks, or using masks that offer less protection. 11 In this context, research work has been done to enhance the performance afforded by cloth face masks through finding new materials with sufficient filtration efficiency, breathability, and comfort, in addition to imparting new properties such as hydrophobicity, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties. 15 Hydrophobic material is needed in face masks, as the moist environment is wellknown for its support to the growth of bacteria, dermal infection, and unpleasant odor which may cause health issues to the wearers when used for long periods of time. 11 Air permeability and breathability are significant properties that provide comfort to the persons wearing face masks. Increasing the mask porosity will increase the air permeability but will decrease the protection level since the infectious aerosols can easily pass through the fabric openings. As well as, higher values of differential pressure (breathability resistance) indicate that the mask is hard to breathe through and lower values indicate that the breathing effort is normal. 16, 17 Cloth face masks can be made using woven or knitted fabrics, as knitted fabrics are characterized by their excellent comfort properties, they possess high extensibility allowing a comfortable fit on the user's face. Several materials can be used in producing cloth masks such as cotton, chiffon, silk, synthetics, or a combination of them which can increase their filtration efficiency. 8, 18 Davies et al. 19 found that surgical and household cotton masks greatly reduced the expelled bacterial and viral aerosols from personal coughs. Disposable face masks cannot block all pathogens and do not kill them, which makes the discarded mask a route for the disease as the pathogens multiply in the mask fibers. 20 Accordingly, utilizing antipathogens methods based on chemical treatment of the material surface have been studied to enhance the masks with a biocide effect. 21 Metal nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are extensively used in various biomedical and textile applications, as they offer high antibacterial and antifungal activities against pathogens due to the inhibition of respiratory enzymes through releasing the Ag + ions. 11, 20, 22 They intercalate into the bacterial DNA once entering the cell and inhibit the proliferation of the pathogen. Also, AgNPs are environmentally friendly and nontoxic to humans. 23 Several in vitro and in vivo studies concerned with investigating the cytotoxicity of AgNPs. 24 , 25 Hiragond et al. 26 found that soaking face masks in a colloidal solution of starch-capped silver nanoparticles showed effective inhabitation to the growth of Staphylococcus and Escherichia bacteria. Silver nanoparticles had revealed to have an antiviral activity through penetrating the cell membrane of the virus, and interacting with the viral genome to prevent the cell from replicating. The efficiency of AgNPs against influenza A, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), monkeypox, influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (H1N1), and hepatitis B viruses have been investigated recently. It was observed that the size of the nanoparticles exhibited a significant effect on their antiviral activity. 27 Also, AgNPs possess potent antiviral activity against feline coronavirus (FCoV), 28 adenovirus, 29 herpes simplex virus, 30 norovirus, 31 bovine herpesvirus, 32 human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), 33 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 34 Cloth masks treated with silver ions could offer a potent perception tool against viral infection, where the virus can be destroyed by the following methods; the metal nanoparticles create a free-radical like-OH ion which is toxic to the virus's cell, the metal combines with N, O, and S in the virus's cell to damage it by chelation, or the metal damages the electron transport chain because silver belongs to the transition element having d-block. 20 On the other hand, the physiological effects of wearing face masks during doing various activities had been considered recently. During respiration, gases exchange occur where oxygen is inhaled and carbon dioxide exhaled. 35, 36 While wearing the face mask, there is a possibility that a great amount of carbon dioxide is inhaled as a result of being trapped between the face and the mask, causing hypercapnia hypoxia due to the increase in arterial carbon dioxide that displaces oxygen from hemoglobin. 9,37-39 Pulse oximeter device is used to monitor the arterial blood oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin (SpO 2 ) and it is based on photoplethysmography. It measures the SpO 2 (%) through the difference in the absorption spectrum of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in the visible and infrared spectral regions and also, it measures the heart pulse rate. 40 Several researches have studied the physiological effects of wearing surgical face masks during work in terms of their effect on SpO 2 , heart rate, and CO 2 levels. 9, 35, 37, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] It worth mentioning here, that the breathability performance is considered one of the most important aspects that the ASTM and ISO standards referred to, as it may cause serious problem to the wearer. Several publications in face masks were ignoring this test, and here, we are focusing on the breathability performance of cloth masks and its effect on the oxygen saturation percentage and heart rate in order to raise the awareness and the importance of the breathability of face masks. So, the aim of the present work is to produce cloth face masks made from different combinations of cotton and polyester knitted fabrics treated with silver nanoparticles to be used as an antiviral face mask during COVID-19 pandemic. The prepared AgNPs were characterized using SEM, TEM, and EDX, and their antiviral activity was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 virus. K/S and color fastness properties of the treated dyed fabrics were determined. Fabric porosity was measured using optical image analysis. The effect of using different fabric materials, number of layers, and hybrid layers on the air permeability and breathability of the cloth masks was investigated to evaluate their comfortability. Also, the physiological impacts of wearing the proposed face masks were evaluated through measuring the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (SpO 2 %) and heart rate of the wearers during doing normal activities such as performing office work and walking.",

It is influenced by several parameters such as yarn count, yarns density, fabric structure, and pore size. Spandex yarns have been added to the cotton and polyester fabrics to maintain the fabrics' dimensions with repeated use and to reduce fabric porosity. Figure 9 shows the macroscopic images of one layer of the fabric samples (S1 to S9) with single jersey structure, and Figure 10 shows the inverted black and white images of the fabric samples to determine the porosity (%). ImageJ as an image processing program was used to analyze the black and white pixels' ratio to calculate the porosity percentage. It can be observed from Table 1 and Figures 9 and 10 that the samples with lower course density showed the highest porosity percentages. Sample S1 made of 100% cotton exhibited the highest loop length due to the natural twists found in the cotton fibers. The polyester samples showed the lowest loop length values compared to the cotton samples. Also, sample S1 showed the highest porosity of 50.80%, followed by sample S6 and sample S2 with porosity 49.21% and 46.79%, respectively.

Regarding the one layer test, Figure 11 revealed that sample S1 (100% cotton) shows the highest air permeability value when compared with all samples. Sample S6 made of polyester with half feeders of spandex yarns of count 20 denier and sample S8 made of polyester with half feeders of spandex yarn of count 70 denier come follow sample S1. On the other hand, sample S5 made of cotton with full feeders of spandex yarn of count 70 denier showed the lowest air permeability value. This variation in the air permeability values may be attributed to the fact that the sample S1 has the lowest stitch density, longest loop length, and highest porosity compared with the other fabric samples blended with spandex yarns. The same can be observed for polyester fabric samples that showed higher air permeability values compared to cotton samples with spandex yarns, due to that polyester fibers have smooth surface which increased the air gaps in the fabric compared to cotton fibers which characterized by natural crimps in the fibers. Therefore, the fabrics produced with cotton yarns have more intra-yarn air paths with lower inter-yarn air spaces that caused a reduction in the air permeability of fabrics. 71 The addition of spandex with different yarn count and ratios causing contraction of the loops to each other, increasing the stitches density and decreasing the porosity of the fabrics particularly with using spandex yarns at high feeding percentage 100%. 72 Moreover, as assumed increasing the number of fabric layers in the face mask can enhance filtration efficiency, but it may negatively affect the user's breathing comfort. So, it can be indicated from Figure 11 that increasing the number of fabric layers of the same material leads to decreasing the air permeability values of all samples in the same manner as in one layer samples' test results. As, sample S1 recorded the highest air permeability value and sample S5 recorded the lowest value of air permeability. Figures 12 and 13 show the air permeability values of testing two layers and three layers of hybrid fabric samples combinations. The samples that achieved better results in one layer test were chosen for two and three hybrid layers' test. It can be observed that the two layers of hybrid samples showed also lower values of air permeability. The hybrid sample (S8/S1) showed the higher air permeability value of 45.4 cm 3 /cm 2 /s, followed by sample (S7/S1) with a value of 31.3 cm 3/ cm 2 /s. This could be related to utilization of polyester fabrics in the outer layer, as S7 and S8 recorded higher air permeability values in one layer test. As well, using sample S1 (100% cotton) as the inner layer enhanced the air flow passed through the air gaps in fabrics.",

Type I masks are recommended for use by patients and other persons to reduce risk of spreading infections in pandemic situations, and are not intended for use by healthcare professionals. While type II masks with high BFE are intended for use by healthcare professionals. Type IIR masks are resistant to splashes with high BFE to protect against exposure to blood and other body fluids. Both type I and II masks require breathability value <40 Pa/cm 2 and type IIR requires breathability value <60 Pa/cm 2 . 14 In this test, the influence of using different fabric materials, number of layers, and layers' combinations on their breathability is shown in Figures 14-16 . Also, the breathability levels for types I, It is indicated from Figure 14 that the samples S1 made of 100% cotton and S6 made of polyester with half feeders of spandex yarns of count 20 denier achieved the best breathability values according to the standard levels for type I and II masks. The samples showed the lowest differential pressure values of 10.20 and 20.41 Pa/cm 2 in testing one and two layers of fabrics, respectively, followed by sample S8 made of polyester with half feeders of spandex yarns of count 70 denier which achieved 20.41 and 30.61 Pa/cm 2 , respectively. Whereas sample S5 made of cotton with full feeders of spandex yarns of count 70 denier showed the highest differential pressure of 293.37 and 306.12 Pa/cm 2 which indicates it will cause a difficulty in breathing. These results are consistent with the air permeability test results. This could be attributed to the fact that using more than one layer of fabric from same material caused decreasing in the porosity of the fabrics which obstacles the air flow to pass through the air gaps where it faces higher frictional forces from the fibers in the fabrics. In Figure 15 , for testing a combination of two hybrid layers of fabrics from different materials, it was found that the hybrid samples (S8/S1) and (S7/ S1) achieved the best values of differential pressure of 35.71 and 51.02 Pa/cm 2 according to the standard.
