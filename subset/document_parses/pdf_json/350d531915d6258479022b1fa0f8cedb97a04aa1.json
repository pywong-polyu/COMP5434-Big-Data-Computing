The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of daily 3 mg subcutaneous (s/c) Liraglutide amongst obese non-diabetic patients in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of obese non-diabetic Saudi patients with obesity managed with s/c Liraglutide 3.0 mg who visited the outpatient clinic in Al Mashfa Hospital, Al Khobar, KSA during 2019-2021. We collected patient data from the electronic reporting system for different parameters. Body weight, hemoglobin A1c %, systolic and diastolic blood pressure mmHg were obtained at baseline and after the intervention. Results: Records of 258 patients who were using a daily dose of Liraglutide 3.0 mg s/c for at least four months have been reviewed. The body weight loss of patients who used Liraglutide for four months was 8.1\u00b10.8 kg. Moreover, around 204 patients continued for up to six months. Meanwhile, the mean body weight loss was 13 kg. There was a significant reduction of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) % by 0.43%. The majority of patients (94.5%) reported satisfaction with the treatment, while adverse events were mainly nausea, vomiting and constipation. Conclusion: Daily s/c Liraglutide of 3.0 mg is effective in producing significant body weight reduction in obese non-diabetic Saudi patients with tolerable minimal side effects and may provide health benefits in terms of reduced risk of obesity and its related outcomes.",

            "text": "Obesity is defined as excessive or irregular fat accumulation. It is one of the major chronic health problems increasing day by day and has negative effects on work productivity, quality of life, and health-care costs, 1 as well as well-known risk factors for cardiometabolic morbidity 2 and overall mortality. 3 Furthermore, obesity is associated with up to several years of lost lifespan. 3 Recently, obesity has been found to be an accelerator of severe COVID-19 and might adversely influence the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. 4 Additionally, obesity has become a critical health problem and a cause of concern worldwide. 5 The global figure for obesity is growing at an alarming rate; according to a recent estimation, it is approaching 573 million by 2030. 6 According to a recent report, the prevalence of obesity was 35% in Saudi Arabia. 7 According to the guidelines of obesity treatment, the use of pharmacologic therapy is indicated when the body mass index (BMI) \u226530 kg/m or in patients with a BMI \u2265 27 kg/m with at least one metabolic syndrome component (eg, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and visceral obesity). 8 The treatment regimen for obese patients with or without type 2 diabetes recommends lifestyle interventions (weight loss, increased physical activity and dietary modification) together with early use of metformin for glycemic control. Unfortunately, many clinical trials have demonstrated the failure of this approach and recommended new and more efficacious treatments to control body weight as well as to prevent the disease progression and its associated complications. 9 Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that has been successfully reduced blood glucose and body weight. The United States Food and Drug Administration approved Liraglutide 3 mg as a treatment for obesity in December 2014. 10 Data demonstrated that Liraglutide can attain weight loss of \u22655-10% from baseline. 11 At the same line, in a previous study at single-center, open-label showed that with Liraglutide 3 mg in combination with intensifying behavioural and diet therapy, 28% of subjects were able to achieve 15% weight loss in one year, compared to 12% with the only intensive behavioural therapy. 12 Liraglutide is available by subcutaneous injection, averaging a cost of over $1000/month. 8 However, Liraglutide treatment is not associated with higher total direct healthcare costs when compared with the clinical effectiveness that is maintained for long term (up to five years), reduced incidence of diabetes and/or its related complications and improvements in health-related quality of life. 13, 14 Unfortunately, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) restrictions and protocols (such as limiting physical activity, isolation, reduced access to health care resources) increased depression and anxiety, disruptions in eating habits and frequent snacking have arisen as an extra burden and challenges for obesity control. 15 Thus, the management of obesity in Saudi Arabia is considered a public health priority. 15 Knowing that the treatment of obesity after it has been established is very difficult, especially when there is some controversy on the available modern treatment of obese patients. 16 Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical effectiveness of daily subcutaneous injection of Liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment on weight control among a sample of obese non-diabetic patients in Saudi Arabia.",

The results of this retrospective study supported the expected hypothesis. Our findings showed improvement in body weight loss as well as glucose control by using 3 mg of liraglutide s/c injection. The results from this study seem consistent with other results done testing similar subjects. 19, 20 Data support the potential benefit of Liraglutide among obese non-diabetic Saudi patients in a dose-dependent manner with once-daily doses of 3.0 mg, as patients have experienced a significant weight loss from baseline. In a recent study, Liraglutide 3.0 mg has shown a significant weight reduction in participants with obesity and a poor response to only lifestyle therapy. 21 Another clinical study has had a follow-up of one hundred and seventeen post-bariatric surgery patients, over seven months taking Liraglutide 3.0 mg. Patients lost a statistically significant amount of weight regardless of the type of surgery they had. This significant decrease in weight was sustained after one year of taking Liraglutide 3.0 mg. 22 The increase in the body visceral fat is not only strongly associated with lipotoxicity (deposition of ectopic lipids in vital organs, such as the arteries, heart, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and liver) but also enhances the release of fatty acids into the circulation, dysregulated adipokine, subclinical inflammation, which in turn can contribute to the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic disorders. 23 ",

After accounting for baseline HbA1c, the study showed a significant reduction in HbA1c % value after three months of follow-up. Several studies have reported a significant glycemic control success. 17, 29 On the other hand, the collected data disagree with other studies that have been conducted on a small sample with available HbA1c values, 16, 22 that cannot be extrapolated to every patient.",
