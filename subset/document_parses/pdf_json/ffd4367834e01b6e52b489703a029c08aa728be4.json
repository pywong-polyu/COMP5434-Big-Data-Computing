            "text": "The self-produced matrix of biofilms, consisting of extracellular polymeric substances, plays an important role in biofilm adhesion to surfaces and the structural integrity of biofilms. In dentistry, biofilms cause multiple diseases such as caries, periodontitis, and pulpitis. Disruption of these biofilms adhering to dental hard tissues may pose a major challenge since biofilms show higher tolerance to antimicrobials and antibiotics than planktonic cells. In this study, the effect of low concentrations of chlorhexidine (CHX) on enzyme-treated multispecies oral biofilm was investigated in an in vitro model. Six-species biofilms were enzymatically treated by anaerobic growth in a medium containing DNase I and proteinase K. Biofilms were exposed to a low concentration of CHX at defined time points. After 64 h, biofilms were either harvested and quantified by cultural analyses or stained for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analyses using either Live/Dead kit or different fluorescent dyes. A mixture of YoPro1 and SYTOX\u2122 Green, Fluorescent Brightener 28 (Calcofluor), and SYPRO\u2122 Ruby Protein Gel Stain was used to stain total DNA, exopolysaccharides, and extracellular proteins, respectively. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) was visualized via an indirect immunofluorescence assay (Mouse anti-DNA IgG, Goat anti-Mouse IgG, Streptavidin-Cy3). Overall, the total colony-forming units significantly decreased after combined treatment with a low concentration of CHX and enzymes compared to the group treated with CHX alone (p < 0.001). These findings also apply to five species individually (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces oris, Veillonella dispar, and Candida albicans) occurring in the biofilms, with Fusobacterium nucleatum being the only exception. Furthermore, CLSM images showed less dense biofilms and a reduction in cell numbers after combined treatment compared to the group without enzymes. The combination of enzymes capable of disturbing the matrix integrity with antimicrobial agents thus appears to be a promising approach for biofilm disruption and killing.",

            "text": "Biofilms are defined as matrix-enclosed bacterial populations adherent to each other and/or to surfaces or interfaces (Costerton et al., 1995) . In dentistry, biofilms cause multiple oral diseases, such as periodontitis or caries, which constitute the most prevalent infectious oral diseases and the main causes of tooth loss (Sanz et al., 2017) . Initially, the bacterial cells adhere to the pellicle-coated tooth surface via different receptor proteins (Kolenbrander et al., 2010) . The cells in a biofilm are embedded in a self-produced matrix consisting of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) such as exopolysaccharides, proteins, extracellular DNA (eDNA), and lipids (Flemming and Wingender, 2010) . The functions of a biofilm matrix are diverse and include adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces, cohesion, scaffolding, and protection against antimicrobials and dispersal (Flemming, 2016; Flemming et al., 2016) . Another key function of the biofilm matrix is to retain nutrients and water to prevent desiccation (Marsh, 2005) . In our work, we focused on two EPS, namely, eDNA and proteins, that both serve as matrix components. Many studies show that eDNA plays an important role in structural stability in an early phase of biofilm formation (Whitchurch et al., 2002; . The eDNA forms nanofibers connecting cells to the substrate or other cells in the biofilm, thereby mechanically stabilizing the biofilm (Liao et al., 2014) . There is evidence that eDNA is released via membrane vesicles upon activation of different mechanisms, including cell lysis and active secretion (Jakubovics et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2014) . It is also known that bacteria in biofilms are more resistant to antimicrobial agents than in the planktonic phase, which can be attributed to different mechanisms . For example, due to its negative charge, eDNA can bind cationic antimicrobials, such as chlorhexidine (CHX; Okshevsky and Meyer, 2015) . Another mechanism of biofilm tolerance toward CHX is the upregulation of multidrug efflux pumps, which are membrane proteins containing multiple transmembrane domains that allow for the elimination of antimicrobials and antibiotics from the cytoplasm. These proteins have been found in Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and in Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Cieplik et al., 2019) . The diverse functions of matrix proteins have been shown in several studies and include, for example, the binding of eDNA (Kavanaugh et al., 2019) or scaffolding the matrix by forming amyloid fibers (Romero and Kolter, 2014; Erskine et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Using enzymes or other agents for the disruption of the biofilm matrix could be a promising approach to control biofilms in the future (Jakubovics et al., 2013; Kostakioti et al., 2013; . This could lead to new treatment approaches, especially in the fields of cariology, periodontology, endodontology, or even prosthodontics, by altering biofilm architecture and thereby making biofilms more susceptible to antimicrobials -even in low concentrations. For example, treatment with DNase I can significantly reduce P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans biofilm growth (Whitchurch et al., 2002; Liao et al., 2014) . showed that DNase I treatment of biofilms grown in vivo can reduce the biovolume of biofilms in a statistically significant range. Another study showed that treatment of S. aureus biofilms with proteinase K can reduce early microbial adhesion, enhance dispersal of bacterial cells, and increase susceptibility toward different antibiotics (Kumar Shukla and Rao, 2013) . In a recently published study, we tested the combined effects of DNase I and proteinase K as examples of \"anti-matrix\" agents on a multispecies oral biofilm (Karygianni et al., 2020a) . In that study, it was shown that the combined application of DNase I and proteinase K had an impact on the reduction in total colony-forming units (CFU) and on the biofilm structure. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of CHX on DNase I/ proteinase K-treated biofilms, thereby combining antimicrobial agents with \"anti-matrix\" agents using the \"Zurich biofilm model.\" Thus, in addition to matrix-degrading enzymes, biofilms were exposed to high (\u22650.1%) and low (<0.1%) concentrations of CHX (Serrano et al., 2015) . We therefore quantified CFU and visualized the biofilms with the aid of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to show alterations in structure and composition in multispecies oral biofilms. To the best of our knowledge, the combined effect of DNase I, proteinase K, and CHX has never been studied so far in an oral in vitro multispecies biofilm. The null hypothesis of this study was that there is no difference in microbial growth between enzyme-treated biofilms and untreated biofilms when exposed to high (\u22650.1%) and low (<0.1%) concentrations of CHX.",

The experimental setup involved four treatment groups, with each group being divided into two subgroups whose growth medium contained either no enzymes or DNase I + proteinase K ( Table 1) : group A was treated with 0.05% CHX, group B with 0.1% CHX; group C with 0.2% CHX, and group D was not treated and served as the negative control. The timing of exposure and incubation time as well as enzyme concentrations were optimized in preliminary experiments (data not shown). The growth medium contained 70% saliva and 30% mFUM supplemented with S\u00f8rensen's buffer (pH 7.2). For those biofilms treated with DNase I and proteinase K, a stock solution of each enzyme was added to the media resulting in a final concentration of 0.002 mg/ml for DNase I and 0.1 mg/ml for proteinase K. The carbohydrate concentration of mFUM was 0.3% glucose (w/v; 0-16 h of biofilm cultivation) or 0.15% glucose and 0.15% sucrose (16-64 h). To initiate a biofilm experiment, disks were covered with 1.6 ml of growth medium and 200 \u03bcl of inoculum prior to anaerobic incubation at 37\u00b0C. The growth medium was changed after 16 and 40 h. After 16, 20, and 24 h, and after 40, 44, and 48 h, the disks were placed in 1 ml CHX in the respective concentration for 1 min (see treatment groups in Table 1 ). To remove the non-adherent microorganisms and remaining CHX, the biofilms were washed by consecutively dipping them three times in 2 ml saline before putting them back into the medium.",

In the present study, we went further by aiming to demonstrate for the first time -to our knowledge -the combined effect of different concentrations of CHX (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2%) with the enzyme DNase I (0.002 mg/ml) and proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) on a six-species in vitro biofilm, the so-called \"Zurich biofilm model.\" The application of EPS matrix-digesting enzymes in combination with antimicrobial agents seems to be a promising approach to control biofilm activity (Koo et al., 2017) . Hence, the objective of our experiments was to mechanically destabilize the biofilms with the applied enzymes and simultaneously kill the microbes by applying low concentrations of CHX. The combined treatment with DNase I/proteinase K and the lowest concentration of CHX (0.05%) tested led to a significant reduction in total microbial counts and CFU counts of five out of the six species compared to the biofilms treated with 0.05% CHX alone. The only exception was observed in the species F. nucleatum, TABLE 2 | Mean log 10 CFU counts of the whole biofilm (total CFU) and the six microorganisms used in the biofilm model when treated with 0.05% CHX compared to the combined treatment with enzymes plus 0.05% CHX alone (n = 6).",

CLSM images are FIGURE 2 | Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) Z-stack maximum projections (A-E) and 3D reconstructions (a-e) of biofilms grown on HA disks after treatment with or without CHX and/or DNase I + proteinase K. Total DNA (green) was stained with a mixture of YoPro 1 and SYTOX\u2122 Green. Extracellular polysaccharides (blue) were stained with Calcofluor. Extracellular DNA (eDNA; red) was stained with Cy3-streptavidin labeled anti-DNA-antibody, and extracellular proteins (purple) were stained with SYPRO\u2122 Ruby. a useful tool to visualize the extracellular matrix of biofilms because they can depict the matrix in a fully hydrated state . Overall, it can be stated that the combined enzymatic and antimicrobial treatment resulted in a reduction of microbial counts and a drastic alteration of the structural integrity within the examined biofilms. In contrast, Ali Mohammed et al. (2013) found no significant effect of proteinase K or DNase I on the formation and dispersion of biofilms consisting of F. nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis grown in a static biofilm model in polystyrene microtiter plates, although they used much higher concentrations of each enzyme (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml). It is well established that biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics, and antimicrobial agents such as CHX, than planktonic cells (Flemming and Wingender, 2010; Xiao et al., 2012) . It appears that ionic interactions hinder the positively charged CHX from diffusing through the negatively charged EPS matrix (Hope and Wilson, 2004) . For example, Guiot et al. (2002) showed that Lactobacillus lactis and Stenotrophonas maltophilia biofilms form a barrier to the diffusion of cationic particles. In another study, Xiao et al. (2012) examined the effect of 0.12% CHX on multispecies biofilms formed with gtfBC null mutant strains of S. mutans, resulting in rapid killing of these biofilms. The genes gtfB and gtfC code for glucosyltransferases B or C, respectively (GTF B or GTF C), while the former produces water-insoluble glucans and the latter produces both water-soluble and insoluble glucans (Aoki et al., 1986; Hanada and Kuramitsu, 1988) . In the present study, the extracellular polysaccharides were not a direct target of the treatment, but by reducing a large part of the biofilm, extracellular polysaccharides and EPS, in general, are also eliminated. This is particularly evident in Figures 2B-D/b-d. The number of adherent microbial cells decreases because of the treatment with DNase I/proteinase K, which consequently leads to a decreased production of extracellular polysaccharides. The diffusion of CHX into the biofilms is thus facilitated, resulting in the elimination of the remaining microbes. The synergistic effect between CHX in low concentrations (0.5%) and DNase I/proteinase K is indicated in Figure 1 , which shows the significant reduction in the total CFU counts and the CFU counts of A. oris, V. dispar, S. mutans, S. oralis, and C. albicans compared to the treatment with 0.5% CHX alone. These findings indicate that the EPS of a biofilm matrix plays an important role in protecting the biofilm against antimicrobial agents, making it an interesting target for antibiofilm therapy (Karygianni et al., 2020b) . In another approach for developing a combined antibiofilm therapy, the susceptibility to four different antibiotics of biofilms formed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. oralis grown on porous sintered glass beads was examined by Gonzalez Moreno et al. (2017) . It was shown that pre-treatment of biofilms with proteinase K increased their susceptibility to lower concentrations of the tested antibiotics compared to biofilms treated with antibiotics alone. Previously, it was shown that proteinase K can change the composition of the EPS matrix of S. aureus biofilms, particularly by decreasing the number of proteins, and even the amount of eDNA (Shukla and Rao, 2017) . Furthermore, proteinase K can disperse established biofilms of Listeria monocytogenes by attacking proteins of the matrix used to adhere to a surface (Nguyen and Burrows, 2014) . On the other hand, both bovine DNase I and recombinant human DNase I (rhDNase I, dornase alfa) were shown to inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, disperse preformed biofilms of S. aureus, and increase their sensitivity to biocide killing in vitro (Izano et al., 2008; Kaplan et al., 2012) . Nguyen and Burrows (2014) showed that DNase I can reduce the biofilms of L. monocytogenes when present during its formation. Bovine DNase I was also able to reduce the formation of S. mutans biofilms grown on HA disks by more than 1 log CFU (Liao et al., 2014) . Furthermore, rhDNase I can be used clinically in patients with cystic fibrosis to digest neutrophile-derived DNA in order to liquefy their sputum and thereby enhance its clearance (Shak et al., 1990; Suri, 2005; Manzenreiter et al., 2012) . Moreover, a single center clinical study tested the use of nebulized dornase alfa together with albuterol (a bronchodilator agent) on five mechanically ventilated patients diagnosed with COVID-19, resulting in reduced oxygen requirement. The patients were all successfully extubated afterward and could be discharged from the hospital (Weber et al., 2020) .",

Biofilms were stained with the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit to visualize the relative viability of bacterial populations according to the membrane integrity of the cell. SYTO 9 can penetrate cells with both intact and compromised membranes (green), while propidium iodide only penetrates cells with damaged membranes (red).
