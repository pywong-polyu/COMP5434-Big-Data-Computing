Acute change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score \u22652 indicates sepsis-related organ dysfunction and is associated with inhospital mortality. Systemic In ammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and \"severe sepsis\" terms were omitted from the most recent de nition. SIRS has been criticised for its poor speci city, while \"severe sepsis\" may underestimate sepsis's seriousness. A subset of patients may develop septic shock with underlying profound organ dysfunction and excess mortality. Clinically, septic shock is de ned as persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) \u2265 65 mm Hg and serum lactate level \u2265 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) despite adequate volume resuscitation.",

[18] [19] [20] [21] We are unaware of any prospective studies that validate or speci cally studied the predictive accuracy of qSOFA score, SIRS criteria, or EWSs in the ED in Middle East region in general and Arab countries in particular. Moreover, previous international studies have limitations that a ect their validity. 13 Aim e purpose of this study is to externally validate qSOFA score, SIRS criteria, and EWSs for in-hospital mortality among adult patients with suspected infection presenting to the ED in the Middle East region. In an ED setting, it is crucial to take a patient's vital signs as early as possible to make decisions and predict the patient's outcome.",

However, rules-of-thumb for sample size are problematic, as they are not speci c to the model or validation setting. Indeed, Snell et al showed that the rule-of-thumb of having at least 100 events and 100 non-events does not always produce precise estimates of a model's predictive performance measures.23 To overcome this limitation, we chose to target an event rate of\u2265200. Previous work by Freund et al 15 showed that a sample size of 879 patients yielded 74 events when power was set at 90%. erefore, if we target a minimum of 200 events and consider 20% of lost to follow-up and missing",
