            "text": "Precarious housing conditions are on the rise in many developing economies, which has resulted in increasing segmentation between population groups with different socioeconomic backgrounds, and in differentiated access to life chances. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its subsequent lockdowns, the relation between learning and housing conditions has become crucial for understanding the adult student's learning experience and well-being. However, knowledge about this relation is limited. This study employs the concept of dwelling to investigate how housing-related precarities may impact upon experiences of students during COVID-19 induced stay-at-home orders. The study draws on fifteen in-depth interviews and a Zoom Video Conferencing (ZVC)-aided focus group in the Ashaiman Municipality in Ghana, to explore students' perspectives on precarious housing conditions, well-being and learning. Findings reveal that experiences of precarious housing conditions can be complicated and compromised in diverse ways related to quality learning environment, financial, and personal well-being. Through ZVC-aided focus groups, participants defined housing suitable for learningnot purely in academic terms but in relation to housing characteristics, the neighbourhood environment, the built environment, and the social relations of learning. The study finds that students perceive an array of economic, social and geographic barriers to learning and that these perspectives deserve attention in adult student housing policy debate.",

            "text": "This study on student housing, part of a larger project on uncertainties of COVID-19 and well-being of adults in Ghana, is aimed at exploring students' perspectives on precarious housing conditions, well-being and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Like all areas upended by COVID-19, impacts are complex assemblages of the social, economic, and psychological factors that go into them: walkability, perceived crime, the social interaction with family and friends, inadequate space for learning, noise, and the neighbourhood environment, and so on, all of which affect the adult student (Mayen & Cafagna, 2021) . What is more, the home learning environment includes, in addition to the physical space of the house, the influences of the learning technologies (access to computers, internet, regular source of light) and the community built environment. As students shifted from regular inperson instructions to virtual engagements with lecturers and peers, new questions emerged about students' new learning environmentthe home conditions, not given much consideration and attention to be a learning environment prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding this trajectory will mean negotiating for a new learning space; it will mean a shift to online learning with its associated challenges, such as information, communication and technology (ICT) access (computers, internet, cost of data, connectivity challenges), poor housing conditions to support learning, and more competing responsibilities of family, friends and learning (Aristovnik et al., 2020) . Questions about the right home environment to enable students to remain living in their homes should their needs change remain largely unaddressed (Zetlin et al., 2012; Madrigal & Blevins, 2021) . Thus, the goal of this paper is to contribute to the existing body of research examining the housing circumstances of undergraduate students during COVID-19. In doing so, the paper presents the findings of a qualitative study aimed at exploring perceived learning and well-being impacts of the home environment amongst undergraduate students, residing in one Ghanaian municipality.",

            "text": "Dwelling place as -home\u2016 is not just a physical shelter, but also a foundation for social, psychological and cultural well-being (U.S. Department of Health and Education and Human Service, 2006; Garnham & Rolfe, 2019) , during which the home becomes a meeting place of human practices and objects, spaces that blend learning and everyday social and bureaucratic life. Chapham (2010) argued that housing research does not have to be a one-size-fits-all approach, but could be understood in a way that is based on the meaning that housing has for the people who live in it. Here we attempt to address these concerns within a local-level context. Today, the disruption of on campus accommodation in general, and face-to-face instructions more specifically, paradoxically has expanded the immediacy of the home space as a learning environment while advancing searches for more effective ways to maximise the housing conditions for learning. In doing so, this paper also suggests an extension of one of the most extensively employed concepts for examining housing researchthat of Heidegger by inclusion of a more nuanced notion of dwelling place. In his seminal work, Building Dwelling Thinking, Heidegger (1971) used the concept of dwelling to convey the idea of being-in-the-world, which goes beyond the idea of mere presence, indicating the way an entity shows itself within a world (Heidegger, 1962, p. 84) .",

            "text": "Beginning with Heidegger's description of the concept of dwelling (Heidegger, 1971) and building on Ingold's idea of dwelling, a number of researchers have used the concept as an approach to nature, place, and landscape. Some seek to distinguish between the built environment (the ville) and the ways of living (the cit\u00e9), and introduced time as part of the relational processes the individual develops through dwelling (Sennett, 2018) , where people anchor their existence in space and time (Besse, 2013) , and dwelling as a -skill, the potentiality of which lies in most people\u2016 (Sennett, 2018, p. 204) . Some underscored that in order to dwell, there is a need to learn to perceive the world and the affordances of the environment (Ingold, 2000) , distanciated networks (Amin, 2002) , pluri-local communities (Pries, 2001) , cosmopolitical space (Entrikin, 2004) , and multi-stranded social relations (Coe & Bunnell, 2003) . So, what are the commonalities amongst these conceptualizations, and is there still a place for dwelling in housing studies? At a glance, it appears dwelling is associated with the way of caring for oneselfthe contextual (i.e., the characteristics of space, and place within which the individual is situated) and collective (i.e., the nature of the social relationships in which the individual engages within his/her context). Second, dwelling is not a straightforward process, as Heidegger (1971) pointed out that dwelling has to be learned. Third, the approaches all underline that dwelling, apart from space, is also constituted in time. environment and adult individual learning style needs, have been demonstrated to shape learning, suggesting that dwelling place may have an impact on learning and access within home spaces (Khan et al., 2019) . With the arrival of COVID-19 and further disruption of inperson instruction, studies have found that the outcomes of teaching, the pedagogy, the content, the teacher-student communication, the economy, and the workload on teachers and students have changed, yet the dwelling place, although fundamental, has not been considered aside from assuming that the home environment is somehow different from the school environment (Jandri\u0107 et al., 2020; Bubb & Jones, 2020; Butola, 2021) . Financially, students in all countries, who have to work to support their studies, now found themselves unemployed and without funding support (Grant & Gedeon, 2020) . Further studies in South Africa found that people mostly access the Internet from their smartphones, but data costs are too expensive, making their students' situations even worse (Venter & Daniels, 2020) . Given that in recent years the dwelling place has been seen as vital in determining the appropriate provision of services for many students in the world (Hu, Roberts, Azevedo, & Milner, 2021) , it is important to understand how the learning process and access to learning resources is manifested at the home learning environment (Cranfield et al., 2021) . However, in Ghana, the impact of housing conditions and the home environment on students' learning and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to be researched. At the current time, most students are found to be learning at home and research on this topic is limited. The Heidegger (1971) framework has been used extensively in many educational settings at different geographic locations. This paper offers a Ghanaian example that explores the applicability of the framework for identifying determinants of students' learning conditions and access at the home scale of analysis (i.e., virtual). Specifically, in light of Ingold's (2000) charge, and extending the earlier conceptual frameworks of Heidegger (1971) ), this study explores explicitly students' perspectives on precarious housing conditions, well-being and learning in the Ashaiman Municipality, Greater Accra, Ghana.",

Approximately 78% of all dwelling units are compound houses (rental houses); 9.2% are separate houses and 3.0% are semi-detached houses. In addition, about 11.2% of households in the municipality have 10 or more members occupying one room. A little over 63% of households in the municipality use the public toilet facility with 4.0% having no toilet facility and therefore resort to the bush/beach/field (Ghana Statistical Service, 2014).

First, I conducted in-depth interviews with fifteen undergraduate students (from six universities in Ghana, see Table 1 ) in the study area to explore students' experiences and perceptions of the home space in relation to learning and well-being during COVID-19. I contacted participants through phone calls and a WhatsApp message. Although the study explicitly targeted students that had already participated in our previous study (students were contacted via church announcements, the Federation of Ashaiman Youth Club, and referrals), it was difficult to reach a number of them for the current study, and therefore, I resorted to referrals from participants.",

The focus group centred on two questions: (1) How have housing conditions impacted your learning and well-being during the pandemic and the subsequent closure of schools? (2) If you have had the chance to choose, which type of accommodation, housing characteristics would you prefer, and why? The first question aimed at evaluating participants' experiences during COVID-19 in relation to the social, economic, and environmental constraints of the home space. The second question was explicitly contextual and explored participants' perspectives about where in the city they would like to live and why?

This involved identifying themes; initial codes with similar characteristics were colour-coded. Similar and recurrent codes were grouped together under one heading. For example, financial challenges and the disruption of in-person interactions with other students were grouped under one theme. The themes were reviewed by two researchers who are well grounded in qualitative research data analysis. The researchers reviewed the themes to ensure that they reflected the data and searched for new codes, which were added to the initial ones. The results of the analysis are discussed below.",

Further, in this research, we are urged to take seriously the opportunities that such an idea of place presents for understanding the home environment, learning processes, and well-being of populations. This research demonstrates that the learning experience and well-being of participants in this study does seem to be affected by the change from the in-person on campus lifestyle to the online home-learning environment experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the learning impacts identified in this research amongst undergraduate students are similar to those found in past research amongst the general population regarding the well-being of people in precarious housing conditions (Bates et al., 2019) . However, the unique position of these participants as students, results in worsened learning challenges for themselves and their families. In particular, the noise concerns that participants linked to the built environment are especially unique to the students because that environment is not conducive and appropriate for learning. The existing literature on home environment, learning, and well-being demonstrates the links amongst noise, lack of concentration, and loss of identity (Xie et al., 2011; Mayen & Cafagna, 2021; Yang et al., 2021) . For students who are learning from home because of the pandemic and school closures, the subsequent migration from in-person to online via the home environment appears to have exacerbated the well-being of students in the Ashaiman area.",

While the lockdown measures provided opportunity for families to be together for an extended period of time, the frequent engagements of family members made disruptive patterns (particularly for students) more apparent, exacerbating the family stress. In this study, a handful of participants found it difficult, or even impossible to study at home, perhaps a reflection of the family's socioeconomic status (Grant & Gedeon, 2020) .

A similar result was found in this study. Participants noted that the lack of jobs and funding support from the government during the pandemic had resulted in the reduction of their income, which in turn, impacted their well-being. Employment difficulties and well-being impacts may be even greater for those students who come from less privileged socioeconomic backgrounds. Income is a contributing factor to well-being amongst unemployed individuals (Jara, Tamayo & Tumino, 2021) . Income itself is a widely accepted determinant of health and a lack of income has been found to correlate with poor health (Dupas & Miguel, 2017; Sharma et al., 2020) .",

The findings showed that the majority of the participants had challenges with ICT and related issues in the home environment. According to participants, some students could not access ICT and had issues including connectivity, cost of data, and regular supply of electricity to support ICT equipment. These kinds of disadvantages have been highlighted in other contexts (Aristovnik et al. 2020 ). Venter and Daniels (2020) described how in Europe and South Africa, many individuals lacked access to the Internet and complained about the cost of data, and the impacts on the learning experiences and well-being of students. In addition, participants created narratives about the potential for the home environment to support online learning should their learning needs change as witnessed during the pandemic. In a focus group discussion, participants identified poor housing conditions, poorly planned neighbourhoods, and -noisy\u2016 areas as main factors that do not support learning and wellbeing. To fully explore participants' perceptions on housing and learning, one must recognise the complexity of the interrelationships between housing, learning, identity and well-being that exist in everyday lives. This research is consistent with Heidegger (1971) , with respect to the importance of examining the relationship that building (here, housing conditions including neighbourhood characteristics) has with dwelling. Heidegger holds that problems of building are essentially problems of dwelling and that the manner in which we dwell is the manner in which we are, we existan extension of our identity, of who we are.",
