The challenges for young adults during the pandemic are voiced by Richter et al. (2) : \"It is safe to assume that many young people are experiencing significant hardship during this time.\" Indeed, social contacts and mobility were restricted due to the national containment measures such as social distancing and closure of schools and universities. The daily structure of young adults changed drastically. Previous studies have shown that university students struggled with online classes and lack of contact with their fellow students (3, 4) . Further, an increase in mental health symptoms in university students during the course of the pandemic has been observed (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Moreover, change in health behaviors such as physical activity, nutrition and substance consumption in university students was reported (5, 6, (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) .",

            "text": "Results on alcohol consumption during the lockdown are inconsistent. The assumption that university students would increase their consumption of alcohol during the lockdown, because of the stressful situation and lack of social control, was supported only by some of the studies collecting data during the pandemic (14, 15, 17) . However, despite a part of university students increasing their alcohol consumption, others reduced their consumption. For example, Bann et al. examined change in alcohol consumption before and during the lockdown, in five representative British cohorts. In the youngest cohort, the 19-20year-olds, 28% reported to have never consumed alcohol during the lockdown, and high risk alcohol consumption decreased from 33 to 13% (5) . Similarly, college students in the USA reduced their quantity of alcoholic beverages from 11.5 to 9.9 drinks per week during the COVID-19 pandemic (16) . However, another study from the USA found an increase in alcohol consumption in university students during the lockdown (14) . Risk factors associated with an increased alcohol consumption were male gender and symptoms of depression and anxiety (5, 14) , while greater perceived social support and returning to live with parents were associated with no increase in alcohol consumption (14, 16, 18) . Those that perceived a high impact were more vulnerable to develop risky health behavior and adverse health outcomes (19, 20) . These results indicate that the pandemic does not affect all young adults equally.",

On one hand, alcohol may be used as coping strategy to deal with symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders, and on the other hand, problematic alcohol consumption can increase the probability to develop a psychological disorder (21) . This correlation between depression or anxiety disorders and increased alcohol consumption was also found during the pandemic (14) . Alcohol abuse itself has damaging short-and long-term health effects for the individual (22, 23) and economic consequences at the individual and societal level (24) . It is crucial to detect both, psychological symptoms and problematic alcohol consumption, at an early stage to intervene and recuse negative consequences, especially in young adults. The life phase of emerging adulthood is a vulnerable phase for the development and establishment of healthy and risky health behavior (25, 26) , and the pandemic likely increased this vulnerability. While the pandemic most probably affected all young adults and university students, the impact on mental health and alcohol consumption may differ across countries.",

The first survey T0, the baseline survey, took place during the first lockdown (16 March to 26 April 2020), while T1 and T2 took place after the lockdown. The Supplementary Figure 1 shows the corresponding stringency of containment measures in Switzerland, the epidemiological data incidence and deaths, as well as the survey time points. University students from all faculties of the ZHAW (N = 12'431) received a non-personalized email, via a central email distribution list containing all students, with information about the study and an online-link inviting them to fill in the online-survey. Of those invited 16.3% (T0, n = 2'023), 11.6% (T1, n = 1'436) and 9.7% (T2, n = 1'207) filled in the surveys. Participants had to actively provide their consent to participate in the study before filling in the online questionnaire. Anonymity was guaranteed at all times. The study is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by both the local cantonal ethics committee (BASEC-Nr. Req-2020-00326) and the ZHAW data protection officer.",

All outcomes were coded as binary response variables. Survey questions related to alcohol consumption were adopted from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and other Drugs (ESPAD) (27, 28) . Increased alcohol consumption was assessed using the following question: \"Think back over the last 30 days. Has your alcohol consumption changed in the last 30 days?\" (dichotomous response categories created: 0 = less alcohol/no change, 1 = more alcohol). Any binge drinking and heavy binge drinking were assessed by asking participants the following question: \"Think back again over the last 30 days. How many times (if any) have you had five or more drinks on one occasion? (A \"drink\" is a glass/bottle/can of beer (ca 50 cl), a glass/bottle/can of cider (ca 50 cl), 2 glasses/bottles of alcopops (ca 50 cl), a glass of wine (ca. 15 cl), a glass of spirits (ca. 5 cl) or a mixed drink.\" To capture episodes of any binge drinking and heavy binge drinking respectively, response categories (0, 1, 2, 3-5, 6-9, \u226510) were recoded to 0 = no binge drinking (response 0) and 1 = yes, binge drinking (response \u22651), and 0 = no (0-1) and 1 = yes (2-10) for heavy binge drinking.",

This finding is comparable with other study results (5, 16), indicating differential health behavior changes among university students. University students who increased their alcohol consumption reported a higher number of drinks at baseline, higher anxiety symptoms and lower resilience compared to university students who did not increase their alcohol consumption. Apparently, university students who reported a higher alcohol consumption at the beginning of the pandemic were those at highest risk to increase their alcohol consumption during the following weeks of the early pandemic. We did not assess reasons for the increase in alcohol consumption, however, other studies suggest that university students used alcohol to cope with the insecure and challenging situation caused by the pandemic (38, 39) . Vanderbruggen et al. found loneliness, lack of social contact, loss of daily structures but also boredom to be the main reasons for drinking more alcohol during the pandemic (40) . The higher anxiety symptoms and lower resilience level reported by university students in the current study further support the hypothesis that the perceived adverse impact of the pandemic may have led to the increase in alcohol consumption.",

This reduction might be explained by the loosening of containment measures and a less severe epidemiological situation at T2 (i.e., lower COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to T0 and T1, see Supplementary Figure 1 ). The first follow-up took place shortly after the lockdown, therefore we may assume that the higher proportion of students with increased alcohol consummation indicates its use as coping mechanism or a lock-down induced temporary health behavior change. At the second follow-up increased alcohol consumption dropped by 10%. This reduction might be explained by the loosening of containment measures and a less severe epidemiological situation at T2 (i.e., lower COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to T0 and T1, see Supplementary Figure 1) , thus a normalization of everyday life and reductions of Covid-related stressors.",

In this sample, about one forth engaged at least once in binge drinking during the last 30 days at T1 or T2. The finding is comparable to results from a national Swiss survey, in which 27% of 15-to 24-year-olds and 22% of 25-to-34-year-olds engaged at least once a month in binge drinking (42) . Also, for binge drinking higher number of drinks at baseline and anxiety symptoms were associated with engaging in binge drinking at follow-up. Interestingly, university students that lived with their parents showed lower odds for binge drinking than university students living in their own household. Possibly living with parents is a proxy for higher social control or, positively expressed, parents acted as a support system providing a daily structure at home and social contacts that the other university students lacked, reducing the risk to resort to binge drinking as a coping strategy. Further risk factors were male gender and younger age. Both associations were expected and shown in previous studies (5, 41) .",

In fact, the behavior was associated with higher perceived social support, which seems counter-intuitive at first. However, binge drinking does happen more often among friends and peers (39, 41) . Perceived social support was added in the model under the assumption to be a protective factor, but in this case we observe the opposite. The results should be interpreted with caution, as the sample of heavy binge drinker was rather small, and other known associations, such as gender and age, were not found. However, heavy binge drinking in university students is a known problem and based on previous findings, it becomes clear that successful interventions must address perceived social norms among university students in relation to binge drinking (41, 43) .",

Social desirability bias, however, would most probably cause an underreporting; implying that the actual number of participants with increased consumption might be higher. Further, it is possible that only the first or last days of the 30-act period are remembered more accurately, while the time in between is more difficult to remember [primacy and recency effect (44, 45) ]. So, an over-and underestimation of reported consumption is possible. Assuming a non-differential bias, the power but not the direction of the association should be impacted. Furthermore, we did not assess the reasons for drinking or the situations in which university students were drinking alcohol. Also, our results may not be generalizable to Swiss young adults outside the university setting, as the latter may have been affected differently by the pandemic, and the higher proportion of women compared to men could limit the generalizability of the frequencies of increased alcohol consumption. A strength of the study is the large sample of university students from different faculties and the data collection started early in the pandemic, including the first lockdown, as well as the postlockdown phase. Furthermore, it is the first study examining risk factors for increased or binge alcohol drinking in Swiss university students during the pandemic, providing valuable information for health promotion and prevention for this specific population in future.",

It is reassuring, that at the follow-up 2 the odds of increased alcohol consumption was already reduced. The data underline the vulnerability of the transition to an independent adult life (26) and the relevance of the life phase emerging adulthood for health behavior development. It seems relevant to consider risks simultaneously (46) or using a cluster approach to identify different risk profiles, not only including age and gender, but also living situation and social support when developing interventions. The data point to the importance of the baseline risk when a crisis occurs, and thus the necessity of continuous prevention activities and investments in order to increase resilience. Universities, for example, could teach sustainable coping strategies for students to deal with uncertain and stressful events and provide support for those students at risk.",
