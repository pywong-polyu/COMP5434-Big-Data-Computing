The RNA preservation may be due to the preservation solution, which contains guanidine isothiocyanate, sodium dodecylsarcosine, and dithiothreitol.

inactivated and non-inactivated samples at different temperatures and durationsThe effects of heat treatment at different temperatures and durations on the SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR Ct-value were evaluated. As shown in table 1, The Ct values of ORF1a/b from 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples were 25.63-34.86, and the Ct values of the heat inactivated samples were similar to the non-inactivated samples. The average Ct values difference between inactivated samples at 56\u2103 for 30min and noninactivated samples is -0.7175 to 1.947, 0.102 to 2.806 between inactivated samples at 56\u2103 for 60min and non-inactivated samples, 0.0145 to 2.0435 between inactivated samples at 60\u2103 for 30min and non-inactivated samples, -0.3735 to 2.489, between inactivated samples at 60\u2103 for 60min and non-inactivated samples, -1.321 to 2.254 between inactivated samples at 100\u2103 for 10min and non-inactivated samples.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, all heat inactivated samples were tested positive. As shown in table 2, The Ct values of N of 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples were 24.46-35.43, and the Ct values of the heat-inactivated samples were approximate to the non-inactivated samples. The average Ct values difference between the inactivated samples at 56\u2103 for 30min and the non-inactivated samples is -0.359 to 2.019, -0.3385 to 2.088 between the inactivated samples at 56\u2103 for 60min and the noninactivated samples, -0.646 to 1.7505 between the inactivated samples at 60\u2103 for All rights reserved.
