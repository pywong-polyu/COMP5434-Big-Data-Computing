Viruses are the main infectious agents of ARIs [4] , among which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, human enterovirus, influenza virus (FLU), human coronavirus, adenovirus (ADV) and human Boca virus account for approximately 70% of ARI viral infections [2] . Studies have analyzed viral infections in ARIs. A systematic review and meta-analysis examined some viral infections in children under 5 years of age hospitalized for acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) and found that influenza viruses (IVs), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), ADVs and coronaviruses (CVs) were all commonly responsible for ALRIs [5] . RSV is also a common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of hospital admissions in young children [6] .",

Nasopharynx swabs or oropharynx swabs are commonly used for pathogen detection of ARIs [3, 7, 8] . In this study, the detection of four respiratory viruses (ADV, FLUA, FLUB, and RSV) using oropharyngeal swabs from 103,210 children with ARIs was analyzed retrospectively. Among them, 38,355 cases were positive for at least one virus, with a total positivity rate of 37.2%, which is close to the rates of respiratory viruses in the literature (32.5-35.8%) [7, 9] . Other studies have reported higher (69.1-85.8%) and lower (14.6-24.5%) rates [4, [10] [11] [12] . There were 1910 cases infected with two or more viruses, and the positivity rate of multiple infection was 1.9%, close to the 2.2% reported by Krishnan [13] but lower than the 5.0% reported by Kim [14] . Different analyses of positivity rates are related to different kinds of patients, geographical areas and detection methods. Among the 38,355 patients, 38.0% were male and 36.2% female. The difference between the two sexes was statistically significant (\u03c7 2 = 37.0, P < 0.001, see Table 1 ). The literature [3, 9] reports no significant differences between males and females in common respiratory viral infection, though Krishnan A and Shapiro d [13, 15] found that the detection rate of males was higher than that of females, which was consistent with our results. The rates of ADV, FLUA, FLUB and RSV positivity were 13.0%, 18.2%, 2.3% and 7.0%, respectively. The highest rate of FLUA positivity indicated a prevalence of FLUA in Zhejiang Province from April 2018 to March 2019. In our study, the total positivity rate was the highest in winter, while the peak of viral detection was in spring, as reported by Wang [12] ; no significant difference between seasons was reported by Kurskaya [3] . The difference my due to local geography and climate. The rate of positive viral infection in different age groups increased with age, with a statistically significant difference. Wang [12] reported that 92.8% of children positive for viral pathogens were \u2264 3 years old. Kim [14] reported that respiratory viruses mainly occurred in infants and children under 5 years old. The types of viruses analyzed and different detection methods may be related to different age distributions.",

The similarities and differences in rates for each virus may be related to climate and environmental factors, population distribution, economic status, diagnostic methods used, and accessibility and connectivity of medical care [3, 21] . High population density and an increase in shared space are conducive to the spread of influenza and other viruses. Therefore, it is a general recommendation to avoid going to school or work during infection [9] . January to February 2019 occurred during the end of the semester in primary and secondary schools in Zhejiang Province. Although there was an increase in patients with fever, schools were not closed.
