Currently, there is a critical need for a comprehensive, valid, reliable, and pragmatic measure of organizational readiness that can be used throughout the implementation process. This study aims to develop a readiness measure that can be used to support implementation in two critical public health settings: federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and schools. The measure is informed by the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation and R = MC 2 heuristic (readiness = motivation \u00d7 innovation-specific capacity \u00d7 general capacity). The study aims are to adapt and further develop the readiness measure in FQHCs implementing evidence-based interventions for colorectal cancer screening, to test the validity and reliability of the developed readiness measure in FQHCs, and to adapt and assess the usability and validity of the readiness measure in schools implementing a nutrition-based program. Methods: For aim 1, we will conduct a series of qualitative interviews to adapt the readiness measure for use in FQHCs. We will then distribute the readiness measure to a developmental sample of 100 health center sites (up to 10 staff members per site). We will use a multilevel factor analysis approach to refine the readiness measure. For aim 2, we will distribute the measure to a different sample of 100 health center sites. We will use multilevel confirmatory factor analysis models to examine the structural validity. We will also conduct tests for scale reliability, test-retest reliability, and inter-rater reliability. For aim 3, we will use a qualitative approach to adapt the measure for use in schools and conduct reliability and validity tests similar to what is described in aim 2.",

Implementation science aims to identify and understand factors that influence implementation success so they can be addressed to improve outcomes. Existing gaps in measurement are a major barrier to improving the understanding of such factors and developing strategies to address them. The field has identified organizational readiness as an important factor for implementation success [1] [2] [3] [4] . Therefore, a pragmatic organizational readiness assessment can both accelerate and improve dissemination and implementation efforts. This study aims to develop a comprehensive readiness measure in two critical public health settings (federally qualified health centers and schools), targeting two important public health issues (colorectal cancer screening and poor nutrition).",

Organizational readiness, as defined across frameworks, is associated with implementation success. The organizational readiness model used in our study consolidates many common constructs shown to be related to implementation success [6, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . While past studies defined readiness as a construct that refers to an organization's commitment and collective capability to change [3, 17] , and considered it a critical precursor to organizational change, more recent conceptualizations reflect the important role it plays during all phases of implementation [4] . Readiness extends beyond initial adoption and implementation and reflects an organization's commitment, motivation, and capacity for change over time [18] . This conceptualization of readiness, which emerged from the ISF, is also broader than previous definitions.",

The ISF focuses on building the delivery system's capacity and motivation through the synthesis and translation of research and assistance from the support system. Flaspohler et al. [19] and Wandersman et al. [5] detailed two distinct categories of capacity: innovationspecific and general capacities. Innovation-specific capacities are the knowledge, skills, and conditions needed to put a particular innovation in place. General capacities involve the general functioning of an organization and include the knowledge, skills, and conditions needed to put any innovation into place. Although capacity is a critical component of readiness, it is insufficient for effective change. The model proposes that organizational readiness also depends on the organization's motivation to implement an innovation [3, 17] . Within the ISF, readiness is a combination of motivation \u00d7 innovationspecific capacity \u00d7 general capacity. We abbreviate this as R = MC 2 [4] . Within these three main components, there are multiple subcomponents that make up an organization's overall readiness (Table 1) [9] [10] [11] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

Third, no measures assess readiness in a comprehensive manner taking into account critical elements as proposed in the R = MC 2 heuristic. A comprehensive readiness measure based on the R = MC 2 heuristic is important for all phases of implementation, and it can serve as a useful diagnostic tool for identifying strengths and weaknesses across multiple constructs. Having information about readiness can inform the selection and tailoring of support strategies (e.g., training and technical assistance) throughout implementation to further improve program effectiveness. Overall, readiness is critical for successful implementation and its measurement is essential for research, evaluation, and pragmatic assessment. Previously, our team developed a readiness measure based on the ISF and the R = MC 2 heuristic to assess readiness for implementing a health improvement process among community coalitions. Existing quantitative and qualitative data provided preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the readiness measure in various settings. Additionally, the readiness measure has gained substantial interest from a range of organizations both in the USA and internationally, and in both the research and practice communities. Despite high levels of interest, more work is needed to rigorously develop, adapt, and test the readiness measure across settings. Thus, an important aspect of our work is to further develop the readiness measure for use in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to target colorectal cancer screening (CRCS), and for use in schools to target nutrition programs.",

The CDC CRCCP views these as the most feasible interventions for implementation in FQHC and other primary care settings [41, 42] . Despite the focus on CRCS in FQHCs and through programs such as the CRCCP, the implementation of these approaches has been slow and inconsistent [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] .

While EBIs for F&V consumption in children exist [51] [52] [53] [54] , additional work is needed to improve the implementation of these approaches in schools. In this study, the research team aims to test the readiness measure with a school-based program with ongoing implementation. This program, titled Brighter Bites, is an EBI to improve F&V intake among low-income children and their families [51, 55, 56] . The program has shown rapid dissemination from one school in 2012 to more than 100 schools in Texas, with more than 20,000 families participating. While existing dissemination efforts are encouraging, implementation varies widely across sites. Organizational readiness is likely one of the factors that influence the implementation of this program. Thus, having a comprehensive, valid, and reliable readiness measure for schools could (1) help understand implementation variability and (2) help lead to greatly enhanced implementation efforts and broad program scale-up. Overall, the use of a consistent readiness measure across settings and topic areas can advance implementation science and further our understanding of how organizational readiness influences implementation outcomes.",

These interviews will ask participants about their understanding of specific items included in the readiness measure and what they need to think about when responding to respective items.

As a preliminary step, we will conduct CFA models for each readiness component (general capacity, innovation-specific capacity, and motivation) using individual level data. We will examine modification indices to highlight potential points of model strain. We will then conduct a series of multilevel CFA models for each readiness subcomponent. In multilevel models, we will note items with low factor loadings (< 0.40). After assessing each subcomponent separately, we will conduct a series of multi-factor multilevel CFA models for highly related subcomponents. We will determine highly related subcomponents by using the correlations between subcomponents from the first set of CFA models and by assessing the sitelevel correlations between subcomponents. If correlations between two subcomponents are > 0.80, we will conduct a multi-factor multilevel CFA model with both subcomponents included to identify potential overlap between subcomponents and items. For factor models, we will assess models using multiple indices of fit: chi-square (non-significant implies good fit of the model to the data), comparative fit index (CFI, > 0.95 = good fit), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI, > 0.95 = good fit), standardized root mean square residual for both the site and individual levels of the model (SRMR, < 0.05 = good fit), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA, < 0.05 = good fit). To address missing data and the potential for non-normal distributions for items, we will use full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation with robust standard errors. Using the collective information from the descriptive statistics, item correlations, and CFA models, we will identify the most relevant and high performing items for each readiness subcomponent. Given the many subcomponents included in the readiness measure, we aim to include 4-7 items per subcomponent. This number is thought to be ideal to establish a balance between brevity and reliability/validity [65] . Once the items are established for each subcomponent, we will assess the scale reliability for each subcomponent using a multi-level CFA-based approach [66] .",

To address these challenges, we have been communicating with FQHC partners to offer support and help with their ongoing clinic-based efforts, such as aiding in the application for COVID-related grants. In addition, we have adapted research plans to conduct cognitive interviews virtually rather than in-person to protect the safety of participants and research staff. We are also offering flexible solutions to technology and time limitations such as options for virtual or phone interviews, and options to schedule interviews for evenings and weekends (if preferred). We will also work with FQHC partners to administer surveys electronically (as originally planned). When the study transitions to collaborating with school partners, we will monitor challenges in the school setting and use a flexible research approach similar to our approach with FQHCs.",

The approach is informed by a rigorous scale development process [78] and addresses the multilevel nature of the readiness assessment. In addition, the approach is designed to create a measure that has strong psychometric properties and yet can also be adapted to be appropriate across settings and topic areas. Collaborating with FQHC and school partners during this unique time presents added challenges for this work. Our team will document these challenges along with our solutions throughout the study, which can help inform future collaborative efforts.",
