The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a move to remote monitoring of patients via telephone consultations, and a need to reduce hospital visits for patient treatment. It is however, imperative that drug safety is not compromised.",

The median number of hospital visits analysed per patient was 5. An adverse event leading to a medical intervention (concomitant medication commenced or altered, further unplanned imaging booked, referral to a non-oncology specialist) occurred in 24 out of 216 (11.1%) hospital visits. We observed a clinically significant abnormal blood test result in 8/216 (3.7%) visits. In 10/216 (4.6%) visits, durvalumab was either discontinued due to significant toxicity (5/10) or due to disease progression (5/10). On review of the doctors documentation from each clinic visit we assessed that the majority 184/216 (85.2%) of face-to-face consultations could have been safely performed via telephone with signs and symptoms elicited via verbal conversation rather than clinical examination.",

Hypertension (28.6%) and COPD (25.5%) were the most frequently reported comorbidities. PDL-1 and EGFR testing were reported for 67.5% and 44% of participants, respectively. Patients had an initial diagnosis of stage III (43.4% IIIA, 45.3% IIIB, 6.9% IIIC). Adenocarcinoma (56.9%) and squamous (33.4%) were the most common histologies. Cisplatin/vinorelbine and carboplatin/paclitaxel were the most commonly administered chemotherapies prior to durvalumab. The average duration and total dose of radiotherapy was 6.95 weeks and 62.9 Gray. Most (85%) of Pacific R patients received concurrent CRT.
