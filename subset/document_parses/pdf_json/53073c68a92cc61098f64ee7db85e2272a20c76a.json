[1] [2] [3] [4] Yet, the pathological processes in which COVID-19 leads to detrimental psychoneurological effects are still largely unknown and are subject to extensive ongoing research. Pathophysiological mechanisms including immune response, vascular damage, detrimental effects of critical illness and side effects from treatments may play an important role. 5 Psychological problems (thereinafter mental health problems [MHP] ), are at least partly attributable to sociodemographic and environmental factors. Infected individuals may suffer from lifethreatening complications with uncertain survival or recovery, social isolation, and reduced access to social support, all of which can lead to loneliness and MHP. 6, 7 Affected individuals may face compromised access to care due to escalating case numbers and overwhelmed health services. Post-illness, survivors may face ongoing symptoms such as reduced physical functioning, fatigue, social and economic issues such as stigmatization with a refusal of services, and reduced working abilities. 1, 3, 8, 9 Mental health problems may also be aggravated by a history of pre-existing mental health problems. 10 As treatment possibilities improve, there is a shift towards physical and psychological long-term effects in affected individuals. Estimating the magnitude of long-lasting mental and physical problems, including mechanisms and risk factors, is critical to estimate individual, societal and economic costs and to facilitate treatment and rehabilitation planning. 11 Results from original studies and reviews estimating MHP prevalence values can be limited in estimating the burden of disease due to a large heterogeneity in study quality, like assessment methods used. 1, 12 We are not aware of a systematic evidence synthesis including patients and survivors of major infections disease epidemics in the last two decades that include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), swine flu (H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), avian influenza (H7N9), Ebolavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the present meta-analysis, we aimed to estimate the overall MHP prevalence and the prevalence proportion of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and general distress with validated and widely used scales in suspected and laboratoryconfirmed patients and survivors. We used a meta-regression to investigate potential moderating effects on the overall MHP proportions.",

All estimates were separated by severity (mild or moderate-to-severe) (appendix p 5) and by follow-up time. In the case of dependent effect sizes for studies reporting multiple outcomes in the same participants, a three-level mixedeffects model was fitted (taking withing study variation into account). 16 To pool prevalence with 95% CIs, each study's proportion estimate was transformed by the Freeman-Tukey double-arcsine transformation for metaanalysis and back-transformed after model fitting. 17 We used I 2 to determine heterogeneity for analysis in nondependent effect sizes. In dependent effect sizes, the distribution of total variance (%) attributed to between and within-study variance was estimated. 18 Meta-regression was conducted on arcsine transformed proportions due to better statistical properties as compared to untransformed proportions. Restricted maximum likelihood was used for parameter estimation. The threshold for significance was set to p<0\u00b705. Statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.3) using the metafor package. 19 Sensitivity analyses were performed by the investigation of influential effect-sizes using DFBETAS and Cook's distance. 19 To analyze the data, we conducted the following a-priori defined steps. First, we estimated the overall pooled prevalence, including all effect sizes (excluding general distress as a generic measure of general distress) and by MHP domains separately. All estimations were stratified by mild or moderate-to-severe severity and acute, ongoing and post-illness follow-up timepoint. Second, a meta-regression on the overall mild and moderate-tosevere MHP values was conducted including follow-up timepoint, sex, age, education, history of a mental health condition, health-care workers, duration of hospitalization, intensive care treatment, type of treatment, response rate, sampling method, world region, and epidemic type as moderators.

A meta-analysis on early neurological and neuropsychiatric studies (published until July 2020) reported point prevalence values for anxiety of 15.9% and of 23.0% for depression. 1 Our results similarly fall in that range. However, milder mental health conditions are somewhat more prevalent and can have detrimental effects as well.",

While the information on the post-viral health detriments was available from earlier infection outbreaks, it is somewhat astonishing that the risks of longer-term conditions were overlooked in the early days of the pandemic and that it took quite some time to receive the science and media attention it now has. 79 The moderator analysis has also shown effects for the time point and for the sampling method in particular. This suggests that methodological details and study quality are very important for assessing the contribution of single studies. In general, and as reported from earlier epidemiological studies on mental health effects of epidemics, 80 the study quality has to be evaluated as mixed. While about 56% reached a moderate to high study quality about 44 per cent showed a poor quality. Studies frequently suffered from non-transparency regarding sampling frame, recruitment, sample size and provided only a poor description of the study sample and setting and showed low response rates. Furthermore, at least one third showed an unclear or insufficient coverage of the identified sample. In contrast, studies predominantly assessed MHP in a standardized way and clearly described how prevalence was calculated.",

This selection bias potentially led to an underestimation/overestimation of the prevalence values. Further, many original studies were generally of poor or moderate quality with incomplete data or a lack of random or complete sampling. This might be due to the urgent need for conducting such studies in a pandemic situation. Secondly, this meta-analysis methodology was limited by the fact that further wellvalidated instruments (e.g., State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were not included in this research. The metaregression should be interpreted cautiously since many studies did not provide data on all moderators. Furthermore, it was not possible to include all hypothetical moderators. Specifically, the physical disease severity and the burden of late physical effects were not covered as this was often not reported within studies.",
