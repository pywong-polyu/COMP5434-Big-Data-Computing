Patients and Methods: The scale items were selected using a literature review on the chain of infection and its content validity. There were 297 study participants, all of whom provided informed consent. Data were collected online from September 3 to September 8, 2020, using Google Survey in Korea. The scale's construct validity was verified through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, criterion validity was Pearson's Correlation, and reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha. Results: Twelve items and three factors were selected after a factor and an exploratory factor analysis of 29 scale items. The three factors were pathogen blocking, transmission blocking, and immunity enhancement. A confirmatory factor analysis validated the model goodness of fit, and the convergent validity and discriminant validity of the scale were verified. The correlation coefficient with a scale for respiratory infection prevention practice was 0.69, thereby confirming the criterion validity of the scale. The reliability of the final scale (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.86. Conclusion: This scale is reflective of the social features of the Korean adult population, and it is easy and concise to be administered to general public, making it useful for subsequent studies on infection prevention.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. COVID -19 has not been the first advent of an epidemic since the 2000s, as it has been preceded by severe acute respiratory syndrome, novel influenza, Ebola, and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This indicates that the rate at which novel viruses are occurring is increasing and that these viruses are also demonstrating an increased ability to cause a global pandemic, as in the case of the plague and cholera. 1 What is most fearful about novel infections is that the infection is transmitted amid a lack of accurate information about the transmission route, prognosis, and treatment. In particular, numerous researches have been conducted and more research efforts are underway to develop therapeutic agents or vaccines for COVID-19; however, the effectiveness of these new developments remains unclear. 2 Thus, the best infection prevention measure as of now is to manage infected individuals based on prompt diagnosis and then quarantine them. 3, 4 Historically, the advent of a novel infection has triggered the development of a new culture and healthcare policies, 5 and the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of contactless conditions, leading to an array of changes, including restrictions on human and material exchanges among countries and individuals. 6 Currently, numerous researches are underway in all study disciplines, including healthcare, education, economics, tourism, and architecture, to explore the roles and measures of that respective discipline in the post-COVID-19 era, that is, to adapt to the new normal. [6] [7] [8] Especially the field of public health calls for keen responses to the changes brought upon by Meanwhile, while individuals with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension, and immunocompromised individuals may experience severe respiratory diseases or even die from the COVID-19 infection, other individuals may remain asymptomatic. 9, 10 Asymptomatic carriers are also a source of infection transmission; hence, preventing interpersonal transmission is highly crucial. 11 Under such conditions, in addition to its roles in the clinical setting, the field of public health is one of the disciplines responsible for researching about novel infections and educating individuals to help them achieve optimal health by preventing the contraction of such infections in their daily lives. However, while research to promote infection prevention behaviors in daily life requires an instrument to measure these behaviors, the currently available tools for measuring infection prevention behaviors focus only on people in specific occupations, such as healthcare professionals or teachers, 12, 13 individuals on anticancer therapy, or those at high risk for a particular disease, such as sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis. [14] [15] [16] While the MERS Prevention Behavior Scale was developed following the 2015 MERS outbreak, 17 a general tool for measuring infection prevention behaviors is needed, as opposed to a tool for a specific pathogen, in order to allow individuals to block the infection in their daily lives and prevent various infections in the future.",

Prevention of infection is possible by blocking one of the links in this chain of infection. Severing a link in this chain of infection is referred to as \"medical asepsis.\" Although this is primarily performed by healthcare providers and staff in hospitals, this technique is critical in daily life as well in order to prevent potential infections in the future. 18 With the availability of several guidelines for COVID-19 in South Korea and abroad, people's awareness and compliance with infection prevention behaviors are probably at highest level in current times; however, an actual analysis of the same is hindered by the lack of instruments to measure these behaviors. Thus, this study aimed to develop a tool for measuring adults' routine infection prevention behaviors in the context of Korean society. The results of this study are expected to serve as foundational data for understanding and assessing the level of infection prevention behaviors of individuals in Korea.",

Two researchers reviewed the links of the chain of infection and the contents of the items and identified items that could fall under more than one link. For example, \"wearing a face mask\" can break the portal of entry and portal of exit links, and \"washing hands\" can break the pathogen and reservoir links.

When suitable, principal component analysis was performed using varimax rotation with the number of factors set to three. 27 The items and number of factors were determined based on cutoffs of 0.40 or higher for communality, 0.40 or higher for factor loading, and 60% or higher for cumulative variance.

In addition, students also showed the lowest infection prevention behavior score compared to those in other occupations. This may be contextually in line with the findings of a previous study, 38 which indicated that young adults in their 20s show lower compliance with health management behaviors compared to those in other age groups because of their belief that they will be healthier; thus, continued research to develop measures to promote infection prevention behaviors among young adults is warranted.",

However, research data on this matter remains thin; therefore, further studies are needed to identify various factors that promote infection prevention behaviors with reference to our findings.",

Second, although this study is to develop a general infection prevention behavior measurement tool. But caution should be exercised when using the results of this study, because the awareness level of infection prevention due to the COVID-19 was high at the time this study was conducted. Third, while predictive validity of the respiratory infection prevention behavior was confirmed in this study, the predictive validity according to the propagation route of droplets and contact was not confirmed. Additional research is therefore needed on this topic. ",
