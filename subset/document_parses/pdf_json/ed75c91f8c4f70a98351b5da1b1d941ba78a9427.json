The primary study relates to the German version of the Acute Cystitis Symptom Score (ACSS), a self-reporting questionnaire for self-diagnosis and monitoring the symptomatic course of AC in women. The current study aimed to analyze the validity and reliability of the German ACSS in German-speaking female patients with AC in Switzerland. Methods Anonymized patient data were collected and analyzed from women with AC at the first visit (diagnosis) and follow-up visits as baseline and controls, respectively. Data from 97 patients with a median age of 41 years underwent analysis. Psychometric and diagnostic characteristics of the ACSS were measured and statistically analyzed. Results Average internal consistency of the ACSS resulted in a Cronbach's alpha (95% CI) of 0.86 (0.83; 0.89) and did not differ significantly between the Swiss and German cohorts. Diagnostic values of the ACSS for the Swiss cohort were relatively lower than for the German cohort, possible due to discrepancies between definitions of UTI in national guidelines.",

At the first admission to the physician's office (baseline visit) patients were requested to fill in the registry form with questions on demographic characteristics, history of previous symptomatic episodes of lower urinary tract infections (LUTI), medications and hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months, if any. The presence and severity of symptoms of AC and relevant signs and symptoms were assessed by patients using the first, diagnostic (part-A) form of the German ACSS [15] . The additional information about the overall health-related quality of life was collected, using the validated German three-level version of the EuroQoL-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-3L) Health Questionnaire [18, 19] . The risk factors of patients to develop more severe outcomes were classified by the physician according to the ORENUC system [20] . The lower urinary tract infection recurrence risk nomogram (LUTIRE) by Cai et al. was used to assess the risk of recurrence of symptomatic UTI and to support additional demographic data from patients [21] . Urine samples were taken from patients for dipstick analysis, and urine culture was performed when appropriate.",

Today, AC is considered a benign infection without significant risk of worsening of UTI or serious complications [7] . Since, according to EAU Guidelines urine analyses may lead only to a minimal increase in diagnostic accuracy in patients presenting with typical symptoms of AC, the clinical diagnosis can be made even without a point-of-care urinalysis [7] . The ACSS is a two-part self-reporting questionnaire, which has demonstrated excellent levels of reliability, validity, diagnostic and discriminative abilities in numerous studies [13, 14, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . It contains ten items on \"subjective\" and one item on \"objective\" signs and symptoms. These items are categorized into specific domains, such as \"Typical\" (urination frequency, urination urgency, painful urination/dysuria, sense of incomplete bladder emptying, suprapubic pain and visible blood in urine), \"Differential\" (flank pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, discharge from the urethra, feeling fever/high body temperature and measured hyperthermia) and \"Quality of Life\" (general discomfort, impact on everyday activity and impact on social life). It includes the \"Additional\" domain containing five questions with dichotomized (\"yes/no\") answers on the presence of additional conditions which may affect therapy (menstruations, premenstrual syndrome, signs of menopause, Fig. 1 A-D Coefficients of split-half reliability for summary scores of the ACSS domains for Swiss and German cohorts of the study and the reference \"International\" cohort pregnancy and known sugar diabetes). Furthermore, in addition to the four domains mentioned above, the \"follow-up\" part B of the ACSS includes the \"Dynamics\" domain to assess the overall clinical outcome reported by the patient. Initially developed in the Uzbek language, the ACSS has been translated and validated in several languages and used as a primary tool for assessment in different countries in different languages [12-14, 39, 43, 47, 48, 50] .",

Strong relationships between the physician's independent assessment of the changes in the patient's condition using the leveled values of \"clinical scenario\" and the differences in summary scores of the \"Typical\" and \"QoL\" domains of the ACSS between the baseline and follow-up visits showed the high responsiveness of these summary scores to changes. The consistency of the scores of the \"Dynamics\" domain with the physician's independent assessment of the changes in the patient's condition, vouches for the validity of the \"Dynamics\" domain. These results testify to the desirability of using the ACSS in continuous monitoring of the progress in the patient's well-being during the symptomatic course of AC, which suggests the feasibility of using the ACSS not only as a diagnostic tool but also as a valuable patient-reported outcome measure (PROM).",

Therefore, the recruitment of the patients in the German cohort was primarily based on the cut-off point of the ACSS questionnaire, whereas the patients of the Swiss cohort were probably recruited according to the definition of AC in the Guidelines of the Swiss Society for Infectious Diseases, which implies the presence of symptoms AND pyuria [10] . Second, although homogeneous in the main demographic characteristics, patients of the two cohorts may have differed in clinical variables, such as the results of urine tests and summary scores of the ACSS domains (Table 1) . These parameters could serve as co-factors and lead to selection biases during recruitment between the study cohorts, as observed and reported earlier [50] . Such dissimilarity of recommendations may affect the study results and clinical practice [44, 46] .",

Median (IQR) difference in summary scores between baseline and follow-up visits of the patients in the Swiss cohort was 6.0 (2.5-8.5) for the \"Typical\" domain, 0.0 (0.0-1.0) for the \"Differential\" domain, 2.5 (0.0-4.0) for the \"QoL\" domain and 9.0 (4.0-14.0) for the entire ACSS score.
