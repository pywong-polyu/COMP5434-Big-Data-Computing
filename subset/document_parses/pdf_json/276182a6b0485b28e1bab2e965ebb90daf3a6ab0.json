The NICD and the National Institute for Occupational Health (NIOH) are divisions within the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) which, since the COVID-19 threat in January 2020 prior to our first case of a returning traveller from Italy on 5 March 2020, has been involved in the testing, public health, and occupational health planning and response.",

However, ongoing research advantageous to South Africa is exemplified by the reuse of respirators now being explored due to critical shortages during emergencies, although handwashing and social distancing remain the mainstay.",
