The virus has a cysteine protease called main protease (Mpro) which is significant to it life cycle, tagged as a suitable target for novel antivirals. In this computerassisted study, we designed 100 novel molecules through an artificial neural network-driven platform called LigDream (https:// playm olecu le. org/ LigDr eam/) using 3-O-(6-galloylglucoside) as parent molecule for design. Druglikeness screening of the molecules through five (5) different rules was carried out, followed by a virtual screening of those molecules without a single violation of the druglike rules using AutoDock Vina against Mpro. The in silico pharmacokinetic features were predicted and finally, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) study was carried out using Molecular Orbital Package 2016 (MOPAC2016) on the overall hit compound with controls to determine the stability and reactivity of the lead molecule. The findings showed that eight (8) novel molecules violated none of the druglikeness rules of which three (3) novel molecules (C33, C35 and C54) showed the utmost binding affinity of \u22128.3 kcal/mol against Mpro; C33 showed a good in silico pharmacokinetic features with acceptable level of stability and reactively better than our controls based on the quantum chemical descriptors analysis. However, there is an urgent need to carry out more research on these novel molecules for the fight against the disease.",

The ongoing pandemic has resulted in more than 168 million confirmed cases with 3.5 million deaths (as at 28th May, 2021) across 218 countries (Sakurai et al. 2021 ). The culprit virus that is devastating our world is the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV 2), with a spherical shape, single-stranded, and positively sensed RNA virus. The virus has a genome length of approximately 30,000 base pairs consisting of about eleven open reading frames (ORFs) that encodes numerous proteins (structural and non-structural) that are of importance to the viral life cycle (Anjorin 2020; Alazmi and Motwalli 2020; Yoshimoto 2020) . Once SARS-CoV 2 gains entry into the host cell, the viral RNA is liberated into the cytoplasm which results in the expression of replicase gene. The replicase gene accommodates two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a/1b which covers two-third of the viral genome. The ORFs undergo expression to yield polyprotein 1a and 1ab. These polyproteins are biochemically sliced by two cysteine-rich proteinases known as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease or main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) emancipating 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to 16).",

The cleft between domains I and II features a noncanonical Cys-His dyad that recognizes amino acids in substrates from the N terminus to C terminus (Dai et al. 2020; Jin et al. 2020) . In it active form, is homodimeric with two protomers (A and B) (Jin et al. 2020 ). There are no homologs of Mpro present in humans, making it an ideal target for antiviral drug design. Additionally, the role it plays in the replication and proliferation of SARS-CoV 2 cannot be silenced. The process of discovering and developing drugs is time-consuming and cost-effective, thus the need for the use of computer-aided therapeutic discovery (CATD) which embraces structurebased, system-based and ligand-based therapeutic design (Dai et al. 2020; Romano and Tatonetti 2019; Prieto-mart\u0131 et al. 2019; Umar et al. 2021a) . Today, the key roles played by computational methods in therapeutic design, discovery and development expedition cannot be overemphasized because of its numerous dimensional usage for assemblage of data, processing it before evaluation and interpretation (Dai et al. 2020; Romano and Tatonetti 2019; Prieto-mart\u0131 et al. 2019; Umar et al. 2021a) .",

In this current study, we designed 100 novel molecules through an artificial neural network-driven platform called LigDream (https:// playm olecu le. org/ LigDr eam/) (Skalic et al. 2019 ) using 3-O-(6-galloylglucoside) as parent molecule for design. These new compounds were subjected to inflexible druglikeness screening to select those that could serve as oral drugs. Then a virtual screening was implemented to get the best hit compounds against Mpro. The hit compounds were examined for their pharmacokinetic properties in silico. Finally, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics study was carried out on the overall hit compound with controls to determine the stability and reactivity of the lead molecule.",

These new compounds show new scaffolds and functional groups which covers new site of chemical space that upholds lead-like characteristics (Supplementary Figure S1 ). The outcome of the inflexible druglikeness screening indicated that eight (8) new molecules scaled through without violating any of Lipinski's, Ghose's, Veber's, Egan's and Muegge's rules; also showing an Abbot bioavailability score of 0.55 (Table 1 ). Druglikeness is defined as a qualitative valuation that offer the chance for a compound to be an oral drug with reverence to bioavailability (Daina et al. 2017 ). In the early stage of drug discovery voyage, these valuations are routinely deployed to filter chemical libraries [in our case our chemical library is made of 100 novel molecules from 3-O-(6-galloylglucoside)] to expunge those molecules with properties that are discordant with an acceptable pharmacokinetics profile. This is an indication that the 8 novel molecules can serve as orally active drug.",

Of note is the ability of our compounds to be able to interact with His41 and Cys145 either by hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interaction.

In line with this, it is pertinent to assess molecules early on in the drug development stage for their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) parameters as this effort will considerably reduce attrition. In our current in silico work, we assessed the ADMET-linked parameters of three best hit molecules (C33, C35 and C54), 3-O-(6-galloylglucoside) and remdesivir computationally using the ADMETSAR server. Our findings are presented in Table 3 . The new compounds showed a good ADMET properties than our seed molecule (3O6G) and remdesivir especially C33. This feat could be linked to the earlier outcome from the inflexible druglikeness screening. Commendably, C33 shows none inhibition to some key liver enzymes (Cytochrome P450 isoforms), human-ether-a-go-go gene (i.e. might not cause prolonged QT interval), and P-glycoprotein transporter, in addition to non-carcinogenic and non-mutagenic aptitudes as predicted.

We were able to generate the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( E HOMO) and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( E LUMO), which describes the charge distribution of frontier molecular orbitals of our compounds ( Fig. 3A-C) . From this, the blue color portrays the negative periods, while the red color indicates the positive periods. Thus, we observe that the HOMO and LUMO are frequently located on the aromatic ring, sugar moiety (remdesivir), the amino-, floro-, carbonyl-, phospho-and methylene groups. Similarly, the values of HOMO (the capacity of a molecule to give electrons to an acceptor species is favored by high values) and LUMO (the ability of a molecule to take electrons is preferred by the low values) can determine the stability and reactivity of our compounds (Benbouguerra et al. 2021; Mubarik et al. 2021) . C33 was seen to be able to donate electrons (HOMO = \u22128.898 eV) and also could take electrons (LUMO = \u22121.636 eV). The energy gap (\u0394G) showed that the lead compound is reactive (\u22127.262 eV) than the seed molecule and control drug (Table 4 ) and moderately stable. This indicates that there is charge transfer between the atoms of C33. Other parameters termed the global reactivity descriptors such as chemical potential, electrophilicity index, and chemical hardness that is required to analyze the reactivity of the inhibitor molecules were also elucidated. In addition, descriptors such as ionization potential and electron affinity were also determined ( Table 4 ). The vertical ionization potentials Is and electron affinities as were obtained from the HOMO-LUMO values, which was used to define the global electrophilicity value \u03c9 (Table 4) . It is a measure of the energy stabilization of the system (Siddiqui et al. 2012) . Chemical hardness quantifies the resistance to change in the electron distribution in a collection of nuclei and electrons (Siddiqui et al. 2012; Kalaiarasi and Manivarman 2017) . The calculated values of the chemical potential, chemical hardness and global electrophilicity of C33 are \u2212 5.267 eV, 3.631 eV and 3.820 eV, respectively. The small value of \u03b7 for C33 indicates that it is relatively soft on the scale of hardness. By designation, the electrophilicity index is a degree of the susceptibility of chemical species to accept electrons (Siddiqui et al. 2012; Kalaiarasi and Manivarman 2017) .",

This evaluation will locate the site of chemical reactivity of our molecules which is represented by the 3D maps at optimized geometry in Fig. 3D -F. The electrostatic potential difference is indicated by color gradients that is valuable in investigating the link between molecular structure and physicochemical property correlation of molecules, biomolecules and drugs inclusive. Based on the color gradients, the positive potentials corresponding to the nucleophilic reaction sites are depicted in blue color, while the negative potentials regions relate to the electrophilic reaction sites illustrated in yellow and red colors. However, the areas of zero potential are presented in green color (Fig. 3D-F) . The variance that occurs in the electrostatic potential generated by our molecule is widely responsible for the binding of our molecule to Mpro binding domain, since the binding region cumulatively is expected to have opposing region of electrostatic potential. MEP of C33 clearly indicates the major negative potential sites cover the fluorine atoms of the phenyl and benzyl rings, and oxygen atoms of the morpholine ring, oxoacetamide chain and carboxylic group that were featured in yellow to red color, as they are the binding region for electrophilic attack. The hydrogen atoms of the amino and carboxylic groups bear the maximum level of positive potential while the rest of the compound seems to possess an almost neutral electrostatic potential (Fig. 4) . The IUPAC name of the lead molecule in our current computational study was generated using ChemSketch and MarvinSketch software and the query from both software returned similar name for the molecule which is 2-({[(2S)-2-(2-amino-3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)morpholin-4-yl](oxo) acetyl}amino)-4,5-difluorobenzoic acid (See supplementary information).",

Also, C33, C35 and C54 out of these molecules displayed good binding affinity of \u22128.3 kcal/mol against Mpro. The ADMET profiling indicates that C33 was better than C35 and C54. Finally, the quantum chemical reactivity descriptors analysis showed that C33 was moderately stable and more reactive than the controls. However, there is an urgent need to carry out Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) of at least 100 ns, synthesis of the lead Funding This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
