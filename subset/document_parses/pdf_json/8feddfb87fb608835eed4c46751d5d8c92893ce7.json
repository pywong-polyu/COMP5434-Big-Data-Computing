A working hypothesis is that juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a type 1 interferon-driven inflammatory response, triggered by one or more environmental stimuli, such as infection. In order to test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 could promote JDM, we studied SARS-CoV-2 infection history in the 10 JDM patients with disease onset (n = 6) or relapse (n = 4) seen in our center since the start of the pandemic. IgG and IgM directed against 5 different portions of the virus were measured in patients plasma at the time of diagnosis: whole spike protein, spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike S2 subunit, nucleocapsid protein (NP), and a membrane-envelope fusion glycoprotein (ME) [3] . Out of the 10 patients, we identified high titers of both IgG (Fig. 1a) and IgM (Fig. 1b) antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 proteins in one new onset (P1) and one relapsing patient (P2) (Fig. 1a) indicating a recent history of infection by SARS-CoV-2.",

Cutaneous lesions consisted of erythema and Gottron's papule at the joint extensor, erythema and painful hyperkeratosis papules palmar and plantar, heliotrope eyelids, erythema and edema of the ears, shawl sign with flagellate erythema. Treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate led to a complete remission of 8 years including 6-year off therapy. Two weeks after being in contact with a COVID-19-positive family member, she experienced a purely skin relapse of the disease. Cutaneous involvement was similar to the lesions observed at initial diagnosis of JDM. No muscle involvement was noted and MSA remained absent. IFN\u03b12 concentration was markedly elevated at diagnosis (4612 fg/mL) (Fig. 1c) . The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S2, and whole spike protein IgM in the plasma 2 weeks after onset of the symptoms, along with limited IgG, followed by increased levels of IgG and decrease of most IgM at week 6, suggests that the infection occurred at the same time as the JDM relapse (Fig. 1d) . Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins and corticosteroids led to skin lesions remission and progressive decrease of IFN\u03b12 concentration: 1466 fg/mL 10 weeks after the relapse.",

            "text": "Altogether, out of the 10 patients with onset or relapse of JDM features seen in our center between April 2020 and March 2021, we identified 2 (20%) with a concomitant history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients had features consistent with typical JDM, according to the ENMC 2018 dermatomyositis classification criteria [5] . Considering that skin manifestations were completely similar at relapse and at diagnosis in P2, we think that the cutaneous involvement is mostly related to JDM rather than to SARS-CoV2 per se. Importantly, no other documented environmental stimulus temporally associated with the manifestations of JDM has been documented in these patients. A few cases of COVID-19-related myositis have been previously reported and may be attributable to direct myocyte injury or to induction of autoimmunity [1, 2] . Although the precise role of IFN\u03b1 in the pathophysiology of JDM still needs to be deciphered, it is interesting to note that P1and P2 had very high levels of circulating IFN\u03b12 compared to the median value (491 fg/ mL) in 33 patients with active JDM followed in our clinical center (150-and 9-fold increase, respectively) (Fig. 1c) . Altogether, these data strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection could trigger the development of JDM, possibly through induction of IFN\u03b1. Moreover, given that both patients were asymptomatic for COVID-19 symptoms, our observation also suggests that viral induction of JDM might be more frequent than expected as it could occur in patients without any manifestation of viral infection. Systemic evaluation of recent SARS-CoV-2, and other virus infection in newly diagnosed or relapsing patients, would help to estimate the extent of this observation. ",
