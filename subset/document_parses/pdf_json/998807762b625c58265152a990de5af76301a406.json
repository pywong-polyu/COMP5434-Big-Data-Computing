Most plants used to prepare medicinal soup are wild-harvested (56 species), 4 cultivated, and 23 wild harvested or cultivated. According to the comparison, 18 Hakka medicinal soup species are shown both in Fujian Province and Guangdong Province. The Hakka soup-making plants in both provinces share very similar therapeutic functions. This study helps to extend the Hakka menu in both provinces.

The medicinal food plants have thus become a new trend for the food system, which is usually used by indigenous communities for daily health promotion [6] . Since ancient times, China has traditionally used food for health care [7] . For instance, when having a Chinese hotpot (\"Huo Guo\"), people always like to add different traditional Chinese medicines into the pot for health care purposes [8] . Typically, some people process the medicinal plants into a beverage like tea or medicinal soup, which is very common in the south of China. For example, in the Guangdong Province of China, the culture of cooling herbal tea is extremely popular locally; in the Chaoshan area of Guangdong Province, a study case by Li et al. has reported that more than 186 plant taxa can be used to make herbal tea [9] .",

The Hakka means \"guest families\". Hakka people are widely considered to be a subgroup of the Han Chinese, originally migrated from northern China in 300 A.D. to avoid war and natural disasters [10, 11] . According to the statistics, more than 45 million Hakka people live in China [12] . The soup made by medicinal food plants is the most typical dish for Hakka people, consumed during every meal in Hakka households. The Hakka people commonly used meats like pork, chicken, duck, young pigeon, and fish as soup ingredients. The soup is prepared as follows: one kind of meat, along with a single medicinal herb or a combination, is placed in a clay pot, marmite, or stewing pot, covered with water. The contents are brought to a boil and then simmered for 1-3 h to produce the medicinal soup. The soup is often consumed within households but is also supplied to restaurants as a typical Hakka cuisine. With the spread of Hakka restaurants, Hakka medicinal soup is becoming increasingly popular in non-Hakka areas. Combining meat with medicinal herbs is thought to improve the taste. The addition of the meat removes the bitterness of the herbs and adds a delicious flavor to the soup. Furthermore, according to the locals, experience has shown that adding meat to the medicinal soup reduces the likelihood of adverse drug reactions. There have only been a few studies on Hakka medicinal soup until now.",

Guangdong Province is one of the main habitats of Hakka people in China, with the biggest Hakka population compared to other provinces in China. According to the field trip, we also found that local Hakkas drink medicinal soup every day. Thus, we hypothesized that (1) In order to verify our hypothesis, an ethnobotanical study was carried out in the Guangdong Hakka area during 2019-2020, aiming to (1) investigate and record the traditional knowledge about medicinal soup in the Guangdong Hakka area; (2) analyze the inventory of the medicinal soup-making plants in Guangdong Hakka area and compared to the study result in the Fujian Hakka area.

All taxa recorded belong to 70 genera within 38 families (Table1). Five species were pteridophytes, and the rest were spermatophytes. Leguminosae was the most represented family (13 species), followed by Compositae (7 species) and Rubiaceae (6 species) (Fig. 2) . The taxonomic distribution fully indicated the diversity of Hakka soup-making plants in Guangdong Province. The majority of the documented soup-making plants are herbaceous species (40 species, Fig. 3 . Roots (26 species, 31.3%) were the most frequently used plant part for medicinal purposes, followed, in descending order, by the whole plant (25 species, 30.1%), rhizomes (5 species, 6.0%), and flowers (4 species, 4.8%). The vast majority of the plants are dried (76 species) because it is easier to restore in a long period in such a humid and warm environment; more importantly, dry plants can somehow reduce the strong original flavor and make the locals easier to accept. For example, the Houttuynia cordata is one of the most popular food in the Southwest of China, where the locals usually eat its root freshly, whose flavor is too strong for a lot of outsiders [18] . However, the dry Houttuynia cordata, consumed by Hakka, has a much less strong flavor, not covering other ingredients' taste.",

The functions of the herbs used in the medicinal soup are shown in Fig. 4 (category/frequency > 10). Most of these are used for disease prevention or treatment of ailments. The most common uses recorded in this study, in descending order, were: clearing heat (43 species), dispelling dampness (31 species), relieving toxicity (24 species), and dispelling the wind (19 species). These medicinal functions are closely related to the local natural environment and local Hakka livelihood. The Hakka medical system is closely similar to the traditional Chinese medicine system because historically, as a branch of Han people, Hakka people migrated from the main habitat of Han people at that time. The \"heat\" does not just mean the \"high fever\" or \"high body temperature\", and it is more like an unbalanced of the inner energy. Additionally, the \"toxicity\" we mentioned here is not just from animals like poisonous insects or snakes; it is the unbalance or unhealthy substance accumulation caused by unusual factors like extreme weather, miasma, etc. Local areas are in mountainous topography associated with the very heavy miasma and humid subtropical climate [13, 14] . Thus, the medicinal soup for clearing inner heat and detoxication is popular locally. Local livelihoods are mostly practicing agriculture, which is heavy physical labor. In such a humid mountainous area, rheumatism is frequently happened, which is related to the \"dampness\" and \"wind\" mentioned above. Thus, clearing dampness and clearing wind are also popular locally.",

The differences could be due to the mountainous topography that cut off the communication between both areas in history. The vernacular names for soup-making plants also show many differences between the two studies. The dialects in two close counties developed some differences even though mostly similar because the traffic is difficult locally in the history. On the other hand, the amount of Guangdong Hakka soup-making plants is much more than in Fujian Province, which could be due to the impact of other medicinal soup cultures in Guangdong Province.

Additionally, the CSCS aims for a different medicinal purpose, like around 30 species are used for tonifying Qi or tonifying Yan, by following the classic traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory. Also, CSCS uses more commercialized plant ingredients or the ones common in TCM like ginseng, Amomum villosum, Eucommia ulmoides, etc. The areas that consume slowcooked soup in Guangdong are more developed, while the Hakka communities are in mountain areas with less developed economies and transportation.

            "text": "According to our findings, some medicinal species are under threat as a result of modernization and industrialization processes, leading to habitat destruction and excessive exploitation. For example, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists Pholidota chinensis as near threatened (NT), Gastrodia elata as vulnerable (VU), and Dendrobium officinale as critically endangered (CR). In the China Species Red List, Callerya speciosa (Champion ex Bentham) Schot and Kadsura coccinea are listed as VU; Alsophila spinulosa is listed as NT, and Anoectochilus roxburghii is listed as endangered (EN) [22] According to the research, raw soup-making plants are sold in local wet markets, herbal stores, supermarkets, and e-stores online, with little or no packaging. Both local people and tourists like to consume herbs for preparing medicinal soup. With the development of e-commerce and the spread of Hakka restaurants all over China, soup-making herbs are consequently in demand in areas outside of Hakka communities. Given the continuously increasing demands for soup-making plants, more and more plant species have been cultivated locally. Cultivation of medicinal plants conserves plant resources and makes their collection convenient and accurate [23] . Examples include Ficus hirta, Gardenia jasminoides, and Rabdosia lophanthoides, cultivated in good agricultural practice (GAP) farms in Yuancheng District, Fengshun County, and Pingyuan County, respectively. Other commonly used herbs previously harvested from the wild, such as Anoectochilus roxburghii, Smilax glabra and Uraria crinita are now being cultivated according to the field investigation. However, the threatened status of wild herbs does not give rise to optimism because the domestication of herbs through farming is not always technically possible. We found that Alsophila spinulosa, a tree fern with a long-life cycle, is under serious threat and very difficult to cultivate during our survey. Cultivated plants are also sometimes considered qualitatively inferior compared to wild ones locally. For instance, wild, dried Anoectochilus roxburghii plants (9,000-28,000 \u00a5/ kg) are considerably more expensive than the cultivated variety (1,250-6,000 \u00a5/kg). Consequently, they are overexploited and threatened. The over-exploited phenomenon of Anoectochilus roxburghii is also mentioned in the Hakka area in West Fujian Province. The local supervision department should pay attention to the trading and the protection of those endangered wild plants. ",

Although some remote areas have not been attacked directly, they were still facing a series of food and medicine shortages because of the breaking down of the normal productions and commerce logistics. However, some self-adjustments have been observed in indigenous communities. The famous ethnobiologist Andrea Pieroni once mentioned: in many cultures, self-made plant-sourced food or beverage has played a very important role in local communities to treat some ailments, contagions, or chronic diseases [24] . In 2020, Pieroni et al. had studied the reactions to the COVID-19 in 17 indigenous communities, and some of the local families seemed to start using some herbal medicine or functional food for treating a respiratory disease or flu [3] . In some cases, the local community increased the consumption of onion, garlic, lemon, and turmeric because the local people believe this plant-sourced food can help resist the virus and boost immunity [3] . However, this is not an isolated phenomenon. In this area, we also observed that some families increased the consumption of Houttuynia cordata, which was believed to be a promising anti-virus medicinal plant locally. In our another study in 2020 (unpublished), many peasant workers had to stay at home because the COVID-19 stopped the operation of factories in cities. Thus, they must go to the wild collecting edible and medicinal plants to maintain their daily consumption.The phenomenon we observed and mentioned by Pieroni is worth thinking about, which indicated that, in front of natural disasters like big pandemics, some remote communities have their own defensive response. This self-response needs to base on rich biodiversity and traditional knowledge about wild resources utilization. The benefits of this response are not just from the medicinal or edible value of the wild resources but also can help boost people emotionally and psychologically [3] . The pandemic fully addresses the importance of traditional knowledge of plant use and wild resources management.",

As it is becoming increasingly popular, both in Hakka and non-Hakka areas, more studies are needed on the efficacy and safety of this medicinal soup, and more attention should be paid to the conservation and cultivation of the plants used. Community-based responses during the pandemics like COVID-19 are also worth studying, bringing more benefits to the locals and providing references for policy-making. ",
