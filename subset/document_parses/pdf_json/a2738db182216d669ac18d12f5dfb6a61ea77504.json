Materials & methods: LeDock software was adopted to determine the binding energy between candidate molecules and selected protein pockets. Enrichment analyses were applied to illustrate potential pharmacology networks of active molecules. Results: The citrus flavonoid rutin was identified to fit snugly into the Mpro substrate-binding pocket and to present a strong interaction with TLRs TLR2, TLR6 and TLR7. One-carbon metabolic process and nitrogen metabolism ranked high as potential targets toward rutin. Conclusion: Rutin may influence viral functional protein assembly and host inflammatory suppression. Its affinity for Mpro and TLRs render rutin a potential novel therapeutic anti-coronavirus strategy.",

Inhibitor N3 was used as a ligand while analyzing the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [10] . LeDock software was used to calculate the binding energy between ligands and targeted proteins because LeDock software presents significant reliability and accuracy compared with other docking software [11] . First, the input protein structure was provided with an added hydrogen for the sake of being charged electrically. Then, compound structures were input as ligands. Subsequently, the site of the grid box was identified according to the coordinates of the positive ligands in the target protein complex [10] . After the active pocket was well placed, LeDock calculations were performed for molecular docking. For each chemical structure, several docking poses were recommended through LeDock in addition to generate the binding energy. The optimum docking poses of each structure were applied for ranking, and the visualization of docking was performed with PyMOL 1.8 v4.4.0 (www.pymol.org) and LigPlot + v.2.2 (www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/sof tware/LigPlus/) software, respectively.",

Cytokine signaling is highly associated with the activation of TLRs [21] . A series of studies reveal that blocking TLR signaling also prevents cytokine storms, indicating a potential therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation.

This process would be direct and simple and available in biosafety level 1 laboratories. Furthermore, biochemical and cell-based assays must be applied to evaluate the solubility, toxicity and pharmacodynamic properties of rutin toward SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. If the EC 50 /IC 50 are high at indicated dosages, the antiviral activity of rutin or other potential inhibitors would be further studied in vivo, especially in animal models that express human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), the putative cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [31] . To clarify the anti-inflammation mechanism of rutin toward SARS-CoV-2, knockout mice with deficiencies in T cells, B cells and/or natural killer (NK) cells could also be utilized [3] . To date, however, evaluation of anti-CoV activity is only available in biosafety level 3 laboratories, where experiments are highly technically demanding.",
