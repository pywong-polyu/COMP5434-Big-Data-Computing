Examination of illicit drug use networks has potential to assess the risk of TB exposure and disease progression. Research also is needed to assess mechanisms for accelerated TB transmission in this population. This study aims to 1) assess the rate of TB exposure, risk of disease progression, and disease burden among PWUD; 2) estimate the proportion of active TB cases resulting from recent transmission within this network; and 3) evaluate whether PWUD with TB disease have physiologic characteristics associated with more efficient TB transmission. Our cross-sectional, observational study aims to assess TB transmission through illicit drug use networks, focusing on methamphetamine and Mandrax (methaqualone) use, in a high TB burden setting and identify mechanisms underlying accelerated transmission. We will recruit and enroll 750 PWUD (living with and without HIV) through respondent driven sampling in Worcester, South Africa. Drug use will be measured through self-report and biological measures, with sputum specimens collected to identify TB disease by Xpert Ultra (Cepheid) and mycobacterial culture. We will co-enroll those with microbiologic evidence of TB disease in Aim 2 for molecular and social network study. Whole genome sequencing of Mycobacteria tuberculosis (Mtb) specimens and social",

An effective method to reduce TB incidence and mortality is to interrupt transmission, which requires finding and treating individuals with subclinical and clinical TB disease early. Molecular epidemiologic studies and mathematical models have shown that household contact tracing, our primary approach to case finding, identifies less than 19% of transmissions in high TB and TB/HIV burden settings [2] . There is a clear need to identify additional risk groups and settings where TB transmission occurs. New approaches have focused on congregate settings, such as prisons and healthcare facilities, to identify additional TB transmission [3] . A major source of transmission also may exist in venues where individuals smoke illicit drugs, making these social networks potential amplifiers for the broader population epidemic and a group to target for transmission interventions.",

In the past 20 years, TB incidence has decreased in most high-income countries with TB disease burden concentrated in at-risk subpopulations, including PWUD [12] .

Nationally, an estimated 13.3% of the adult population meet criteria for a lifetime substance use disorder (SUD), with rates as high as 20.6% for the Western Cape Province [14] . Community-based data related to illicit drug use in South Africa are limited but suggest a growing problem. A 2012 population-based study of adults found the past 3-month prevalence was 4.0% for cannabis, 0.4% for sedatives, and 0.3% for amphetamines [13] . A 2017 national study estimated the prevalence of any drug use in the last 3 months increased to 8.6% of adults, largely driven by cannabis use followed by Mandrax (methaqualone) and stimulants such as methamphetamine [15] . Polysubstance use is common [16, 17] , and likely to be under-reported due to the illicit nature of substance use and concerns about stigma. In the Western Cape, methamphetamine (referred to as tik), which is generally smoked, has been a popular self-reported drug of choice among patients entering SUD treatment for a number of years.

The first is to assess the TB exposure, risk of disease progression, and disease burden among PWUD, including people living with and without HIV. We hypothesize that TB prevalence in PWUD will be significantly higher compared to results from a community-wide survey [32] and that the prevalence of incipient TB (host RNA signature presence) will be significantly higher among PWUD compared to the general community. We also hypothesize that PWUD living with HIV will have higher rates of incipient, subclinical, and clinical TB disease compared to those PWUD who are HIV negative. Second, we aim to estimate the proportion of active TB cases that are the result of transmission within the social network of PWUD. We hypothesize that there will be a high proportion of linked isolates from Aim 1, reflecting predominance of recent transmission within this cohort. We also expect that persons with TB/HIV co-infection will more often appear as contacts with fewer links compared to persons with TB disease alone, reflecting their increased susceptibility to TB and their decreased ability to transmit TB.",

For Aim 3, we will enroll 100 participants who are diagnosed with TB and compare PWUD (Arm 1) with people who do not use drugs (Arm 2). For Arm 1 we will recruit 50 participants, most from Aim 2, who have active, untreated pulmonary TB and use methamphetamine and/or Mandrax. For Arm 2 we will recruit 50 persons who do not smoke illicit drugs but have been newly diagnosed with TB disease and have received less than five days of treatment.

The Bayesian classifier is trained on this dataset to determine the relative contribution of other potential predictors of transmission, such as time between disease diagnosis/onset, gender, geographic distance and smear grade, and will be applied to the validation dataset to estimate the probability of a link between the remaining individuals in the dataset. This is done repeatedly, randomly selecting 1000 different training sets and estimating probabilities for each potential transmission pair to allow for the potential of an infector outside of the observed data network. We will also infer the relative contribution of attributes, such as HIV, to transmission probabilities. Simulations that we have performed with this approach show the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 compared to 0.65 with random covariates and excellent ability to determine the true infector.",

We will closely monitor enrollment patterns, and consequently implement strategies such as working closely with the community to generate interest around the study and extending the recruitment period until we are able to obtain our sample. The use of RDS should circumvent this challenge to a degree. Alternatively, interest may be greater, and enrollment faster than we anticipate, leading to challenges in managing participant flow. If enrollment is more rapid, we may hire additional staff. The risk of participant attrition is another challenge, but this will be limited by incorporating recruitment strategies that have been successful with previous studies that focused on PWUD, such as collecting detailed locator information and actively tracking participants between appointments, as well as the provision of reminders and reimbursement [64, 65] .
