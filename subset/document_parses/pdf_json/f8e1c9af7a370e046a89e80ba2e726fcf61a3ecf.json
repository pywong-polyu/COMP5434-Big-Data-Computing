We aimed to evaluate the relevance of two municipality-level deprivation indices (DIs), the French-Deprivation-Index (FDep) and the French-European-Deprivation-Index (FEDI) in perinatal health through two key perinatal outcomes: preterm birth (PTB) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA).",

Using the SNDS, we then studied the association between each component of the two DIs (census data, 2015) and \"PTB and SGA\". Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using multilevel logistic regression with random intercept at the municipality level.",

However, after adjustment, neither FDep nor FEDI showed a significant gradient with PTB or SGA. In the SNDS (N = 726,497), no FDep component, and only three FEDI components were significantly associated (specifically, the % of the population with \u2264 lower secondary level of education with both outcomes (PTB: 1.5 [1.15-1.96]); SGA: 1.25 [1.03-1.51]), the % of Conclusion: Some components of FDep and FEDI were less relevant than others for capturing ecological inequalities in PTB and SGA. Results varied for each DI and perinatal outcome studied. These findings highlight the importance of testing DI relevance prior to examining perinatal health inequalities, and suggest the need to develop DIs that are suitable for pregnant women.",

For the former, publicly available aggregated variables are frequently used to measure socioeconomic status of inhabitants in residential areas [8, 9] . These variables are used in several ecological composite indices known as area-based deprivation indices [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] most of which are developed from census data. Previous studies showed that the way DIs are constructed may impact their ability to measure health inequalities (i.e., the data sources and socioeconomic variables selected, as well as the methods chosen to combine these variables into a single measure) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The best possible data source meets all the following criteria: it reflects the deprivation experienced by the largest number of people in the most accurate and reliable way, it is the most recent source, it is reproducible, and its data are collected in a consistent manner throughout a country [21] . The most suitable geographic area is that with the smallest possible population size [20] , while the most appropriate socioeconomic variables to explain social inequalities in health are those which are selected based on the theoretical model of the occurrence of the health problem studied [18] . Not all individual or neighbourhood-level socioeconomic variables are equally effective at uncovering health inequalities in different population groups [22] .",

            "text": "Among the different perinatal outcomes, PTB represents a large burden for families, healthcare, and educational systems in France [24, 25] . At 5\u00bd years, 28% of children born extremely preterm have severe/moderate neurodevelopmental disabilities. This risk is more than three times higher in families with low socioeconomic status [25] . In addition, preterm infants are at risk of long-term neurocognitive, motor impairments and more risk of chronic diseases [26] . SGA is associated with a four-fold increased risk of stillbirth [27] , and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality [28] . SGA is also associated to the 'fetal origins of adult disease' hypothesis with a higher risk of chronic diseases in later adulthood, such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus [29, 30] . The aetiologies of both outcomes are complex, and linked to a wide range of factors. Although the factors associated with these outcomes have been widely studied, mechanisms or pathways leading to PTB and SGA are still not fully known [3, 23, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Risk factors often co-occur and their relationships with \"PTB and SGA\" may not be simple or direct [37] . Accordingly, adverse behaviours, such as tobacco smoking, and potentially protective factors, such as increased health literacy, may mediate the association between \"PTB and SGA\" and socioeconomic characteristics. Risk factors associated with \"PTB and SGA\" include sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, individual chronic conditions and previous pregnancy-related medical risks (e.g., hypertension, infections, etc.), obstetric factors (e.g., parity, previous pregnancy outcomes, multiple births), foetal factors, psychosocial factors (e.g., social support, sense of community), environmental factors, mothers' behaviours during pregnancy (e.g., illicit substance use and nutrition), and prenatal care [31, 34, 37-40, 44, 45] . Previous studies showed that individual socioeconomic characteristics such as educational level [3] , household income [32, 36, 39] , being a single-parent [43] , working conditions [41] , and demographic factors such as race and ethnicity [35, 42] were all associated with PTB and SGA, as well as contextual factors such as neighbourhood deprivation status [23] . Evidence-based policy-making for reducing social perinatal health inequalities requires measuring social disparities accurately and therefore validating DIs across subpopulations is important [17] . However, this is rarely done [4, 46, 47] . Furthermore, researchers do not often discuss or justify their decision to choose one area-based DI over another to measure health inequalities with respect to the outcomes or the characteristics of the subgroups studied.",

This difference could be partly explained by the fact that the FDep and FEDI have different objectives and were built using different statistical methods. The FEDI is built from a combination of ten weighted census-derived elements as a proxy of individual experience of deprivation [13] . In contrast, the FDep is built from four ecological variables to capture spatial variability using the statistical procedure of principal component analysis and validated on mortality [14] . In addition, the different components in the two DIs may explain this difference. Previous studies showed that some components of the FEDI-such as the proportion of non-home owners, the proportion of primary residences with more than 1 person per room, and the proportion of persons with no access to a car-vary between rural and urban areas [55] , and do not always reflect the deprivation status in an area of residence. In rural areas, not having access to a car could be an obstacle to mobility and may reflect deprivation status, whereas in urban areas, it is common not to have a car as public transport is developed. Likewise, while the proportion of overcrowded homes and home ownership may be markers of deprivation in rural areas, this is not necessarily true in urban contexts. When DI quintiles were applied to the NPS population, 60% of women were classified into a Chi2 test the most deprived area according to FEDI quintiles (Q5) (data not shown). This could be explained by the fact that pregnant women are more often young, actively working and mainly live in urban areas.",

            "text": "With regard to individual socioeconomic characteristics, the significant associations we observed between household income and educational level with both PTB and SGA are consistent with previous studies [3, 33, 39] . Our results showed a less clear link between the composite variable 'individual social deprivation index' and PTB, despite an excess risk as soon as the score was higher than 0. This result is similar to that observed by Opatowski M et al. who built the individual social deprivation index we used here [6] . One explanation for this may be the small number of premature infants with a score > = 3 (n = 93 PTB neonates), which prevents any potential significant difference from being demonstrated. Another explanation is PTB's multifactorial aetiology, especially psychological status, behaviours (tobacco, cannabis and alcohol consumption, etc.), inadequate prenatal care, and commuting, which are all very important during pregnancy, but are not included in the index [37] . In the SNDS analyses, with regard to PTB, the non-significant associations we found for the proportion of blue-collar workers, the median household income, and the proportion of secondary school graduates, confirm those reported in a previous French study [4] . However, unlike that study, we found that the proportion of unemployment, the proportion of non-home owners, and the proportion of single-parent households were not associated with PTB. This may be due to differences in the analyses methods used [4] . More specifically, unlike previous analyses [4] , we used multilevel regressions adjusted for a large range (Fig. 2a) . Association between SGA and individual socioeconomic status, and the quintiles of the DIs (FDep, FEDI) (Fig. 2 b) . aOR (95% CI) = adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) from multilevel logistic regression models. Educational level categorized into four classes: ISCED 0-2 (lower secondary education or less), ISCED 3 (upper secondary education), ISCED 4-5 (post-secondary non-tertiary education, short-cycle tertiary education), ISCED 6-8 (university Bachelors' degree or equivalent or higher). Individual social deprivation index categorized into in four classes: ISDI-0: zero factor, ISDI-1: one factor, ISDI-2: two factors, ISDI \u2265 3 factors. FDep/FEDI: Q1: least-deprived quintile (reference); Q5: most-deprived quintile. a Preterm Birth. b Small for gestational age of variables, which allowed to study both individual and ecological variables. We did not observe a significant association between the median household income and either PTB or SGA. This could be due to the difficulties in accurately measuring income, and especially financial burden, including household expenses and the number of dependent persons [36] . In contrast to the proportion of secondary school graduates, the proportion of persons with a lower secondary school level of education or less was associated with PTB and SGA. The high percentage of the general population who complete upper secondary educational level and the continued increase in this percentage over recent years could explain this result. With regard to the proportion of foreign nationals, our study did not show any significant link with PTB or SGA. In the literature, poor perinatal outcomes are not always associated with foreign nationality because of the 'healthy migrant effect' on first generation immigrants [56] . The association between components of both DIs and PTB and SGA were not always similar, perhaps due to difference in risk factors regarding the two outcomes [38, 39] .",

Some authors suggest that this decrease could be the result of cumulative effects of socio-environmental variables (such as maternal behavioural modifications, reduced workrelated stress, possible alleviation of commutingrelated and other work-related physical strain thanks to working from home), a likely increase in partner presence and support at home, reduced exposure to infection because of physical distancing measures and self-isolation, and less air pollution.

It is also possible to evaluate the relevancy of taking these factors into account when constructing area-based deprivation indices. Finally, preventive measures also provide the opportunity to examine causal mechanisms related to perinatal outcomes.",

France's NPS are population-based and provide detailed data on mothers' medical, social and demographic characteristics in a representative annual sample of births in France. We combined data from two French NPS (2010 and 2016) to increase the sample size. Our second study population was based on an exhaustive national medicoadministrative database (SNDS), which includes all deliveries in France. We used multilevel models with random intercept to take into account variations at the municipality scale, and to study both individual and ecological variables. Our results may be generalised in the French context because they were based on data from a representative sample and from exhaustive national databases. In the international context, the methods used in our study could be reproduced to evaluate the validity of local deprivation indices.",

Second, the NPS analyses were designed to evaluate the extent that ecological deprivation indices can be considered good proxies of individual socioeconomic characteristics. Although this approach has been previously used in several studies [13, 47, 62, 63] , one cannot simply interpret these indices as exclusively proxies for individual characteristics; they may also reflect the effects of the area of residence. Third, due to a lack of available data in the SNDS, we were not able to include as many individual covariables on maternal socioeconomic status as in the NPS analysis. Therefore, we used a different set of covariables on the NPS and SNDS multivariate analyses. To our knowledge, no study to date has assessed the validity of coding of the few available proxies of maternal individual-level socioeconomic deprivation in the SNDS database, limiting its potential usefulness.",
