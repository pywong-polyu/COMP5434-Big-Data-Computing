It is well known that the traditional solution, of using a fixed bitrate ladder, does not result in the highest quality of experience for the user. Hence, in this paper, we consider a content-driven approach for estimating the bitrate ladder, based on spatio-temporal features extracted from the uncompressed content. The method implements a content-driven interpolation. It uses the extracted features to train a machine learning model to infer the curvature points of the Rate-VMAF curves in order to guide a set of initial encodings. We employ the VMAF quality metric as a means of perceptually conditioning the estimation. When compared to exhaustive encoding that produces the reference ladder, the estimated ladder is composed by 74.3% of identical Rate-VMAF points with the reference ladder. The proposed method offers a significant reduction of the number of encodes required, 77.4%, at a small average Bj\u00f8ntegaard Delta Rate cost, 1.12%.",

In Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) [2] , video content is encoded by varying spatial resolution and quantization level in order to adapt to the changing state of a heterogeneous network and to differing display device specifications. For example, if a streaming client monitors a change in the rate of an incoming video chunk that cannot support a smooth (without re-buffering) play-out, it will signal the need to switch to a stream at a lower bitrate. To this end, the creation of a set of video encodings at different bitrates is required at the server. This set of encodings are normally represented using a bitrate ladder. The traditional HAS solution uses a fixed bitrate ladder (a set of fixed bitrateresolution pairs) but this approach cannot ensure a high quality of experience for all types of video content.",

Each short video chunk is encoded using optimized parameters, i.e. resolution, quantization level, intra-period, etc., with the aim of building the Pareto Front (PF) across all Rate-Quality curves. Then a set of target bitrates is used to find the best encoded bitstreams. The quality metric used for this in the Netflix case is Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion (VMAF) [8] . Given the extensive parameter space (compression levels, spatial and temporal resolution, codec type etc.) and taking into account the fact that this process must be repeated for each video chunk, the amount of computation needed is massive. As a consequence, the industry heavily relies on cloud computing services, and this comes at a high cost in financial, time and compute terms.",

An approach reported by Bitmovin [9] , [10] , performs a complexity analysis on each incoming video and inputs that into a machine-learning model to adjust the encoding profile to match the content. CAMBRIA [11] , estimates the encoding complexity by running a fast constant rate encoding [11] . In [12] , trial encodes are used to collect coding statistics at low resolutions and these are utilized within a probabilistic framework to improve encoding decisions at higher resolutions. MUX [13] introduced a deep-learning based approach that takes, as input, the vectorized video frames and predicts the bitrate ladder. Another interesting approach that takes into account both quality constraints and bitrate network statistics was proposed by Brightcove [14] , [15] . The quality metric used in this case was the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and bitrate constraints were based on probabilistic models. Finally, recently iSize [16] proposed the use of pre-encodes within a deep learning framework to decide on the optimal set of encoding parameters and resolution at a block level.",

Further to the encodes at the six cross-over QPs, we require two additional in order to determine the unknown parameters of the linear model at each resolution. Particularly, we require one more encode for the 2160p and one for the 540p. The QP value selection for the extra encodes for each sequence j is decided as below:",

We evaluated the proposed methods by computing the BD metrics (mean and mean absolute deviation (mad) 2 of BD-Rate) against RL, the maximum number of encodes required per method, and the percentage of the estimated ladder points that are identical to RL points, RL-hits. Fig. 4 illustrates the distributions of BD-Rates for the three tested methods in (a)-(c) and the complexity -accuracy tradeoff in (d). As can be seen in (d), for the same number of initial encodes, CIL-7, slightly improves the mean BD-Rate (0.13%). As the differences between the CIL versions 5-7 are trivial, it is clear that CIL-5 results in the best accuracycomplexity tradeoff, as it reduces by 22% the required encodes compared to NIL. Moreover, FL can further decrease the complexity down to only eight initial encodes at the cost of 0.46% BD-Rate loss. However, by comparing the histograms, the FL distribution tail is heavier than the other two methods. Compared to RL, NIL reduces the maximum number of required encodes by 71% with 75.1% RL-hits, CIL-5 by 77.4% with 74.3% RL-hits, and FL by 87.1% with 36% RL-hits. Taking into account these statistics, we conclude that CIL-5 is the recommended method for an accurate and cost-effective ladder estimation.",

The results showed a significant reduction of complexity, 77.4% at a small BD-Rate cost, 1.12%, when compared to the optimal reference ladder, while achieving to build a ladder with 74.3% RL-hits.
