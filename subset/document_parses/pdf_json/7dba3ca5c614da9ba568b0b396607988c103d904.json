Challenges in the life cycle of vaccine production include process development, lead time, intellectual property, and local vaccine production. A robust and stable manufacturing process and constant raw material supplies over decades is critical. In a continuously evolving vaccine landscape, the need of the hour for developing nations is to manufacture their own vaccines besides having supply security, control over production scheduling and sustainability, control of costs, socio-economic development, and rapid response to local epidemics. There is a need for capacity building of workforce development, technology transfer, and financial support. Technology transfer has improved vaccine access and reduced prices of vaccines. Capacity building for the manufacturing of vaccines in developing countries has always been an area of paramount importance and more so in a pandemic situation.",

            "text": "Prevention of diseases by vaccination is one of the most significant achievements in medical` research history. 1 It has become a key to the cost-effective reduction of mortality, improvement of life expectancy, and economic growth. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), approved vaccines prevent 2 to 3 million deaths per year. 2, 3 These numbers are projected to increase by at least 6 million if all children are vaccinated as per the recommended vaccination schedule. At present, 19.5 million infants worldwide are still at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) because they miss out on basic vaccines. 4 The primary reason behind this is the lack of equitable access to basic vaccines in the low-income and middle-income developing nations. These nations are largely dependent on imports. Some countries with relatively high per capita income are not eligible for support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (GAVI) in accessing new vaccines. 5 In 2008, the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property was adopted at the World Health Assembly. 6 In 2010, nearly 200 countries committed to a shared global health vision called the \"Decade of Vaccine Initiative (DoV) (2010-2020).\" The main aim was to achieve 90% vaccination coverage in developing countries to prevent around 7.6 million under-5 child mortality. The vaccine industry in all countries was supposed to play a significant role in these initiatives. 7 Fortunately, during the \"Decade of Vaccines,\" 20 million additional children, and at least 90% coverage of the three-dose diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccines in more than hundred countries were vaccinated. 8 This initiative also contributed to increased recognition of the socio-economic benefits of immunization beyond reducing the VPDs burden and increased demand for data and analytical methods to quantify the economic impact and support decisionmaking. 8 Return on investment (ROI) and investment cases have been actively used by global health stakeholders to link specific health investments' implications and costs. 8 Sim et al., 8 estimated economic impact by using cost-of-illness and valueof-a-statistical-life models. They used this estimation with immunization program costs and derived the ROI from immunization programs against 10 pathogens for 94 low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) between 2011 and 2030. Using the cost-of-illness approach, ROI for one dollar invested in immunization against the 10 selected pathogens was 26.1 USD from 2011 to 2020 and 19.8 USD from 2021 to 2030. Using the value-of-a-statistical life approach, return on investment was 51.0 USD from 2011 to 2020 and 52.2 USD from 2021 to 2030. The results showed continued high ROI from the immunization programs. The ROI estimates can help country policy makers and decision makers in mobilizing resources for immunization. 8 The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a timely reminder of the tenuous nature of the world's vaccine supply and the lack of widespread vaccine manufacturing expertise. The annual reports of United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) over the years (2015-2019) have shown that out of the majority of the goods that were procured from different countries are either vaccines or biologicals ( Figure 1 ). 9-13 GAVI started with six vaccines from five suppliers in five countries. Till date, 430 new vaccine introductions were launched by them. The current portfolio targets 18 diseases, involving 17 suppliers in 11 countries, impacting affordability and supply security. The number of manufacturers from Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network (DCVMN) contributing to GAVI markets increased from 4 to 10 between 2012 and 2018. Moreover, 55% of the total doses were supplied by DCVMN to GAVI between 2012 and 2018 ( Figure 2 ). 14 Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are only a few countries with exceptions who are actually actively involved in vaccine development and manufacturing. This also has brought a new emphasis to the local production of vaccines. Local production will require interested countries to work on technology transfer/assimilation, innovation, and capacity-building. Capacity-building interventions, in particular, can take a variety of forms that include technical support, in-depth consultations, web-based and in-person training sessions, online learning options, guidance materials in the form of knowledge products, and skills-based courses among others such as coaching and mentoring. 15 In this review, we are going to highlight the present challenges to start local vaccine manufacturing in general with particular emphasis on the developing countries and the role of capacity building as a possible solution to counter these challenges and thereby not only increase the vaccine coverages in their respective countries but also export them to other nations.",

Moreover, it requires significant fixed and ongoing maintenance costs. Any new change in technology that impacts how vaccines are packaged and delivered may disrupt the vaccine industry by further market segmentation with different product presentations of the same vaccine. For example, a change in the primary containers. In addition to the costs of new technology development, any decrease or alteration in the product life cycle of the original vaccine, full costs of the original presentation are not recovered, and the manufacturer is forced to invest further to maintain market share. Facilities can cost 50-500 million USD per antigen based on the high complexity of design, automation, segregation, utilities, contamination controls, and as much as 700 million USD for multiple vaccines. Current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) space may cost 600 USD/ft 2 ; non-cGMP space may cost 350 USD/ft 2 ; clean rooms and containment rooms may cost more. 16, 17 ",

Even if there is no product manufacturing, many of these costs are incurred. Majority of the operating costs are attributed to fixed cost, which is a function of the facility design. 17 Generally, some equipment across platforms (bioreactors, filtration, and chromatography equipment, filling, and lyophilization equipment) are common, but the sequence of operations and the specific cycles for each product vary. Each product or family of products demands a dedicated facility and production team. This allows flexibility to address unpredictable demand but adds to the operating costs. Labor costs vary significantly by country, depending on the availability of local expertise. Mostly labors include both locals and expatriates. Most expatriate staff require higher total compensation and benefits than local employees, increasing the overall labor costs. Vaccine production mainly needs biological raw materials (e.g., yeast extract, natural or recombinant enzymes), adding inherent biological variability to the manufacturing or analytical processes. These raw materials are specialized in nature and may be limited in supply and subject to shortages. Moreover, materials of animal origin carry the risk of adventitious agents that may contaminate the production process. Raw materials of animal origin are subject to extensive testing for viral or other microbial contamination and are generally sourced from regions free of certain diseases. Due to the short supply, the prices are on the higher side and interrupts production leading to vaccine shortages. Even having multiple suppliers for critical materials to manage short supply, the order volumes from each supplier gets reduced, resulting in higher prices. However, with local production of vaccines, the prices are estimated to be as low as 15% of those in high-resource countries because of cost savings in consumables. 16 ",

As a result, many regions lack significant vaccine manufacturing capacity. These areas are ones where there is high demand for vaccines as there exist an increased risk of endemic diseases and outbreaks. Novel technologies such as utilizing DNA/RNA synthesis, 3D printing, mini-labs, and product design would make distributed manufacturing feasible for a broad range of vaccines across the globe. These technologies would not only enable decentralized production but will also provide flexibility to accelerate transition between different product lines. Combined with local testing and quality assurance, a new regulatory approach would be needed as well. Vaccine companies would require sharing of their IP in new ways for their products to be produced in a distributed way. Implemented at mass scale, distributed manufacturing would not only provide value for routine use but also be beneficial during pandemics.",

For example, the FDA already utilizes this approach for the seasonal flu vaccine. The United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has shown substantial flexibility in its review of COVID-19 MCMs. Recently, many COVID-19 vaccine developments have combined or overlapped clinical trial phases. While accelerated regulatory processes can enable critical flexibility in an emergency, it is important to weigh the benefits and risks.",

Until and unless effective vaccines are administered to large portions of the global population to prevent hospitalization and severe disease, and preferably achieve herd immunity to halt transmission of the virus, the world will not be the same again. Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for human use in different parts of the world. But the biggest challenge now will be to produce them at a large scale, pricing them affordably, and allocating them globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities. To suddenly scale up the production to meet global demand is a monumental challenge. In addition, the increasing volume of vaccines will also put pressure on global supply chains for glass vials, syringes, and stabilizing agents. Moreover, prior to this pandemic, there were no established networks of contract manufacturers for candidates using novel technologies like mRNA delivery platforms. The COVID-19 vaccines' production is limited by the highly concentrated state of global vaccine manufacturing capacity, and the established relationships between lead developers and contract manufacturers. A successful solution to the production bottleneck needs widespread technology transfer to enable the expansion of manufacturing capacity. Presently, countries around the world have limited domestic capacity to rapidly manufacture COVID-19 vaccine batches. So, these countries will require global companies to actively share knowledge, technology, and data with domestic manufacturers. LMICs are home to about 85% of the global population and mechanisms will be required to make these vaccines affordable Universal access of the vaccines to billions of people will be another major challenge in stopping this pandemic in 2021. 58 ",

Taking these into considerations, BMGF over the last two decades supported DCVMs with US$1 billion and worked with 19 DCVMs across 11 countries to bring 17 vaccines to market. These collaborations had a tremendous positive impact all over the world. For example, MenAfriVac, an affordable meningitis conjugate A vaccine was developed by a multi-year partnership with Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and the SII. It was the first internationally qualified vaccine developed outside the major multinational pharmaceutical companies' way back in 2010. This vaccine developed specifically for the African meningitis belt has effectively ended meningitis as a public health problem there. Similarly, Euvichol was a low-cost and easy-toadminister cholera vaccine developed by EuBiologics in South Korea. It helped in countering several cholera outbreaks in Africa and prevented further such epidemics all over the world. Indian DCVMs have been particularly successful over the years. Bharat Biotech from India has developed Rotavac, which is an affordable rotavirus vaccine that costs only US$1 per dose. There are many such examples where DCVMs are making a difference. BMGF is supporting many other DCVMs vaccines in the pipeline. DCVMs now produce more than two-thirds of the vaccine volume for use around the world by GAVI. 68 ",

The government was facing a shortage of funds to continue importing vaccines for the growing population to support their extensive immunization program. To overcome these challenges, the Turkish ministry mandated one of the renowned universities to set up a novel vaccine development center. After researching all options and avenues, the university approached a resource partner company called Techinvention to help set up Turkey's first vaccine laboratory for indigenous manufacturing of vaccines. The outsourcing company was asked to design the laboratories, train local teams, supervise equipment selection, procurement and installation, transfer the strains/clones, completing technology transfer, and producing successful consistency batches on a pilot scale. The project was started in 2014 and the first successful development of the pilot batches of recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine took place in 2016.

They also hired an engineering firm to complete the project and also helped with Quality Management System (QMS) implementation. This project started in 2014 and was completed with the establishment of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, a first in the region. This unique crosscontinent collaboration to help in capacity building development is a model project for other countries to look up to. 70",

The WHO approached SII for working on capacity building of a pandemic flu vaccine and stockpiling. A special team was created to support the activity of development of the same.The process of development went through handling of simple flu virus strains to seasonal vaccine strains and subsequently H5N1 virus. A suitable system for growing, inactivating, and purifying viruses was developed which could be tailored to facilitate handling of any strain of flu virus to produce a vaccine. SII was able to develop an inactivated adjuvanted H5N1 whole-virus vaccine for animal toxicity studies in the record time of 18-20 months (December 2008). In April/May 2009, reports of a possible swine flu pandemic appeared and subsequently WHO requested SII to develop an H1N1 vaccine. The anticipated challenge was that a stockpile approach alone will not be adequate for countries like India with more than 1.2 billion population. SII looked for technology acquisition which would be highly scalable and offer ease of delivery. A successful agreement was reached between WHO, Nobilon, BioDiem & SII, by which SII obtained the license to use the cold-adapted virus strain for developing an intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine. In August 2009, the cold adapted strain was received and SII developed Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) vaccine at an accelerated speed. 71",

With the introduction of newer vaccines and immunization schedules getting updated, diverse service delivery strategies, expanding target population, increased cold-chain infrastructure requirements, and lack of adequate funds are some of the new challenges for ISCL systems as it was not designed to manage such everincreasing demands. This has led to stock-outs, potential administration of ineffective vaccines, avoidable wastage, and inadequate cold-chain capacity leading to considerable coverage, performance, and cost implications. These inefficiencies can hinder the ability to provide much-needed immunizations and yield a lower return in health outcomes for those funding the research, production, procurement, and delivery of vaccines, threatening the dependability of future funding sources. The growth in complexity of immunization programs occurs simultaneously with the development and application of innovative supply chain strategies and technology.

It integrates the commitment of the public sector to develop products to improve the health of the population with the private sector's discipline and culture in business development and marketing. The nonprofit enterprise has effectively led to the development of several products in the past decade. The PPPs have also evolved innovative methods for IP and portfolio management and have unique governance structures and methods. The PPP in vaccine research can be strengthened by flexible governing and funding mechanisms that should be evolved to support product development in the PPP model. The flexibility of contracting experts, both from the national and global pool for a defined period should be built-in in these partnerships. While setting up the policy framework, the industry may be provided a channel to voice their opinions and experiences, and their concerns could be utilized in framing the policy. If the industry is genuinely concerned about tardy regulatory mechanisms or a decision has been made to their detriment, an independent and speedy redressal mechanism should be in place. A needbased realistic procurement policy should help. One such example where product development has taken the PPP route and has resulted in a shortening of the time frame for vaccine development is the Meningococcal Meningitis Vaccine Initiative (MMVI). In this initiative, the product was produced in India with multiple partners, met international quality standards, and was exported to, and used in Africa.",

While overall economic development has helped to increase public and private access to capital, the need for continued capital investment to ensure successful compliance with cGMPs and adoption of new production technology was noted as a particular challenge for manufacturers and important for governments to take into consideration. 31 A social investor like a country government, a supranational entity, a development finance institution, or a private philanthropy can use a range of financial instruments to encourage greater investment in manufacturing capacity like production subsidy, capacity subsidy, concessional loan, and volume guarantee. 83 Although all these instruments can incentivize a vaccine developer to enhance its manufacturing capacity, but each intervention results in a different expected cost to the social investor. 83 These global investments and innovations through worldwide network would better prepare the world for future pandemics and improve equitable access to vaccines around the world. Capacity building for manufacturing of vaccines in developing countries has always been an area that should have been accorded paramount importance. In the COVID-19 scenario and increasing incidences of newly emerging and re-emerging diseases, this arena should be accorded among the highest of importance across strategic initiatives.

Since inception, the department has been focusing on, developing human resources, creation of appropriate infrastructure, research and development, and creating a regulatory framework. 73\u2022 Strong collaboration of technology partners and local research institutionsThe WHO and partners launched the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) to operationalize the Solidarity Call to Action and facilitate timely, equitable, and affordable access to COVID-19 health products. C-TAP, working through its implementing partners (the Medicines Patent Pool, the Open COVID Pledge, and the UN Technology Bank), provides a global one-stop platform for developers of COVID-19 medications, diagnostics, vaccines, and other related products to share their IP knowledge, and data with quality-assured manufacturers through public health-driven voluntary, non-exclusive, and transparent licenses. With the support of WHO and Unitaid, the Medicines Patent Pool temporarily expanded its mandate to cover any COVID-19 related health technologies, including vaccines and diagnostics.74 As part of the task force, the WHO established in April 2021, a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub to scale-up global manufacturing. WHO and its COVAX partners are working with a South African consortium to establish the first COVID mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub. 75",
