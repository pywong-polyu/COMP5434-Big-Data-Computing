Common extrapulmonary syndromes: 98 patients (64.47%) suffered from digestive system involvement; 43 patients (28.29%) suffered from cardiovascular system damage; 32 patients (21.05%) had urinary system damage; 25 patients (16.45%) had nervous system damage; and 30 patients (19.74%) had more than two kinds of system damage. In all cases, these patients were treated with comprehensive measures, and effective outcomes were achieved. Conclusion: According to the clinical characteristics and laboratory test results of this sample group, early evaluation of patients with extrapulmonary complications and timely symptomatic treatment can effectively improve outcomes of pneumonia treatment, accelerate the alleviation of symptoms, and improve patients' condition.",

Novel coronavirus pneumonia is a class B infectious disease and is managed according to class A in China. With the development of the epidemic, the disease has spread to almost every country in the world. The number of patients and deaths is increasing day by day, causing a global pandemic. [1] [2] [3] As of 24:00 on April 30, there were 2,016,555 unrecovered confirmed cases, 3,235,409 cumulative confirmed cases, 227,823 deaths, and 991,031 recovered cases globally (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). This epidemic poses a huge threat to the lives of the people of China and the global population, and it is having a serious impact on global economic development. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 4, 5 The novel coronavirus is the pathogen of the disease, 6 and it is highly infectious and pathogenic. The disease primarily causes lung damage, but it also affects multiple organs, especially in the digestive and cardiovascular systems. 7 If a patient's extrapulmonary complications are not addressed early enough, the delay can severely impact the overall treatment effect and prognosis. However, to date, novel coronavirus pneumonia patients with extrapulmonary complications have only been studied to a limited extent. In the current study, we analyzed 500 patients who were admitted to Hanchuan People's Hospital and were treated by the hospital's supporting medical team, with a focus on patients with extrapulmonary complications, to provide a scientific basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.",

It has the characteristics of high infectivity and high pathogenicity. 8 At present, the source of the virus is not clear; however, research has revealed that its homology with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in bats is over 85%. Additionally, studies have confirmed that the routes of transmission are mainly respiratory droplets and close contact; in most patients with confirmed cases, the definite source of infection can be traced back to these routes. 9 The virus incubation period is typically between 10 and 14 days, but it can be as long as 24 days. [10] [11] [12] [13] The main clinical manifestations are fever, cough, dyspnea, and other respiratory symptoms; most patients also have general symptoms such as asthenia and poor appetite. 7 Lung computed tomography results mainly show multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes. 14, 15 Early routine blood tests show that white blood cell count does not increase; meanwhile, a progressive decrease in lymphocyte count may indicate a poor prognosis. 16 Depending on a patient's epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and physical and chemical examination results, it is often not Especially when these are the first symptoms, the disease can be complicated, and careful analysis by clinicians is needed. The findings of this study reveal that, in addition to respiratory symptoms, novel coronavirus pneumonia has a high incidence of extrapulmonary complications. The most common of these is digestive system involvement, followed by cardiovascular system damage and urinary system damage, while the occurrence rate of damage to the nervous system is relatively low. In the present study, 500 cases were retrospectively analyzed. According to the results, 98 (19.6%) of the sample patients without a history of related basic diseases showed poor appetite, and their blood biochemical tests indicated that their transaminase levels were increased. Patients with abnormal myocardial zymogram and ECG changes accounted for 8.6% of the sample; these findings were more common in elderly patients. The abnormal cardiac enzyme profile is the elevated cardiac enzyme (AST/LDH/CK).Finally, the incidence rates of renal dysfunction and neurological The findings of the present study suggest that the prognosis of patients with extrapulmonary complications is poorer than for those without complications but significantly superior to that of patients with previous underlying diseases. In addition, age has a certain impact on clinical curative effects; in general, curative effects were observed to be affected by an increase in age. However, after active antiviral and symptomatic support treatment, most patients had a good prognosis, and the overall rate of curing extrapulmonary complications was high. It was also observed that very few patients had sequelae.",

The results revealed a high incidence of extrapulmonary manifestations and a direct impact of the curative effects for extrapulmonary complications on those for pneumonia. These findings indicate that clinicians should pay attention to the interference factors presented by complications in differentiation from novel coronavirus pneumonia from other diseases. In addition, close monitoring of the clinical manifestations and laboratory tests of patients, early detection of complications, and active symptomatic treatment all play key roles in improving the symptoms and prognosis of patients with COVID-19.",
