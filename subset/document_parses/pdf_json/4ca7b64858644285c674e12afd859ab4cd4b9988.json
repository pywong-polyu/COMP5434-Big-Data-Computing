            "text": "Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality among Malawian women, despite being preventable through screening and preventive therapy. In 2004, Malawi implemented a national screening program, using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and cryotherapy, but its success has been limited due to equipment and human resources challenges. Since the development of that program, new technologies for screening and treatment that are less resource-intensive and more scalable have become available. GeneXpert systems provide fast, accurate HPV results and are increasingly available in low-income countries. Self-collection for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is a validated method for screening and improves uptake. Thermal ablation provides an alternative ablative treatment that is simpler to use than cryotherapy and can be performed with portable devices. Meanwhile, urine HPV testing methods provide promising options for primary screening. We designed a single-arm prospective study to investigate a novel HPV screen-triage-treat strategy among 1250 women in Lilongwe, Malawi. Our proposed strategy consists of (1) Xpert HPV testing of self-collected samples, (2) VIA and colposcopy for HPV-positive women, and (3) thermal ablation for HPV-positive/ablation-eligible women. We will collect cervical biopsies, Pap smears, and endocervical samples to validate the HPV results and VIA/colposcopy findings against endpoints of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer (CIN2+). We will evaluate same-day completion of our algorithm, its performance in triaging women for treatment, and 24-week treatment efficacy of thermal ablation. We will also explore the performance of HPV and methylation tests in urine samples, as compared to provider-and self-collected cervicovaginal samples.",

However, as of 2015, the percentage of women who had been screened at least once was 27%, far below the program's goal of 80% [6] . Furthermore, only 43% of screen-positive women had received treatment. Barriers to successful implementation of this screening program in Malawi revolve around resource requirements. VIA screening requires a private examination room, pelvic examination table, and a trained provider. The need for a pelvic examination may also introduce individual-level barriers related to embarrassment or privacy concerns. Meanwhile, for cryotherapy, the health system must constantly resupply cryogas and address maintenance issues. In 2015, only 32 of the 130 health facilities that offered screening services had cryotherapy machines, 22 of which (69%) were functional [6] . Context-appropriate prevention strategies are urgently needed.",

HPV testing for primary screening has resulted in greater reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality than VIA or Pap smear for primary screening, including in low-resource settings [9] . The Xpert HPV assay (Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) seems well-suited for SSA, since GeneXpert machines have been introduced widely in the region for tuberculosis diagnosis [10] . Xpert HPV tests perform similarly to other commercially available HPV DNA tests [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .

In multiple settings, providing the option of self-collection has resulted in increased screening uptake [22] . Urine sampling may present an even less invasive and equally effective strategy for primary HPV testing [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , but has not yet been validated with the Xpert HPV assay. Beyond DNA testing, methylation changes in human genes and the HPV virus are strongly correlated with the development of CIN and invasive cervical cancer [29] [30] [31] . Methylation tests, such as the S5 methylation classifier, could be used for primary screening or added in sequence with HPV DNA testing to improve specificity of screening [32] . However, validation data on methylation testing, especially on self-collected cervicovaginal and urine samples, are still limited.",

However, in a recent meta-analysis of 34 studies, only three studies were performed in Africa and only two of those included HIV-positive participants [33] . Since that analysis, a randomized controlled trial in Zambia showed that cryotherapy, thermal ablation, and loop excision had comparable effectiveness for resolution of positive HPV/VIA status [34] .

Malawi's national cervical cancer control program has been making strides, with resultant increase in screening coverage from 9.3% to 26.5% over a five-year period [6] . However, this coverage is suboptimal to reduce the burden of cervical cancer in the country. There are significant barrriers to scaling up VIA and cryotherapy in Malawi. These include limited access to screening services and preventive therapy hampered by performance of the VIA-based screening and supplies for cryotherapy for screen-positive women [6, 45] . Context-appropriate and scalable solutions are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of cervical cancer. HPV testing is highly reproducible and addresses concerns about reliability of VIA-based screening [8] . The advent of Xpert HPV testing addresses many of the barriers to implementing an HPV-based screening strategy in resource-limited countries including Malawi [11] . Additionally, Xpert testing has been validated with self-collected samples, with a high sensitivity for CIN2+ detection [18] . Self-collection reduces provider burden and has been shown to increase screening uptake, possibly due to better acceptability among women. Self-collected samples are highly stable for transport [46] , which improves the feasibility of community-based screening in countries like Malawi with majority rural population [4] .",

The performance of our proposed algorithminvolving Xpert testing of self-collected samples and thermal ablation for HPV-positive/ablation-eligible womenhas not been validated in Malawi. Using HPV testing as the primary screening instead of VIA introduces an extra wait-time step because Xpert results take 1-2 h. In the national cervical cancer control program, of the 939 women for whom cryotherapy treatment was postponed, 500 (53.2%) never received treatment [6] . Same-day screen-and-treat improves treatment rates by minimizing loss-to-follow-up. It is crucial to demonstrate that same-day completion of the screen-and-treat algorithm is still feasible with the incorporation of Xpert HPV testing. Our study will address the feasibility, and since we are tracking time points for each step, provide insight into where women might be the most likely lost to follow up. However, we understand the limitation which could come about due to selection bias of our study population, which could represent already motivated women to undergo screening.",

Performing VIA following an HPV-positive result may result in lower sensitivity compared to HPV testing alone, while there are concerns that HPV screen-and-treat strategies could lead to overtreatment. The rates of missed treatment (undertreatment) and unnecessary treatment (overtreatment) of HPV-based screen-and-treat strategy, have not been robustly studied, particularly in resource limited settings. By collecting pathology samples from all HPV-positive women, we have the opportunity to determine rates of overtreatment and undertreatment of the proposed strategy using histologic outcomes as gold standard. These analyses will provide preliminary essential data of the utility of VIA triaging for treatment following an HPV-positive result.",

Newer battery-powered, hand-held thermocoagulator devices are promising for outreach clinics targetting hard-to-reach populations. For these reasons, the Malawi government already endorsed thermal ablation as an alternative ablative treatment for the national cervical cancer control program. However, data for thermal ablation efficacy are limited in settings with high HIV prevalence and are not typically defined histologically, but rather based on subsequent negative VIA result, which is not a robust indicator of the absence of CIN2/3 [50] . Including a substantial group of HIV-positive women in our study allows us to provide insight on our research questions in HIV-infected populations. In particular, thermal ablation efficacy evidence in HIV-infected women is solely needed. Our study will also provide a unique experience for using thermal ablation among nurses, who form a substantial number of available trained providers for Malawi's national cervical cancer control program. With the capacity for histologic diagnosis from baseline and follow-up visits, our study will provide robust data for thermal ablation efficacy, particularly among HIV-positive women.",

Cervical cancer should not remain a leading cause of cancer death since it is largely preventable with vaccination and screening. Due to implementation challenges, HPV vaccination is not readily available in Malawi. Even if widespread HPV vaccination of girls is achieved in Malawi, millions of Malawian females will still be vulnerable to cervical cancer since only girls aged 9-13 years will be eligible for vaccination and a subsequent decline in hr-HPV incidence will not occur for decades [51] . Our study results will help inform national cervical cancer control programs across SSA on how to utilize innovations like self-collection, Xpert HPV testing, and thermal ablation to reduce the risk for cervical cancer among their populations. The study funders were not involved in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and in the decision to submit the article for publication.
