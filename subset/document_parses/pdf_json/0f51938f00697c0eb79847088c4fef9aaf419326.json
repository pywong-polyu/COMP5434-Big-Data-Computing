Selective aortography was done through right common femoral artery, a 4F cobra catheter was advanced into descending thoracic aorta. Selective embolization of hypertrophic tortuous right bronchial artery was performed using poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) particles of 300-500 \u00b5m with complete disappearance of the abnormal right bronchial artery [2] . After embolization, the boy had no further hemoptysis and was doing well on follow-up after 6 months. VOLUME 58 __ MARCH 15, 2021 CORRESPONDENCE The most important step in situation of massive blood loss through the mouth is to first establish that the child is indeed experiencing hemoptysis. The boy was initially treated as hematemesis, and differentiating hemoptysis from hematemesis is critical, as treatment strategies differ markedly [3] . Definition of massive hemoptysis has not been completely agreed upon and vary between 200 and 600 mL as a cut-off, ideally, a volume >200 mL warrants immediate investigation [4] . Although massive hemoptysis is relatively uncommon, mortality rates as high as 75% been reported. The common cause of death is asphyxia secondary to aspiration rather than blood volume loss. Selective bronchial artery embolization is an effective nonsurgical technique for immediate control of massive hemoptysis with a success rate around of 77 -94% [5] . Bronchial dieulafoy disease is rare disease but known to cause massive hemoptysis, where bronchial artery embolization should be considered as the first-line treatment.",

While AHA algorithm considers evaluation for incomplete KD in children with fever \u22655 days and 2 or 3 compatible clinical criteria, the algorithm by Shenoy, et al. [1] triggers KD evaluation if fever \u22655 days is accompanied by less than four compatible clinical features. Although these two statements appear similar, this approach loses specificity by including children who present with fever and just one compatible clinical feature. Individually, the clinical features like rash, lymphadenopathy, conjunctival injection, oral or extremity changes are nonspecific and may occur with various childhood infections in India. This approach risks huge number of children with underlying infections being referred for echocardio-graphic evaluation.",

Compared to Western cohorts, these criteria should be carefully defined in a low-and middle-income setting like India, with a high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia [3] and associated thrombocytosis (present in up to a quarter of those with iron deficiency) [4] . Iron deficiency when associated with infection accounted for more than half of all cases of reactive thrombocytosis in Indian children [5] . Given these findings, the current definition is likely to overestimate the burden of incomplete KD in Indian children, risking increased cost and potentially delaying the diagnosis of underlying infections. For example, as per the algorithm, a child with undifferentiated fever \u22655 days due to measles or a rickettsial infection that has a rash, iron deficiency anemia (and associated thrombo-cytosis) and hypoalbuminemia (negative acute phase reactant) would be treated for Kawasaki disease even if the echocardiogram is normal. In the absence of a 'gold standard' for diagnosis, we believe that grading recommendations based on available quality of evidence may be more useful for the readers to make informed decisions [6] .",
