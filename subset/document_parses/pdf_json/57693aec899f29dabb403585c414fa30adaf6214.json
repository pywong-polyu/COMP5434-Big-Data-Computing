There are approximately 115 species in this genus and 55 of them are native to China [2, 3] . Due to their outstanding value as ornamental, edible, and medicinal plants, lilies are widely cultivated worldwide. Secondary metabolites of plants are important sources of many nutrients and natural medicines [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Plants of the genus Lilium are rich in chemical diversity and have been the focus of natural product chemistry research for decades. Phytochemical studies have shown that, in addition to essential primary metabolites, the chemical constituents of Lilium plants also include many secondary metabolites, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, saponins, sterols and alkaloids, which are important",

Then, 200 \u00b5L of the final mixture were added to the microplate for absorbance determination at 450 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and 100 \u00b5L methanol were used as a blank. Assays for samples with high antioxidant ability were performed after appropriate dilution. The CUPRAC of the samples was calculated by the standard curve equation (y = 0.003x + 0.1391, r 2 = 0.9983), and the results were expressed as \u00b5g trolox equivalent per g of dry weight (TE \u00b5g/g DW).",

As secondary metabolites, phenolic acids and flavonoids can be extensively found in plant-derived foods, composing significant parts of our daily diet. The levels of TPC and TFC of 22 lily bulbs are shown in Table 2 . The TPC was presented by GAE mg/g DW, and the TFC was presented by QE mg/g DW. The TPC of different lilies varies from L. 'Jinghe' (0.6 \u00b1 0.07 GAE mg/g DW) to L. regale (13.73 \u00b1 0.35 GAE mg/g DW), among which wild species L. regale and L. henryi stood out from all the tested lilies, followed by the O and OT types (2.83 \u00b1 0.01~4.21 \u00b1 0.07 GAE mg/g DW). The traditional edible and medicinal lily L. lancifolium, had a higher TPC of 2.25 \u00b1 0.07 GAE mg/g DW than the others, and followed by the edible L. davidii var. willmottiae and Lilium longiflorum hybrid L. 'White Heaven'. The remaining lilies had the lowest, having similar TPCs. The results showed that the TPCs of different genotype lilies varied greatly, which coincides with results from potato in which cultivar was the main variable affecting the biosynthesis of the studied phenolics [34] . The TFCs of the different lilies tested showed a similar trend with the TPCs, but with some differences. The TFCs of L. regale and L. henryi were 3-10 times higher than those of the other tested materials. Although both L. lancifolium and L. brownii var. viridulum are medicinal lilies, our results showed that there were significant differences in the contents of phenolic acids and flavonoids between them ( Table 2 ). For traditional edible lilies, L. davidii, L. leichtlinii var. maximowiczii, L. davidii var. willmottiae, L. lancifolium and L. brownii var. viridulum, L. lancifolium had the highest levels of both the TPC and TFC, and L. brownii var. viridulum had the lowest levels of TPC and TFC. There was no significant difference in the TFCs of L. davidii, L. leichtlinii var. maximowiczii, and L. davidii var. willmottiae (Table 2 ). This means that the nutritional and health effects of different lilies may be different. In a previous study, L. regale had higher contents of total phenolics, flavonoids and flavanols than the other five species (L. concolor, L. pumilum, L. leucanthum, L. davidii var. unicolor and L. lancifolium), consequently exhibiting the highest antioxidant ability [31] . We confirmed this result by the study of a broader selection of material, while our study also demonstrated that L. henryi is richer in TPC and TFC than other lilies except L. regale.",

The second was L. henryi (13, 249 .75 \u00b1 390.47 TE \u00b5g/g DW), being 30 times higher than the lowest value. The O and OT hybrids had moderate DPPH scavenging abilities from 2738.94 \u00b1 265.84 to 4971.99 \u00b1 402.33 TE \u00b5g/g DW, following a similar pattern as the TPC and TFC. For edible lily, L. lancifolium has the highest antioxidant capacity, although this value was not significantly different than that of L. davidii var. willmottiae. For the reducing power of FRAP and CUPRAC, L. regale (11, 622 .55 \u00b1 344.81 and 32,304.44 \u00b1 1878.93 TE \u00b5g/g DW, respectively) and L. henryi (8736.93 \u00b1 645.45 and 26,593.33 \u00b1 1205.54 TE \u00b5g/g DW, respectively) continued to show much higher levels than the other materials. In Rhamnus petiolaris, the contents of flavonols and anthocyanins were highly correlated with DPPH, and phenolic compounds were the main contributors to the antioxidant abilities of the members of the genus Rhamnus [37] . Our study confirmed that there were similar trends among the DPPH, FRAP and CUPRAC values and the TPC and TFC of the different lily bulb extracts, which means that the phenolic acids and flavonoids in lily bulbs might play vital roles in their antioxidant capacity. There were significant differences in TPC and TFC between L. davidii var. willmottiae and L. lancifolium, but there were no significant differences in antioxidant capacity in terms of DPPH, FRAP and CUPRAC values, which might be caused by the differences in antioxidant substances between them [38] .",

The results showed that all the tested factors were significantly highly correlated at the 0.01 level, and all the coefficients were above 0.977 (Table 3 ). The correlation coefficients between TPC and antioxidant indexes were 0.997 for DPPH, 0.992 for FRAP and 0.997 for CUPRAC, and the coefficients of TFC were 0.983, 0.986 and 0.977, respectively. This result indicated that although both TPC and TFC exhibited significant positive correlations with antioxidant capacity, TPC was more highly correlated with this capacity. The same pattern was also found in Actinidia extracts [34] . Our results revealed that the TPC was significantly related to the TFC, with a correlation coefficient of 0.977, in lily bulb extracts. This is reasonable since the biosynthesis of many flavonoids occurs downstream of phenolic acids in plants [39, 40] . Previous studies suggested that the substances extracted by 80% methanol with 1 M HCl from lilies had no significant correlation with DPPH [31] , but our results indicated that the TPC extracted by methanol was highly correlated with DPPH, which coincided with other reported results [38] . This means that the differences in substances extracted by different extraction methods from the same sample may cause divergences in antioxidant capacity [41] . Again, the significant correlation between methods was confirmed with three methods (DPPH, FRAP and CUPRAC). Above all, our results suggested that all the tested bulb extracts exhibited strong antioxidant activities, both in radical scavenging capacity Hierarchical cluster analysis is the most widely used method to classify the objects according to their characteristics [42] . Data on the TPC, TFC and antioxidant capacity (DPPH, FRAP and CUPRAC) were used to carry out hierarchical cluster analysis of the tested lilies, and 22 lilies were separated into three clusters, as shown in Figure 1 . As the results showed, L. regale and L. henryi were clustered together with high TPC, TFC and antioxidant capacity, O and OT hybrid sections were arranged in one group characterized by moderate TPC, TFC and antioxidant properties, and the others, including traditional edible and medical lilies, belonged to a group with low TPC and TFC and weak antioxidant activity (Figure 1 ). The hierarchical clustering results showed the same change trend as the TPC, TFC and antioxidant capacity, which proved the reliability of our results above. These results suggested that, in addition to the traditional edible and medicinal lily, a large number of other species and cultivated varieties also have high antioxidant capacity, which can be used as important sources of natural antioxidants.

The phenylpropane metabolic pathway involves the synthesis of many secondary metabolites, and most flavonoids are synthesized downstream of phenolic acids [39, 40] . Since flavonoids and phenolic acids are the major antioxidants in plants [43] and account for the largest proportion of lily constituents ( Figure 2C or Figure S2D ), we performed correlation analysis for all flavonoids and phenolic acids detected in the five materials. The results indicated that most of the flavonoid have broad correlations with phenolic The cluster heatmap and class heatmap of the metabolites clearly showed the similarity of components among biological repeats and the difference of components amongst different species ( Figure 2B or Figure S1C ).

Since flavonoids and phenolic acids are the major antioxidants in plants [43] and account for the largest proportion of lily constituents ( Figure 2C or Figure S2D ), we performed correlation analysis for all flavonoids and phenolic acids detected in the five materials. The results indicated that most of the flavonoid have broad correlations with phenolic acid, and vice versa ( Figure S1E ). This result supports our findings of a significant positive correlation between the TPC and TFC (with a correlation coefficient of 0.977, Table 3 ) and provides new insights into the synergistic regulation of the biosynthesis and accumulation of phenolic acids and flavonoids in Lilium plants.",

The number of up/downregulated compounds resulting from pairwise comparison of tested species is shown in Figure 3A . The smallest number of differential metabolites was found in the LR vs. LH group with 177 (95 were upregulated and 82 were downregulated). Moreover, LH and LR had more differential metabolites than LDW, LBV, and LL, and among them, the substances whose contents were upregulated accounted for the majority ( Figure 3A) . A total of 112 differential metabolites were shared for three traditional edible species (LDW, LBV and LL), and LL was predominant compared with LDW and LBV not only in the total number of metabolites but also in the upregulated DAMs ( Figure 3A,B) . The metabolic comparative signatures among three traditional edible and medicinal lilies and the top 20 KEGG enrichment pathways of DAMs are presented in Supplementary Figure S2 . Interestingly, LBV was dominant over LDW in the quantitative abundance of substances, but LDW contained more differentially upregulated metabolites than LBV ( Figure 2C or Figure 3A) . To explore the metabolite information in LH and LR, which had higher antioxidant activities and abundance and numbers of active compounds, we performed KEGG enrichment analysis of differential metabolites comparing them with those from Chinese traditional medicinal and edible lily LL. The top 20 most enriched pathways for the differential metabolites are shown in Figure 3E ,F. Multiple amino acid metabolic pathways and secondary metabolic pathways (isoflavonoid biosynthesis, folate biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis) were among them. These results may reveal the reason why the TPC and TFC were higher in LH and LR as well as their stronger antioxidant activities.",

These findings are of great value for the production of specific regalosides. Phenylpropanoid glycerol glucosides, also named as regalosides because they were first isolated from Lilium regale, are typical compounds in genus Lilium [44] . Studies have shown that regalosides have anti-oxidation, bacteriostasis, anti-inflammatory and other functions. Murray et al. [45] proved that phenylpropanoid glycerol glucosides can be used as an inhibitor of hepatic glucose production and may have potential to regulate metabolic syndrome and delay type II diabetes. The total glycosides of lily, including six regalosides, can protect cardiomyocytes by protecting mitochondria [46] . Regaloside I could be the main constituent in protecting human dermal fibroblasts from UVA-induced morphological changes [47] . In this study, 13 regalosides were detected in the five tested materials ( Figure 5 , Table S3 ). The results showed that the proportions of different regalosides varied in five lilies. In LR and LH, regaloside A, regaloside E and regaloside F accounted for a relatively high proportion; while, regaloside, regaloside A, regaloside B, regaloside D, regaloside F and regaloside I accounted for a relatively high proportion in LL; regaloside A had a higher proportion in all five tested lilies. These findings are of great value for the production of specific regalosides. Antioxidants 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 17 LDW, LL and LBV are Chinese traditional edible lilies, meanwhile, LL and LBV are used as TCM. At present, there is no specific description of the composition of the substances available for edible and medicinal lilies. The information on the composition of substances in lily that we obtained in the current study can provide a useful reference for the development of standards related to edible and medicinal lilies. The present results suggested that, besides traditional edible lilies, bulbs of the other lilies were also rich in phenolic acids, flavonoids and other bioactive ingredients, and had extensive antioxidant activity. Moreover, these characteristics of LR, LH, and O and OT hybrids were superior to those of the traditional edible lily, indicating the potential applications of a large number of other lily species and hybrids. Although some lilies have high TPC and TFC and strong antioxidant capacity, they also contain some substances that are not found in traditional edible and medicinal lilies. Considering the possible potential toxicity of different ingredients, even though there is almost no obvious acute toxic reaction to the human body, further studies on the constituents contained in different lilies are needed [1] .",
