While certain aspects of care can be safely omitted or delayed, systemic therapy plays an important role in survival and quality of life for patients with advanced lung cancer; limiting access to systemic therapy will compromise cancer-related outcomes. This can be at odds with strategies to mitigate risk of COVID-19 exposure, which include reducing hospital and clinic visits. One important strategy is implementation of oral cancer therapies. Many standard regimens require intravenous infusions but there are specific circumstances where an oral agent could be an acceptable alternative. Integrating oral therapeutics can permit patients to receive effective systemic treatment without the exposure risks associated with frequent infusions. Here, we review currently available oral cytotoxic agents with a potential role in the treatment of lung cancer.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The global pandemic of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or coronavirus disease , has influenced every aspect of health care, particularly for patients with cancer. Early reports suggest that patients with cancer, particularly lung cancer, may be at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 (1, 2) . An analysis of patients with cancer treated at the Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China revealed a higher COVID-10 infection rate than the general Wuhan population (0.79 vs. 0.37%) (3) . The majority of COVID-19 infected patients from that cancer center, however, were not receiving any active therapy, suggesting a possible risk was simply exposure to the cancer center itself. Efforts to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure have led to a reshaping of cancer care delivery, largely focused on reducing hospital and clinic visits with the use of telemedicine (4) . A complementary strategy for patients with advanced cancer requiring systemic therapy is the use of oral therapeutics in lieu of intravenous agents. While not always possible, when a suitable oral equivalent is available, its use can reduce clinic visit frequency and potentially COVID-19 exposure. For patients with alterations in driver oncogenes, use of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors is already standard practice (5) . For patients without actionable driver alterations, oral treatment options are less readily available, but there are several oral cytotoxic agents ( Table 1 ) which can easily be implemented in an effort to reduce the risk of exposures in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we will summarize the data for oral chemotherapeutics in lung cancer and discuss the utility of these agents in the outpatient management of advanced disease.

The combination of platinum and etoposide chemotherapy has been the front-line therapy for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for decades. While the addition of anti-PD-L1 antibodies (atezolizumab, durvalumab) to first-line therapy has improved survival, the platinum plus etoposide backbone remains central to the treatment of this disease (12, 13) . Platinum agents (and the anti-PD-L1 antibodies) are delivered intravenously (IV), but etoposide is available in both IV and oral formulations. A prospective phase II trial randomized 83 patients with SCLC to a standard IV regimen (cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 plus etoposide 120 mg/m 2 IV days 1-3) or a hybrid IV and oral regimen (cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 IV on day 1, etoposide 120 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 and etoposide 240 mg/m 2 orally on days 2 and 3), both in 28-day cycles (14) . There was no significant difference in overall response rate (RR) between the oral and IV regimens (50 vs. 59%, p = 0.438). PFS and OS were also comparable in both treatment arms. Most toxicities, including grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were similar in both groups. Infectious episodes, moderate to severe anemia, and weight loss occurred more frequently with the IV regimen. Other trials with different dosing schedules for oral etoposide, including 5-or 21-day regimens, also provided comparable outcomes to IV regimens (15, 16) . The cisplatin plus etoposide IV-oral hybrid regimen was also used as a standard arm in several other SCLC clinical trials and performed well. A large (n = 436) randomized trial showed superiority of platinum plus etoposide over CEV (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and vincristine) (17) . The standard arm utilized oral etoposide (cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 on day 1, etoposide 100 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 and etoposide 200 mg/m 2 orally on days 2-4 every 3 weeks) and included 214 patients with limited stage (LS)-SCLC (who received concurrent thoracic radiation therapy). Median survival was longer with platinum plus etoposide (14.5 months) compared to CEV (9.7 months) among patients with LS-SCLC (p = 0.001). For patients with extensive stage (ES)-SCLC, survival was equivalent between the two arms. While the chemo-immunotherapy regimens employing atezolizumab and durvalumab, studied in IMpower133 and CASPIAN, respectively, only used IV etoposide, extrapolation to a hybrid IV-oral regimen could be a reasonable option to reduce infusion center visits and potential COVID-19 exposure (12, 13) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 449, "end": 453, "text": "(12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 454, "end": 457, "text": "13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 935, "end": 939, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1507, "end": 1511, "text": "(15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1515, "text": "16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1802, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2596, "end": 2600, "text": "(12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2601, "end": 2604, "text": "13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Etoposide"}, {"text": "Data exploring use of oral etoposide in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sparse, primarily consisting of early phase studies done in the 1990s prior to the development of modern platinum-doublet regimens.
