            "text": "The novel coronavirus outbreak had occurred in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December 2019 and evolve rapidly throughout the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. This crisis has caused immense stress on governments, institutions, and the world population. Delirium, psychosis, severe anxiety, and depression have been well observed during this pandemic. 1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that pandemics are marked by disrupted sleep cycles, concentration difficulty, fear and excessive worry about one's own life and their loved ones', and increased substance abuse. 2 For those reasons, it is essential to assess the mental health status during and after pandemics to provide new resources and interventions. 3 Pandemics, such as COVID-19, can be mentally demanding due to the unpredictability of the situation, the uncertainty of when to control the disease, and the seriousness of the risk. These, along with misinformation and exaggerating media coverage can put immense mental pressure on individuals and societies. 1 In a study measuring the psychological impact of COVID-19 in China, 26% reported that they suffered from mild to moderate depression, 4.3% had severe depression, and over one third reported moderate to severe anxiety. 4 People with families and children tend to have a higher level of stress. 4 Another survey in China reported that COVID-19 has caused high levels of emotional stress. 5 Additionally, Gavidia illustrates that 88% of employees in an American sample reported moderate to extreme stress levels during COVID-19. 6 Similarly, the heightened sense of concerns and stress have been also reportedly experienced by healthcare workers during the MERS-CoV outbreak in Saudi Arabia, and during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. [7] [8] [9] [10] While these studies and surveys have assessed the mental health impact of MERS-CoV and COVID-19 in different countries, to our knowledge, there has not been any national assessment done on the Saudi population with regards to COVID-19. Given the cultural variations in responding to natural disasters and pandemics, it is essential to understand how Saudis particularly react to this unprecedented pandemic in order to assist government agencies and organizations in safeguarding the psychological wellbeing of the society. 11 This national, crosssectional study aims to evaluate the emotional wellbeing of the general population in Saudi Arabia.",

Qualtrics is an online survey tool that allowed us to build, distribute and analyse the survey responses. Ethics approval to conduct the study was obtained from Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group -Institutional Review Board (RC20.03.78), and this study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This was an anonymous survey that did not collect any personal details about the participants and participation was voluntary, hence consent was implied. A probability convenience sample method was employed to recruit the study participants. The convenience sample technique was considered as the most appropriate method to reach the maximum population and to enable us to explore the study phenomena and acquire information about the study area. The sampling method used was intended to allow an equal opportunity to the population to be enrolled in the study, increase the representativeness of the sample, and decrease sampling error and bias. Several measures have been taken to control biases that might arise from the sample criteria. The criteria included: 1) Living in Saudi Arabia and 18 years of age or older, 2) with no previous mental health diagnosis, and 3) can read and write Arabic.",

This was undertaken to allow the probability of the statistical test to detect the differences or relationships in the study population. The effect size referred to the degree to which the null hypothesis was not true, while the significance level was set at 0.05 so there would be only a 5% probability of getting Type I error. 12 According to Munro (2005) , medium effect size between 0.3 and 0.5 is suitable for well-defined theoretical framework studies such as the current study as many relevant studies have been conducted in the same area. [13] [14] [15] [16] Additionally, 0.80 (80%) is considered the best acceptable power for a study according to Cohen. 17 Therefore, to allow estimation of moderate size effect (\u0192 = 0.3) at a 5% significance level with 80% power, a sample size of 5000 was determined using G*Power.",

Using a cross-cultural multicenter survey approach, a validation study among Arabic-speaking nursing students to examine the psychometric testing of the AV-MHI-38 has shown good internal consistency with Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.85 and acceptable reliability measures. 15 All items are scored on a 6-point Likert scale (range 1-6) except two items scored on a 5-point Likert scale (range 1-5). The Anxiety subscale includes nine items with a possible score range between 9 and 54, in which higher scores indicate greater anxiety. The Depression subscale includes five items with a score range between 4 and 23, in which higher scores indicate greater depression. Loss of Behavioral/Emotional Control subscale includes nine items ranging from 9 to 53, with higher scores revealing a greater loss of behavioral/emotional control. In the General Positive Affect subscale, there are 10 items with a score ranging from 10 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater positive affect. The Emotional Ties and Life Satisfaction subscales have two items and one item, respectively, with scores ranging from 2 to 12 and 1 to 6, in which higher scores indicate stronger emotional ties and greater life satisfaction, respectively.",

To mitigate the issue and to maintain the scoring and validity of the scale, this item was assigned the average score (mean = 3.7) which was found in two previous studies that used Saudi samples. 15, 16 This method was preferred over mean imputation methods as the latter resulted in highly biased estimates when more than 10% of subjects had missing data. 19 Descriptive statistics, subscales, and global scales were calculated per the MHI-38 Scoring System and Procedure. 18 Backward multiple linear regression was used to find the best fitting model to identify the socio-demographic predictors of emotional wellbeing. The normality of the data was confirmed using Q-Q normality tests and histograms for all scales. All assumptions of multiple linear regression were confirmed prior to the analysis. 20 All analysis was conducted using the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences statistical software package version for Mac, version 26.0; a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

It measured the levels of anxiety, depression, behavioral control, positive affect, and general distress, so as to design strategies to alleviate and rehabilitate during this pandemic. Our findings suggest that Saudis have been found to be quite resilient to COVID-19 stress in comparison to other countries experiencing this pandemic. The data collected are somewhat surprising and counterintuitive in some aspects. It leads to the possibility of further investigation into the minds of the Saudi population to further understand what has and is contributing to their resilience. As this pandemic continues to rage, people are worried about getting infected or a loved one getting infected. Also, death numbers and the media coverage that handling the situation are potential factors that might contribute to increase the levels of anxiety and depression. However, loss of behavioral and/or emotional control can be frequent at moments such as COVID-19. In China, one study found that a low perception of being infected is significantly associated with low stress and vice versa. 4 This is supported by another 2010 H1N1 study done in Hong Kong that was able to correlate peoples' fears for either themselves or loved ones contracting the virus, which affected their threat level and therefore their emotional stress response. This Hong Kong study was focused on emotional stress levels and avoidance behaviors. It was conducted during the initial phase of the H1N1 pandemic in 2010. The study concluded that lack of adequate, clear, and concise information contributed greatly to increased emotional distress and behaviors of avoidance. Evidently, the stages of a pandemic can greatly affect emotional stress responses because of the ties to public health education levels. Concerns can be calmed when the affected population receives education about the pandemic threat including transmission, at-risk populations, symptoms, treatment, and interventional steps to take to lessen the spread and severity of the new disease. 21 In this Saudi-based study, results have shown low levels of life satisfaction, general positive affect, and emotional ties. Similar conclusions were found in China, where life satisfaction was found to be lower during COVID-19, and people presented more negative emotions. 22 However, research shows that positive feelings increase over time during natural disasters and pandemics 23, 24 due to prosocial behaviors, such as social solidarity which produces higher group cohesiveness. [23] [24] [25] During COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, positive affect and emotional ties were mild since the government made it clear that the public's health was the priority during the crisis, which may have contributed to reports of moderate life satisfaction levels. Psychological Distress, psychological wellbeing, and the Mental Health Index (MHI-38) scores were mainly moderate. Given the circumstances in Saudi Arabia, where there was an early implementation of social distancing, as the governmental focus was mainly on the public health and economic status. Make note that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy and its DovePress citizenry has not only common religious ties but also tribal ties as well as large traditional family bonds. Saudi Arabia has high literacy levels, universal healthcare that is at par with western countries, and a large interactive social media presence. This results in a high regard for authority and the ability to communicate and disseminate information easily, which then leads to high compliance with proposed preventative measures.",

Similar findings were indicated in a study where gender was a predictor of psychological distress, showing that the male gender is significantly associated with lower stress. 4 Another study found that gender, social support, and specific experiences were factors for psychological distress. 26 While a review of the literature makes it apparent that being informed, having solid communication and a feeling of governmental control over the situation is also deemed very important.",
