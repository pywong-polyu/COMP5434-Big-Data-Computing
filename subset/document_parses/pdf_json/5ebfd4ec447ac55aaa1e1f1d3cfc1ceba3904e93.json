Here, I identify a data set containing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from early in the Wuhan epidemic that has been deleted from the NIH's Sequence Read Archive. I recover the deleted files from the Google Cloud and reconstruct partial sequences of 13 early epidemic viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences in the context of carefully annotated existing data further supports the idea that the Huanan Seafood Market sequences are not fully representative of the viruses in Wuhan early in the epidemic. Instead, the progenitor of currently known SARS-CoV-2 sequences likely contained three mutations relative to the market viruses that made it more similar to SARS-CoV-2's bat coronavirus relatives.",

The first reports outside of China at the end of December 2019 emphasized the role of the Huanan Seafood Market (ProMED 2019), which was initially suggested as a site of zoonosis. However, this theory became increasingly tenuous as it was learned that many early cases had no connection to the market (Cohen 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020) . Eventually, Chinese CDC Director Gao Fu dismissed the theory, stating \"At first, we assumed the seafood market might have the virus, but now the market is more like a victim. The novel coronavirus had existed long before\" (Global Times 2020).",

The Lancet described a confirmed case having no association with the market whose symptoms began on December 1, 2019 . The South China Morning Post described nine cases from November 2019 including details on patient age and sex, noting that none were confirmed to be \"patient zero\" (Ma 2020) . Professor Yu Chuanhua of Wuhan University told the Health Times that records he reviewed showed two cases in mid-November, and one suspected case on September 29 (Health Times 2020). At about the same time as Professor Chuanhua's interview, the Chinese CDC issued an order forbidding sharing of information about the COVID-19 epidemic without approval (China CDC 2020), and shortly thereafter Professor Chuanhua recontacted the Health Times to say that the November cases could not be confirmed (Health Times 2020). Then, China's State Council issued a much broader order requiring central approval of all publications related to COVID-19 to ensure they were coordinated \"like moves in a game of chess\" (Kang, Cheng, et al. 2020) . In 2021, the joint WHO-China report dismissed all reported cases prior to December 8 as not COVID-19, reviving the theory that the virus might have originated at the Huanan Seafood Market (WHO 2021) .",

Other than a set of multiply sequenced samples collected in late December of 2019 from a dozen patients connected to the Huanan Seafood Market (WHO 2021), just a handful of Wuhan sequences are available from before late January of 2020 (see analysis in this study below). This paucity of sequences could be due in part to an order that unauthorized Chinese labs destroy all coronavirus samples from early in the outbreak, reportedly for \"laboratory biological safety\" reasons (Pingui 2020) .",

But the earliest known SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which are mostly derived from the Huanan Seafood Market, are notably more different from these bat coronaviruses than other sequences collected at later dates outside Wuhan.

Analysis of these new sequences in conjunction with careful annotation of existing ones suggests that the early Wuhan samples that have been the focus of most studies including the joint WHO-China report (WHO 2021) are not fully representative of the viruses actually present in Wuhan at that time. These insights help reconcile phylogenetic discrepancies and suggest two plausible progenitor sequences, one of which is identical to that inferred by Kumar et al. (2021) and the other of which contains the C29095T mutation. Furthermore, the approach taken here hints it may be possible to advance the understanding of SARS-CoV-2's origins or early spread even without further on-the-ground studies, such as by more deeply probing data archived by the NIH and other entities.",

The SRA files for two runs (SRR11313490 and SRR11313499) were not accessible via the Google Cloud, but after I posted the first version of this manuscript as a preprint, several individuals found archived data for these runs that had been downloaded when they were still available on the SRA, and I have used those data in the updated analysis described here (see Methods for details). I used the SRA Toolkit to get the object timestamp (vdbdump -obj_timestamp) and time (vdb-dump -info) for all SRA files. For all files, the object timestamp is February 15, 2020, and the time is March 16, 2020.

In this paper, I only analyze the region from spike through ORF10 because this is a much longer contiguous sequence and the amplicons were generated by conventional rather than nested PCR.

Table 1 also shows the mutations in each sample relative to proCoV2, which is a putative progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 inferred by Kumar et al.

This fact is perplexing because although the proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear (i.e., zoonosis versus lab accident), all reasonable explanations agree that at a deeper level the SARS-CoV-2 genome is derived from bat coronaviruses (Lytras et al. 2021) .

The earliest SARS-CoV-2 sequences were collected in Wuhan in December, but these sequences are more distant from RaTG13 than sequences collected in January from other locations in China or even other countries ( fig. 2 ). The discrepancy is especially pronounced for sequences from patients who had visited the Huanan Seafood Market (WHO 2021). All sequences associated with this market differ from RaTG13 by at least three more mutations than sequences subsequently collected at various other locations ( fig. 2) . Importantly, all these observations also hold true if SARS-CoV-2 is compared to other related bat coronaviruses (Lytras et al. 2021 ) such as RpYN06 (Zhou et al. 2021) or RmYN02 This conundrum can be visualized in a phylogenetic context by rooting a tree of early SARS-CoV-2 sequences so that the progenitor sequence is closest to the bat coronavirus outgroup. If we limit the analysis to sequences collected no later than January 2020 and remove singleton mutations observed only once in the sequence set, then there are three ways to root the tree in this fashion since there are three different sequences equally close to the outgroup ( fig. 3 and Bloom . doi:10.1093/molbev/msab246 MBE supplementary figs. S4 and S5, Supplementary Material online). Importantly, none of these rootings place any Huanan Seafood Market viruses (or other Wuhan viruses from December 2019) in the progenitor node-and only one of the rootings has any virus from Wuhan in the progenitor node (in the leftmost tree in fig. 3 , the progenitor node contains Wuhan/0126-C13/2020, which was reportedly collected on January 26, 2020). Therefore, inferences about the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 based on comparison to related bat viruses are inconsistent with other evidence suggesting that the progenitor is an early virus from Wuhan (Pipes et al. 2021) .",

Note that the lower-right point in the middle (green) panel corresponds to a sequence (Guangdong/FS-30-P00502/2020) reportedly collected in late February that is actually two mutations more similar to RaTG13 than proCoV2.

It is also possible that there was an early ascertainment bias toward market-associated viruses (clade B), since some early case definitions included exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Another explanation that I consider less plausible is offered by Garry (2021) : that there were multiple zoonoses from distinct markets, with the Huanan Seafood Market being the source of viruses in clade B, and some other market being the source of viruses that lack T8782C and C28144T ( fig. 3) . However, this explanation requires positing zoonoses in two markets by two progenitors differing by just two mutations, which seems nonparsimonious in the absence of direct evidence for zoonosis in any market. To examine if the sequences recovered from the deleted data set help resolve the conundrum described in the previous section, I repeated the analyses including those sequences. In the process, I noted another salient fact: four GISAID sequences collected in Guangdong that fall in a putative progenitor node are from two different clusters of patients who traveled to Wuhan in late December of 2019 and developed symptoms before or on the day that they returned to Guangdong, where their viruses were ultimately sequenced (Chan et al. 2020; Kang, Wu, et al. 2020 ). Since these patients were clearly infected in Wuhan even though they were sequenced in Guangdong, I annotated them separately from both the other Wuhan and other China sequences.",

The rooting of the middle tree in fig. 5 is now more consistent with the evidence that the pandemic originated in Wuhan, as half its progenitor node is derived from early Wuhan infections, which is more than any other equivalently large node. The first known sequence identical to this putative progenitor (Guangdong/HKU-SZ-002/2020) is from a patient who developed symptoms on January 4 while visiting Wuhan (Chan et al. 2020 ). This putative progenitor has three mutations toward the bat coronavirus outgroup relative to Wuhan-Hu-1 (C8782T, T28144C, and C29095T) and two mutations relative to proCoV2 (T18060C away from the outgroup and C29095T toward the outgroup). The leftmost tree in fig. 5 , which has a progenitor identical to proCoV2 (Kumar et al. 2021) , also looks plausible, with some weight from Wuhan sequences. However, analysis of this rooting is limited by the fact that the defining C18060T mutation is in a region not covered in the deleted sequences. The rightmost tree in fig. 5 looks less plausible, as it has almost no weight from Wuhan and the first sequence identical to its progenitor was not collected until January 24.",

This principle is especially likely to hold for the scenarios in fig. 5 , since there are multiple individuals infected with each putative progenitor sequence, implying multiple opportunities to transmit descendants with new mutations. Using this qualitative principle, the middle and leftmost scenarios in fig. 5 seem more plausible than the rightmost scenario, where the progenitor lacks branching descendants. I acknowledge that these arguments are purely qualitative and lack the formal statistical analysis of Worobey et al.

The deleted data and existing sequences from Wuhan-infected patients hospitalized in Guangdong show early Wuhan sequences often carried the T29095C mutation and were less likely to carry T8782C/ C28144T than sequences in the joint WHO-China report (WHO 2021). Second, given current data, there are two FIG. 4 .

            "text": "Bloom . doi:10.1093/molbev/msab246 MBE fully sequence all 34 samples rather than delete the partial sequence data. There is no obvious scientific reason for the deletion: the sequences are concordant with the samples described in Wang et al. (2020) , there are no corrections to the paper, the paper states human subjects approval was obtained, and the sequencing shows no evidence of plasmid or sample-to-sample contamination. After I e-mailed the NIH the original version of this manuscript, they sent me the email requesting deletion of the data, which is in fig. 6 . Despite the statement in the deletion-request e-mail that the sequences were being uploaded to \"another website\" (fig. 6 ), I could find no evidence that they were actually uploaded to any other public website-and certainly they were not posted to GISAID, NCBI, or any database used by the joint WHO-China report. Therefore, even though the sequencing data were listed in a table in the Small paper by Wang et al. (2020) , the practical consequence of removing the data from the SRA was that nobody was aware these sequences existed. Notably, it is not possible to delete preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv, so once Wang et al. (2020) had posted their preprint, it was permanently committed to the public record (withdrawn preprints are still accessible, for instance see Yang et al. 2020) . Particularly in light of the directive that labs destroy early samples (Pingui 2020 ) and multiple orders requiring approval of publications on COVID-19 (China CDC 2020; Kang, Cheng, et al. 2020) , the deletion of the data from the SRA suggests a less than wholehearted effort to maximize the availability of information about viral sequences from early in the Wuhan epidemic.",

Future studies should devote equal effort to going beyond the annotations in GISAID to carefully trace the location of patient infection and sample sequencing.

Further application of more advanced methods would be a welcome advance. However, qualitative and visual analyses do have advantages when the key questions relate more to the underlying data than the sophistication of the inferences.

The trees are identical except they are rooted to make the progenitor each of the three sequences with highest identity to the RaTG13 bat coronavirus outgroup. Nodes are shown as pie charts with areas proportional to the number of observations of that sequence and colored by where the viruses were collected. The mutations on each branch are labeled, with mutations toward the nucleotide identity in the outgroup in purple. The labels at the top of each tree give the first known virus identical to each putative progenitor, as well as mutations in that progenitor relative to proCoV2(Kumar et al. 2021) and Wuhan-Hu-1. The monophyletic group containing C28144T is collapsed into a node labeled \"clade B\" in concordance with the naming scheme of Rambaut et al.(2020); this clade contains Wuhan-Hu-1. Singleton mutations (mutations observed only once in the sequence set) are removed as described in more detail in the Methods. Supplementary figs.

First, I annotated sequences based on the joint WHO-China report (WHO 2021) and also Zhu et al. (2020) to keep only one representative from multiply sequenced patients and to indicate which sequences were from patients associated with the Huanan Seafood Market. My version of these annotations is at https://github.com/ jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/blob/main/data/WHO_ China_Report_Dec2019_cases.yaml. Next, I identified some sequences in the set that were clearly duplicates from the same patient, and removed these. The annotations used to remove these duplicates are at https://github.com/ jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/blob/main/data/seqs_ to_exclude.yaml. Finally, I used information from Chan et al. (2020) and Kang, Wu, et al. (2020) to identify patients who were infected in Wuhan before January 5, 2020, but ultimately sequenced in Guangdong: these annotations are at https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/ blob/main/data/Wuhan_exports.yaml. I next removed any of the handful of mutations noted by Turakhia et al. (2020) to be lab artifacts that commonly afflict Recovery of Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 Sequences . doi:10.1093/molbev/msab246",
