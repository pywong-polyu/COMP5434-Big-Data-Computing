The studies with and without face shield in both an infected and healthy person have been considered in indoor environment simulation. In addition to the influence of the face shield and the synchronization of the breathing process while using the device, we also simulated the effect of small air movements on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate (outdoor environment simulation). The contact with infectious particles in the case without a face shield was 12-20 s (s), in the presence of at least one person who was positive for SARS-CoV-2. If the infected person wore a face shield, no contact with contaminated air was observed during the entire simulation time (80 s). The time of contact with contaminated air (infection time) decreases to about 11 s when the surrounding air is still and begins to move at a low speed. Qualitative differences between simulations performed on the patients with and without the face shield are clearly visible. The maximum prevention of contagion is probably a consequence of wearing a face shield by an infected person. Our results suggest that it is possible to determine contact with air contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 using the CFD method under realistic conditions for virtually any situation and configuration. The proposed method is probably the fastest and most reliable among those based on CFD-based techniques.",

The effectiveness of these methods mainly depends on the infectious agent. In 2019/2020, humanity has met a novel type of cronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 (Krajewska et al., 2020) . The above-described methods and strict hand hygiene were proven to be still valid in reducing the spread of this infection (Farneti et al., 2020; O) O. (2020) . Modes o, 2020) . However, in the 21st century, it is impossible to completely isolate people, leading to potentially serious social, economic and political consequences. There are several routes of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission: airborne, droplet and fomite (Krajewska et al., 2020; Pi\u0105tkowski et al., 2020; National Center for Immun, 2020; Covid-O. (2020) . Advic, 2020; O)O. (2020) . Coronav (2020) ; Borro et al. (2021) . The issue of what distance should be kept between people remains controversial. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends keeping a distance of at least 1 m from each other during the COVID lockdown, although the large droplets can travel as far as 8 m (Covid-O. (2020) . Ad1vic, 2020; Meselson, 2020; WHO, 2020) . This fact suggests that the use of goggles, face shield and face masks in combination with maintaining distance could contribute to a significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the environment.",

Despite the lack of evidence of face masks' effectiveness in preventing viral infection, pandemic strategies in many countries include recommendations to wear face masks in public places Eikenberry et al., 2020; Goh et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2020) .

The indoor simulation shows the influence of the face shield and the synchronization of the breathing cycles. In contrast, the outdoor simulation illustrates the effect of a slight air movement on the viral particle spread. The time of the viral particle spread was reduced to about 12 s (s) with asynchronous breathing. If the infected person wore a face shield, no contact with contaminated air was observed during the entire simulation time of 80 s. When the volume fraction of infectious particles in the inhaled air was >0, it was assumed to be the potential infection moment. Under the considered conditions and in the mutual positioning of people, as in Fig. 2 , the volume fraction's maximum values reach 4%. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the time of contact with infectious particles (infection time) when the surrounding air is still and begins to move at a low speed of 0.1 m s \u2212 1 . When air flows towards a healthy person, the infection time decreases to about 11 s. Notably, a much more extensive volume fraction of infected air with infectious particles is visible, which is an order higher than in the case of still air. While in the first case, the maximum values of the coefficient reached 4%, in the second case these values reached as high as 30%.",

All meshes can be classified as Cartesian (hexahedra dominant). Fig. 5 shows the volume fraction of infected air inhaled by a healthy person as a function of time for different mesh sizes ranging from 4.8 to 9.9 \u00d7 10 6 nodes. Moving averages of the volume fraction are also superimposed where the time of averaging corresponds to a typical breath period, i.e., 4 s. Increasing the number of nodes above 9.2 \u00d7 10 6 (i.e., fine mesh; Fig. 6 ) has a negligible effect on the results. What is more, the onset infection starts at the same time, regardless of the mesh. However, there are differences in the volume fraction coefficient during the simulation: the worse the mesh, the smaller the coefficient values. Fig. 7 shows the influence of the time step on the value of the volume fraction coefficient of infected air inhaled by a healthy person. As before, the onset of infection occurs simultaneously, and the longer the time steps are, the more the initial volume fraction values are over-predicted. The comparison was made for the finest mesh. The computation time for the finest mesh and the shortest time step (0.002 s) was approximately 7 days on two Xeon 5120 2.2 GHz processors (26 out of 28 cores involved). This time was reduced to two and a half days for a time step of 0.006 s with the same computational mesh.",

In our study, numerical analysis of the effect of wearing a face shield on the hypothesized airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was performed using the CFD method.

Epidemiologists' recommendations regarding the social distance, wearing face masks and hand disinfection should be contrasted with the increase in the number of cases observed in recent weeks in most European countries (so-called \"second wave\" of COVID-19 infections). So does a \"safe social distance\" actually exist? Is it a matter of \"when\" instead of \"if\" we become infected? The enormous political pressure to re-open the economy, cultural activity, and schools seem to have not survived the test of time. A separate issue is the concept of \"infection,\" an complicated, multi-factorial process that depends on the pathogen (e.g. its virulence, particle size, penetration depth, the massiveness of contact) and the infected person (e.g. immune status, comorbidities). The term \"time of infection\" should be supplemented with the term \"contact time\" with the microorganism (Abkarian et al., 2020) . In this sense, both social distance and contact time have two aspects: indoor and outdoor environments.",

Other authors report that the infectivity of viruses in the exhaled air may persist for up to 16 h (Fears et al., 2020) .

The investigated system simulates staying in a shared air-conditioned room while maintaining social distance without the PPE (e.g. restaurant, school, public transport, shopping mall, cinema, hotel, cruise ship, conference room). Moreover, attention should be paid to the almost 8-fold increase (4% vs. 30%) in the air exhaled by a COVID-19 positive in the air inhaled by a healthy person, observed in our research. The experiment demonstrates that the introduction of air conditioning, air purifiers, dust extractors, or other mechanical devices releasing air movement may increase infections among people staying indoors. Our results are consistent with the observations of other authors (Lu et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Moriarty et al., 2020) .",

Their use has at least two dimensions: qualitative cover (a reduction (e.g., surgical masks) or elimination (PPF-2, -3 masks) of virus spread) and directional cover (elimination or control of possible leaks) (Viola et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2020) . In our model the face shield was potentially infected and simply modulated the flow of the exhaled air. We found that in the indoor setting it was effective in both synchronous and asynchronous breathing. The face shield perfectly protects, first of all, the horizontal direction \"straight-ahead\", and it is dangerous when the infected person using it stands (bends) over the healthy person. When worn by an infected person, the face shield protects the environment however it does not protect the healthy person in any way. Thus, medical staff should contact people with COVID (+) or COVID (\u2212 ) using these safeguards. Moreover, in our study we did not observe any redirection of the exhaled air stream towards the back, coronary, or sideways, which in reality depends on the head position in relation to the body. Viola et al. also raise the problem of the accuracy of wearing the masks (covering both the nose and mouth) and the fact that coughing or sneezing may \"detach\" the mask from the face, causing it to leak (Viola et al., 2020) .",
