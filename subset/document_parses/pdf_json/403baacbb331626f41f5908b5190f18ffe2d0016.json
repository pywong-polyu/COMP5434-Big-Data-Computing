            "text": "Background: Although pharmacists are trusted and easily accessible by the public, their role in changing health behaviours related to breast cancer has been rarely investigated. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of pharmacist-based coaching in improving BC-related health behaviors and knowledge in females, and to measure the comfort level toward this program. Methods: This was a randomized controlled study carried out in community pharmacies in Egypt. Pharmacies included were asked to enroll 240 females into a trial, then equally allocate them into either active or control arms, and provide 12 weekly face-to-face coaching sessions to those assigned to the active arm. Pharmacists were also asked to survey females and fill a standardized data collection form at baseline, in the middle of coaching, at the end of coaching, and three months after coaching. Results: The proportions of doing high physical activity, practicing healthy diet, and practicing breast self-exam three months after the end of coaching programme across the active and control arms were 52.17% versus 17.09% (p=0.002), 62.60% versus 28.20% (p=0.003), and 81.73% versus 23.07% (p=0.005), respectively. The mean scores of knowledge on BC symptoms, risk factors, and detection methods three months after coaching across the active and control arms were 4.10\u00b12.47 versus 2.72\u00b11.19 (p=0.038), 4.25\u00b12.20 versus 3.28\u00b11.48 (p=0.020), and .34\u00b11.80 versus 1.72\u00b10.68 (p=0.001) respectively. While most of the females participated in the active arm were comfortable toward the financial 94.78% and social 88.69% sides of the program, more than one-third (34.78%) of the participants were uncomfortable toward the competency of coaches. Conclusion: Despite the need for some modifications, BC-related health behaviors and knowledge can be improved through pharmacist-based health coaching.",

            "text": "Breast cancer (BC) is a global health issue, predominantly affecting women, accounting for a quarter of the new cancer diagnoses worldwide, and leading to high mortality rates, especially in low-income countries. BC may cause long-term consequences, such as chronic pain, functional and cognitive disorders, and sexual incompetence. Additionally, it can increase the risk for other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes. In Egypt, BC is the second most common diagnosed cancer, accounts for roughly one-fifth of the new Egyptian cancer cases. 1 The most distinguish feature of BC in Egypt is that most new diagnoses are for young females, 2 which is concerning, given the lower survival rate and seriousness of the disease in such age groups. 3 Early BC detection through regular screening could be helpful in increasing the odds of complete recovery and reducing severity of negative consequences. 4 Additionally, behavior changes including moderate to high physical activity, healthy diet, avoiding inappropriate medicines, and smoking cessation can lower the risk for BC occurrence and reoccurrence. 5 A previous systemic review comprising 17 observational studies on breast cancer prognosis reported up to 51% reduction in mortality rates when patients with high and low physical activity were compared. 6 Despite the availability of advanced information on BC prevention and management, the global incidence of the disease is still high and many patients reach advanced stages and probably die. 7 This could be attributed to several factors. First, because public' exposure to traditional awareness-raising campaigns is limited to fragments of BC information without focusing on key elements of behavior change, the outcomes of these campaigns are limited. Second, while some authors suggested remote educational approaches to prevent BC using new technologies such as social media, these approaches cannot be generalized to populations who do not have access to these technologies and even to an internet connection. 8 Third, because of lack of trust in behavior change recommendations or limited financial abilities, women are poorly adherent to behavior change recommendations.",

In fact, this strategy empowers patient to take control of the decision they make as well as encourages them to deeply interact with their coaches. 9 Unlike other healthcare professionals, community pharmacists are well positioned to deliver health coaching within an environment filled with a trusting atmosphere. Furthermore, given the flexible nature of pharmacists' workplace and roles, and in many cases lack of private spots, time constraints and accessibility issue, which are main barriers in physician-based health coaching, 10 may have a minimum influence on the feasibility and effectiveness of pharmacist-based health coaching.",

The principle of behavior change was explained to pharmacists using the COM-B model, 13 which asserts that effective behavior change can occur only after considering the interconnection between the following key elements:",

For practical purposes and to maintain strong communication between coaches and females, each pharmacist was asked to coach females he or she originally recruited. The coaching programme included three main components. First, coaches conveyed evidence-based coaching, which focused on the symptoms, risk factors, methods of detection and diagnosis, prognosis, and severity of breast cancer. Females were coached to do breast self-exam (BSE)based on guidelines issued by the American cancer society (ACS). 14 Second, coaches encouraged females to connect their health objectivesto what they value the most in life. Third, coaches helped females to set realistic goals, which are prevention of breast cancer or early detection of the disease. To achieve these components, a supportive environment for authentic communication between coaches and females was created. For examples, to avoid the impact of stigma on females' involvement in the study, all coaches were females.",

These changes were sustained three months after coaching. These findings were most likely related to the elements of coaching presented to females. For example, in addition to the benefits of these behaviors, females were coached how to practically implement these behaviors to their lives with minimum consuming of their time, money, and social connections. This might have contributed to sustaining the improvements in these behaviors. Although the use of hormonal contraceptives was considerably reduced at the end of coaching, this change was not sustained three months after coaching. The reasons behind this finding could be the fears of financial consequences of pregnancy and absence of effective and feasible replacement for hormonal contraceptives. Nonetheless, coaches shed light on alternatives of hormonal contraceptives. Our findings align with a previous study that reported a significant impact for nurse-based online telephone coaching on physical activity and diet of BC survivors. 17 However, sustaining behavioural changes was a common challenge. Jane Ogden et al, 18 suggested three factors that should be met to sustain behavioural changes. First, disrupting the function of the unhealthy behaviour and reflecting the function of the healthy behaviour into the learner's mind. Second, learners need to feel that their choice to practice the unhealthy behaviour has been reduced. Third, learners need to feel their adherence to behavioral change model. The findings of this study indicated that our coaching programme had no significant influence on smoking rate and mammogram testing rate. This could be attributed to the low prevalence of smoking among the study sample. Additionally, mammogram tests are expensive in Egypt and only performed for females with suspected BC symptoms and those with high risk factors.",

The coaching programme implemented in our study significantly increased the proportions of all knowledge-related items of females in the active arm. However, only the mean scores of knowledge on BC symptoms and detection methods were sustained. The plausible explanation for this finding is that because early detection of BC can potentially increase the chance of survival and reduce the cost of treatment, 21 females enrolled in the active arm were extensively coached how to practice BSE and discover the symptoms that may indicate the occurrence of BC. Furthermore, they were trained how to approach and consult healthcare professionals on BC issues without any fears or concerns. 22 investigated the effectiveness of community-based BC educational approach in the New York state and suggested that this tool can improve the awareness of understudied females toward BC prevention. Nevertheless, the generalization of these findings is far-fetched given that public' involvement in these interventions is an untested issue. Mohsen Rezaeian and his colleagues 23 tested the impact of Health belief models (HBM) on BC-related knowledge of females above aged above 40 and claimed that this approach demonstrated a considerable efficacy. However, it is extremely difficult to make an accurate judgment on the efficacy of an educational approach without testing the sustainability of its findings, especially when testing the HBM, which the emotional, social, and cultural preferences of patients are not a priority. 24 Additionally, the comfort levels of participants were not measured in the above studies.",
