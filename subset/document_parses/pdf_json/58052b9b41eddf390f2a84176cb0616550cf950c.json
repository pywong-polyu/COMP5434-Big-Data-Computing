Despite testing negative four times for coronavirus disease infection by nasopharyngeal swab reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, her clinical symptoms of hypoxaemic respiratory failure and radiological findings on computed tomography pulmonary angiogram were consistent with coronavirus disease pneumonia. Although she made a quick recovery in the intensive care unit with a combination of empirical antibiotics, corticosteroids, high flow nasal oxygen, therapeutic anticoagulation and awake semi proning, her protracted hospital course due to persistent sinus tachycardia remained challenging. A diagnosis of potential postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome was explored during the acute phase of illness following an active stand test and exclusion of other causes. She was treated with beta blockers as she failed to improve with non-pharmacological measures. We searched for similar cases by analysing the literature databases. Our case aims to stress the importance of recognising and treating patients with negative nasal reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction swabs as coronavirus disease infection, especially if there is strong evidence of clinical and radiological findings where diagnosis is often under recognised in asthmatics with intellectual disability.",

Among 62.4% adults tested for COVID-19, only 11 tested positive, confirming an overall infection rate of 2.5%. A total of 61 (8.6%) participants had a history of lung disease/asthma. The most common COVID-19-like symptoms reported by participants were fever (57.7%), cough (43.7%), fatigue (12.7%) and shortness of breath (9.9%). The report highlighted high rates of comorbid health conditions which can lead to poorer outcomes for COVID-19, although no deaths were reported at the time. 4 Failure to recognise symptoms in individuals with asthma and intellectual disability is not uncommon as evident from our case. There is a trivial overlap of non-specific symptoms and limited case references detailing asthma exacerbations as a result of COVID-19 infection. Different hypotheses including altered T1-type immunity, mucus hypersecretion reducing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the distal lung, different asthma phenotypes and adherence to asthma therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids allude to reduced COVID-19 symptoms and lower mortality risk. 5 In addition, there is paucity of literature exploring implications and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with intellectual disabilities.",

            "text": "Multiple studies have reported negative nasal RT-PCR swabs due to sampling errors or as a result of collection of specimens from the upper respiratory tract. [6] [7] [8] The false-negative rate in our medical facility is between 1% and 2% and PCR results are interpreted with caution especially if clinical and radiological findings were suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia. It is now not unusual to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia on individuals testing negative on RT-PCR for the virus. As per Hase et al., 9 a diagnosis of COVID-19 could be considered if the clinical and radiological evidence strongly point towards the infection, and bronchoalveolar lavage samples could be analysed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus, as lower respiratory tract specimens harbour the virus for a longer duration when compared to the upper respiratory tract. As per Lu et al., 10 it is vital to understand that RT-PCR only detects samples with high RNA reactivity (viral load). Patients go on to have hypoxaemic respiratory failure secondary to inflammatory cytokines released by the virus, that is, cytokine storm. 11 Diagnosis of dysautonomia syndrome such as POTS requires extensive clinical and diagnostic evaluation. POTS is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of chronic symptoms. These include (1) OI, (2) heart rate of 120 bpm or an increase in heart rate by \u2a7e30 bpm within 10 min of assuming an upright posture and (3) absence of orthostatic hypotension (a decrease in blood pressure > 20/10 mmHg). 12, 13 Some authors suggest POTS can be experienced weeks to months following triggers such as viral illness, that is, SARS-CoV as noted in our case. 14, 15 There are various pathophysiological mechanisms for developing OI in POTS. One mechanism broadly described is cardiovascular deconditioning following prolonged bed rest, resulting in cardiac atrophy, and subsequent physical deconditioning. Reversibility is attainable with graduated physical activity which increases myocardial mass and cardiac output. Other mechanisms described include hyperadrenergic stimulation, autoimmunity, autonomic dysfunction, anxiety and hypovolaemia. The most morbid consequence of POTS universally is physical deconditioning secondary to OI. Engagement with structured exercise regimens, in which patients are encouraged to incorporate and continue indefinitely throughout their lifestyle, plays a vital role in the road to recovery. 13, 16 In our patient's case, merely sitting up from a supine position provoked a rise in heart rate by at least 26 bpm, which further increased to heart rate >30 bpm at 2, 5 and 10 min intervals of standing ( Figure 3 ) with no significant orthostatic hypotension. It is highly plausible that she may have experienced an overlap between sinus tachycardia caused by provoked PE and POTS during the course of her illness. However, her post-viral recovery stand test necessitated further evaluation to exclude POTS. Following the absence of abnormal echocardiogram findings, thyroid dysfunction, vasculitis and rhythm disturbances, a possible diagnosis of POTS was established with a positive active stand test and 10-min walk test. In our case, the patient reconditioned by engaging with the physiotherapist on most days of her inpatient rehabilitation. We were unable to pursue the gold standard head-up tilt-table test due to the patient's noncompliance to proceed with further investigations or physiotherapy sessions in the outpatient setting.",
