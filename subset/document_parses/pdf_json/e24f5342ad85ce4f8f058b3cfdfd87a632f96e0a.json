The majority of reports focus on the presence of viral DNA ignoring proof of viral RNAs as important markers for viral activity. During this study, we established (RT-) qPCR to characterize expression of B19V RNAs (NS1 and VP1/2) in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) of 576 patients with unexplained heart failure. 403/576 (70%) EMBs were positive for B19V DNA. B19V mRNAs NS1 and/or VP1/2, indicating viral activity, could be detected in 38.5% of B19V DNA positive samples using the newly established B19V RT-PCRs. 22.1% of samples were characterized by only NS1 mRNA detection while 6.0% revealed only VP1/2 mRNA expression. Detection of both intermediates was successful in 10.4% of samples. Applying the molecular testing, our study revealed that a high proportion (38.5%) of B19V DNA positive EMBs was characterized by viral transcriptional activity. Further prospective studies will evaluate relevance of viral transcription intermediates as a diagnostic marker to differentiate between latent B19V infection and clinically relevant transcriptionally active B19V-infection of the heart muscle.",

Transcription activity is driven by a single promoter sequence (P6) while enhancer sequences upstream of the P6 promoter region recruit different cellular transcription factors 13 . From a single precursor (pre-) mRNA, 12 mature mRNAs are generated through alternative splicing that coordinates polyadenylation 14 . B19V infection induces a cell cycle arrest at late S phase and induces DNA damage response which will supply enzymes that facilitate B19V replication 15 . The expression of B19V transcription intermediates depends on splicing and polyadenylation efficiency and thus it depends on host cell factors. In semi-permissive cells, such as endothelial cells, transcripts are polyadenylated at polyadenylation site proximal (pA)p leading to an increased expression of NS1 intermediates. In permissive cells, however the blockade at (pA)p is overcome by replication of the viral genome in the late phase of infection and readthrough (pA)p leads to expression of VP1/2 16 . Cardiomyocytes cannot be infected by B19V 8 . Host cell tropism of B19V is restricted to erythroid progenitor cells. Since endothelial cells of the myocardium express the primary erythrovirus receptor, the P-antigen, and co-receptors such as integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and KU80, infection with B19V of these semi-permissive cells leads to an incomplete viral replication cycle 17 . Due to the absence of certain host cell factors, B19V is not able to complete the viral replication cycle in endothelial cells, and thus no infectious progeny virions are produced 18 . Instead, infection of endothelial cells leads to endothelial dysfunction 18 . Several mechanisms may explain B19V mediated cytotoxicity, such as direct damage through the NS1 endonuclease domain or upregulation of pro-apoptotic signalling molecules e.g. TNF\u03b1 or IL-6 19, 20 . Furthermore, the VP1-unique region exerts phospholipase A2 activity that promotes inflammatory signalling and impairs endothelial function 21 . In addition, NS1 transactivates viral and host gene expression and is essential for viral replication due to its DNA nickase and helicase activity.",

A representative image of agarose gel electrophoresis of a B19V DNA and RNApositive EMB using VP1/2 specific nPCR primers was shown (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S1 , Table 2 ). The amplicon was detectable after DNA extraction (Fig. 1B lane 6) and after RNA extraction, DNAse treatment and reverse transcription (Fig. 1B lane 7) . No amplicon was detectable when DNAse treatment after DNA extraction was applied (Fig. 1B lane 5) . After RNA extraction and RNAse treatment and reverse transcription PCR, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ no amplicon was detectable ( Fig. 1B lane 4) . The negative control ( Fig. 1B lane 3 ) and the positive control with detectable amplicon at 173bps (Fig. 1B lane 2) were shown. Therefore, the DNAse treatment ensured that no DNA contamination is present in the sample after RNA extraction (Fig. 1B) . A representative agarose gel of 10 EMBs following VP1 nPCR was shown (Fig. 1C) . For each EMB, the viral DNA (first lane) and RNA (second lane) were shown (Fig. 1C) . Whereas EMBs 1, 6, 8, 9, and 10 were positive for viral DNA, EMBs 3 and 5 were positive for both, viral RNA and DNA (Fig. 1C ). EMBs 2, 4, and 7 were virus negative without any viral DNA nor RNA being detectable (Fig. 1C) . A serial dilution of the control plasmid (pParvovirus B19) ranging from 16,000 to 0.16 GE/\u00b5l demonstrated the performance of the NS1 qPCR ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). In each dilution stage, four replicates were measured and the mean value of corresponding Ct values \u00b1 SD were calculated ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Successful NS1 detection was verified by VP1/2 PCR detection showing identical viral loads. B19V detection in EMBs of patients with unexplained heart failure. The majority of EMBs (70%; n = 403) of the total cohort (N = 576) showed B19V positive genome detection (DNA) using B19V-specific PCR (Fig. 2) . B19V RNA detection using RT-qPCR assays revealed that 155/403 (38.5%) of analysed EMBs with detectable B19V DNA were positive for B19V RNA ( Fig. 2A) . 248/403 (61.5%) of these EMBs were characterized ",

Since the first description of B19V as a cardiotropic pathogen in dogs and later on in humans, the clinical relevance of B19V infection of the heart muscle is a matter of discussion until to date 24 . However, since fulminant acute B19V infection in acute myocarditis can be causative for the heart disease is unquestionable, B19V infection in chronic myocarditis or DCM is still being discussed controversially [10] [11] [12] . Routine molecular diagnostic of cardiotropic pathogens is done using PCR techniques. However, B19V infection of the heart muscle is diagnosed only by B19V genome detection that cannot differentiate between latent and active B19V infection. B19V transcription intermediates such as B19V RNAs can therefore serve as markers of viral activity. Hence, we developed a new molecular approach to determine and quantify B19V RNAs in EMBs of patients with unexplained heart failure. Detection of B19V RNAs can differentiate between latent and active infection and therefore may serve as a marker for clinically relevant infection of the heart muscle.",

A previous meta-analysis revealed that the overall detection rate of B19V genomes by PCR in different tissue types was 44.8% as summarized from 18 studies 4 . Since B19V prevalence increases with age, the rate of persistently infected individuals will be affected by the mean age of the sample population. A seroprevalence of 78% has been reported for individuals > 50 years of age that corresponds well to the data of our study population (mean age 53.6 \u00b1 15.7 years) 2 . However, the high detection rate of active viral transcription by RT-qPCR (38.5% of all B19V positive EMBs) has not been reported before. We could also show that it was crucial to search for both replication intermediates in EMBs, the NS1 and VP1/2 viral RNAs. For that reason, our data demonstrated that for NS1 and VP1/2 RNAs in 57.4% and 15.5%, respectively, of B19V-positive EMBs an active viral transcription will remain undetected if only VP1/2 or NS1 intermediates are detected during molecular diagnostics using our newly established molecular approach. Left or right ventricular catheterization did not bias detection rate or viral load of B19V. Results were in accordance with a previous study reporting no significant difference in B19V genome detection rate when left and right ventricular EMBs were analysed in parallel 26 .",

EMBs from healthy donors were not available for ethical reasons in the present study and comparison of B19V transcriptional activity between control and cardiac patients is pending and will be accomplished in future studies. The high number of B19V genome detection both, in healthy controls and in EMBs from patients with myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy, may be due to the fact that up to 70% of healthy individuals suffered from a past B19V infection depending on progressing age 1,28 . However, viral genomes in all tissues including the heart muscle will not be cleared following infection but remain generally as a latent infection 1 . The expression of viral transcription intermediates represents a distinct entity of the disease with clinical consequences for the patient. From a cohort of 416 B19V DNA positive cardiac patients, in only a small fraction (15.9%) active viral transcription was detectable 31 . Bock et al. reported that viral transcripts were only detectable in patients with myocardial inflammation and were absent in persistently infected patients without viral transcription 12 . Viral transcription might be associated with local increase in inflammatory signalling while triggering of signalling cascades may lead to increased expression of IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 19, 20, 32 . Since detection of B19V genomes is a common finding in various diseases, the viral activity as measured by transcription of viral mRNAs, will be of potential diagnostic relevance. We hypothesize that reduced LVEF at baseline of patients presenting with viral transcription activity compared to latently infected or virus free patients might be associated with pathogenic effects of B19V transcription activity. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ However, this finding must be confirmed by further prospective studies also assessing long-term effects of B19V in the myocardium. Variation in viral loads and viral RNA expression among samples were observed which may be attributed to different phases of the B19V replication cycle. As we could demonstrate here, the highest amount of viral DNA was found in those samples when both viral RNAs, NS1 and VP1/2, or only VP1/2-RNA were detectable (Fig. 3C ). This finding is in line with few studies that used both, capsid (VP1/2) and non-structural protein (NS1) specific sequences to detect B19V genomes by PCR, while discrepancies in the detection rate were reported 4 . Furthermore, our analysis revealed that EMBs of patients with active transcription demonstrated a significantly increased viral load (Fig. 3B ). This result is in agreement with a previous study by Kuehl et al. showing that the expression of viral VP1/2 intermediates lead to significant increase in viral genomes while a correlation between the number of viral RNA transcripts and the viral genome copy number was observed 31 .",

Parvoviral replication is limited to erythroid progenitor cells in vivo and to certain cell types in vitro. Therefore, infection of endothelial cells does not lead to a productive infection. As a consequence, VP1/2 expression is low and NS1 is expressed at a higher rate 34 . Accumulation of NS1 may trigger the hosts' immune response leading to auto-immunity that could be responsible for cardiac damage and clinical symptoms. Endothelial dysfunction then leads to secondary necrosis of myocardial cells 29 . Furthermore, NS1 exhibits cytotoxicity through mitochondriamediated reactive oxygen species accumulation and apoptosis. For porcine parvovirus, it has been reported that NS1 expression leads to a downregulation of antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and enhanced expression of proapoptotic molecules Bax, P21, and P53 35 . In addition, a direct damage of B19V in vivo might be possible through its NS1 endonuclease function 36 .",

Expression of HPRT was measured using predesigned primers and probe (TaqMan gene expression assay; Hs99999909_m1) (Applied Biosystems, Germany) and therefore also served as an internal quality control for extraction efficiency or possible sample degradation. Serial dilutions (25-2 ng/\u00b5l) of reverse transcribed Total RNA Control (Human) (Applied Biosystems, Germany) were used to quantify HPRT expression. The PCR reaction was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA). For qPCR of NS1 the following reaction conditions were used: initial denaturation for 10\u2032 at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation for 15\u2033 at 95 \u00b0C and a combined annealing and extension step for 60\u2033 at 60 \u00b0C.",
