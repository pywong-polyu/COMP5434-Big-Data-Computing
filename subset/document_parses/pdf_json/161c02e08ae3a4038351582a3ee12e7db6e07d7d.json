Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources.",

The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

[15] use bibliometric analysis with heat maps, pie charts, and bar graphs to describe COVID-19 research areas and their relative importance. Others combine bibliometrics with text mining. Hossain [16] does this, using bibliometrics combined with text mining for word co-occurrence and factorial analysis of the top keywords visualised in network diagrams and dendrograms. Similarly (to Hossain) Aguado-Cort\u00e9s & Casta\u00f1o [4] use bibliometrics and concurrence of keywords with network diagrams to visualise the analysis. Fister et al. [10] use association rule text mining [3] , then analyse word relationships and employ bar chart and word cloud visualisations. Wang et al. [24] create an application which uses distantly supervised named entity recognition [25] and facilitates text queries. It visualises query results with a doughnut chart. One study by Domingo-Fernandez et al. [9] took a subset of the literature focusing on drug targets, generated a network graph by manually annotating evidence text from the corpus with Biological Expression Language (BEL) and explored the network graph with web applications built for the task. Lastly, Ahamed & Samad [5] use a method of topic analysis where topics are identified using betweenness centrality measurement [12] .",

The topics can be interrogated intuitively to reveal more detail, and further visualised with a word cloud and a trend chart showing how the volume of research in that topic has changed over time. Our method which we describe in Section 2, uses a pipeline perfected over recent years allowing a rapid and efficient generation of a newly updated visualisation as the corpus grows and develops, thus allowing efficient and timely updating of the visualisation.",

We first computed the hierarchical topic similarities using the cosine distance between the topics' document vectors, and agglomerative clustering with a complete linkage criterion [23] . Then, the bubble treemap placement algorithm on this hierarchy allowed us to position similar topics next to one another. We used the sum of each topic weights across publications to set the bubble sizes, showing the topics relative importance in the dataset. To represent our two-level topic hierarchy, we first mapped the main topic model, the resulting visualisations for both datasets are shown in Figure 3 . Then, for each main topic, we grouped the associated sub-topics and mapped these groups independently from one another. It resulted as a set of sub-maps, each accessible from their main topic. Finally, this automated methodology allowed us to quickly abstract and visualise the content of thousands of research publications on COVID-19 and coronaviruses.

In Figure 10a , we see how both main and sub-topics featuring Wuhan and China display a trend showing publication volumes peaking in March and dropping back in April. Then, if we examine the sub-topics of the Model-Case-Number main topic, we can see that the publication volumes trend for the sub-topic featuring Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy rose and levelled off (Figure 10b ). For the Europe sub-topic (Italy-Spain-France-Germany), the publication volumes rose and have kept rising. Lastly, the India sub-topic shows publication volumes which are just beginning to rise. Using topic modelling on large corpora, combined with trend analysis, we can see how scientists have followed the progress of the pandemic through their publications. The interface, moreover, can help predict the trends in other countries and discover exciting movements in the relevance of other various research topics of the pandemic.
