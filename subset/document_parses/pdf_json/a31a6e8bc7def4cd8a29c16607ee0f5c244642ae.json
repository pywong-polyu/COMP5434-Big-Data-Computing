            "text": "Healthcare systems worldwide are currently facing major challenges because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, for instance, hospital inpatient and intensive care bed capacity, as well as mutations that pose a threat to global immunisation efforts. 1 However, little is known about the disease mechanisms associated with COVID-19, and although vaccines have been developed, the long-term effectiveness of vaccines is still unknown. 2,3 Therefore, COVID-19 management strategies should aim to reduce transmission, promote disease control, and facilitate self-monitoring within the population. This includes encouraging individuals to stay home as much as possible and promoting the practice of social distancing to prevent transmission and protect community health. 4, 5 In this regard, mobile health (mHealth) technologies serve as supportive tools. mHealth may facilitate self-monitoring among users who have been staying home and COVID-19-positive patients with mild symptoms who have been instructed to self-quarantine at home. 4, 6 Smartphones utilise high-quality technology and provide suitable platforms for the collection of real-time data, which users can store and share. 7, 8 Further advantages of mHealth interventions include cost-effectiveness to implement, as mHealth interventions are available to a large number of people because of a high number of individuals with internet-enabled devices. 9 In addition, past studies have found that individuals living in the Western world are increasingly willing to use mobile phone applications to manage their health. [9] [10] [11] [12] Globally, several COVID-19-specific mHealth applications have been developed. 13, 14 These applications focus on different strategies: contact tracing/exposure notification, symptom monitoring and information provision. 15 Most mHealth applications assess the symptoms experienced by users. This study was a part of conceptual progress in the development of an application (CoronaMonitor) that monitors objective COVID-19-related physical signs in users. 16 Most of the other available COVID-19-specific applications focus on subjective symptoms. This study aimed to facilitate further development and integration of this application. We aimed to examine user perspectives and identify the motivators and barriers associated with the use of applications that monitor COVID-19-related signs within the Danish context. Specifically, we examined how such applications help individuals manage and monitor their condition. We also aimed to identify discrepancies between user expectations and developer design perspectives to determine if their visions were aligned.",

Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted to examine user expectations regarding applications that monitor COVID-19related physical signs and developer expectations in Denmark. This article has been prepared in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (Appendix 1). 17 The CoronaMonitor application This study was a part of conceptual progress in the development of the theory-based CoronaMonitor application, which monitors objective COVID-19-related physical signs in users. The application was developed as a collaboration between electronics engineers, scholars, physicians and nurses. Both symptoms and signs are abnormalities that are indicative of an underlying medical condition. Whereas signs are objective evidence of an underlying disease that can be observed by others, symptoms are subjective evidence rooted solely in patient experiences. 16 The main symptoms of COVID-19 are cough, feelings of warmth, shortness of breath, headache, tiredness, a sore throat, and gastrointestinal issues. 18 In contrast, objective signs include cough, especially dry cough, dyspnoea, fever and impaired consciousness. The primary aim of this application was to classify coughs as those indicative and not indicative of COVID-19 and assess cough frequency. Other physical signs were to be included later. The purpose of this application was to monitor objective COVID-19-related physical signs so that users can monitor their condition at home without rendering themselves and others vulnerable to infection (e.g. by visiting a general practitioner or hospital). CoronaMonitor generates a daily health status report using data regarding cough, breathing, heart rate and sleep. This application also assesses subjective experiences. Specifically, using free-text boxes, users can add symptoms, rate them and describe their condition. These data points reflect how citizens experience their physical signs and disease. 19 This combination of objective and subjective data helps users track their health status over time. The CoronaMonitor application used in this study served as an example during the interviews, and participants were directly asked to state their expectations regarding the development of this application to determine if it is likely to meet the expectations and needs of future users.",

Denmark's Prime Minister introduced the first lockdown measures, starting on 13 March 2020. All public sector employees without critical functions were sent home on paid leave, while private sector employees were encouraged to work from home as much as possible. 20 Denmark is a highly digitised country with a strong welfare state, and it weathered the COVID-19 crisis with a relatively low infection and death rate during the first wave of the pandemic. 20, 21 The authors shared the link to the survey through both individual and organisational social media platforms on LinkedIn and Facebook. Interested individuals completed a form including demographic information to express interest in taking part in the research. Participants were subsequently contacted by telephone by one of the researchers who arranged the interview (see Appendix 2) . The participants were purposefully sampled based on age, gender, educational level and occupational status (e.g. employed vs retired) to generate nuanced answers for the research questions. 22 Since the interviews were conducted during the lockdown period, the invitation and consent form were presented as a part of the survey created using Google Forms. In total, 33 individuals volunteered to participate in the study. Seven individuals dropped out because of their busy schedules, and three individuals had provided invalid telephone numbers. Thus, user perspectives were examined using a sample of 23 individuals. Additionally, six developers with experience in developing complex application systems (scholars, engineers and leaders) were recruited. First, an invitation was sent to the Technical University of Denmark. Interested developers volunteered to participate in the study. They represented the field of mHealth technology, and their skill levels ranged from novice to expert. All the developers were employed at the Technical University of Denmark, which is the only institution of its kind in the country. Participant characteristics are presented in Table 1 .",

One participant offered nuanced insights into how applications foster a sense of safety by making the following observation: I don't want to trust the safety of an application. Security is a very big concept in relation to an epidemic, whether it is Ebola or whatever it is. An app can appear in connection with other things, in the context with other things . . . if it is stand-alone, then it can also give a little insecurity, I think.

The application may be perceived as a surveillance tool when users are screened for objective physical signs (e.g. breathing). However, the participants expected to witness disruption to peace and quiet in daily life.

(U-12) The participants were willing to use an application that monitors COVID-19 signs despite the likelihood of privacy breaches; however, what was of crucial significance was who controlled when the user should be monitored. The participants were not willing to compromise their integrity with regard to the risk of surveillance, and the deciding factor appeared to be who retains control over whether the application is switched on or off. For example, one participant made the following observation: 'I don't like it . . . it will be too much monitoring if it has to run 24/7. It would be okay if you could turn it off and on as needed' (U-20).

The first theme subsumed a key discrepancy: users wanted applications to be highly secure related to virus from the very beginning, whereas developers perceived the application to be in the development stage and that safety will be built and reinforced across time. The second theme underscored the need for an application that is personalised based on user needs, preferences, conditions and life circumstances related to data safety and privacy features.

Some reported feeling nervous, stressed and anxious when others failed to take COVID-19 seriously. Similar trends have been observed in other international research studies. Specifically, it has been found that the pandemic has exerted a psychological and social impact and contributed to stress and anxiety related to social interactions. [28] [29] [30] However, some participants reported no or little anxiety and, therefore, believed that the world was overreacting to the outbreak. Despite these differences in reactions, they all agreed on the need and demand for protection and safety from the virus and potential transmission. Owing to the imposition of the lockdown and social restrictions, virtual tools were perceived as tools that could help citizens monitor their condition. The conclusions of a recent review entitled, Wearable sensing and telehealth technology with potential applications in the coronavirus pandemic, further support our results. Ding and colleagues reported that applications have the potential to support individuals during the ongoing pandemic. Furthermore, through remote monitoring, they reduce virus exposure, which benefits all individuals by increasing safety. 31 These findings support our contention that such applications can provide different types of COVID-19-related information and serve as a bridge between the home and the outside world by facilitating remote monitoring among users. [32] [33] [34] According to Kickbusch et al., health literacy refers to the ability to make informed health decisions in daily life and plays an important role in increasing control over one's health. 26 Personal health technologies (e.g. applications) that generate health data in close proximity to individuals promote self-tracking and empowerment. 31 Therefore, an application that is specially designed to monitor COVID-19-related physical signs may serve as an important contributor to health literacy among the public and potentially increase safety. Whether the application will reach its full potential and contribute to citizen safety remains a critical issue. According to our results, this depends on the ability of the application to effectively engage with diverse audiences with different health literacy levels and communication competencies. Among individuals with high health literacy, self-tracking may be the ultimate strategy that ensures self-control, but low health literacy may restrict one's ability to be an active participant. At the individual level, application use requires one to take on the responsibility of being aware of potential symptoms reported through an application.",

Such applications are not alternatives to pre-existing professional assessment and counselling services. Instead, they should be perceived as digital tools that foster safety when physical signs are monitored and, consequently, a supplement to preexisting assessment and counselling services. 35 In a recent editorial on digital healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been suggested that applications offer diagnostic support and help individuals and communities cope with health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, by enabling individuals to stay informed, feel more safe and lead their lives in a socially responsible manner. 34 In this study, the participants expected the mHealth application to foster a sense of safety, be easy to use and ensure data privacy and safety because these characteristics are important to end-users. However, similar to the findings reported by Lomborg et al., concerns about data accuracy, a lack of trust in technology and uncertainty about user ability to interpret symptoms and changes in their health condition were reported as major barriers to future application use. 35 Therefore, health literacy is a major communication issue that is relevant to effective application use. Indeed, it refers to the ability to accurately interpret and utilise relevant health information and resources to achieve health goals. Thus, application developers should be cognizant of the health literacy levels of their target population and ensure technical face validity when they develop COVID-19-specific mHealth applications.",
