            "text": "Hearing speech in competition is a major complaint in those who suffer from hearing loss. Here we investigate a novel perceptual learning game that is designed to train perceptual skills thought to underlie speech in competition, such as spectral-temporal processing and sound localization, under conditions of quiet and in noise. Thirty young normal hearing participants were assigned either to this mixed-training condition or an active control consisting of frequency discrimination training within the same gamified setting. To assess training outcomes, we examine tests of basic central auditory processing, speech in competition, and cognitive processing abilities before and after training. Results suggest modest improvements on speech in competition tests in the mixed-training but not the frequency-discrimination control condition. This data show promise for future applications in populations with hearing difficulties.",

            "text": "There is much that is still not well understood about how to address the diversity of hearing difficulties that people may face throughout their lifespan as they attempt to make sense of different auditory scenes. There historically has been a focus on the problem of audibility, or the capacity to detect sounds, and the use of amplification techniques such as hearing aids to address peripheral hearing loss (Chisolm et al., 2007) . While, restoring audibility through amplification may help in some cases, it does not necessarily resolve problems with central auditory processing (CAP) Hoover, Souza & Gallun, 2017; Humes et al., 2019) , and amplification comes with its own difficulties in noisy environments since both the sound of interest and the competing noise are amplified (see McDermott, 2009 ). As such, there exists a significant need for assessment and rehabilitation of supra-threshold auditory processing disabilities Weihing, Chermak & Musiek, 2015; Gallun et al., 2018; Larrea-Mancera et al., 2020) , which relate to our capacity to discriminate between competing sounds to resolve what we intend to hear.",

There currently exist several different types of Auditory Training that target a range of different interactions with a range of different stimuli and applied to different populations. Examples of training range from simple frequency discriminations (Goldsworthy & Shannon, 2014) to phonemes (Ferguson et al., 2014; Kimball et al., 2013; Wade & Holt, 2005) , modified speech Tallal et al., 1996) , speech in noise (Burk et al., 2006; Humes et al., 2014; Kuchinsky et al., 2014) , active conversation listening (Lavie, Attias & Karni, 2013) , and music (Schellenberg, 2016; Zendel et al., 2017) . Examples of target groups for application range from children with learning difficulties Tallal et al., 1996) to those with cochlear implants (Goldsworthy & Shannon, 2014) , to normal hearing young adults (Kimball et al., 2013; Wade & Holt, 2005) to older adults with hearing impairment (Anderson et al., 2013ab; Stropahl, Besser & Launer, 2020; Henshaw & Ferguson, 2013) and those without (Karawani et al., 2015; Zendel et al., 2017) . However, a key limitation of many of these training studies is the extent to which training transfer beyond the trained context (Seitz, 2017) .",

One must identify the dimensions upon which the function that one intends to train relies upon and train systematically across those dimensions (Seitz, 2018) . For example, Deveau and colleagues found that systematic training across visual primitive features such as spatial frequencies, orientations and locations, within a gamified framework, transfer broadly across basic tests of vision (Deveau, Lovcik & Seitz, 2014) , to reading (Deveau et al., 2015) and even on-field performance in baseball athletes (Deveau, Ozer & Seitz, 2014) .",

            "text": "Here, we hypothesized that improvements in speech in competition would similarly be promoted by training with the basic features/processes upon which they arise. For example, there is substantial evidence that while oriented Gabors at different orientations, spatial frequencies and locations form the basic representation in visual cortex, that auditory cortex is represented by basis of spectral-temporal filters (Kowalsky, Depireux & Shamma, 1996; Shamma, 2001) . Relatedly, spectrotemporal processing abilities can predict speech intelligibility in those with hearing impairments (Bernstein et al., 2013; Mehraei et al., 2014) . Based upon this literature a first set of dimensions that we train upon are spectral-temporal processing at a variety of frequency ranges, directions of change, and durations. Another dimension of importance, crucial for auditory scene analysis and critical for speech in competition, is the ability to localize sounds in the environment. Sound localization can help segregate information coming from speech targets and avoid competing distractors at different locations . Given this, we trained sound localization under conditions of quiet and competing noise. Lastly, we note the importance of working memory in understanding speech in competition (Gallun & Jakien, 2019) and also train people to match sounds to representations of those sounds held in memory. In this first study, we address the efficacy of training in a young normal hearing population with longer term goals of applying the same approach to those with hearing difficulties.",

Listen introduces different types of spectro-temporal modulations, spatialized sound cues, and competing noise into an \"endless runner\" type of videogame where a player needs to listen to different sound elements to avoid obstacles in the environment. Additionally, Listen is equipped with some stages where participants need to remember sounds to perform adequately. To our knowledge, there is no example in the literature of a training paradigm that includes a wide range of psychoacoustical cognitive tasks and delivers them in an adaptive manner through a computerized interactive video-game.",

Tests were conducted before, during (mid-test) and after (including one month later follow-up) either: a) a mixed training (as discussed above) addressing spectro-temporal modulation discrimination, spatial hearing, and auditory working memory, all both in silence and in competition; or b) pure tone frequency discrimination training in the same gamified framework. The assessments chosen included basic tests of CAP such as dichotic frequency modulation detection, spectro-temporal modulation (STM) detection and discrimination, gap in noise detection, as well as tests of speech in competition, such as spatial release from masking and digits in noise. We additionally included some tests of cognitive processes such as attention and working memory, as some have argued that a cognitive benefit like that associated to action video-games (see Green & Bavelier, 2003) , might underlie improvements in hearing ability associated to AT (see study by Zhang et al., 2017 ; but also that of Stewart et al., 2020) .",

For the discrimination cases (labeled STM_250 and STM_3k), all intervals presented a spectro-temporal modulation in a more narrow band of white noise (1 octave). In one task the stimulus was centered at 250 Hz and in a second one at 3 kHz.

The adaptive parameter of this task was frequency ratio which describes the magnitude of difference between target and test frequencies. This parameter ranged from 1 (magnitude equal to the target frequency) to 0 (no difference).

Moreover, all of these tasks were presented both in quiet and in competition. Competition was either white noise or \"Carlile\" noise (Carlile and Corkhill, 2015) , which is created by vocoding speech into 22 bands and then temporally offsetting each band by rotating randomly in a circular buffer. Carlile noise thus contains the long-term spectrum and within-band amplitude modulations of speech but is completely unintelligible. Up/Down tasks use narrow-band spectro-temporal modulated noise similar to the one described for the STM discrimination assessment above. These stimuli, similar to the frequency discrimination control training described above, are centered around five different frequencies, namely 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz and 3 kHz (that largely span the range of spectrotemporal modulations found in speech). Different versions of this task adapted on the parameters of noise level, duration of stimuli, modulation depth, and modulation slope. Left/Right tasks included separations (offsets) from center in virtual space of eight different magnitudes, namely 60, 45, 30, 20, 15, 10, 5 and 2.5 degrees. Simulated phonemes were used in the leftright task. Different versions of this task adapted on either offset or noise level. Lastly, the n-back tasks included either pure tones or simulated phonemes as the memory tokens. In this task participants respond if the current auditory token matches the one that was presented n trials before by swiping towards a green circle (match) or a red one (no-match). Participants trained first on 1-back tasks which then progressed to the 2-back, both memory loads could adapt on noise level. This mixed training was designed to promote broad transfer of learning from the trained sound modulations to assessments that are indicative of hearing in real-world conditions (see Seitz 2018) . The full list of task conditions, stimuli used and progression logic is detailed in the supplementary materials (Section SA) and a summary is provided in Figure 3 .",

Of note, Whitton et al., (2017) study has generated much enthusiasm as a viable type of AT intervention for the future (see Skoe, 2017) as they examined hearing impaired populations. An important future direction for us will be to determine the effectiveness of our mixed-training intervention in hearing impaired populations including what dosages will be most impactful and whether retention can be achieved or whether continued practice will be required to retain training effects.",

            "text": "We also note that the benefits we found match what was suggested by Stewart et al. (2020) that using an action-based video-game that targets auditory cues for its task resolution should yield benefits in the auditory domain. These authors identified their lack of effects after training with an action video-game as being due to sensory domain specificity (mainly relying on visuo-spatial cues). Interestingly, we failed to find cognitive benefits beyond the active control. While our findings support the idea that the perceptual domain recruited for task resolution during action videogame play might be target of plasticity and learning, more work is needed to understand which elements are of importance (e.g. motivation and reward) to promote beneficial change up the cognitive processing ladder into general domain executive realms. It may be the case that some action elements are needed to elevate our game to the cognitive demands that have been shown to promote changes of this sort (e.g. Green & Bavelier, 2003) . There are a number of indications in the literature that our training approach can be improved to boost learning. For example, Whitton et al. (2014) examined how closed-loop auditory-motor foraging tasks may promote generalized learning. Likewise, other studies examining music to promote learning have emphasized this synchronous cogeneration of motor behavior and perceptual information (see Zatorre, 2005) . Moreover, some have asserted having a rich multi-sensory training approach might be beneficial to promote learning (Shams & Seitz, 2008) even when the target is unisensory (Shams & Seitz, 2011) as it may benefit from interactions with other sense modalities with different proficiencies (Barakat, Seitz & Shams, 2015) . Even when our training is audio-visual, the remarkable correspondences between visual and auditory cues (see Yehia, Kuratate & Vatikiotis-Bateson, 2002) and even other senses (see Rosenblum, Dias & Dorsi, 2017) could be explored with the aim of promoting beneficial auditory change. Further, there is reason to expect that implicitly training phonemic categories through video-game play may lead to benefits to speech processing (Kimball et al., 2013) . Exploring training both on explicit and implicit manners may afford more diverse training benefits.",

Our training is designed in such a way that tasks that are hard for a given individual will remain in rotation until the processing precision needed is achieved. In that sense the training is tailored to individual needs. However, this only occurs to some extent. For example, while the frequency-discrimination task is a reasonable control condition for young normally hearing adults whom have excellent pure tone hearing thresholds, which unlikely are limiting factors towards their ability to understand speech, in the case of cochlear implant patients frequency discrimination training directly targets their hearing needs (e.g. Goldsworthy & Shannon, 2014) . Future research will be required to further understand what approaches to auditory training may be best and how this may differ as a function of different individuals' hearing needs.",

However, the thresholds obtained during training with similar stimuli to that used for the STM discrimination assessments were of higher magnitude on average (8.23 M (dB) for the 250 Hz and 10.19 M (dB) for the 3 kHz) than the assessment thresholds (see Table 1 ). Further, there was no relation between the assessment thresholds and the training thresholds for either the 3 kHz center frequency (r = -0.001, p = 0.9 ) nor the 250 Hz (r = -0.63, p = 0.09). Of note, only 9 out of 15 participants in the mixed-training group reached the equivalent task to assessment making the apparent distance in thresholds even greater. So at the moment we cannot establish a clear link between training and assessment performance that would afford assessment through training on the game.",

Moreover, this study and intervention presents a point from which to improve development of auditory training in search for a more optimal learning paradigm.
