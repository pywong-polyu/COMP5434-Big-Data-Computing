            "text": "Misoprostol entered the global market under the name Cytotec in the mid-1980s for the treatment of gastric ulcers. Decades of research have since demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of off-label use of misoprostol as a uterotonic in pregnant women to prevent and treat post-partum hemorrhage, treat incomplete abortion, or terminate first-trimester pregnancy. Global health experts emphasize misoprostol's potential to revolutionize access to reproductive health care in developing countries. Misoprostol does not require refrigeration, can be self-administered or with the aid of a non-physician, and is relatively inexpensive. It holds particular promise for improving reproductive health in sub-Saharan Africa, where most global maternal mortality related to post-partum hemorrhage and unsafe abortion occurs. Although misoprostol has been widely recognized as an essential obstetric medication, its application remains highly contested precisely because it disrupts medical and legal authority over pregnancy, delivery, and abortion. I draw on fieldwork in Francophone Africa to explore how global health organizations have negotiated misoprostol's abortifacient qualities in their reproductive health work. I focus on this region not only because it has some of the world's highest rates of maternal mortality, but also fertility, thereby situating misoprostol in a longer history of family planning programs in a region designated as a zone of overpopulation since the 1980s. Findings suggest that stakeholders adopt strategies that directly address safe abortion on the one hand, and integrate misoprostol into existing clinical protocols and pharmaceutical supply systems for legal obstetric indications on the other. Although misoprostol has generated important partnerships among regional stakeholders invested in reducing fertility and maternal mortality, the stigma of abortion stalls its integration into routine obstetric care and availability to the public. I demonstrate the promises and pitfalls of pharmaceuticalizing reproductive health: despite the availability of misoprostol in some health facilities and pharmacies, low-income and rural women continue to lack access not only to the drug, but to quality reproductive health care more generally.",

            "text": "Misoprostol offers a particularly vivid example of how pharmaceuticals inhabit multiple \"social lives\" or \"biographies\" throughout various stages of their production, marketing, distribution, prescription, and consumption (Geest et al., 1996; Whyte et al., 2002) . In the late 1980s, medical professionals in Brazil began reporting that women who used misoprostol to terminate pregnancy experienced less severe complications of incomplete abortion (Co\u00ealho et al., 1994; L\u00f6wy and Dias Villela Corr\u00eaa, 2020) . Produced under the brand name Cytotec by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, this drug had been available on the global market since 1985 for the treatment of gastric ulcers. In pregnant women, misoprostol acts as a uterotonic, causing the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract. In addition to terminating pregnancy, misoprostol may also be used to induce labor, prevent and treat post-partum hemorrhage (PPH), and treat complications of incomplete abortion (also known as postabortion care or PAC). While off-label utilization of misoprostol is challenging to measure, in 2007 an estimated total of 129,300 mcg of misoprostol were sold in pharmacies and hospitals worldwide. Off-label use of misoprostol is thought to be highest in Asia, where the drug has been approved for managing PPH and medication abortion (MA) where legal, and where the cost of the drug is the lowest (Fernandez et al., 2009) . While misoprostol is sold in brick and mortar health facilities and pharmacies, it may also be purchased from informal drug vendors, and where available, the Internet. For example, since launching in 2018, the online organization Aid Access has distributed at least 600 medication abortion kits including misoprostol to women in the United States (Lussenhop, 2018) .",

WHO placed misoprostol on its List of Essential Medications (LEM) for labor induction in 2005 , for PAC in 2010 , for preventing PPH in 2011 , and for treating PPH in 2015 (WHO, 2019a .

In response to increasing access to MA worldwide, WHO shifted its abortion classification system.

More specifically, they have cautioned against reducing solutions to complex public health problems like maternal mortality to \"magic bullets\": cost-effective drugs or interventions that promise to save the most lives at the lowest cost, but with inadequate attention to the social and economic context in which these technologies are applied (or not) (Farmer et al., 2013; Adams, 2016) . Magic bullet approaches have been incentivized within a broader landscape of neoliberal health reform since the late 1970s, in which the competitive distribution of health goods and services through the market, rather than the government, purportedly leads to greater standardization, accountability, access, and quality (Erikson, 2012; Basilico et al., 2013; Chorev, 2013) . In developing countries, structural economic reform, led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, has decreased government support for health care, leaving private organizations to fill in service delivery gaps (Pfeiffer and Chapman, 2010; Packard, 2016; Pfeiffer, 2019) . Within a context of economic scarcity, aid donors and governments prioritized the implementation of practical, technologically driven approaches whose effectiveness can be statistically measured, ideally through randomized controlled trials (Adams, 2013; Adams, 2016) . For example, starting in the 1980s, the World Bank supported a collection of primary health care interventions for children-growth monitoring, oral rehydration therapy, breast feeding, and immunizations-known as GOBI Packard, 2016) .",

For example, studies in Brazil and Mozambique have shown how HIV/AIDS programs that prioritize the availability of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) overlook, and in some cases reinforce, inequalities in basic health needs such as nutrition, housing, and clean water that increase people's vulnerability to HIV infection (Biehl, 2006; Biehl, 2007; Kalofonos, 2010) . In Tanzania, mass administration of deworming medication took precedence over environmental interventions to reduce the burden of parasitically transmitted diseases such as onchocerciasis and trachoma (Samsky, 2015) . Even in wealthy countries like the United States, stratified access to life-saving drugs and technologies reinforces racial and class inequalities in health outcomes (Clarke et al., 2003; Phelan et al., 2010) . While medication may effectively treat disease, pharmaceutical approaches do not adequately address underlying inequalities that render some people at greater risk of disease and limit their access to preventive and curative care. From this perspective, misoprostol alone may not be enough to reduce maternal mortality in SSA.",

Despite misoprostol's potential to reduce maternal death, its off-label obstetric indications, and in particular its capacity to terminate pregnancy, have rendered it a \"pharmaceutical outlaw\" (MacDonald, 2020) in a global arena of reproductive health that remains reluctant to accept abortion as a legitimate part of obstetric care (Suh, 2018) . For example, US policies like the 1973 Helms Amendment and the 1984 Mexico City Policy (also known as the Global Gag Rule [GGR]) prohibit US development assistance from being used to procure abortifacient technologies or to support abortion-related activities in developing countries. As recently as May 2020, in a letter to the UN Secretary General, US Agency for International Development (USAID) threatened to withdraw funding from the UN Humanitarian Response to the global Covid-19 pandemic because of its alleged \"promotion\" of abortion through \"the widespread distribution of abortion-inducing drugs and abortion supplies\" (USAID, 2020). Additionally, faith-based, anti-abortion organizations such as Maternal Life International have expressed opposition to WHO's inclusion of misoprostol for preventing PPH on its LEM, arguing that it promotes a lower standard of obstetric care outside the hospital for pregnant women in developing countries (Adams, 2020) .",

I focus on this region not only because it has some of the world's highest rates of maternal mortality, but also the highest rates of fertility and lowest rates of modern contraceptive use. Since at least the 1980s, family planning has factored prominently into structural adjustment policies designed to increase economic growth throughout the region under the guidance of the IMF and the World Bank (Hartmann, 1995; Robinson, 2015) . By the turn of the millennium, Francophone Africa was designated as a climate change \"hot spot\" (Mutunga et al., 2012) due to population growth.

My findings show that these organizations pragmatically engage in approaches that, on the one hand, openly signal their support for safe abortion through training and advocacy, and quietly support the approval of misoprostol for legitimate obstetric indications by national pharmaceutical regulatory agencies and its integration into national LEM and private and public pharmaceutical supply systems, on the other. For advocates of safe abortion, both approaches are necessary in a region where abortion laws remain highly restrictive, USAID remains an influential donor of reproductive health aid, and health officials and medical workers face immense pressure to meet national and global demographic targets to reduce fertility and maternal mortality.",

Examples include drugs for sexual disorders, social anxiety, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), depression, and other mental illnesses (Abraham, 2010) . Off-label prescription of drugs is neither uncommon nor new: a 1998 study found that nearly 39% of drug prescriptions in pediatric wards of European hospitals were off-label (Conroy et al., 2000) . Some off-label \"jobs\" may be deemed too controversial by pharmaceutical companies to promote in clinical practice. Despite the integration of misoprostol into national and global guidelines for obstetric care, Pfizer has not applied for a license to cover the reproductive health indications of Cytotec, a drug that is registered for treatment of ulcers in at least 80 countries (Weeks et al., 2005) .

Indeed, misoprostol disrupts conventional knowledge about where maternal health care itself should be administered. Since the 2000s, global maternal health authorities have stressed the importance of skilled birth attendance (births attended by doctors, nurses, or midwives), ideally in well-equipped health facilities, to reduce maternal death (Stanton 2008) . The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals have maintained skilled birth attendance as a key indicator of progress toward reducing maternal death (Chou et al., 2015) . Yet, even as WHO and other global maternal health stakeholders have promoted skilled birth attendance, other maternal health advocates have critiqued this approach, pointing to evidence that TBAs can use misoprostol in community-based settings to safely and effectively manage PPH Potts and Hammerling, 2006) . Some maternal health scientists and organizations have been critical of WHO's recognition of misoprostol as an alternative medication for preventing and treating PPH in the absence of the gold standard, oxytocin. In 2011, Maternal Life International, a faith-based organization, wrote to WHO to question the evidence base for misoprostol's inclusion on the LEM for preventing PPH, arguing that it fostered sub-standard, unregulated care outside of health facilities for poor, rural women in SSA (WHO, 2011a; Adams, 2020) . Similarly, in 2018, researchers from Newcastle University in the United Kingdom requested that WHO remove misoprostol for the prevention of PPH from its LEM in light of a lack of rigorous statistical evidence supporting community-based administration of the medication (WHO, 2019b). In counterresponse, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) argued that misoprostol must remain on the LEM to ensure \"an alternative for prevention of PPH in resource-poor community and rural settings where injectable oxytocics are not available, or cannot be safely administered\" (WHO, 2019c). Additionally, some misoprostol advocates have argued that in some developing countries, it may be financially, ethically, and logistically \"impossible\" to conduct randomized, placebocontrolled trials that produce rigorous statistical evidence of the medication's efficacy in managing PPH, and that demands for additional statistical evidence unjustly delay women's access to safe and effective care (Potts et al., 2010) .",

Compared to modern contraception, abortion plays a limited role in fertility reduction. Yet, the \"contraception-abortion paradox (p. 12)\" exists in many developing countries, where limited access to or inconsistent use of contraception increases the risk of unwanted pregnancy, which in turn frequently leads to abortion (WHO, 2011b). There is precedent for the deployment of abortion technologies, along with long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), in the achievement of fertility reduction goals in the global South. Starting in the late 1960s, modern contraception was identified as a technical solution to the perceived problem of overpopulation in newly sovereign nations in the global South. Neo-Malthusian predictions of political and economic instability and environmental degradation due to overpopulation catalyzed an era widely known as \"population control,\" during which developing countries were compelled to establish population policies that articulated fertility reduction goals in exchange for development assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors. Through family planning programs established by international NGOs, USAID \"inundated\" developing countries with low-cost contraceptives (Murphy, 2012; Takeshita, 2012) . These programs have been widely critiqued for coercive practices and inadequate attention to women's needs, comfort, and safety (Hartmann, 1995; Kuumba, 1999) .",

By the early 2000s, however, fertility reduction through voluntary family planning emerged yet again as a key component of global approaches to address the environmental dangers of climate change (Sasser, 2018) . Over the next decade, SSA was identified as a region particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change on food security, water, and health. The Gates Foundation explicitly identified population growth as a cause of \"disease burden, environmental degradation, poverty, and conflict\" (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, 2012) . Nearly all of the 26 countries designated as population and climate \"hotspots\"-areas characterized by \"high rates of population growth, high projected declines in agricultural production and low resilience to climate change\" (PAI, 2011, p. 2)-in 2011 were in SSA. As the \"primary collectors\" of food, water, and fuel in SSA, women were more vulnerable to climate change and therefore the ideal target population for contraception to help them \"cope\" (Mutunga et al., 2012, p. 12) .",

They disproportionately burden women in SSA for solving the problem of climate change, despite the fact that at 3%, this region has the lowest greenhouse gas emissions in the world (Sy, 2016) .

And yet, the qualities that render it a potentially revolutionary medication for achieving maternal mortality reduction simultaneously raise the specter of unregulated abortion and increased participation of TBAs in obstetric care. As an abortifacient, misoprostol's ties to a neo-Malthusian past and present threaten to destabilize precarious global agreements on achieving fertility reduction targets in a post-ICPD landscape. In the following sections, I explore how reproductive health advocates have negotiated these qualities in their efforts to increase the availability of misoprostol in Francophone Africa. \"RIGHT AT THE PRECIPICE\": REGIONAL PRIORITIZATION OF SAFE ABORTION Some study participants are explicitly engaged in advancing access to MA, and safe abortion more generally, in Francophone Africa as part of a broader maternal and reproductive health agenda. Abortion-specific meetings have been held, either as stand-alone events or tied to other global or regional maternal and reproductive health conferences starting in 2016. Some of these events have been organized and held in secrecy because of the politically sensitive nature of abortion. These meetings have been attended by representatives from national and international NGOs, research organizations, bilateral donor agencies, UN agencies, and philanthropic agencies. During these meetings (none of which I attended), safe abortion advocates have discussed trends, progress, and challenges related to MA in the areas of research, legal environment, advocacy, commodities, community engagement, funding priorities, and services. For example, during a January 2019 meeting on safe abortion, almost 40% of participants indicated that their funds were allocated to MA services, and 88% identified Francophone West Africa as a priority region (SAD, 2019a). Safe abortion advocates use these meetings to rethink priorities, conduct situational analyses, coordinate and synergize activities, and articulate next steps.",

On the other hand, procuring an abortifacient drug within the public health system remained a serious challenge. He characterized the act of registering the drug for PPH as a \"big battle\" because \"everyone knows that it's a product that is used to make abortions safer.\" He joked that even the MOH \"hid\" behind obstetric indications like PPH and PAC to place misoprostol on the national LEM. For Jacques, this approach made people reluctant to order misoprostol \"publicly\" in government health facilities, even for legal indications. \"Everyone knows that they need the product,\" he said, \"but no one will say, 'listen, we need to order miso.' Jacques described a situation in one Francophone country where a multilateral agency donated a quantity of misoprostol to the MOH, which was \"only buying contraceptives.\" The MOH then sent the drug to \"university hospital centers,\" but not secondary health facilities.

Mariam, who worked for an NGO with activities in multiple Francophone African countries, explained: \"It's still difficult for women to get misoprostol because of legal restrictions. There are many things that still block women.\" Jacques, who worked for the same NGO as Mariam, pointed out that \"just because the product is in the country does not mean that it is accessible.\" This observation is relevant not only for women seeking the drug in the private sector, but also health workers in government health facilities. Ayo, who worked in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, estimated that beyond large hospitals, less than 10% of public health facilities stocked the medication. In Senegal, a survey of obstetric care conducted between 2015 and 2016 showed that only 3.4% of referral facilities carried misoprostol (MSAS, CEFOREP, and UNFPA, 2017) . Laila explained that despite misoprostol's integration into national norms and protocols, Senegalese midwives were more likely to have received MVA training for PAC, and that misoprostol training for PPH was still lacking. One of the main barriers to obtaining misoprostol, despite its availability in pharmacies under various brand names, was the need for a prescription for a legal obstetric indication. Even with a prescription, Jacques pointed out that women may experience difficulty procuring the amount needed to terminate pregnancy. Misoclear, for example, is sold in packets with three 200 mcg tablets. To meet the recommended dose for up to 12 weeks of gestation, a woman would have to buccally, sublingually, or vaginally take 800 mcg (four pills) every three hours until expulsion (Ipas, 2020) . This would require four packs of Misoclear. Requests for multiple packets of Misoclear at a pharmacy might raise suspicion, and prompt pharmacy workers to question clients about why they were purchasing this quantity (Mann Global Health, 2019). Alternatively, Jacques explained, the woman might visit several pharmacies to purchase one or two packs of Misoclear at each, an equally challenging process requiring additional time, transportation costs, and possibly multiple prescriptions.",

Health workers may purchase a supply of misoprostol and \"resell\" it to women at a higher price. \"This is the kind of dysfunction that comes out of all these restrictions,\" she said.",

In countries like Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Tanzania, women obtain misoprostol from multiple sources, including friends, relatives, health workers, pharmacists, and informal pharmaceutical vendors. While some health workers administer misoprostol directly, others dispense it to women and instruct them on how to use it at home. Women may obtain misoprostol from brick and mortar pharmacies with or without a prescription. Although many women seek misoprostol from health workers in the private sector, some health workers in government facilities may provide the service themselves, or refer women to a colleague. Women obtain misoprostol not only from skilled health workers, but also TBAs and other paramedical providers (Izugbara et al., 2015; Drabo 2019; Solheim et al., 2020; Ouedraogo and Juma, 2020) .",

Ayo explained that for many women, street medication was much more affordable than misoprostol purchased at a pharmacy or through a health worker. \"Instead of paying 5000 CFA francs for misoprostol, she can buy Chinese medicine for between 200 and 500 francs.\" Both Jacques and Ayo asserted that while such purchases might be more affordable, women faced the risk of encountering inauthentic drugs or receiving inadequate information related to dosage or gestational age, all of which could lead to complications. \"In all of the Francophone African countries, we have these people who make these abortifacients available,\" Jacques said. \"But what is the quality of that medication? What is the quality of the prescribed dosage? That's the problem. In these circuits you can often find good miso or bad miso, or drugs that are supposed to be miso but are not.\" Jacques disagreed with people who pointed to the risk of complications as a reason to restrict misoprostol because women were \"not ready\" for self-medicated abortion. \"It's not true,\" he argued. For him, the problem was the gap between pharmaceutical distribution systems and clients: Our pharmaceutical distribution system has completely missed its target. The environment has evolved, but our pharmacies and our distribution policies have not evolved. We wait for the client to come, thinking it's the client who has to come to us even if they are 100 or 120 km away.",

Attention to how misoprostol's pharmaceutical regime is unfolding in this region reveals a great deal about the opportunities and limitations of pharmaceutical solutions to public health problems. Through its multiple \"biographies,\" misoprostol has generated partnerships between transnational stakeholders invested in reducing fertility and maternal mortality. At the same time, misoprostol's abortifacient capacity complicates safe abortion advocates' relations with NGOs and national health authorities that receive support from donors like USAID. Abortion stigma may delay misoprostol's integration into national LEM, clinical protocols, and pharmaceutical supply systems. Demand for generic brands of misoprostol in the private sector does not necessarily translate into access for low-income and rural women. As an abortifacient, misoprostol's connection to neo-Malthusian logics of population control threatens the gains won by FP 2020 in revitalizing global commitments to fertility reduction. Misoprostol's legal obstetric indications, PAC and PPH, firmly position the medication in harm reduction approaches to maternal and reproductive health (Erdman, 2011; Hyman et al., 2013; Kulczycki, 2016) . This has enabled partnerships with USAID, an enormously influential donor in global maternal and reproductive health that accounted for over two thirds of family planning funding between 2003 and 2013 (Grollman et al., 2018) . In Senegal, for example, USAID funded a study in 2009 to test the feasibility of providing misoprostol for PPH at the community level (Ortiz et al., 2010) . In 2011, USAID awarded Child Fund, an NGO, a $40 million grant over five years to expand health care provision at the community level, including the provision of misoprostol for PPH by TBAs (Ennulat, 2016) . Due to anti-abortion funding policies such as the Helms Amendment and the GGR, USAID neither supports national health authorities in procuring misoprostol supplies, nor does it permit its contracting agencies to purchase the medication. Similarly, USAID supported research, training, and programming related to PAC in Senegal, but would not support the procurement of MVA because it is an abortifacient (Curtis, 2007; Suh, 2021) .",

By framing misoprostol as a poorly evidenced, sub-standard form of care for PPH, these actors aim to restrict access to abortion. For example, Maternal Life International is a Christian organization that, in addition to providing emergency obstetric care in various African countries (and Haiti), promotes couple-based natural contraception. In a 2011 letter to WHO, the organization explicitly expressed its opposition to the use of misoprostol for abortion, suggested that the \"real agenda\" of \"misoprostol advocates\" was \"not evidence-based obstetrical care but rather unregulated medical abortion,\" and affirmed that ethical medical care necessitates \"a proscription against abortion\" (WHO, 2011a).",

Maxine described Ethiopia as a place where the MOH was \"open\" to engaging with abortion. Since 2005, Ethiopia has permitted abortion in cases of rape, incest, fetal malformation, or if the pregnant woman is under the age of 18. A woman's \"word\" is considered sufficient to establish her age or that she experienced rape or incest . The national society of obstetricians and gynecologists played a prominent role in advocating for abortion law reform (Holcombe, 2018 ). Yet, a 2016 study of legal abortion provision at public and non-profit facilities showed that despite a favorable political climate, health workers continue to struggle with adjudicating between legitimate and illegitimate requests for abortion (McLean et al., 2019) . John, who worked on MA in Francophone Africa, revealed that in a previous position with an NGO in a southern African country, he had been warned directly by the MOH not to cross the line into legal advocacy for abortion. In India, where medication abortion is permitted in certified health facilities up to seven weeks and misoprostol and mifepristone are widely available at private pharmacies (Boler et al., 2009) , an estimated 67% of abortions are classified as unsafe (Yokoe et al., 2019) . In Ghana, where abortion is permitted for several indications, a 2016 study in the capital city of Accra showed that only half of pharmacies stocked misoprostol, with pharmacies in less affluent neighborhoods less likely to do so (Ganle et al., 2019) .",

Release of the third loan during the late 1980s was conditioned upon the establishment of a concrete population policy with support from USAID, Pathfinder International, and UN Population Fund (UNFPA) (Robinson, 2017) . More generally, countries in SSA with high levels of structural adjustment debt are more likely to have articulated population policies (Robinson, 2015) .",

Scarcity in natural resources like land and water due to climate change fuels conflict, which in turn propels migration from SSA to the global North. In the post-9/11 War on Terror, the region's emerging identity as a recruitment zone for organizations like Al-Qaeda has provided an additional geopolitical rationale for the expansion of US military intervention into Francophone Africa. None of the study participants viewed misoprostol, or MA more generally, as a tool of population control in Francophone Africa. Instead, they understood misoprostol as an important harm reduction approach to addressing the problem of maternal mortality. Yet, donors in the global North (including USAID) have long cultivated an interest in abortion as a technological strategy in the solution of population problems. If abortion and contraception represent two sides of the same neo-Malthusian coin, misoprostol is flexible enough to achieve both of these \"jobs\" within overlapping regimes of global reproductive governance.",

In Senegal, for example, international NGOs have contracted private logistics operators to supply government health facilities with contraceptives. By closely monitoring the private operators' performance in delivering and taking inventory of contraceptives, this approach endeavors to prevent contraceptive stock-outs in the public sector . Some of my study participants were keen to harness the private sector to increase access to misoprostol throughout the Francophone region. Private organizations, with support from international NGOs, do the work of registering and marketing misoprostol and other MA drugs. They believed the presence of multiple brands on the market generated competition between manufacturers, thereby keeping prices affordable for consumers. Sales of misoprostol provide concrete evidence of demand in the Francophone region. In 2018, DKT International, an international reproductive health NGO, sold over a million packets of misoprostol in Benin, Cameroon, the DRC, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mali, and Togo (DKT International, 2018) . In this sense, the market is key to getting life-saving drugs \"into women's hands.\"",

It should come as no surprise that study participants with direct experience with the public health sector were more critical of a privatized, pharmaceuticalized approach to reproductive health. Laila, Ayo, Jacques, and Mariam, all African nationals, described unequal distributions of reproductive health care between private and public health facilities, wealthy and poor women, and rural and urban women. Privatized distribution of misoprostol reinforced the marginalization of community-based health workers like TBAs upon whom low-income and rural women often depend for maternal and reproductive health care. Although multiple generic brands of misoprostol may be available for purchase in formal and informal sectors of the health system, the drug may be unaffordable for low-income women, or altogether inaccessible for rural women who live far from a pharmacy. Even if a woman is able to purchase misoprostol, she may receive inaccurate information about how and when to use the drug, and what to do if complications arise.",

In countries like Brazil (Zordo, 2016) , El Salvador (Oberman, 2018) , Senegal (Suh, 2021) , and the United States (Eckholm, 2015) , PAC serves as a doorway to criminalization if health workers suspect that a patient has illegally terminated pregnancy.

As a feminist advocate of reproductive justice, I support access to technologies like misoprostol that empower women through granting reproductive autonomy in contexts where legal abortion is highly restricted, and benefit them by reducing the risk of obstetric complications and death (Layne et al., 2010) . Attempts to restrict misoprostol to \"protect\" women in SSA from the dangers of sub-standard care outside of hospitals conveniently overlook profound inadequacies in obstetric care in health facilities. As lockdowns and other disruptions related to the global Covid-19 pandemic have threatened access to health care worldwide, it is more important than ever to ensure women's access to life-saving drugs like misoprostol (Kumar, 2020) . At the same time, privatized approaches to reproductive health amplify broader inequalities in access to resources according to age, gender, geography, and race. Neoliberal discourses of empowerment and self-actualization through rational consumption of health services or goods such as family planning or facility-based delivery obscure the gendered and racialized anti-natalism of twenty-first century approaches to maternal and reproductive health (Bhatia et al., 2019; MacDonald, 2019) . While the presence of misoprostol in pharmacies and hospitals increases access to safe reproductive health care for those who can afford the drug, it also abandons the most vulnerable women to cope with discriminatory abortion laws and under-resourced public health systems while aspiring to responsible reproductive behavior.",
