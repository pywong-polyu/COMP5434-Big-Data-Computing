However, human-based models do not (yet) emulate complex human (patho)physiological processes and, thus, cannot simply replace animal models.

At the beginning of a zoonotic pandemic, key questions about the causative agent, as well as natural and transmitting hosts first need to be addressed. For COVID-19, the causative agent was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and although the natural host (bats) was rapidly identified, intermediate and transmitting hosts are still under debate. This prompted the World Health Organization to form an international panel to establish suitable animal models for vaccine and therapy testing, with the first summary report published in autumn 2020 2 . One take-home message of this report is that no animal model tested thus far entirely reflects human COVID-19.",

However, the lack of species-specific molecular tools and reagents makes the correlation to human pathomechanisms challenging. Alternatively, genetically modified animals, such as transgenic mice, can be used. In these models, human ACE2 is expressed under tissue-specific promo ters, which makes the mice susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infec tion. However, dependent on the cellular expression pattern, the animals develop mild to lethal phenotypes and, in some instances, even neurological disorders, such as encephalitis, which do not occur in humans 2 . This raises the question whether animal models should be chosen based on the representation of disease symptoms, as they may be mechanistically misleading and ultimately foster fundamental biases. Nonetheless, animal models, if thoroughly evaluated, have value in the study of virus transmission, drug repurposing and vaccine efficacy. However, in particular at the beginning of a pandemic, animal models are not readily available, and their development takes valuable time and significant research effort.",

Although Vero E6 cells highly express ACE2, TMPRSS2 expression levels are lower than in human lungs.

Interspecies-related differences, such as host specificity, divergent immune responses, or the unavailability of species-specific reagents hamper the research. Human-based models, such as micro-engineered multi-organs-on-chip, may hold the solution. infections. For example, self-organizing, human stem cell-derived organoids can be grown that represent the cellular heterogeneity and extracellular matrix composition of tissues, by which functional characteristics are retained over months. As such, lung organoids are currently applied in drug repurposing studies, which identified the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib as a potent SARS-CoV-2 cell entry inhibitor 5 . The relevance of this finding is currently being evaluated in clinical trials (NCT04394416, NCT04346147) . Notably, efficient cell entry inhibition was also seen in xenografted mice, indicating that organoids can be predictive stand-alone tools. In addition, kidney, heart and brain organoids are being explored to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in other organs. For example, brain organoids provided important insights into SARS-CoV-2 tropism of neurons and the preferential targeting of more mature cell types, as derived from the comparison of organoids cultivated for 60 versus 15 days (mature versus developing). Interestingly, neurotoxic effects were observed, which may explain some of the detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain 6 .",
