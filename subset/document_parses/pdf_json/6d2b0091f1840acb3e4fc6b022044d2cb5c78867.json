N is the virus nucleocapsid protein, is highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed in vivo after the virus infects human being. S is responsible for binding the virus to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its subsequent cellular uptake [3] [4] [5] .",

Importantly, these clinical observations are independent of the SARS-CoV-2 antigens used for the immunoassay, that include Region-binding Domain (RBD), S1 subunits, full-length S or N proteins [4] [5] [6] [7] 9] . However, some studies that went into the details of the quality of humoral response, revealed that some features could be associated to a more severe disease or death.Firstly, it seems that an antibody response directed mostly versus N antigen in respect to S antigen may predict the disease progression toward a more severe illness. A study [10] which analyzed 38 patients divided in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (=11) and non-ICU patients (=27), reported lower anti-S IgG titers in the 3 rd week after symptom onset and a higher anti-N IgG/anti-S IgG ratio during all the weeks analyzed (1, 2 and 3 weeks after symptom onset) in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. In addition, anti-N IgG and anti-N IgM were higher in ICU patients in respect to non-ICU patients at all-time points; anti-S-IgG positively correlated with the decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) in non-ICU patients, while anti-N IgG did not. Another more recent study [11] which analyzed 22 hospitalized patients, all recruited within the first 20 days following symptom onset, showed a N-focused humoral response in patients who ultimately deceased and an S-focused response, in particular implying an S-specific antibody dependent complement deposition and phagocytosis, in patients who survived. They validated this observation in a larger cohort of acutely infected patients and found that the higher ratio of S/N antibody response was significantly associated to a protection against severe disease.",

After the third week, IgM begin to decrease, while IgG remain stable for longer time and sustained levels were detected until 6-7 months so far, even if a great variability was observed among patients [9, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, interestingly, some studies that focused on the analysis of patients' serum starting from first days pso, have reported that most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients mount an early antibody response. Both IgG and IgM seroconversion was detected during the first week pso. In another recent study on 38 samples from 13 COVID-19 patients with known date of symptom onset, 33% of patients seroconverted for IgG between 3rd and 7th day pso [17] . Although, in this regard, some studies didn't report any significant difference among different type of patients (asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic) [10, 12, 18] , another two analytic studies underlined a major proportion of early responders among hospitalized [6, 19] and severe patients [20] . In particular Iyer et al. [19] reported that the median time to seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 RBD was, on average,4 days earlier for ospitalized patients compared with non-hospitalized patients, suggesting an association between antibody kinetics and disease severity. Humoral response against sars-Cov-2 and its implication: key messages. a. sars-Cov-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus which infects human cells expressing aCe2 receptor through its trimeric surface spike (s). glycoprotein nucleocapsid (n) protein is a highly immunogenic structural protein which participate in rna package and virus particle release. the most common observations regarding the humoral response mounted by sars-Cov-2 infected patients are summarized. B. Different serologic tests have been promptly implemented for the diagnosis of sars-Cov-2 infection diagnosis. at present, serum antibodies against s and n proteins are the ones mainly detected. Potentialities and drawbacks of this kind of assay are summarized. C. antibody response against sars-Cov-2 has been used for the implementation of convalescent plasma therapy (up) and the isolation and characterization of neutralizing mabs for therapy (down). salient points concerning these two treatment options are reported. D. Both analysis of neutralizing response against sars-Cov-2 and epitope characterization of isolated monoclonal nabs are useful for vaccine design. focal points of the design of a vaccine aimed to induce an effective antibody response are highlighted.",

Interestingly, Sun et al. [10] showed that non-ICU patients had a faster and higher IgM to IgG class switch than ICU patients. Moreover, in ICU patients, anti-S IgM maintained a stable high levels, while anti-S IgG appeared to increase slowly compared to anti-N IgG levels. Observations on asymptomatic carriers have shown that these patients had constantly low levels of IgM, but high levels of IgG, together with an earlier viral clearance. Very early class switching was also detected in the pediatric population, characterized by milder symptoms and better recovery rate than adults. These observations suggest that high and persistent IgM played a negative role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, while efficient and rapid IgM to IgG class switch, especially for S-specific antibodies is important for viral clearance.",

Such seronegative asymptomatic carriers may have resulted from low level of viral load. Likewise, Quan-Xin Long et al. [13] reported the case of a mother and a daughter of 11 years who maintained IgG and IgM seronegative status during hospitalization and other cases where IgM or IgG response are lacking [3, 6, 21] . Again, Ger Rijkers et al. [6] reported two cases of patients with severe disease who failed to show an IgG response at day 21 after disease onset (although the total antibody assay was positive). These patients, 69 and 87 years of age, had persistently positive PCR test results, respectively, on day 28 and day 37 after disease onset. The authors hypothesize that patients with an inadequate IgG antibody response may exhibit prolonged viral shedding, and thus longer periods of infectivity",

With some exceptions, the data agree firstly that humoral immune response is driven by a small number of B clones [22] [23] [24] [25] , and secondly that, heavy (VH) and light (VL) variable gene classes utilized are often shared among different patients [23, 26] . These clones have been referred as public clonotypes and are associated to different Abs classes in reference to the portion of S-protein that is recognized [27] . Variability was observed in somatic hypermutations and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) lengths, even though there are indications that longer CDR3 sequences were represented in SARS-CoV-2 infections [22, 24] . In particular, Kuri-Cervantes L et al. [22] , analyzed these characteristics in relation to the severity of the disease. They found a significant expansion of plasmablasts during severe COVID-19; this is directly correlated with an oligoclonal expansion of antibody clones within the overall B cell repertoire, suggesting that many of these large clonal expansions reside within the plasmablast pool. By contrast, mild patients, with one exception, showed a reduced clone expansion with more diverse repertoires. Moreover, the analysis of antibody sequences of the largest B cell clones in severe COVID-19 individuals were surprisingly variable in terms of somatic hypermutation levels, although they consistently had long CDR3 regions compared to healthy donors and those with moderate COVID-19.",

The same observations were reported also by Ling Ni et al. who found a variability in NAb titers of serum from 14 analyzed patients [3] , with one patient remaining completely negative, and by Robbiani et al.

Serologic tests, in fact, represent an indirect measure of the host response to the infection that can be variable among individuals, in terms of kinetics, as well as of antibody levels at peaks and targeted antigens. Generally, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both IgM and IgG) reach the peak between the 2 nd and the 3 rd week pso. Differently from other infections, where IgM/IgG detection is used for establish a recent or past infection, the dynamic of appearance of these two classes of antibodies is quite similar in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, IgG production occurs concurrently to or sometimes before IgM antibodies, the latter decreasing after the 4 th week pso. Therefore, serologic assays can be useful to support and confirm molecular diagnosis of infection, especially after 5.5 days pso [31] . They are unable, however, to establish the actual infectious status of the patient: negative result does not exclude a recent infection, while a positive result does not indicate if the patient has stopped viral shedding or not (RT-PCR is a necessary complement assay in this case).",

Various studies report that the detection of anti-N antibodies is more sensitive respect to anti-S and anti-RBD antibodies, due to the higher abundancy of N protein during the infection [32, 33] . For example, Bubelo PB et al. [32] , analyzed samples from PCR + confirmed COVID-19 cases and showed that seropositive N-antibodies were detected in a major number of samples collected both at >14 days after onset of symptoms (35/35 for anti-N antibodies, 100% sensitivity, and 32/35 for anti-S antibodies, 91% sensitivity) and at <14 days after onset of symptoms (33/65 for anti-N antibodies, 51% sensitivity, and 28/65 for anti-S antibodies, 43% sensitivity). This suggests that anti-N antibodies appear earlier than anti-S antibodies and are present at more elevated levels. Interestingly, the authors also analyzed five immunocompromised patients, who showed a general delayed production of antibodies and seropositivity for anti-N antibodies even when anti-S antibodies were undetected.",

            "text": "Regarding the serologic tests' specificity, to avoid false positive results it is important to take into account the eventual cross-reactivity of antibodies specific for other endemic human CoV infections including alpha-CoV (229E and NL63) and other beta-CoV (OC42 and HKU1), against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Multiple groups have shown limited or no cross-reactivity of antibodies to NL63, 229E, OC42 and HKU1 CoV against recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 N, S and RBD proteins by Western blot or ELISA analysis [34] . In this regard, Phipps WS et al. [17] in their recent study analyzed 23 cytomegalovirus IgG positive samples, several cases associated with prior influence A+ (n = 8) and influence B+ (n = 7) viruses, respiratory syncytial virus + (n = 6), and all 4 types of human CoV (n = 47); none of these patients were COVID-19 IgG positive. They also tested samples from patients with multiple autoantibodies, obtaining the same results. Generally, almost all recent studies confirmed negligible cross-reactivity [21, 35] of antibodies specific for common human CoVs, whereas cross-reactivity it is observed with SARS-CoV and, at lesser extent, MERS-CoV infection because of the higher similarity and the phylogenetic affinity between these two other CoVs and SARS-CoV-2. In particular, considering the 90% similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, cross-reactivity for this antigen is very high, while cross-reactivity with MERS-CoV infection was not observed (49% of homology between N proteins) in different studies [21, 35] . By contrast, when anti-S or S1, S2, RBD antibodies were individually detected, Nisreen M.A. Okba et al. [33] , observed cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against SARS-CoV S and S1 proteins, and to a lesser extent with MERS-CoV S protein, but not with the MERS-CoV S1 protein. More importantly, the authors analyzed sera from healthy blood donors, PCR-confirmed acute respiratory non-CoV infections, acute to convalescent PCR-confirmed alpha-and beta-HCoV infections, and PCR-confirmed MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. None of these sera were reactive against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein, RBD antigen and N protein except for SARS-CoV sera. This cross-reactivity pattern is not unexpected if we consider the higher homology levels of S and S1 proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that reach 77% for the entire S, 66% for the S1 portion and 73% for the restricted RBD region (for MERS-CoV homology were respectively 33%, 25% and 16%) [18] . S2 region is more conserved with 90% similarity with SARS-CoV and 43% with MERS-CoV. It is therefore likely that this portion of the protein is responsible for the cross-reactivity observed with MERS-CoV patients' sera. On the other hand, recently Ng K et al. [35] have reported cases (5 of 34 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals with recent HCoV infection, as well as in 1 out of 31 individuals without recent HCoV infection) of weak preexisting humoral immunity in uninfected and unexposed humans to the new CoV. This phenomenon was particularly prevalent in children and adolescents, predominantly for the IgG class and targeted the S2 subunit and N protein, but not with the S1 subunit or the RBD of S. Notably, these sera also exhibited specific neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes, according to levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-binding IgG and with efficiencies comparable to those of COVID-19 patient sera. In the same way, Morgenlander et al. [36] , showed that a small minority of pre-COVID plasma contain antibodies reactive to CoV2 FP peptide, which represents a pan-CoV conserved antibody epitope.",

It had even been thought that a plan for large scale serological testing could provide results upon which governments could formulate both social policies and the return to work. However, this information needs to be backed up by further research as we will discuss later and also by NAbs measurement. Currently, the only assay able to establish if a patient serum contains NAb (and in which quantity), and as such usable as a correlate of protective immunity, is the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT); unfortunately, the test demands biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment facilities and therefore is impracticable by clinical laboratories. On the other hand, as already previously discussed in this review, the presence of NAb is high variable among patients, even if almost all of them develop an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. In this context different studies focused on the possible correlations between PRNT results and levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Since the protein S, in particular the S1 region, RBD, was implicated in the binding to the cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor for viral entry, some antibodies specific for these antigens are supposed to be neutralizing. Accordingly, various studies found correlations between the neutralizing power of sera and the levels of anti-S antibodies. Ni L et al. [3] analyzed 14 patients' sera: 13 presented various degrees of neutralizing capabilities with 5 patients displaying high titers of NAb, with a significant correlation between NT50 and area under the curve (AUC) (calculated performing serum diluitions/OD ELISA curves) of anti-S-RBD IgG, but not of anti-N IgG. Wu F et al. [29] , through plasma analysis from 175 discharged patients, interestingly observed that NAbs titers moderately correlated with S-binding antibodies targeting RBD (r = 0.51, p < 0.0001), S1 (r = 0.42, p < 0.0001), and also S2 (r = 0.435, p < 0.0001). This suggests that the S2 region could also be targeted by NAb, although this region is not directly involved in virus-cellular receptor interaction. Finally, Suthar MS et al. [18] analyzed the range of anti-RBDspecific and Nab responses across their cohort of 44 acutely infected COVID-19 patients and found a positive correlation between the magnitude of this two measures (r2 = 0.7; p < 0.0001). Subsequently, robust validation of this RBD-specific IgG ELISA by high-throughput testing at the Emory Medical Laboratories, on 231 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patient serum samples demonstrated that this test also resulted highly sensitive and specific (97.5% and 98%, respectively), and perfectly discriminatory, above all for group of patients on day 7 or later after PCR confirmation (AUC of 1.00 (n = 83)). Another very interesting study [40] conducted on 68 COVID-19 patients, confirmed a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-S ectodomain (ECD) IgG titers and, better, anti-RBD and in vitro VN titer. The same study also establishes that the probability of a VN titer \u2265160 (the titer firstly recommended by FDA for convalescent plasma therapy) was 80% or greater when anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers are \u22651:1350. This is further evidence that anti-RBD IgG and anti-ECD IgG titers measured by ELISA serve as a very reliable surrogate of VN.",

Regarding Nabs' ability to protect patients from re-infection, currently we lack the data to answer this question, even if preliminary results from studies in Rhesus Macaques show a lack of re-infection after SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge in animals recovered from first infection [41] . Whether persons can be reinfected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is unknown; SARS has not reemerged since 2004 and MERS cases remain sporadic. However, at present, NAbs titer necessary to confer protective immunity is unknown; thus future studies are required to determine which titer has therapeutic benefit. Finally, as yet, stable persistence of Nab, mainly IgG, has been described up to a variable time from four to seven months [14] [15] [16] and SARS-CoV-2 re-infection is estimated as a rare event [14] . However, due to the high similarity between the two diseases, lessons can be reasonable drawn from SARS-CoV and MERS infections, for which concentrations of IgG remained high for approximately 4 to 5 months before declining slowly over the next 2 to 3 years [42, 43] .",

On the contrary, scarse efficacy in terms of patients' survival and disease progression was found when convalescent plasma is administered later in the course of the infection.

Moreover, IVIG are not subjected to ABO match blood groups, and the infusion volume would be lower. ; human Iggs, particularly Igg1 and Igg3, bound to to the viral antigen exposed on the target cell, can subsequently interact through their fc region with fc\u03b3rs expressed by effector cells or with complement component 1q, potentially supporting the destruction of target cells through aDCC or CDC, respectively. In addition, the fc region of Igg can bind the salvage receptor fcrn after fluid-phase uptake by vascular endothelial cells and other cells, an interaction that contributes to the long (\u223c21 day) half-life of human Igg. B. the aDe phenomenon is illustrated as a possible adverse event that could occur with some antibodies. aDe has been documented to occur through two distinct mechanisms in viral infections: by enhanced antibody-mediated virus uptake into fc\u03b3r-expressing phagocytic cells leading to increased viral infection and replication, or by excessive antibody fc-mediated effector functions or immune complex formation causing enhanced inflammation and immunopathology. Both aDe pathways can occur when non-neutralizing antibodies or antibodies at sub-neutralizing levels bind to viral antigens without blocking or clearing the infection. Identification and exclusion of aDe-associated epitopes in vaccine design or modification of the amino acid sequence of Igg reducing the interaction with one or more binding partners (for example by inserting lala mutations) could be promising strategies to improve the clinical potential of antibodies.

Results from more recent studies on both mRNA vaccines generally confirm that neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination are able to neutralize also these two variants, even if with variable reduction titers against the South African one [85] [86] [87] , suggesting an antibody response directed against different epitopes of the S-protein. Moreover, an interesting study by Stamatatos et al. [88] , have highlighted the importance of vaccinating also previously infected persons since they showed how a single immunization with mRNA vaccines was able to boost cross-neutralizing antibodies titers against all variants (even if, again, with a reduced potency against the South African variant) and that antibodies involved in the cross-neutralization target the RBD. Interestingly, this effect was up-to 1000 fold higher in previously infected patients after a single vaccine dose than in uninfected persons after two vaccine doses. However, to date the neutralizing titer levels that can be considered protective against infection or disease severity by original and variant SARS-CoV-2 haven't yet been determined and only real-world experience can provide this answers. In this perspective, the challenge that the above mentioned pharmaceutical pharma are facing is to adapt and modify the current vaccines in order to be maximally efficacious also against the most resistant variants. Moderna and Pfizer/Biontech are developing, for example, multivalent mRNA combining the codes of all S-proteins and are planning, together with Johnson and Johnson, a third boost of their original vaccines.",

Higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in severe cases prompt the hypothesis that a similar mechanism could occur in some cases for COVID-19, but a more recent study tends to exclude it [30] showing that ADE is not involved in severe forms experienced by the patients analyzed.

On the other hand, a gradual development of viral antigen specific B cells undergoes somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation at the traditional germinal center; this ultimately leads to high affinity protective antibody responses as observed in non-severe COVID-19 patients [20] . In another study, Cervantes LK et al. set out to elucidate their observation that severe COVID-19 patients displayed longer CDR3: given that B cells harboring antibodies with long CDR3 sequences are often multi-reactive and counter-selected during B cell development [22] , they propose a contribution of longer CDR3 sequences as part of severe COVID-19 immunopathology.",

This could be caused by an elevated immune activation, and to higher exposure to the virus and its antigens. Moreover, higher exposure to S protein could induce, in a probabilistic way, more NAb titers. In most cases, these antibodies are effective, but other independent factors could contribute to the severity of the disease: excessive T responses, cytokine storms or other physiological elements, such as imbalance in the ACE2-angiotensin I-angiotensin II axis [90] . All the hypothesis above need verification; in depth studies would clarify the relationship between the degree of humoral response and a more severe disease.",

However, concerns remain when testing patient populations differ from those used to validate the assay are tested, e.g. asymptomatic patients and immunocompromised patients, whose humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be delineated. Moreover, as described in this review, some RNA-positive patients display no antibody responses; alternatively, they could produce antibodies that currently developed tests were unable to detect. On the other hand, actually, setting-up of serologic, in particular RBD-based, and neutralizing tests has extreme importance in the evaluation of the efficacy of emerging vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and the response to vaccines at whole population level. An important issue is the reported cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with DV antigens (probably Envelope protein) which can cause misdiagnosis in region where the DV infection is endemic, considering also that the two virus can cause diseases with overlapping symptoms. However, an interesting hypothesis arose from the observed cross-reactivity and the reported less severity of COVID-19 in regions with relevant frequency of DV infections: it is supposed that preexisting DV antibodies could mask S-RBD and reduce the binding to ACE2 receptor, thus protecting from the infection [38] . This issue certainly need to be further evaluated and verified.",

The ability of this treatment to impact on mortality and disease progression seems strictly dependent on the early time of administration and nAbs titer of the donor; interestingly and, probably as awainted, these results match also with the efficacy results of monoclonal nAbs, thus suggesting a fundamental role of nAbs in the acute infection in order to prevent severe disease progression, more than the induction of severe forms of the diseases.",

This said, various biotechnological strategies are already in place to avoid the onset of this mechanism for mAbs, e.g. the introduction of LALA mutations in Fc region (Figure 2 ), as performed with CB6 mAb [66] . Obviously, since LALA mutations reduce mAb Fc's interaction with the Fc receptors on immune cells, one should also take into consideration that ADCC and ADCP will also be reduced, thereby limiting important mAb-mediated mechanisms that may contribute to viral clearance. Therefore, the risks of ADE should be determined accurately by specific testing [91] case by case, before deciding to adopt these protein engineering strategies.",

Humoral response against sars-Cov-2 and its implication: key messages. a. sars-Cov-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus which infects human cells expressing aCe2 receptor through its trimeric surface spike (s). glycoprotein nucleocapsid (n) protein is a highly immunogenic structural protein which participate in rna package and virus particle release. the most common observations regarding the humoral response mounted by sars-Cov-2 infected patients are summarized. B. Different serologic tests have been promptly implemented for the diagnosis of sars-Cov-2 infection diagnosis. at present, serum antibodies against s and n proteins are the ones mainly detected. Potentialities and drawbacks of this kind of assay are summarized. C. antibody response against sars-Cov-2 has been used for the implementation of convalescent plasma therapy (up) and the isolation and characterization of neutralizing mabs for therapy (down). salient points concerning these two treatment options are reported. D. Both analysis of neutralizing response against sars-Cov-2 and epitope characterization of isolated monoclonal nabs are useful for vaccine design. focal points of the design of a vaccine aimed to induce an effective antibody response are highlighted.",
