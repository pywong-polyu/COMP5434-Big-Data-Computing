The importance of nutrition in infectious diseases was emphasized but the relationship between the severity of symptoms and nutrition status of individuals was not examined. This study compared the nutrition status of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the emergency service and the clinical severity of the disease. Based on the nutrition status of the 337 patients included in the study, 87.2% (294) of the patients were in the low-risk group while 12.8% (43) were in the high-risk group in terms of malnutrition. In the analysis conducted to examine the effect of nutrition on the severity of disease, the relationship between NRS 2002 and dyspnea, cough, weakness, fever, and other symptoms was statistically significant. It was concluded that healthy nutrition is crucial during the pandemic, and it is necessary to consider nutrition improvement as a way to cope with emerging viral infections.",

Malnutrition is a risk factor for the severity and mortality of viral pneumonia [2, 11] . Similarly, in the recently defined COVID-19, malnutrition accelerates the inflammatory process and is associated with a long hospitalization period [2, 12, 13] . Therefore, it is very important to evaluate hospitalized patients in terms of malnutrition risk and take necessary precautions as well as monitor nutrition status during the clinical course of the disease [13, 14] . The nutrition status of patients with COVID-19 should be taken into consideration, and most of all, it should be remembered that malnutrition can be a prognostic factor for morbidity and mortality related to COVID-19. It is considered that the nutrition status of the individuals who visited the hospital due to COVID-19 might be related to the severity of the disease; however, there is an insufficient amount of study on this factor.",

For this purpose, the relationship between the NRS 2002 score and the severity of disease was examined using \u03c7 2 analysis and the result was statistically significant (\u03c7 2 = 202.52, p = 0.0001). The logistic regression analysis indicated that the individuals with a higher nutrition score had a 5.6 times higher risk for an extreme-critical COVID-19 severity (p = 0.0001, 95% CI = 66.636-1321.163). Accordingly, individuals who are at risk for malnutrition had a more serious COVID-19 clinical course. In viral infections such as COVID-19, the effect of nutrition on catching the disease and/or the prognosis of the disease should not be ignored. In line with our findings, in a study conducted with 355 adults, the prevalence of malnutrition was high (71.83%) in a general cohort of COVID-19 [14] . In addition, Allard et al. reported that about 40% of patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia had malnutrition and about 35% of them had severe nutritional risk [2] . In our study, individuals who were malnourished had higher COVID-19 severity. Accordingly, adequate nutrition might have a significant role in COVID-19 progression and it might relieve symptoms and reduce the individuals' complaints. It was concluded that for the individuals with a severe course of COVID-19, determining nutritional status would be useful.",

In a study that examines the prevalence and severity of malnutrition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the overall prevalence of malnutrition was 42.1% (moderate: 23.7%, severe: 18.4%), and the prevalence of malnutrition reached 66.7% in patients admitted to the intensive care unit [11] . In a study conducted regarding the evaluation of nutrition and the provided nutritional therapy in COVID-19 patients, almost all of the patients were at nutritional risk and one-half were malnourished. In the same study, the frequency of nutritional risk, malnutrition, disease/inflammation burden, and decreased intake of hospital diet differed among the intensity of care settings, where the patients were managed according to the severity and stage of the disease. However, malnutrition affected one-half of patients in both intensive care units and emergency services [15] . Malnutrition differs according to the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients and the care settings where the disease is managed.",

In this study, the symptom of fever was low among the patients (18.4%) but was associated with malnutrition risk. Although the ratio is low, it is important to evaluate the nutritional status of the individuals who visit the hospital with the symptom of fever. Examining the individuals who had cough, weakness, and other symptoms, it was seen that their malnutrition risk was high. Although the prevalence of symptoms differs overall, the individuals with symptoms had insufficient nutritional status.",
