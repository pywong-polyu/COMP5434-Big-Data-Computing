Patients were stratified to three groups (A) 3-6m post HCT; (B) 6-12m post HCT; and (C) >12m post HCT. Results: Individuals early post allo-HCT (3-6 and 6-12m post HCT) developed significantly lower antibody titers after vaccination compared to patients >12m post allo-HCT and healthy controls (p<0.001). Within the cohort of HCT recipients, patients >65 years (p=0.030), those under immunosuppression for prevention or treatment of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) (p=0.033), and/or with relapsed disease (p=0.014) displayed poor humoral immune response to the vaccine.

Antibody titers achieved the highest levels 1m after the 2 nd dose of the vaccine but substantially waned in all transplanted groups and healthy controls over time. Conclusions: This analysis of long-term vaccine antibody response is of critical importance to allo-HCT recipients and transplant physicians to guide treatment decisions regarding re-vaccination and social behavior during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 4 EXTENDED ABSTRACT Background: Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been rapidly approved. While pivotal studies were conducted in healthy volunteers, little information is available on safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines in immunocompromised patients, including recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantations (allo-HCT).

Moreover, the influence of simultaneous IST, presence of GVHD, and/or other patient-or transplant-related parameters on the level and temporal dynamics of immune protection against SARS-CoV- 2 have not yet been elucidated. Here, we report the results of a prospective observational study on the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among 110 allo-HCT recipients and 86 healthy controls.

Healthy controls displayed significantly higher titers than patients (p<0.001 for 3-6m, 6-12, and >12m, supplemental figure  S3A ).

We identified a total of 38 low responders in our cohort (17 patients were 3-6m, 8 were 6-12m and 13 were >12m post allo-HCT). Overall, a high proportion of patients 3-12m after transplant were on IST (75%), and the proportion of low responders in this group was consistently high, whether patients were on IST or not (70% off IST, 60% on IST). In contrast, only 28% of patients in group >12m were on IST, and the low responders constituted a higher proportion of those on IST (35%) versus those not on IST (16%) (figure 5A). Adding an interaction term between the variables \"group\" and \"IST\" did not improve our multivariate linear regression and was not significant (p=0.42). By assessing age categories, we observed consistent patterns: the proportion of low responders was higher in patients under IST regardless of their age and was also generally higher in older patients (figure 5B). We vaccinated low responders with a third dose and evaluated the response approximately 1 month after the third dose (median 36 days, IQR:31-37 days) in 23 patients (7 died, 1 was lost of follow-up, 1 was excluded because the patient received a booster vaccination 3 months after the second, 1 refused to receive a booster injection and for the 5 others booster titers were not available yet). For these 23 patients, the third dose had been received around 6 months after the second dose (median: 197 days, 1Q-3Q: 138-221 days). We documented an increase of the humoral response in a fraction of patients: 47% (9/19) of the group 3-12m and 25% (1/4) of the group >12m developed a humoral immune response and became responders (sum S1>17) after the third dose ( figure 5C ).

The lower rate of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and other vaccines in elderly patients is consistent with prior reports. 22 Likewise, detrimental effects of IST on immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been described in solid organ transplant recipients. 8 Patients in our study were given IST either because they were early post-HCT (prophylactic IST), or because they were suffering from GVHD (therapeutic IST). Whether a 3 rd booster dose of the vaccine may overcome low responses remains to be elucidated in the coming months, but first experiences (including our own observations) indicate that low responders can benefit from a 3 rd dose and turn to good responders subsequently. Unexpectedly, chronic GVHD per se was not associated with lower antibody levels in our patient cohort. Chronic GVHD is a very heterogeneous condition affecting one or several organs. Depending on the number and type of involved organs, treatment can be topical or may require single-agent or combined systemic IST. Moreover, \"subclinical\" GVHD of the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues can result in severe lymphopenia and immune dysfunction. 21, 23, 24 In our current study, cohort subgroups of chronic GVHD were too small to perform statistical analyses.",

Emerging data on quantifications of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and corresponding cytokine production upon exposure to specific peptides in vitro stress the importance and role of T-cell mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2, but also reveal a wide heterogeneity of the magnitude of such T-cell responses. Hence, ultimately both humoral and cellular immunity should be integrated into assessments that define the correlates of protection necessary to evaluate current vaccine strategies. [31] [32] [33] [34] In conclusion, in the light of breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals systematic analyses of immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their temporal dynamics are urgently warranted to guide treatment decisions during this pandemic. Our results highlight the importance of identifying those at highest risk with longitudinal antibody assessment and moreover elucidates the rapid decline of vaccine efficacy not only in high risk patients but also in healthy individuals.",

While pivotal studies were conducted in healthy volunteers, little information is available on safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines in immunocompromised patients, including recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantations (allo-HCT). Objectives: Here, we used a novel assay to analyze patient-and transplant-related factors and their influence on immune responses over an extended period of time (up to 6 months) to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in a large and homogenous group of allo-HCT recipients at a single center in Switzerland. Study Design: We examined longitudinal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) in 110 allo-HCT recipients and 86 healthy controls. Seroprofiling recording IgG, IgA, and IgM reactivities against SARS-CoV-2 antigens (receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike glycoprotein subunits S1 and S2, and nucleocapsid protein (N)) was performed prior to vaccination, prior to the 2 nd dose, and 1, 3, and 6 months (m) after the 2 nd dose. Patients were stratified to three groups (A) 3-6m post HCT; (B) 6-12m post HCT; and (C) >12m post HCT. Results: Individuals early post allo-HCT (3-6 and 6-12m post HCT) developed significantly lower antibody titers after vaccination compared to patients >12m post allo-HCT and healthy controls (p<0.001). Within the cohort of HCT recipients, patients >65 years (p=0.030), those under immunosuppression for prevention or treatment of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) (p=0.033), and/or with relapsed disease (p=0.014) displayed poor humoral immune response to the vaccine. In contrast, the intensity of the conditioning regimen, underlying disease (myeloid/lymphoid/other), and presence of chronic GVHD had no impact on antibody levels. Antibody titers achieved the highest levels 1m after the 2 nd dose of the vaccine but substantially waned in all transplanted groups and healthy controls over time. Conclusions: This analysis of long-term vaccine antibody response is of critical importance to allo-HCT recipients and transplant physicians to guide treatment decisions regarding re-vaccination and social behavior during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Gender, intensity of the conditioning regimen, and, unexpectedly, the presence of chronic GVHD had no influence on humoral immune responses to the vaccine. Intrigued by the indistinct association of chronic GVHD with humoral vaccine response, we further explored the influence of chronic GVHD and IST on antibody response. Regardless of whether patients had no/mild or moderate/severe chronic GVHD, it was systemic IST that had a long-term impact on the humoral immune response (figure 4B). This lack of statistically significant impact of chronic GVHD on humoral immune reactivity may be explained by the heterogeneity within this small subgroup with moderate/severe chronic GVHD (n=26) and the clinical condition itself -as well as its systemic and/or topical treatments (figure 4C-D, supplemental table 2). Systemic treatments varied substantially with n=15 patients receiving systemic steroids, n=34 calcineurin-inhibitors, and n=20 who were treated with ruxolitinib.
