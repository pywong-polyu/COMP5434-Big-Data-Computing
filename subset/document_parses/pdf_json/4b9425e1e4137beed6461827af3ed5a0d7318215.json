Only the Worldwide Olympic Partners could exercise various rights both in Japan and abroad. However, the contract period was 10 years, and there was only one company per industry. To become a 10-year Worldwide Olympic Partner, Toyota Motor Corporation paid 200 billion yen (Tomisawa & Hasegawa, 2020) .

For instance, the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games welcomed approximately two million visitors, as well as a worldwide television audience (Farrell & Frame, 1997) . In addition to such wide exposure, the overall positive image of the Olympic Games is likely to enhance the sponsor companies' brand image, leading to sales growth by increasing awareness of sponsors' products and services (Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympics and Paralympic Games, 2020).",

            "text": "Several studies have investigated the economic impact of the Olympic Games on sponsors by using the event study methodology in which the Olympics' market value is measured in stock price responses to announcements of Olympic sponsorship agreements. Farrell and Frame (1997) investigated stock price reactions to announcements of 26 sponsorship agreements for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. Running the market model over the 241-day estimation window, they reported significant negative average cumulative abnormal returns (ACAR ) at the 5% level in the three-day (0, 2) window. Miyazaki and Morgan (2001) also examined market reactions to the news of 27 companies becoming sponsors of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics by cross-checking firm announcement dates using Lexis-Nexis and other online sources. Unlike Farrell and Frame (1997) , their event studies over the 120-day and 100-day estimation periods detected no significant negative events, but found significant positive ACAR at the 5% level in the five-day (-4, 0) window and marginally significant positive ACAR at the 10% level in the four-day (-3, 0) window. Deitz et al. (2013) reexamined previous studies by eliminating the effects of confounding events. Their event study over the 120-day estimation window used by Miyazaki and Morgan (2001) generated significant negative ACAR at the 5% level in the three-day (0, 2) event window. The event study over the 241-day window used by Farrell and Frame (1997) produced significant negative ACAR at the 5% level in the three-day (0, 2) window. Deitz et al. (2013) also showed that markets had the most negative reactions at the 5% significance level to news about the Olympic Partner (TOP) program sponsorship, in which sponsors paid the highest sponsorship fees. In contrast, Samitas et al. (2008) investigated market reactions to sponsorship announcements of the 2004 Athens Olympics and found insignificant ACAR in the six-day (0, 5) window.",

Thus, Hypothesis 2 (H2) is that stock price reactions of official Olympic sponsors to news about the postponement of the Olympics were more positive than those of matched firms. Deitz et al. (2013) indicated that the stock returns of Olympic sponsors vary across sponsorship ranks, whereby larger investments result in larger market reactions. The potential recovery from the loss expected by canceling the Olympic Games could have been greater for sponsors that paid more in sponsorship fees than for those that paid less in sponsorship fees. Thus, Hypothesis 3 (H3) is that stock price reactions of sponsors that invested larger amounts of sponsorship fees were stronger in response to news of postponing the Olympics than those of sponsors that invested smaller amounts of sponsorship fees.",

These results are consistent with those of H2. Table 2 shows that the market reacted negatively to the news regarding the potential cancellation of the Olympic Games and positively to the news of its eventual postponement. The next question is whether the rebound following the announcement of their postponement was sufficient to compensate for the drop following the news suggesting their cancellation, or if the value was simply adjusted to mitigate the negative effects. Figure 1 shows the ACAR accumulated on January 6, 2020. Both the ACAR based on the FF3 and FF5 models declined sharply after the second event on February 26, 2020, which was not recovered by the market rebound after the third event on March 24, 2020.",

Given that Olympic sponsorship requires a large amount of investment, the postponement of the Olympic Games was more beneficial for sponsors than cancellation because sponsors had a chance to recover investment to some extent. Recovery was more important for top-tier sponsors with the largest investments and sponsors with high ratios of individual and foreign shareholders, who were considered to be more sensitive to changes in the future cash flows of investee companies. However, investors did not believe that the postponement of the Olympics would have paid off all of the sponsors' costs. For this reason, future sponsors will need to place more emphasis on potential deferral risk when making investment decisions.",
