This study evaluated the effectiveness of an online psychological intervention based on the Awareness, Courage, and Love (ACL) model from Functional Analytic Psychotherapy to promote closeness between couples during the pandemic. Method: Thirty-one couples were randomised into either the intervention or control group for a 2-hour online group session. The intervention was designed to increase closeness between couples, whereas control group members watched a movie. In both groups, participants responded to two instruments that assessed the couple's relationship. Generalised linear mixed modeling was used to compare the change scores over time between the groups, with random effects used to control for the correlation within a couple and the correlation within the individual. Results: The intervention group's closeness increased by 23 per cent while the control group's closeness increased only 2 per cent. A week later, a significant difference between the two groups emerged on closeness. Conclusion: Online ACL protocols requiring minimal training offer a promising intervention to quickly buffer against stress for large numbers of individuals during pandemic times.",

            "text": "Social ties are an important buffer against adverse psychological consequences (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2018) , and this is especially true during times of crisis (Hostinar & Gunnar, 2015; Kaniasty, 2012; Pollack et al., 2012) . As important as social support can be for promoting resilience, going through a disaster also places a strain on close relationships (Lavee, 2013) . In particular, couples who weather crises together are at an increased risk for conflict (Duke et al., 2013) , domestic violence (Fisher, 2010) , and even suicide (Griffiths & Mamun, 2020) . Specifically, during the COVID-19 crisis, although the safeguards of social distancing and staying home are key to reducing transmission of the virus, they are highly disruptive to daily routines. Both partners may be trying to work from home, and couples with children have the added responsibility of childcare while working. Typical self-care involving down time, exercise, pleasurable activities, and connection with social support systems has been interrupted. The presence of additional stressors rampant in this pandemic, such as unemployment, economic hardship, fear of catching the virus, loved ones falling sick or even dying, not being able to attend family events such as weddings and funerals, all create contexts in which partners are more likely to be critical, argumentative, or blaming and less caring and supportive, leading to greater relationship dissatisfaction (Bodenmann et al., 2015; Neff & Karney, 2004) . Given that these additional pandemic factors can greatly increase stress for couples, partners who focus on nurturing their relationships during these trying times are investing in their longer-term emotional and physical health (Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Pietromonaco & Collins, 2017) . Thus, it is important to develop easily disseminable, online interventions that can not only address couples' difficulties, but actually increase their bond in order to buffer their stress. This can be done by leveraging Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP), a form of contextual behavior relational therapy that emphasises the power of interpersonal connection (Holman et al., 2017; Kohlenberg & Tsai, 1991; Tsai et al., 2009) . In an attempt to bring the principles of FAP to a wider population than just those who want or can afford therapy, its main tenets have been translated into the terms Awareness, Courage, and Love (ACL), which serve as the foundational principles for a global project with chapter leaders in 26 countries and six continents (Awareness, Courage & Love Global Project, 2020) .",

There were 12 discussion questions, such as: \"What was the theme of the film? Did you learn anything from the movie? Was there something you didn't understand about the movie? What did you like best and least about the movie? Why? Describe the use of color in the film-did it advance the emotions the film makers were trying to evoke? Did events portrayed in the film ring true? Describe the scenes that you found especially accurate. Which sequences didn't seem to match reality? Why? How did the editing of the film advance the story that the film makers were trying to tell?\" After the couples answered the discussion questions with each other, a brief group discussion took place.

Specifically, one person did not complete the pre-survey, five did not complete the post-survey, and one did not complete the follow-up survey. Single point imputation was used to estimate missing values for the post-survey based on this value being a mean between pre and follow-up time points for the individual. Normality of the data was assessed using normal quantile plots and Welch's t-tests were used to evaluate whether there was a significant difference in the mean change score between each of the time points on our primary and secondary outcome measures. Given that this method ignores the correlation between the couples and individuals, sensitivity analysis was performed, using multi-level generalised linear mixed modeling (GLMM) with random effects for couples and individuals to compare the change scores over time between the groups. Since this was a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, sample size was not planned in advance to power it. Post-hoc power analysis revealed that power for the interaction term was 0.44, indicating a lack of power in the model; however, as this analysis was intended to be complementary to the original analysis, it was determined that the increased risk of type II error was acceptable. The Bonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Each potential demographic covariate was run through the model independently. Variables which had a p-value of .10 or less were included in the final model. The final multivariate model was again run using the GLMM method as set out above.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the significant difference between the two groups' closeness at 1-week follow-up appears to be driven partly by a drop in the control group's closeness at this third time point, compared to their two previous ratings. Because it seems unlikely that the control group activity of watching a movie together would cause a marked decrease in closeness, especially a week later, we suspect that the control group's decline at follow-up may represent a return to their true baseline. Indeed, because the initial baseline measure was collected only a few minutes before the couples began the intervention, their closeness ratings at that time may have been artificially inflated due to their anticipation of engaging in some kind of presumably connecting activity with each other. This may explain why the control group, experiencing no lasting effects from their protocol a week later, returned to relatively lower closeness than in either of the earlier surveys, while the intervention group, buffered by the effects of the intervention, remained elevated. Because the control condition controlled for time spent together during the intervention, it appears that simple time spent together was not responsible for the differential improvements, and that the ACL structured experiential exercises improved relational behavior between the couples. Specifically, as described in Haworth et al. (2015) , the basic functional process invoked by the intervention's experiential exercises was an exchange of vulnerability (courage) and responsiveness (love) by members of the couple, which has been shown across multiple experimental and longitudinal studies to be the basis for the development of close, intimate relationships (e.g. Aron et al., 1997; Debrot et al., 2012; Laurenceau et al., 1998; Laurenceau et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "This pilot study has a number of limitations which need to be addressed in future research. First and foremost, sample size was planned a priori only to power Welch's t-tests, but we ended up supplementing these analyses with GLMM in order to provide a greater level of control. This resulted in our GLMM being underpowered, so it will be critical for future research to determine if these findings replicate with a fully powered model. Furthermore, there were a number of other limitations in this pilot study: (1) The measures were self-report only. (2) While the couples were asked to complete the surveys separate from each other, since they were quarantined together, this may have affected their ability to respond candidly to the questionnaires. (3) While any follow-up data are a strength, the 1-week follow-up only provides limited support that the benefits to the intervention participants are sustainable. Obviously, longer follow-up is required. (4) The intervention group was led by the first author, the intervention developer, raising the possibility of allegiance bias that would result in smaller, and possibly null, effects if this research were implemented by researchers independent of the intervention itself (Luborsky et al., 1996) ; (5) A manipulation check was not carried out to assess which couples actually completed the homework exercise. This may be a potential unexplored explanation for the follow-up effects. (6) The study hypotheses were not pre-registered, which limits the credibility of any claims that can be made based on the results. (7) Possible covariates related to the COVID-19 pandemic specifically (e.g. infection status) were not measured, yet may have influenced the outcome variables.",

Since people have a fundamental need for belonging, they are most likely to thrive in the face of stress when they feel closely connected to significant others, experiencing them as accepting, validating, and responsive (Gottman & Gottman, 2018; Pietromonaco & Collins, 2017) . With its relatively easy-to-administer protocol, this study also addresses the problems in our field of inconsistent adoption of evidence-based treatments (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2006) that require expensive and time-consuming instruction and supervision that are not readily accessible (Addis et al., 1999) .",
