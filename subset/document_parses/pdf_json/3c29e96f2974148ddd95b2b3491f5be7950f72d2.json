Other people easily touch the surface, and articles COVID-19 landed then, touching their nose, mouth, and eyes. 1 COVID-19 causes flu-like symptoms and, at a severe level, it causes death. 2 The period between exposure to COVID-19 and the onset of COVID-19 symptoms is supposed to be 14 days, with the majority of cases occurring five to six days after exposure. 3 To reduce the risk of transmission, the community must adhere to approved infection prevention protocols, including regular handwashing with soap, rubbing the hand with an alcohol-based sanitizer, physical Meskel Primary Hospital, and Muke Turi Primary Hospital) were included in this study. The final sample size was proportionally allocated to the five hospitals found in the North Shoa zone based on the number of hypertension patients who attended follow-up for one month. Finally, a simple random sampling technique specifically computer-generated was used to recruit study participants ( Figure 1 ).",

The results were calculated, taking the mean scores as a cut-off point after testing each outcome's results' normality distribution. Scores greater than the mean score were considered as good knowledge, a favorable attitude, and good practice, while scores below the mean were considered poor knowledge, unfavorable attitude, and poor practice against coronavirus disease prevention.

Specifically, frequency and percentages were used for descriptive analysis, and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the COVID-19 prevention practice. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to control for possible confounding effects of the selected variables. The Chi-square test was used to determine the association between knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores and categorical variables. The main assumption of the binary logistic regression model was tested. The assumption result showed that there is no existence of a significant effect modification. The multicollinearity among the independent variables was also evaluated using a multiple linear regression model. The evaluation result does not indicate evidence of multicollinearity.",

Therefore, increasing knowledge, attitude, and practice of coronavirus disease 19 among hypertension patients requires a coordinated effort from government, non-government and health professionals. The Ethiopian health minister should continue to distribute updated information through social media and mass media in collaboration with different stakeholders. Finally, the health professional who works in chronic outpatient departments should provide health education on COVID-19 prevention methods to patients with hypertension.",
