            "text": "At one side, heat-related illness due to heat stress fortunately can be treated with simple oral rehydration and avoidance of heat source as soon as possible while the symptom is still mild. 8 12 On the other side, recently there is a concern on the subclinical effect of chronic heat exposure, especially to kidney. [13] [14] [15] [16] At first, the risk of kidney disease, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), is thought to be reversible and can be averted with a quick management before progressing to a more severe stage. 8 12 However, several reviews highlight that occupational heat stress possibly causes repetitive subclinical ischaemic kidney injury which may eventually progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD). [13] [14] [15] [16] Without obvious symptom, such kidney injury may progress unnoticeable. Other than this hypothesised direct route, recurrent heat exposure may also indirectly lead to CKD by increasing the risk of kidney stone. 13 17 Appropriate screening can be used as a method for prevention of CKD in high-risk individuals like heatexposed workers. The standard screening tests for CKD are serum creatinine and urine albumin for measurement of kidney function and kidney damage, respectively. 18 However, when serum creatinine or urine albumin levels are abnormal, CKD is already set afoot. Various promising novel biomarkers have been introduced to detect early kidney injury in heat-exposed workers. 19 Two examples of these markers are urinary nephrin and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). Urinary nephrin is used to detect glomerular damages, while urinary KIM-1 is used to detect tubular damages. 20 21 Urinary KIM-1 has been used to detect tubular injury in outdoor heat-exposed workers, while urinary nephrin is mostly used for individuals with glomerular diseases. 19 21 Both tests precede the incident of increased serum creatinine and microalbuminuria. 21 22 The applicability of urinary nephrin and KIM-1 tests for heat-exposed workers is still limited because they are expensive and not widely used in clinical setting. An inexpensive surrogate test, which can accurately detect these early kidney injury biomarkers in heat-exposed workers, is needed. Urine specific gravity perhaps can be the answer. Urine specific gravity is commonly used to detect dehydration with \u22651.020 as cut-off value. 23 24 According to our knowledge, there is no previous research that has studied the ability of urine specific gravity to detect increased urinary nephrin or KIM-1.",

KIM-1 is a glycoprotein which is predominantly expressed in proximal tubule cells of the kidneys. 22 KIM-1 is normally detected in low level in the urine, but may acutely increase in AKI and precede the increase of serum creatinine level. 22 Urinary KIM-1 was associated with incidence of CKD. 22 In our study, there was no case of AKI according to the definition by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes. 26 Therefore, the finding of increased urinary KIM-1 was not related to AKI or decreased eGFR. On the other hand, because increased urinary KIM-1 in our study was associated with albuminuria (p=0.008), it was perhaps more due to albuminuria as shown in previous studies. 27 28 Increased resorption of unfiltered albumin at proximal tubules may damage the tubular cells, which in turn increases urinary KIM-1. 28 Hydration status of the subjects In this study, we used combination of urine specific gravity and serum vasopressin to evaluate hydration status of the subjects. From physiological perspective, heat exposure will increase overall body temperature. To compensate, main cooling mechanism via sweating is activated. 8 However, too much sweating subsequently increases plasma osmolality and stimulates the release of vasopressin into circulation. Vasopressin works in the tubules of kidneys by increasing water absorption from urine compartment. In the end, urine specific gravity increases. 29 In our study, 64.7% of the subjects had increased urine specific gravity \u22651.020, indicating that they were dehydrated. This finding was also complemented by increased serum vasopressin in 66.4% of the subjects.
