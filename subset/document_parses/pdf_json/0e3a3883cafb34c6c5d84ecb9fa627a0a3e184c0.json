An attempt was made to study the clinical profile and risk factors associated with mucormycosis. Materials and methods A retrospective descriptive study was carried out at a tertiary hospital during May 2021-July 2021. After obtaining informed written consent from the participants, various details of all participants, such as diabetes mellitus, use of steroids in COVID-19 treatment, use of immunosuppressant drugs, oxygen therapy, use of ventilators, complications that occurred during treatment, etc., were noted. All mucormycosis patients were treated with amphotericin B and aggressive surgical treatment.",

Despite aggressive surgical debridement along with amphotericin B, mortality was 25.33%. 5.3% of patients had brain abscesses, 8% of patients had cavernous sinus thrombosis, 4% of patients had facial nerve palsy and 1.3% of patients had meningitis.

Various theories are suggested for the occurrence of mucormycosis. Diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia in COVID-19 infection, ketoacidosis and low pH due to acidosis increase chances of mucormycosis. The phagocytic activity of WBC is reduced with the use of steroids, which causes defective bronchoalveolar macrophage migration, ingestion, and phagolysosome fusion, making diabetic patients prone to mucormycosis. Mucormycosis growth occurs on free available iron. Hyperglycemia causes glycosylation of transferrin, ferritin and reduces iron-binding. This increased free iron is favourable for mucormycosis growth. Increased interleukin 6 in COVID-19, increases free iron due to increased synthesis and decreased iron transport. Acidosis increases free iron by reducing the ability of transferrin to chelate iron. Adhesive bandages, wooden tongue depressors, hospital linens, negative pressure rooms, water leaks, poor air filtration, non-sterile medical devices, and building construction are sources of mucormycosis [13] . Mucormycosis is also seen in exposed wounds [14] .",

According to Mehta et al., facial nerve paralysis was occasionally seen in mucormycosis epidemic. Facial nerve palsy may be the alarm for rhinocerebral mucormycosis.

In diabetic patients, arterial resistance may cause oedema of the facial nerve and localized ischemia leading to facial nerve palsy distal to chorda tympani nerve. Involvement of the CNS in mucormycosis occurs due to spread from the paranasal sinuses and orbits in 70% of cases [10] . 30% of cases of CNS involvement were seen in intravenous drug users and hematogenous spread from infected distant sites.
