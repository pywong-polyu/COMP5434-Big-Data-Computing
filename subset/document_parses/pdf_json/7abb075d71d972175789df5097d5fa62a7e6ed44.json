The objective of this study was to evaluate the intentions of US adults to receive the influenza vaccine this flu season (2020-2021). A cross-sectional, population-based survey study of US adults age 18 years and older was distributed in early September 2020. The primary outcome was the intention to receive the flu vaccine assessed with a survey instrument based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. Three-hundred sixty-four adults (59.1% female, 66.5% white), completed the survey. Twenty percent of participants had already received the flu vaccine, 54.3% indicated high probability of getting the flu vaccine this flu season, and 49% would get it at a doctor's office. Concerns regarding adverse effects from the flu vaccine was a major barrier to vaccination and family (58.1%) was the primary influencer in participants' decision to get vaccinated. Participants who indicated that getting the vaccine was beneficial to them and that their doctor thinks they should get the flu vaccine were significantly more likely to have the intent of getting vaccinated. Approximately half of US adults believed that the flu vaccine was beneficial to them and indicated intent to receive the vaccine this flu season. Doctors can help educate patients regarding the limited adverse effects of flu vaccines, and include patients and their families in vaccination discussionsbecause families are influential in the decision-making processto increase flu vaccination uptake.",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were between 39 and 56 million reported flu illnesses leading to 410,000-740,000 hospitalizations, and 24,000-62,000 deaths during the 2019-20 flu season (2019 US Flu Season, 2020 . The CDC also reported that since tracking COVID-19 cases in late January 2020, the US has seen over 32 million reported COVID-19 cases leading to over 570,000 deaths as of May 1st, 2021 (CDC COVID Data Tracker, 2021). These statistics show that while COVID-19 may not be as virulent as the seasonal influenza virus, mortality is significantly higher. COVID-19 has already overwhelmed the healthcare system at its onset, and having a competing epidemic and pandemic in the fall and winter seasons may precipitate another healthcare system overwhelm (Shuster, 2020; Rosenthal et al., 2020) . If this occurs, we may see repeat shortages of hospital beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and medications, increases in burnout among healthcare workers, and increases in patient mortality rates. Therefore, flu vaccinations must be a priority for the United States.",

For the 2019-2020 flu season, only 48.4% of adults aged 18 years and older received the flu vaccine (Flu vaccination coverage, United States, 2020). In vaccinated patients, the risk of contracting the flu decreases by an estimated 40-60 percent (Vaccine Effectiveness, 2020) . In unvaccinated adults, the risk of flu infection ranges from 3.5 to 10.7 percent (Jayasundara et al., 2014; Somes et al., 2018) . Additionally, with COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, emphasis on minimizing going outside, and decline in patients seeing their healthcare providers unless urgent or emergent, the rate of flu vaccination is expected to decrease . In order for healthcare providers and public health officials to determine effective public health interventions to improve flu vaccination rates, baseline understanding of the general population's beliefs and intentions to receive the flu vaccine must be assessed first to have a clear understanding of the severity of vaccine hesitancy during COVID-19.",

Positive correlation with individuals' attitudes (i. e. I believe that the flu vaccine is effective), social norms (i.e. My family thinks I should get the flu vaccine), and perceived behavioral control (i. e. I have the time to get the flu vaccine) are associated with greater intention to complete the health behavior.

The sample size was calculated based on Tabachnick's recommendation of a minimum of 10 participants per predictor variable for analyses that involve associations, such as regression analyses (Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996) . Therefore, with 15 independent variables, the minimum required sample size was 150. A sample size of 250 was agreed upon based on literature. The cover page of the survey included a description of the study that stated, \"The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the general public's beliefs and intentions on receiving the influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" This statement, as well as the survey's administration in early September 2020 before the flu season started, provided the context of possible concurrent flu and COVID virus circulation.

Participants were most likely to be influenced regarding their decision to get the flu vaccine by family, followed by their doctor, with 58.1% and 42.7% ranking it as their number one influencer, respectively. Only 22.6% of participants indicated that their decision would be influenced by a pharmacist, with 23.3% stating that a pharmacist providing education or contacting the participant would influence their decision to get the flu vaccine.",

The intention to receive the vaccine was expressed by more than half (54.3%) of the respondents, with an additional 19.5% of respondents already vaccinated. This percentage is slightly higher than CDC reported flu vaccination rates from the 2019-20 flu season (48.4%), which is promising (Flu vaccination coverage, United States, 2020). It is also higher than reported intentions to receive the flu vaccine according to a similar study conducted by the CDC between September 10th and October 1st; 2020 (Lindley et al., 2020) . In that study, 46.7% reported being absolutely certain or very likely to receive the vaccine, and 12.3% of respondents had already been vaccinated. Results from this study also are higher than another similar study by Mercadante and colleagues conducted between October 23rd and October 29th, 2020 (Mercadanate and Law, 2020) . In that study, 53% of respondents reported either having received or intending to receive the 2020-2021 flu vaccine. Despite higher reported flu vaccination intent this flu season (2020-2021) than the previous flu season (2019-2020), a third of the participants in our study indicated high likelihood of not getting vaccinated. Therefore, increased public health campaigns, targeting both the general public and healthcare providers who administer flu vaccines, should be implemented to promote flu vaccination during COVID-19. The study was also able to identify potential influencers who can sway individuals' decision. Attitude and subjective norms were significant predictors of the intention to receive the flu vaccine. Among the subjective norm items, the doctor's influence was the strongest. This observation aligns with the fact that more than half of the respondents stated that information received from the doctor's office would influence their decision to get the influenza vaccine, and almost half the respondents would likely get the flu vaccine at their doctor's office. Intentions were higher to get the flu vaccine when individuals believed that it was beneficial for them and protected others, which are similar to results found in other studies assessing flu vaccine hesitancy during COVID-19 (Mercadanate and Law, 2020; Jung and Albarracin, 2021) . A doctor's role in educating patients about the benefits of flu vaccination, and encouraging them to get the flu vaccine as part of routine patient care is essential during flu season. Though pharmacies are highly accessible for flu vaccines, only a third of participants indicated that they most likely would get the flu vaccine at the pharmacy, with only one in five participants indicating that a pharmacist could influence their decision to get the vaccine.",

This is similar to findings assessing the likelihood of flu vaccination in asthma patients, where 43% cited fear of adverse effects (Asciak et al., 2013) . Based on our study results, when educating patients on the flu vaccine, patient-specific concerns and negative public perceptions about vaccine adverse effects should be addressed by healthcare providers. This also points to the attitude statement that belief in vaccines was a strong predictor of intention to receiving it. Additionally, getting the vaccine in the previous flu season was a significant predictor of getting the vaccine this flu season. This shows that once educated and vaccinated, the concerns about adverse effects from flu vaccines decrease and individuals have a more positive attitude towards flu vaccines, making it more likely that they continue receiving the vaccine annually.",

For the 2020-2021 flu season, non-pregnant patients aged 2-49 years may be candidates for the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), which is administered intranasally. Additionally, one formulation of the inactivated flu vaccine is available for administration via needle-free injection. Patients who cite fear of needles as a barrier for vaccine administration should be screened for eligibility for one of these alternative administration methods . Those individuals who listed inconvenience as a barrier can be made aware of pharmacies that provide flu vaccinations without an appointment using a public health campaign. Furthermore, healthcare providers should consider offering vaccinations to family members who may be accompanying a patient to their doctor's appointment. Additionally, because family was a significant subjective norm in increasing the likelihood to receive the vaccine, a public health campaign about the benefits of vaccinating everyone in a household can be a conversation starter in families. Among the demographic variables, the only significant variable that influenced the intention to obtain the flu vaccine was Hispanic race. Hispanics were less likely to receive the flu vaccine compared to the whites. According to CDC data from the 2018-2019 influenza season, only 37.1% of Hispanic adults compared to 48.7% of white adults received the flu vaccine (Flu vaccination coverage, United States, 2020). While it is unknown from this survey the rationale for lower intent to obtain the vaccine, this highlights a need for identification of potential barriers and improved education in this patient population .",

Vaccine coverage was highest among physicians, nurses, pharmacists, physician's assistants, and nurse practitioners and lowest among non-clinical health care workers. However, from our study, it is unclear which type of HCPs were included and only 20% of the participants identified themselves as HCPs.

A third issue can be the desirability bias, where respondents may have answered positively to the intention question. Additionally, the questionnaire used the words doctor and doctor's office. Expansion in scope of practice of physician assistants and nurse practitioners allows them to serve as primary care providers who are able to educate patients and encourage receipt of the flu vaccine. Because the terminology, \"doctor\" and \"doctor's office\" were utilized in the survey, it is unclear whether the respondents made the delineation that all primary care providers could be included in these options. SurveyMonkey does not provide the baseline survey population size which was contacted to attain the requested 250 responses in order to determine the response rate.
