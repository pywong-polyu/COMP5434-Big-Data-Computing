While limited reuse of filtering facepiece respirators has been permitted as a crisis capacity strategy, there are currently no standard test methods available for decontamination before their repeated use. The decontamination of respirators can compromise the structural and functional integrity by reducing the filtration efficiency and breathability. Digital segmentation of X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) scans of the meltblown nonwoven layers of a specific N95 respirator model (Venus-4400) after treatment with one and five cycles of liquid hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, and aqueous soap solution enabled us to perform filtration simulations of decontaminated respirators. The computed filtration efficiencies for 0.3 \u00b5m particles agreed well with experimental measurements, and the distribution of particle penetration depths was correlated with the structural changes resulting from decontamination. The combination of X-ray microCT imaging with numerical simulations thus provides a strategy for quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of decontamination treatments for a specific respirator model.",

This highly contagious virus poses a severe risk to the general public and, in particular, to healthcare workers. At the heart of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, healthcare workers face challenges in treating patients and developing short-term and long-term strategies to reduce the spread of infection 2 . To ensure the safety of healthcare workers, it is essential to have sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), including respirators, body protection equipment, facial protection, gloves, shoe covers, head, and neck cover 3 . N95 respirators limit the passage of airborne droplets by blocking at least 95% of very small (0.3 \u03bcm) test particles 4-6 . The use of N95 respirators has been recommended for healthcare workers while caring for COVID-19 patients, specifically when performing procedures such as intubation, extubation, non-invasive ventilation, etc., which generate high concentrations of aerosols 7 . Globally, the unprecedented demand for the N95 respirators has not only led to demand-supply gaps, but extraordinary efforts have been directed in utilizing homemade cloth masks to match the filtration performance 8 . However, a plethora of methodological and analytical problems were later reported, and it was suggested that the commonly used fabrics should not be conflated with the N95 respirators in terms of filtration efficiency 9-11 . Limited reuse of N95 respirators after decontamination has been considered as a crisis capacity strategy.",

However, disinfecting treatments can affect the structural and functional integrity of the filtering material. Therefore, the effectiveness of disinfecting treatments methods has to be evaluated with respect to filtration performance after each decontamination cycle. With advanced imaging techniques, it is now possible to obtain three-dimensional (3D) images of micro-and nano-structured materials with high resolution. However, the accurate characterization of material properties based on images remains challenging due to noise and artifacts in the raw images. Careful image processing and segmentation are necessary for accurate predictions of filtration characteristics, which subsequently assist in simulating the digitally reconstructed fibrous media. In the past, the Digital Materials Laboratory Software (GeoDict\u00ae) has been successfully employed to determine the microstructural characteristics and filtration performance of various kinds of filter media, including nonwoven materials. For instance, Azimian et al. 24 modeled variations of filter media for oil filtration to optimize the fiber volume distribution to increase the dust holding capacity while maintaining a low-pressure drop of the filter element. In addition, the flow and efficiency simulations of aerosol filtration in fibrous media were carried out based on synchrotron X-ray images and found that the results were in good agreement with experimental measurements 25, 26 . Wang et al. 27 investigated the dependency of filtration efficiency and pressure drop on the filter thickness. They reported an exponential relationship for the filter efficiency and a linear relationship for the pressure drop. On the other hand, Wang et al. 28 performed simulations of polyacrylonitrile membranes and observed the change of the particle deposition pattern from surface filtration to deep bed filtration. Maddineni et al. 29 used a numerical approach to investigate the effect of collision and adhesion parameters on the capture efficiency of aerosol particles in fibrous media. In particular, they studied particle bounce and re-entrainment mechanisms and found that the Hamaker adhesion model yielded a good agreement with experimental data for the capture efficiency. Their results suggested that flow re-entrainment can increase particle penetration, and the effect depends mainly on the fiber volume fraction. Bai et al. 30 constructed a layered filter model based on measured fiber dimensions and fiber orientation distributions. They demonstrated that the simulations of the filter efficiency for the digital twin model reproduced the measured values for a real sample. GeoDict has been used in the past to uncover the filtration performance of electret filter media based on their morphology and other physical characteristics without considering the effect of electrostatic charges [31] [32] [33] . Further, GeoDict has successfully generated virtual fibrous media with varying solid volume fraction and orientation distribution and performed simulations to study the dependence of permeability on the microstructural characteristics 34, 35 . In a comprehensive review of theoretical filtration models, Bai et al. 36 compared theoretical, simulated, and experimental data for different filtration mechanisms, including diffusion, interception, and impaction. These previous works show that numerical simulations can be a valuable tool for predicting the filtration performance of nonwoven materials.",

The unavoidable gaps between experiments and simulations stem from the inability to account for the electrostatic charges in the meltblown layers, the shape of the droplets, various interactions, and other uncertainties 31 . The input geometries for the numerical simulations were obtained from X-ray microCT scans, as described in our previous work 38 . Here, we imported the stack of X-ray microCT images into the GeoDict software package to perform numerical simulations of the airflow and particle trajectories through the nonwoven layers.",

The input www.nature.com/scientificreports/ geometries were obtained from X-ray microCT scans, and the simulation model parameters were calibrated for an untreated control sample. To elucidate the effect of the structural heterogeneity on the filtration efficiency of the treated samples, we investigated the flow field and distribution of captured particles within subregions of the digitized samples. In particular, we analyzed how far individual particles penetrated the nonwoven layers before they were caught on a fiber surface. The analysis of five subregions of each sample revealed that structural heterogeneity correlates with considerable variability in the local airflow, particle penetration, and filtration efficiency. For instance, we observed that the effect of structural voids in H 2 O 2 treated samples is offset by compaction of the surrounding fibers such that the overall filtration efficiency is retained. The penetration depth increased after the first cycle for the solutionbased treatments, while the difference before and after one cycle was insignificant for the UV and heat treatments. However, an increase in the penetration depth was observed after five treatment cycles for the latter. Further, the variation of the filtration efficiency between different subregions increased with the number of cycles, particularly for soap treatment. These observations suggest that the local structural heterogeneity of the meltblown layers has a crucial impact on the overall filtration efficiency of N95 respirators. In particular, variation of filtration efficiency across the surface of the respirator is a cause of concern, as regions of low filtration efficiency can compromise the functional integrity. It is thus essential to assess the entire filtration layer of decontaminated respirators.",

            "text": "Whereas the filtration efficiency predicted by the simulations generally agreed well with the trends observed in experiments, the simulated values tended to be higher than the experimental measurement, most notably after five H 2 O 2 and heat treatment cycles. This suggests that besides structural changes, the decontamination www.nature.com/scientificreports/ treatments can alter the physico-chemical properties of the filter material. For H 2 O 2 and heat-treated samples, the changes of pore sizes and fiber orientation in the nonwoven layers may not affect the filtration efficiency as strongly as the surface adhesion properties of the fibers. When investigating the influence of the interaction parameters of the Hamaker model on the simulated filtration efficiency of the control sample, we found that the filtration efficiency was sensitive to both the Hamaker constant and the restitution coefficient. These parameters were tuned to match the filtration efficiency of the control sample and thus, could not capture quantitatively the changes in surface interactions caused by the treatments. Therefore, a deviation of the predicted filtration efficiency from the measured value was inevitable. Future research should focus on a detailed investigation of the adhesion properties after decontamination. Our simulations provided some insights into the potential effect of decontamination treatments on adhesion interactions but their effect on the pressure drop still needs to be investigated in the future. Nevertheless, the relatively good agreement between the predicted and measured filtration efficiency of the UV treated samples indicated that UV treatment did not change the surface adhesion as strongly as heat or H 2 O 2 treatment. Broadly speaking, our results indicate that solution-based treatments are less effective at preserving the structural and functional integrity of the meltblown nonwoven filtration layers of N95 respirators. Although the soap treatment is highly convenient for mask decontamination, our findings demonstrate that the filtration performance of the N95 respirator can be considerably reduced, as also reported elsewhere in the literature 20, 23 . For www.nature.com/scientificreports/ UV-and heat-treated samples, the numerical results confirmed the experimental observation that the filtration efficiency deteriorated less severely with a higher number of treatment cycles. It is worth noting that we have not considered several aspects that are also relevant to respirator performance after decontamination, such as virus inactivation, off-gassing of decontamination chemicals, or fit performance. These factors should be evaluated along with filtration performance when considering respirator reuse. As aforementioned, we analyzed the filtration efficiency for particles of 0.3 \u00b5m at a face velocity of 3.89 m/s that emulates speaking conditions. At this relatively high velocity, the deposition efficiency for diffusive trapping is significantly reduced due to the high Peclet number. Under these conditions, the Stokes number is also high, and therefore impaction and interception are the dominating mechanisms for particle deposition. This is corroborated by the observation that most particles are captured near the inflow surface of the nonwoven layers. The collision models in GeoDict invariably assume that particles remain entrapped by attaching to fiber, and there is no re-entrainment. However, re-entrainment is more likely to occur for agglomerated particle clusters. This would lead to a shift of the distribution towards larger particle sizes that are unlikely to penetrate the whole thickness of the nonwoven layers. Therefore, we consider a negligible effect of re-entrainment on the count of 0.3 \u00b5m particles in the experiments and simulations. We note that the particle transport model used herein does not consider breakup or evaporation that may play a role in aerosol filtration. As refined models for respiratory droplets and saliva plumes are emerging 40,41 , it will be possible to include the interactions of droplets with fibrous ",

The raw X-ray microCT images were imported into GeoDict using the 'ImportGeo-Vol' module. The images were aligned such that the fiber layers were oriented perpendicular to the Z-axis. The imported volume images were then cropped to the volume-ofinterest (VOI), where fibers were present across the whole thickness so that the calculated porosity was not affected by void regions at the borders of the experimental image. The cropped volume was further processed by applying a denoising filter and a non-local means filter to remove speckle noise. The denoising was modulated by three parameters, a patch radius that determined the size of edges, a search window radius that defined the neighborhood around each voxel, and the filter strength that controlled the amount of smoothing. The filtered images were segmented using a threshold segmentation where the threshold was automatically determined using Otsu's method 42 . The parameters for the image processing and segmentation in GeoDict are given in Table S2 . Following the segmentation, the binary structure was further processed by removing unconnected objects smaller than 500 voxels. The properties of the resulting structure were analyzed using the 'FiberFind' module in GeoDict.",

For organic molecules interacting in the air, the Hamaker constants have been found 48 in the range of (4-7) \u00d7 10 \u221220 J.
