In this study, we re-analyzed published scRNA-seq data of COVID-19 patient bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to further classify and compare immunological features according to the patient's disease severity. Patients with severe symptoms showed DNA damage and apoptotic features of epithelial cells. Our results suggested that epithelial damage was associated with neutrophil infiltration. Myeloid cells of severe patients showed higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL8. As a result, neutrophils were abundant in lungs of patients from the severe group. Furthermore, recruited neutrophils highly expressed genes related to neutrophil extracellular traps. Neutrophilmediated inflammation was regulated by glucocorticoid receptor expression and activity. Based on these results, we suggest that severe COVID-19 symptoms may be determined by differential expression of glucocorticoid receptors and neutrophils.",

Currently, a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) study suggested that proinflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages correlate with severe symptoms, and clonally expanded CD8 T cells correlate with moderate symptoms in patients (5) . This study suggested that proper regulation among immune cells is important for the moderate pathogenesis and clearance of viral particles. According to the original study, excess macrophage inflammation and clonal expansion of CD8 T cells are highly related to COVID-19. However, the previously published analysis of other cell types, including neutrophils and B cells, was limited. Therefore, we re-analyzed published scRNA-seq data to further investigate the difference between mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Although recruitment of neutrophils in severe COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS-like symptoms was already known, detailed mechanisms of how neutrophils are regulated and contribute to severe COVID-19 symptoms remain unclear (1) . Therefore, we focused on the mechanism of how myeloid cells and neutrophils damage the airway and induce severe symptoms.",

            "text": "To determine whether COVID-19-mediated epithelial damage was associated with severe inflammation, we first analyzed the expression patterns of proinflammatory cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL1B, IL6, IL12A) were mainly produced by myeloid cells including macrophages, alveolar macrophages, and monocytes (Supplementary Figure S2A) . As expected, these cytokines were more highly expressed by myeloid cells in severe patients than in other patients (Figure 2A) . Thus, we confirmed that cytokine storm-mediated severe inflammation was a signature of severe COVID-19 patients. Not only cytokines, but chemokine expression was also upregulated in severe patients; specifically, recruitment of neutrophils by chemokine was upregulated (Figures 2B-D) . Neutrophilattracting CXCL8 was mainly produced by epithelial and myeloid cells (Figures 2D,E) . Furthermore, CXCL8 expression was highly enriched in severe cases ( Figure 2F) ; however, mild patients showed no increase of CXCL8 compared to healthy controls. These results indicated that neutrophil chemotaxis was induced by severe COVID-19, although infection alone did not induce neutrophil chemotaxis. However, IL17A expression, which is related to neutrophil-mediated immune responses, did not change in severe cases (Supplementary Figure S2B) (7) . Upon further analysis of DEGs in myeloid cells, chemotaxis related genes were also found to be upregulated in eosinophils and monocytes. In addition, negative regulation of the viral process pathway was upregulated in severe patients (Supplementary Figure S2C) . These results suggested that myeloid cells, which were directly infected with SARS-CoV-2, were trying to suppress replication. However, their antigen presenting capacity was downregulated in severe cases (Supplementary Figures S2D,E) . Although, myeloid cells of severe patients produced more cytokines and chemokines because of infection, their ability to activate T cells, a critical part of the antiviral response, was dysregulated at the transcriptional level. Overall, these results are consistent with previous studies emphasizing the role of T cells in eliminating SARS-CoV-2 (5).",

To determine the functional differences between mild and severe Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org patients, we compared the DEGs of neutrophils. When we analyzed neutrophil pathways using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), pathways involving extracellular events, lysosomes, and secretion were upregulated in the severe group (9, 10) ( Figure 3C) . However, pathways related to immune responses and antiviral defense were downregulated (Figure 3D) . These results implied that neutrophils of severe patients were secreting molecules into the extracellular space while antiviral functions were impaired. Neutrophils are known to secrete neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) including DNA and extracellular fibers (11) . Although NETs can protect the host from pathogens, they can also damage organs. Progranulin proteases, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and granule proteins are needed for NETosis. When we compared DEGs in mild and severe disease groups, cathepsin family protein genes (CTSB, CSTD, CTSL) were upregulated in the severe group (Figure 3E ). HIF1A and CYBB expression, which are related to ROS, were also upregulated in the severe group (Figures 3F,G) . As a result, genes for hydrolase activity required for NETs were enriched in the severe group (Supplementary Figure S3A) , as well as genes that are upregulated in infection with bacteria such as F. Tularensis (Supplementary Figures S3B,C) . However, small molecule metabolism-related genes were downregulated in the severe group (Supplementary Figure S3D) . As a result, neutrophil infiltration was positively correlated with lung epithelial damage markers ( Figure 3H) . Taken together, these results showed that neutrophils in the severe disease group were more recruited and activated to make NETs, which related to epithelial damage. However, their metabolism and antiviral responses were dysregulated at the transcriptional level.",

Because glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory activity, they could reduce the cytokine storm and excessive inflammation. We therefore analyzed the possible relationship between glucocorticoid and neutrophil-mediated severity of COVID-19. There was average expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene, NR3C1, in total cells. In the mild disease group, NR3C1 expression was increased over that in healthy controls, but was downregulated in the severe disease group (Figure 4A ). According to previous results, myeloid cell-derived neutrophil chemotaxis is related to COVID-19 disease severity. Thus, we determined NR3C1 expression in myeloid cells and found that NR3C1 expression was upregulated in the mild disease group and downregulated in the severe disease group (Figure 4B) . GR activation is known to suppress CXCL8 production, and we found that NR3C1 expression was negatively correlated with CXCL8 expression (Figure 4C ). As expected, CXCL8 expression was positively correlated with the percentage of neutrophils (Figure 4D) . As a result, NR3C1 expression was negatively correlated with the percentage of neutrophils ( Figure 4E) . Further, according to the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) data, upregulated genes of myeloid cells from the severe disease group were negatively enriched in the gene set of GR activity (Supplementary Figure S4A) . Taken together, these results showed that GR activity and expression were negatively correlated with neutrophil-mediated severe inflammatory features induced by COVID-19.",

Furthermore, we observed that neutrophil-recruiting chemokines such as CXCL8 from myeloid cells were highly increased as the severity increased. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF can increase the expression of CXCL8 and neutrophil chemotaxis (14) . Similarly, the number of neutrophils in blood is higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (1) .

However, whether neutrophils are related to the severity of the disease and the underlying mechanism, remain unclear. Our data may indicate that recruitment of neutrophils and NETosis could contribute to severity of the disease symptoms through epithelial damage. Although neutrophil genes related to NETosis were increased in the severe group, their antiviral defense system was abnormal. Our findings should be confirmed at the protein level. Furthermore, the detailed mechanism regulating neutrophils should be further studied.

Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are known to be anti-inflammatory agents (15) . Glucocorticoid treatment reduces TNF-mediated CXCL8 production, according to a previous study (16) . Despite the importance of glucocorticoids to deal with inflammation, the role and mechanism of glucocorticoids in COVID-19 treatment is unclear. Thus, we analyzed the relationship between neutrophil recruitment and GR expression. Surprisingly, mild patients showed increased GR expression while severe patients showed reduced GR expression, which was similar to the levels in healthy controls. Our results showed that GR expression was negatively correlated with CXCL8 expression and neutrophil recruitment, suggesting that GR expression and activation regulated neutrophil chemotaxis. Thus, using glucocorticoids to treat severe patients might be effective. Because glucocorticoids are anti-inflammatory agents, glucocorticoid treatment during early disease time points might be harmful. However, late treatment could not reverse airway damage. Thus, the protocol schedule for glucocorticoid therapy will be important. IL-8 blockade might be more effective than glucocorticoid treatment, which may be too broad in its targeting, and the efficacy of anti-IL-8 on SARS-CoV-2 is currently being tested in an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04347226).

Because our results showed that GR expression negatively correlated with neutrophil recruitment, the reason that GR expression was differentially regulated is important.
