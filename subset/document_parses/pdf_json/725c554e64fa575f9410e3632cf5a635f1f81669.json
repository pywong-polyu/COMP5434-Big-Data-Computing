Although older people are at lower risk of job loss than the young, they are more likely to remain unemployed after losing their job. 5 Losses in financial markets have reduced the value of superannuation funds, affecting pensions for retired people. 6 Engagement with family and friends has been limited. Internet-based communication and online delivery of mental health interventions offer the potential to redress social and mental well-being impacts, 7 but difficulties with access and computer literacy may exacerbate inequalities in social participation and mental well-being for older people. 8 Grandparents have had to withdraw childminding support for families, or risk exposure to the virus. The impacts of social distancing on family dynamics are unknown, although there are positive reports of community and family initiatives to address the social impacts of the virus. 9 Closure of clinics, swimming pools and gyms may adversely impact levels of physical activity and management of long-term health conditions. Health-care services have cancelled elective surgery and non-urgent clinical care, increasing risk of worsening health in older people. Health services have changed practice to support older people with tele-services, though the effectiveness and uptake of these modes of delivery are not known at the population level.",

The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety identified several areas of need including focusing on caring relationships, including the voices of residents and family, providing clear information to make informed choices about care, improving regulatory arrangements and supporting the aged care workforce. 15 Addressing these needs may also increase resilience to pandemics, although at least in the short term, these questions may be displaced in preference to addressing infection control and the direct impacts of the virus.",
