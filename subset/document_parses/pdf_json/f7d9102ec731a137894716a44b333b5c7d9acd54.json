The rapid outburst of the COVID-19 virus led to a situation that the government had to shut down all the schools and universities and all the teaching activities had to be carried out without physical contact. The universities had one weekend to conduct the transition. The influence of the rapid change in teaching practice was analysed using the feedback of the study program directors, students and academic staff. The main enablers and disablers with the main constraints are presented. Analysis showed that the transition is impeded both by the lack of technological solutions (i.e. remote usage of laboratories) and by human resources (i.e. skills and willingness to conduct the transition by the academic staff). The unique and hopefully non-recurrent situation enables to analyse both the institutional, technological and personal readiness to adapt with the rapid changes in teaching practice. The outcomes of the experience will be used to improve the readiness and competences at all levels at TalTech.",

Nevertheless the university reacted very quickly and launched precise and clear instructions for the academic staff how to carry on with the teaching activities. Two factorsavailability of the support and clear guidance form the Educational Technology Centre and presents of the e-learning support for all compulsory courseswere enabling the transition for the academic staff. For example before the transition in the School of Engineering 94% of all compulsory courses had the required e-learning support. At the university level, the percentage was 88.7 being lowest at the School of Information Technology (69%). The three major disablers for the transition were short time frame, motivation, preparation and willingness of the academic staff and limited or no remote access to the infrastructure (i.e. lab facilities). The enablers and disablers of the transition are listed in Table 1. This paper analyses the possible constraints of such abrupt change in teaching practice to the overall teaching quality and outcome. Potential impact of the transition with the lessons learnt is discussed.",

Figure 3 shows the lecturer's satisfaction about the information exchange and relevance during the crisis and their opinion on the available e-learning environments. It can be concluded that the information exchange at the university was very good. Majority of the lecturers (*91%) rated this with 4 or 5. The average satisfaction was as high as 4.47. The availability of proper e-learning environments was rated high as well (*86% rated with 4 or 5) but the average satisfaction was a little bit lower at 4.23. This is understandable as the rating is more subjective. Real fact based conclusions can be drawn after the examinations. Figure 4 gives a very good overview how the students reacted to the transition. It is good to see that in majority of the classes the students' participation did not change or even improved (75%). Still it has to be reckoned that in 25% of the cases the students' participation decreased. This is not only affected by the crisis. Previous studies on class attendance have shown that the number of attendees decrease during the semester [e.g. 2, 3] . A study carried out in an elite Economics school in Portugal [2] showed that the class attendance decreased from the start of the semester from 84-95% to 49-66%. The percentage of average attendance was more-or-less linearly decreasing throughout the semester. Similar trends were reported in a study performed in Technical University of Denmark taking into account information received from nearly 1 000 undergraduate students [3] . It was shown that the attendance differed based on the students performance but decreased in all performer groups. Therefore it can be concluded that the transition process was successful as majority of the lecturers (75%) did not notice a remarkable decrease in attendance and in some cases the attendance even improved.

It was shown that the successful transition was enabled by the fact that most of the mandatory courses had esupport before the crisis. In addition clear guidelines were present and rapidly prepared by the Educational Technology Center to support the lecturers. It was evident that not all the laboratory measurements and practices could be transferred to online environment in just a few days (or even months). Another constraint was the readiness of lecturers and students to switch to a new teaching method in a blink of an eye.",
