Although many hospitals are already using several advanced technologies and automated devices, the role of hospital nurses has not changed considerably and is, even more, the headline of health care. With the shortage of nurses and the lack of nursing care, patients are at risk of being exposed to dangerous situations [2, 3] . The effects of nurse staffing level and appropriate level of nurse allocation on the quality of nursing care in hospital wards have already been extensively reported [4] [5] [6] . According to a Korean study, patient mortality rates on pneumonia and hemorrhagic septicemia after operations significantly decrease if the nurse staffing level increases [7, 8] . Thus, maintaining the appropriate level of nurse staffing and hiring experienced nurses are important [9] .",

The nurse staffing grades were obtained from the national health insurance administrative dataset, which had been collected by the HIRA. Since November 1999, the MOHW of Korea has introduced the sliding scale of the nursing reimbursement fee for every inpatient care depending on the nurse staffing grades [21] . The grades ranged from 1 to 7 and were calculated by using the nurse-to-patient (or bed) ratio (\"NP ratio\") of hospitals. For example, the grades of a hospital with over 100 beds range from grade 1 with an NP ratio of < 1: 2.5 to grade 7 with a ratio of \u22651: 6.0 or not reporting their nurse staffing levels to HIRA. In detail, the hospitals obtain grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 if the NP ratios were 1: <2.5, 1: 2.5-3.0, 1: 3.0-3.5, 1: 3.5-4.0, 1: 4.0-4.5, 1: 4.5-6.0, and 1: >6.0 or not reporting, respectively. Thus, grade 1 means high nurse staffing level and grade 7 represents low nurse staffing level. In Korea, the number of beds has been applied for Seoul, the Capital of South Korea, whereas the number of patients has been applied for the rest of the areas since 2018. Generally speaking, the NP ratio or patient-to-nurse ratio is a good indicator of the nurse staffing level [18, 22, 23] . In Korea, the grades critically affect the inpatient reimbursement fee per patient per day. If some hospitals get the grade 1, then they will get the full amount of inpatient reimbursement fee with some additional monetary incentives. Thus, every hospital has taken care of nurse staffing grades to attain the full amount of inpatient reimbursement fee. Regarding hospitals having the grade 7, this study separately analyzed them because there were groups of hospitals not reporting nurse staffing levels to HIRA.",

The nurse staffing grades were obtained from the national health insurance administrative dataset, which had been collected by the HIRA. Since November 1999, the MOHW of Korea has introduced the sliding scale of the nursing reimbursement fee for every inpatient care depending on the nurse staffing grades [21] . The grades ranged from 1 to 7 and were calculated by using the nurse-topatient (or bed) ratio (\"NP ratio\") of hospitals. For example, the grades of a hospital with over 100 beds range from grade 1 with an NP ratio of <1: 2.5 to grade 7 with a ratio of \u22651: 6.0 or not reporting their nurse staffing levels to HIRA. In detail, the hospitals obtain grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 if the NP ratios were 1: <2.5, 1: 2.5-3.0, 1: 3.0-3.5, 1: 3.5-4.0, 1: 4.0-4.5, 1: 4.5-6.0, and 1: >6.0 or not reporting, respectively. Thus, grade 1 means high nurse staffing level and grade 7 represents low nurse staffing level. In Korea, the number of beds has been applied for Seoul, the Capital of South Korea, whereas the number of patients has been applied for the rest of the areas since 2018. Generally speaking, the NP ratio or patient-to-nurse ratio is a good indicator of the nurse staffing level [18, 22, 23] . In Korea, the grades critically affect the inpatient reimbursement fee per patient per day. If some hospitals get the grade 1, then they will get the full amount of inpatient reimbursement fee with some additional monetary incentives. Thus, every hospital has taken care of nurse staffing grades to attain the full amount of inpatient reimbursement fee. Regarding hospitals having the grade 7, this study separately analyzed them because there were groups of hospitals not reporting nurse staffing levels to HIRA.",

Thus, the main outcome variable has a numeric scale. As mentioned, Korea has three hospital types, which have individual organizational characteristics. Thus, this study evaluated the general characteristics according to hospital type. To compare these three groups, we cross-tabulated the data by hospital type and analyzed the basic characteristics of hospitals through the analysis of variance between groups. Before the main analysis, we checked the correlations between the independent variables to identify any multicollinearity issues among the independent variables. To deal with multicollinearity issues, we used separate models. For the main analysis, a generalized linear model was used with 95% confidence intervals for each independent variable. The main data were analyzed using the SAS version 9.1. Table 1 lists the general characteristics of the study hospitals. The number of people with COVID-19 quarterly was not the number of hospital patients with COVID-19; instead, it was the number of people with COVID-19 in the areas where each hospital was located. Quarterly nurse staffing levels were the highest in tertiary hospitals and the lowest in small hospitals. In each hospital type, the nurse staffing level after the 1Q increased rather than decreased, indicating that fewer nurses were working at each hospital type after the 1Q. The number of patients with COVID-19 also drastically increased after the 1Q. ",

This study result is remarkable. The COVID-19 pandemic would require more nurses in the ICUs [24] , especially in large hospitals; thus, some nurses would be reallocated from general wards to ICUs, thereby reducing the nurse staffing level in general wards. However, the study found no significant decrease in the nurse staffing level in general wards. This result may be explained by two points. First, given that hospitals might need to move nurses with higher experiences to the ICUs, they might accept nurses from out-of-hospital boundaries to make up for or complement the nurse shortage in the ICUs. If hospitals need to reduce nurses in general wards and increase nurses in ICUs, they would receive a reduced reimbursement amount regarding the nurse staffing level. Consequently, as the second point, the number of general ward nurses might only be slightly reduced. Thus, hospitals would choose an alternative action recruiting additional nurses for ICUs [25] . However, this kind of explanation would also be a conjecture, thereby requiring further research at the national level. Any increased reimbursement insurance policies on ICUs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, some rare possibilities of reduced inpatients could improve the NP ratio.",

Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic might critically affect tertiary hospitals in a way similar to the reasons mentioned above. However, the nurse staffing level of tertiary hospitals even increases the nurse staffing level.

Thus, small hospitals might have a further chance of hiring more nurses or low number of patients. Unlike that in small hospitals, the staffing level in general hospitals did not change, except at 2Q, probably because general hospitals would not have many rooms to take care of patients with COVID-19 compared with the tertiary hospitals [29] .

Another strategy would be introducing telemedicine [31, 32] , which demonstrated similar efficacy with the face-to-face care tool [33] . According to a report on how professional nurses responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea, the Korean Nurses Association, nurse leaders, and volunteer nurses showed numerous systematic actions against COVID-19 [34] . Additionally, individual hospitals took specific actions against the COVID-19 pandemic by themselves [35] [36] [37] . Many nurses also showed endless efforts against the pandemic [38] . These actions would help successfully maintain the nurse staffing level in general wards and adequately control the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea.

First, the ICUs would be the clinical department that is critically affected by the nurse staffing level in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this study focused on general wards. Unless reallocating or moving a large number of nurses to ICUs, identifying the direct impact of the change in nursing staff levels in general wards would be challenging. Second, this study did not use the direct measure of patients with COVID-19 by hospital; instead, a proxy variable, which is a trend of COVID-19 outbreak, was used. To detect the effect of COVID-19 on NP ratio changes, we should have used both the nurse staffing data and the direct patient data with COVID-19 by hospital. To mitigate this limitation, we analyzed the data by hospital size such as tertiary and general hospitals. Third, this study could not compare the 2020 data with the data of previous years, such as 2019. Data comparison by year would have increased the validity of our study data on whether improving the nurse staffing level in 2020 resulted from seasonal variation or any other characteristic in 2020. Unfortunately, this study did not have the opportunity to analyze the data of the previous year.",

First, this study would help us confirm whether hospitals had enough nurse workforces to securely supply appropriate levels of inpatient nursing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, by using nationallevel data reporting mandatory nurse staffing levels directly from almost all the hospitals, the study obtained highly validated study results. The nursing grade data used in this study were based on reimbursement schedules and the nurse-patient (NP) ratio, which was directly reported from and objectively measured by each hospital under the national health insurance program. National data coming from an almost perfect study setting that is separated from other environments were used. No other studies used this kind of study setting. Third, this study would also provide some political grounds on whether the government made the right decision regarding the effective management of patients with COVID-19 and the nurse staffing level. This part will be discussed in the last section, using the study results. Many nations took various actions against the COVID-19 [41] [42] [43] .",

First, this study is one of the first monitoring studies on the nurse staffing level and how the level changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study could verify and confirmed that the nurse staffing level in general wards in Korea did not decrease. Identifying the nurse staffing level of hospitals is important to maintain a certain level of quality of care. Second, this study observed the changes in the NP ratio, which was a national mandatory information that is objectively measured and reported. By using empirically collected national data, this study has high validation in terms of measuring the changes in nurse staffing levels. Third, this study used a large national dataset targeting hospital populations with more than 30 beds. The percentage of tertiary hospitals and general hospitals included in this study was 100% and 95%, respectively.",

First, although these changes might have resulted from seasonal variation or other unknown factors, the COVID-19 impact clearly has existed by observing various pandemic social and economic impacts. Hence, the government should start conducting research with more accurate data by linking the nurse staffing level to the number of patients with COVID-19 in hospitals. Investigating the direct effect of COVID-19 on the staffing level of ICUs is also necessary, considering that our study only investigated the changes in nurse staffing levels in the general wards of hospitals. Second, the government should also prepare for alternative action plans in dealing with nursing shortages when another infectious pandemic comes. Third, the government needs to prepare for action plans such as increasing the teleconsultation or referral systems of patients to transfer to areas with fewer COVID-19 cases to efficiently respond to the unknown impact of infectious diseases.
