            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is a widespread and deadly public health crisis. The pathogen SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the lower respiratory tract and causes fatal pneumonia. Although tremendous efforts have been put into investigating the pathogeny of SARS-CoV-2, the underlying mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its host is largely unexplored. Here, by comparing the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and human, we identified five fully conserved elements in SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were termed as \"human identical sequences (HIS)\". HIS are also recognized in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Meanwhile, HIS-SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved in the primate. Mechanically, HIS-SARS-CoV-2, behaving as virus-derived miRNAs, directly target to the human 2 / 26 genomic loci and further interact with host enhancers to activate the expression of adjacent and distant genes, including cytokines gene and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), a well-known cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), which further increases hyaluronan formation. Noteworthily, hyaluronan level in plasma of COVID-19 patients is tightly correlated with severity and high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may act as a predictor for the progression of COVID-19. HIS antagomirs, which downregulate hyaluronan level effectively, and 4-Methylumbelliferone (MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, are potential drugs to relieve the ARDS related ground-glass pattern in lung for COVID-19 treatment. Our results revealed that unprecedented HIS elements of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to the cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Thus, blocking HIS-involved activating processes or hyaluronan synthesis directly by 4-MU may be effective strategies to alleviate COVID-19 progression.",

When HIS-SARS2-1 RNA and its target ssDNA (HIS-SARS2-1 DNA-S, S represents sense strand) were hybridized, the absorbance significantly decreased compared with the theoretically calculated and the mixed (before hybridization) group, indicating that HIS-SARS2-1 can hybridize its target DNA and form double strands (Figure5A).

We accessed the interaction between human AGO2 (hAGO2) and HIS-SARS2-1 DNA-S, HIS-SARS2-1 dsDNA, HIS-SARS2-1 RNA-DNA-Hybrid by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) assay. It showed that hAGO2 could partially bind to HIS-SARS2-1 DNA-S in high hAGO2 concentration (Figure5C), while the interaction between hAGO2 and HIS-SARS2-1 dsDNA or HIS-SARS2-1 RNA-DNA-Hybrid was more intense (Figure5D&E), which was verified in a fixed concentration of hAGO2 (Figure5F). We simulated the hAGO2 binding curves of these three forms of nucleic acid and calculated the corresponding dissociation constant (Kd). It clearly demonstrated that HIS-SARS2-1 RNA-DNA-Hybrid has the smallest Kd, indicating the strongest binding ability.

For example, one of the vsRNAs derived from enterovirus 71 (EV71) inhibits viral translation and replication via targeting its internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) (Weng et al., 2014) . Conversely, influenza A virus-generated vsRNAs promote virus RNA synthesis (Perez et al., 2010) . Except for the regulation of virus replication, vsRNAs also play a key role in regulating host response and disease processes. For instance, repression of LMP2A by miR-BART22 derived from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protects the infected cells from host immune surveillance (Lung et al., 2013) . Moreover, vsRNAs can mediate the silencing of host genes in Caenorhabditis elegans (Guo et al., 2012) , and SARS-CoV virus N gene-derived small RNA (vsRNA-N) could enhance the lung inflammatory pathology (Morales et al., 2017) .

Besides, these virus fragments containing HIS can increase the H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) enrichment at their corresponding regions of the human genome in different mammalian cells and activate the expression of adjacent and distant genes associated with inflammation.

To investigate the underlying interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host, we analyzed the sequence conservation between the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (accession number NC_045512) and human (GRCh38/hg38). Considering that the shortest regulatory RNAs derived from human genome are 19~21 nt miRNAs; thus, we set the length range of conserved sequences as greater than 20bp and the matching rate as 100%. Surprisingly, we identified five fully conserved sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure1A), which were collectively termed as \"Human Identical Sequences (HIS)\". HIS-SARS-CoV-2-1 (abbreviated as \"HIS-SARS2-1\") and HIS-SARS2-2 were located in chr3 (Figure1B), while HIS-SARS2-3, HIS-SARS2-4, and HIS-SARS2-5 in chr5, chr18, chrX, respectively (FigureS1A).",

Furthermore, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the neighboring (\u00b1500kb) genes of HIS showed that they were enriched in cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and muscle contraction (Figure1D), consistent with the proposals that modulation of cGMP-PKG by the inhibitor of its upstream regulator phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which is highly expressed in airways and vascular smooth muscle, could be a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients (Giorgi et al., 2020) . Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that they were enriched in vascular smooth muscle contraction and protein import into the mitochondrial matrix (FigureS1C), consistent with the recent reports that mitochondria might play a vital role in COVID-19. For instance, cytokine storm could induce iron dysfunction, such as hyperferritinemia, which can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, and finally cause mitochondrial dysfunction, platelet damage, apoptosis. Abnormal platelets will cause clotting events and thrombus formation (Saleh et al., 2020) .

We presumed that HIS might also exist in mediator hosts. To explore the distribution of HIS-SARS-CoV-2 across species, we analyzed the sequences of 19 species, including eight primates (human, rhesus, crab-eating macaque, baboon, green monkey, marmoset, squirrel monkey, bushbaby), squirrel, mouse, rat, pig, cat, dog, four bats (megabat, David's myotis bat, microbat, big brown bat) and chicken (The accession number for each species mentioned here refers to TableS1).

Indeed, SARS-CoV-encoded small viral RNAs (svRNAs) targeted 3\u2032UTR of specific transcripts and repressed mRNA expression (Morales et al., 2017) . Also, the function of small regulatory RNAs is largely dependent on their subcellular locations. It was predicted that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was highly enriched in the host nucleolus and mitochondria . Previously, our team revealed that miRNA could be allocated in the nucleus and target enhancer for gene activation (Xiao et al., 2017; Zou et al., 2017) .

We transfected them into transformed human embryonic kidney cell HEK293T, human fetal lung fibroblast cell MRC5, and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC), and detected the expression of surrounding as well as the distant genes. The expression level of coronavirus fragments was verified by qPCR (FigureS5A&B&C) . FBXO15, TIMM21, and CYB5A lie the upstream of targeted locus of HIS-SARS2-4; among them, FBXO15 was upregulated when HIS-SARS2-4 was transfected in HEK293T (Figure3A), MRC5 (Figure3B), and HUVEC (Figure3C); meanwhile, TIMM21 and CYB5A upregulated in HEK293T (Figure3A) and MRC5 (Figure3B), respectively. As an E3 ligase subunit, FBXO15 impairs mitochondrial integrity and induces lung injury in pneumonia . Both TIMM21 (Mick et al., 2012) and CYB5A (Plitzko et al., 2013) encode the components of mitochondrial membrane, implying their fundamental roles in mitochondria, the dysfunction of which is tightly correlated with COVID-19 pathogenesis (Saleh et al., 2020) . Similarly, HIS-SARS2-1 overexpression upregulated the upstream gene KALRN in HEK293T cell (FigureS5D). KALRN plays a significant role in the development of sarcoidosis (Besnard et al., 2018) , a systemic inflammatory disease involved in multiple organs throughout the body, including the kidney and lungs, implying KALRN may get involved in inflammatory response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Except for the adjacent genes, HIS can also upregulate distant genes. The transfected HIS-SARS2-3 upregulated MYL9 in HEK293T and MRC5 (Figure3D) and EPN1 (Figure3E) in MRC5 and HUVEC (Figure3F) . MYL9 was demonstrated to be a functional ligand for CD69 that regulate airway inflammation (Hayashizaki et al., 2016) . These data suggest HIS contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis by upregulating the adjacent or distant genes, which may cause mitochondrial dysfunction or participate in the inflammatory response.",

Transfection of HIS-SARS-1 could also activate neighboring genes, such as HAS2, ZHX2, and DERL1 in HEK293T (FigureS5E), MRC5 (FigureS5F), and HUVEC (FigureS5G). Importantly, HAS2 encodes the critical enzyme for the production of hyaluronan, which is a kind of glycosaminoglycan that plays a fundamental role in the inflammatory response. The accumulation of hyaluronan in the lung has been recognized in ARDS for more than three decades (Hallgren et al., 1989) . Besides, ARDS is the most typical clinical manifestation of severe COVID-19 cases (Guan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) . In that, it's natural to testify whether HIS-SARS2 could activate HAS2. Surprisingly, we found HIS-SARS2-3 and HIS-SARS2-4 could activate the expression of HAS2 about 2 ~4 folds in HEK293T (Figure3G) and MRC5 (FigureS5H); however, the expression of HAS2 was upregulated more than ten folds in HUVEC (FigureS5I), suggesting that small vascular cell may be the main target of SARS-COV2 infection. In this case, HIS might largely explain most clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients, including ARDS and microvessels injury, by upregulating HAS2 and the level of hyaluronan, which receives very limited attention in COVID-19 progression.",

It clearly showed that HIS fragments could induce the enrichment of H3K27ac at HIS targeted loci (Figure4A). H3K27ac marks enhancer or super-enhancer, which is critical for gene activation. This indicates that HIS regulated gene activation is largely dependent on activating the targeted enhancers. JQ1 is a potent inhibitor of the BET family proteins, which functions by binding to H3K27ac. After the treatment of JQ1, the upregulation of HIS targeted genes was abolished (Figure4B&C&D), which was also the case in HIS-SARS-1 (FigureS6A), further supporting that HIS mediated gene regulation is achieved through enhancer. To further confirm whether HIS were indispensable for gene activation, we knocked down the HIS expression by Cas13d and found the activation of targeted genes was abolished (Figure4E&F&G), which was also the case in HIS-SARS-1 (FigureS6B), indicating the specificity of HIS for regulating host gene. The behaviors of HIS-SARS2 RNA are highly similar to our previously identified NamiRNAs, which activate genes as enhancer triggers in the nucleus (Xiao et al., 2017; Zou et al., 2017) . Overall, these data suggest that HIS activates the host gene through the NamiRNA-enhancer network.",

In severe patients, the mean value of hyaluronan (80.39ng/mL) (Figure6B) was significantly higher than that in mild patients (5.70ng/mL), which was supported by the recent report that hyaluronan level was higher in severe patients (Ding et al., 2020) . Hyaluronan can encompass a large volume of water, which enable it to determine the water content in specific tissues (Turino and Cantor, 2003) . It has been reported that the extravascular lung water volume is positively correlated with hyaluronan level in normal animal lungs (Bhattacharya et al., 1989) . In that, the water absorption characteristics of hyaluronan rationalize the possibility that increased hyaluronan, which was induced by the upregulated HAS2 in lung cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, bind lots of water and form jellylike substances, underlying the ground-glass opacity commonly occurred in COVID-19 patients. Besides, higher level of hyaluronan in severe patients' plasma suggests hyaluronan may act as a predictor of COVID-19 progression, especially when physicians making a quick decision in the clinic for patients who will need critical medical care.",

For example, humans and chimpanzees are the known unique hosts to be infected naturally by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Sandmann and Ploss, 2013) . Notably, the liver is the principal site of HCV infection. The pathogenesis of HCV infectioncausing progressive liver diseases is thought to be an uncontrolled inflammatory response within the change of inflammatory cytokines . Of note, not all the infection of viruses is virulent for their hosts. One of the typical examples is that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is pathogenic only for human, and does not affect the health of the primary host (Nomaguchi et al., 2012) . Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection in human results in COVID-19 without being fatal for its other potential hosts, including bats and pangolins (Xiao et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . By comparing different primates with SARS-CoV-2 genome, we found five conserved fragments with high similarity in human. Interestingly, the conserved fragments were discovered between SARS-CoV-2 and their hosts, including bats. Moreover, we also identified HIS between other highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses (such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and different primates. Consistent with these points, HIS was found within other pathogenic viruses, including avian influenza virus, swine flu virus, rabies virus, coxsackievirus, influenza A virus, HIV, Ebolavirus, and Zika virus (TableS4). Therefore, it is a universal phenomenon that the conserved fragments, which were termed here as \"host identical sequences (HIS)\", are ubiquitous between viruses and their hosts, implying HIS could be the determinants of viral susceptibility and pathogenicity. In this case, it is natural to speculate that HIS from the pathogen genome may help to trace the lines of the host, especially for the mediated host during SARS-CoV-2 virus evolution. Since HIS activate host genes through enhancer and enhancer is well known for its tissue-specific signature, it is paramount to investigate the virus-host cell interaction and to understand why viruses usually show organ or tissue-specific pathogenesis.",

            "text": "In recent years, multiple DNA and RNA viruses have been demonstrated to produce miRNA-like non-coding RNAs (Mishra et al., 2019) . Surprisingly, bioinformatics analysis revealed that the fragments containing HIS in SARS-CoV-2 could produce the primary structure of precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). We have previously clarified that miRNAs can activate genome-wide gene transcription by targeting enhancers (Xiao et al., 2017) . Excitingly, further bioinformatics analysis (Betel et al., 2010) indicated that enhancers of lung targeted by these HIS could regulate 298 genes (TableS5) overlapping with recently published transcriptome sequencing data of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in COVID-19 patients (Xiong et al., 2020) , implying HIS probably play a key role during the progression of COVID-19. An increasing number of researches point to SARS-CoV-2 infection as causing multiple organ damage involved in the lung, kidney, and liver by activating inflammation response (Wiersinga et al., 2020) . Additionally, the fibrinolytic system in COVID-19 patients is also destroyed by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Levi et al., 2020) . To confirm whether HIS affect inflammation in these organs, different fragments of HIS were transfected in selected human cell lines, including HEK293T, MRC5, HUVEC. Interestingly, HIS-SARS2-1 can upregulate the expression of its upstream KALRN in HEK293T, which contributes to the development of sarcoidosis (Besnard et al., 2018) , causing a systemic inflammatory in multiple organs such as kidney and lungs. Alternatively, the adjacent gene FBXO15 and the distant gene MYL9 were increased by transfected HIS-SARS2-3 and HIS-SARS2-4 in HEK293T. Of note, both FBXO15 and MYL9 are closely related to inflammation response Hayashizaki et al., 2016) . Similarly, HIS-SARS2-4 promoted the expression of its upstream gene CYB5A and FBXO15 in MRC5. Consistent with these results, HIS in SARS-CoV also activate neighboring genes, such as HAS2, ZHX2, and IGF2R. Collectively, all the above evidence emphasizes that HIS can indeed cause inflammation response by activating gene expression, supporting this novel mechanism underlying the viral pathogenicity. miRNAs can activate gene transcription epigenetically by increasing H3K27ac enrichment at their target enhancers in our previous study (Xiao et al., 2017) . Interestingly, ChIP-qPCR confirmed that H3K27ac was enriched in the HIS-SARS2-4 region of the human genome by the corresponding HIS fragment in HEK293T. Then we treated HIS-SARS2-4 HEK293T cell with JQ1, which is an inhibitor of BRD4, resulting in the preferential loss of enhancer (Loven et al., 2013) . Meanwhile, blocking H3K27ac with JQ1 remarkably downregulated FBXO15 expression in HEK293T, suggesting enhancer is essential for HIS mediated gene activation. To investigate the specificity of this activation process, we designed the antagomir against HIS-SARS2-4 and found that FBXO15 was decreased in HIS-SARS2-4 transfected HEK293T cell, which was further confirmed by degrading the HIS-SARS2-4 with CasRx system for efficiently and functionally knocking down targeted genes . As AGO2 may serve as a guide mediating the binding of miRNAs to their enhancers, resulting in gene activation (Liang et al., 2019) , we found that AGO2 was also involved in HIS induced host gene activation. Clearly, HIS-SARS2-4 RNA could hybridize its target ssDNA and form stable double strands, which can be stabilized by hAGO2 by reducing dissociation constant (Kd), supporting that AGO2 guiding the binding of miRNA on their target enhances. These results demonstrate that HIS can activate gene transcription epigenetically, and inhibition or degradation of HIS may act as a new strategy for controlling the virus-induced disease.",

            "text": "Importantly, we identified that hyaluronan could be a novel target for COVID-19 treatment. At first, HAS2 located on the upstream of HIS targeted site in the human genome attracted our interest, the major enzyme responsible for hyaluronan synthesis (Csoka et al., 2001) . Accumulation of hyaluronan is closely associated with ARDS (Hallgren et al., 1989) , the typical symptom in patients of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV infection. As expected, HIS-SARS-CoV and HIS-SARS2 can activate dramatically HAS2 expression in host cells, causing the upregulation of hyaluronan in cell medium supernatant. Clinically, hyaluronan is significantly increasing in severe COVID-19 patients with ground-glass opacity by the chest CT scan, and the level of hyaluronan is correlated with the clinical prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Ding et al., 2020) . Interestingly, decreased lymphocytes, increased D-Dimer and C-reactive protein show up more often in severe patients compared to mild patients distinguished by their hyaluronan level, which is in surprising unanimity with the pathological features of ICU COVID-19 patients . In other words, hyaluronan level alone could be an indicator for characterizing the clinical progression of COVID-19 patients. Notably, the total number of T cells reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients compared to the normal levels (Qin et al., 2020) . Such discrepancies may be owing to the binding of hyaluronan and its ligand CD44, which can induce the death of activated T cells (McKallip et al., 2002) . Another ligand HABP2 (also called factor VII-activating protease), which conjugate with hyaluronan, plays an important role in blood coagulation by activating the pro-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (Kanse et al., 2008) , which may cause the dysregulation of the fibrinolytic system in COVID-19 patients. In addition, HABP2 aggravates the disruption of the hyaluronan -mediated endothelial cell barrier (Mambetsariev et al., 2010) , which may explain well the sudden brain hemorrhage of ICU patients with COVID-19 ( Barrios-Lopez et al., 2020) . Further studies will be performed to elucidate the latent mechanism of hyaluronan causing these clinical characteristics during the progression of COVID-19. 4-Methylumbelliferone is reported to be an efficient inhibitor for hyaluronan production (Nagy et al., 2015) . 4-MU treatment can reverse the upregulation of hyaluronan in response to HIS in HEK293T and MRC5. Additionally, hyaluronan level was also decreased in HEK293T after the treatment of hymecromone, which is one of the commercially available hyaluronan inhibitor drugs for cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and cholecystectomy syndrome in China. Overall, decreasing hyaluronan could improve most of the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients and serve as a promising therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 and other related diseases.",
