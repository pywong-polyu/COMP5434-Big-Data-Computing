            "text": "Motivated by the recent outbreak of coronavirus , we propose a stochastic model of epidemic temporal growth and mitigation based on a timemodulated Hawkes process. The model is sufficiently rich to incorporate specific characteristics of the novel coronavirus, to capture the impact of undetected, asymptomatic and super-diffusive individuals, and especially to take into account time-varying counter-measures and detection efforts. Yet, it is simple enough to allow scalable and efficient computation of the temporal evolution of the epidemic, and exploration of what-if scenarios. Compared to traditional compartmental models, our approach allows a more faithful description of virus specific features, such as distributions for the time spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g., mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding light onto several effects related to mobility restrictions introduced by the government, and to the effectiveness of contact tracing and mass testing performed by the national health service. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 20 parable to that of an individual infection, and we believe it is essential to address fundamental questions such as: i) when and to what extent can we expect to see the effect of specific mobility restrictions introduced by a national government at a given point in time? ii) what is the impact of hard vs partial lockdowns enforced for given numbers of days? when can restrictions be safely released 25 to restart economic and social activities while still keeping the epidemic under control? Specifically, we propose and analyse a novel, modulated version of the marked Hawkes process, a self-exciting stochastic point process with roots in geophysics 2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof and finance [10]. In a nutshell, in the standard marked Hawkes process each 30 event i with mark m i , occurring at time t i , generates new events with stochastic intensity \u03bd(t \u2212 t i , m i ), where \u03bd(\u00b7, m i ) is a generic kernel. The process unfolds through successive generations of events, starting from so-called immigrants (generation zero). In our model events represent individual infections, and a modulating function \u00b5(t), which scales the overall intensity of the process at 35 real time t, allows us to take into account the impact of time-varying mobility restrictions and social distance limitations. In addition, we model the transition of infected, undetected individuals to a quarantined state at inhomogeneous rate \u03c1(t), to describe the time-varying effectiveness of contact tracing and mass testing.",

In particular [16, 17, 18] propose stationary and nonstationary Hawkes models (i.e., Hawkes processes with time-varying kernels) to model the outbreak of several epidemics, such as Ebola and COVID-19. In [19] 45 authors proposed a first comparison of SIR, SEIR, and Hawkes (with Gamma or Weibull kernels) to forecast the spread of COVID-19. In [20] a comparison between SEIR and Hawkes (with a non-parametric estimate of the kernel) was done for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The authors show that, in general, Hawkes predictions are more accurate, leading to lower root mean square errors 50 (RMSE). With respect to previous models based on Hawkes processes, the main novelty of our approach is the use of a marked Hawkes process, where the mark encodes different classes of infected and variable durations of stages, together with the application of a continuous modulating function to the conditional process intensity. 55 In [21], a probabilistic extension of (deterministic) discrete-time SEIR models, based on multi-type branching processes, has been recently applied to COVID-19 to capture the impact of detailed distributions of the time spent in different phases, together with mobility restrictions and contact tracing.

            "text": "Models of epidemic propagation are especially useful when they provide key insights while retaining simplicity and generality. For example, in mathematical epidemiology the SIR model reveals in very simple terms the fundamental role of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) which governs the macroscopic, long-term 5 evolution of the outbreak in a homogeneous population. The vast majority of models developed for the novel SARS-CoV-2 are extensions to the classic SIR, along the standard approach of introducing additional compartments to describe different phases of the infection, the presence of asymptomatic, symptomatic or pauci-symptomatic individuals, the set of quarantined, hospitalized people, and 10 so on. Such models lead to a system of coupled ODE's with fixed or time-varying coefficients to be estimated from traces. A very incomplete list of modeling efforts pursued in this direction, early applied to COVID-19, includes the SEIR models in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] , the SIRD models in [6, 7] , the SEPIA model in [8] , the SIDHARTE model in [9] . 15 In this paper we adopt a different approach that allows a more accurate representation of native characteristics of a specific virus, such as actual distributions of the duration of incubation, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases, for various categories of infected. This level of detail is important when the intensity of applied countermeasures varies significantly over time-scales com-for parameter inference. The work in [23] is somehow orthogonal to us, since they focus on spatial and demographic features, aiming at predicting the trend of confirmed cases and deaths in each county. In contrast, we introduce marks and stages to natively model the course of an infection for different categories of individuals, with the fundamental distinction between real and detected cases. 70 Moreover, we take into account the impact of time-varying detection efforts and contact tracing. At last, we obtain analytical expressions for the first two moments of the number of individuals who have been infected within a given time.",

To apply their method, we used a generation time obtained from a Gamma distribution 475 with mean 6.6 (shape 1.87, scale 0.28), which has been proposed for the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy [37] . Interestingly, though both estimates of R(t) exhibit qualitatively the same behavior, the model-based value of R(t), which considers also undetected cases, tends to be smaller. In Figure 10 we investigate instead the impact of detection rate \u03c1(t), by changing its slope \u03b1 (recall Fig. 5) . We report both the number of real cases 495 and the number of detected cases predicted by the model, when all other fitted parameters are kept the same. We consider what would have occurred with \u03b1 = 0 (which means that infectious people are never tested), and by doubling the intensity of the detection rate (a tracking system twice more efficient). As expected, with \u03b1 = 0 only symptomatic cases (p s = 6%) are eventually detected. We observe that the number of daily deaths is similar between the two waves.",

It also suggests that, differently from the first wave, the impact of \u03c1(t) (the individual rate at which an infectious is detected) is expected to be much more important during the second wave than in the first wave, requiring a careful treatment of it in the model.",

By amplifying the number of infections leading to death by the inverse of the mortality rate we eventually obtained an estimate of the daily increment of real cases, as reported in Fig. 11 (green curve, left y-axes). 540 We chose August 1st (day 160 on Fig. 11 ) as starting date of the new infection process producing the second wave in Italy. This time, instead of manually searching for suitable profiles of \u00b5(t) and \u03c1(t) generating the expected curves of real and detected cases, we adopted a novel \"reverse-engineering\" approach: we took the daily increments of real and detected cases as input to 545 the model, and computed the functions \u00b5(t) and \u03c1(t) that would exactly produce in the model the given numbers of real and detected cases, on each day 6 .",

Indeed, we observe that, during the first month, the epidemic was closely tracked by the national health system, but at some point, around day 30, the curve of detected cases stops increasing, and stays roughly constant during the entire second month, lagging more and more behind the otherwise exploding curve of 570 real cases (time window 30-60). As consequence, function \u03c1(t), which describes the effectiveness of individual tracking, falls down to a minimum reached at around day 60. This behavior can be interpreted as an effect of the saturation of the capacity to perform swabs, resulting in a progressive collapse of the tracking system, as actually experienced by many people during those days. 575 Our analysis shows that, in contrast to what might be believed by just looking at the curve of detected cases, September (days 30-60) was, perhaps, the most critical period for the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.",

Then, there is a crucial pre-symptomatic period, during which infected in classes {s, h} already exert a high infection rate \u03bb high , while infected in class a still exert low infection rate \u03bb low . For simplicity, we have assumed the presymptomatic phase to have constant duration w.The following evolution of the infection rate of an individual depends on 310 the class: since we assume that symptomatic people get effectively quarantined, they no longer infect other individuals after the onset of symptoms. We model this fact introducing a quarantined class of people (denoted by q), and deterministically moving all infected in class s to class q after time I + w.People in classes {a, h} continue to be infectious during a disease period of 315 random duration D, with given cdf F D (). The difference between these two classes is that infectious in class a (h) exert, during the disease period, infection rate \u03bb low (\u03bb high ), respectively. At last, we assume that people in classes {a, h} enter a residual period of random duration E, with cdf F E (), during which all of them exert infection rate \u03bb low .

Remark 5.2. The use of 'classes' and 'stages' in our model is similar to the classical approach of introducing compartments in models stemming from the basic SIR of Kermack and McKendrick. The fundamental difference is that in our marked Hawkes model we can consider arbitrary distributions for the time 340 spent in stages, and account for the non-homogeneous intensity of offsprings generated by an infected during a stage. Moreover, note that an Hawkes process has a rich (non Markovian) stochastic structure, whereas compartmental models are usually analyzed by ordinary differential equations.",

The impact of countermeasures is taken into account in the model in two different ways. First, modulating function \u00b5(t) can be used to model the instantaneous reduction of the infection rate at time t due to the current mobility restrictions, and, more in general, changes in the environment which affect the 355 ability of the virus to propagate in the susceptible population (such as seasonal effects). Typically, \u00b5(t) is a decreasing function in the initial part of the epidemics, in response to new regulations introduced by the government, while it goes up again when mobility restrictions are progressively released.Second, we assume that any infected not already found to be positive is 360 tested (e.g., by means of massive swab campaigns) at individual, instantaneous rate \u03c1(t), which reflects both the amount of resources employed by the health J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof service to discover the infected population, and the effectiveness of tracking.Recall that, when an infected is found positive, we assume it transits to the quarantined state q and stops infecting other people.

Model fitting for the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy390    We fit the model to real data related to the spread of COVID-19 in Italy, publicly available on GitHub[29]. Italy was the country where the epidemics first spread outside of China into Europe, causing about 34600 deaths at the end of June 2020 during the first wave.Our main goal was to match the evolution of the number of detected cases, 395 represented in the model by individuals in class q. The actual count is provided by the Italian government on a daily basis since February 24th 2020. We take this date as our reference day zero. However, it is largely believed that the epidemics started well before the end of February. Indeed, it became soon clear that detected cases were just the top of a much bigger iceberg, as the prevalence 400 of asymptomatic infection was initially largely unknown, which significantly complicated the first modeling efforts to forecast the epidemic evolution. During June-July 2020, a blood-test campaign (aimed at detecting IgG antibodies) was conducted on a representative population of 64660 people to understand the actual diffusion of the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy[30]. As a main 405 result, it has been estimated that 1 482 000 people have been infected. This figure provides a fundamental hint to properly fit our model, and indeed while exploring the parameter space we decided to impose that the total number of predicted cases at the end of June (day 120) is roughly 1 500 000.For the durations I,w,D,E of the different stages of an infection, we have 410 tried to follow estimates in the medical literature. In particular, the duration of the incubation period is believed to range between 2 and 12 days, with a sort of bell shape around about 5 days [31, 32, 33], which we have approximated, for simplicity, by a (asymmetric) triangular distribution with support [Moreover, we have fixed the duration of the pre-symptomatic phase 415 to 2 days. For the duration of the disease period we have taken a uniform distribution on[2,12], while the residual time is modeled by an exponential distribution with mean 10 days[34].The other virus-related parameters have been set as reported in the third column ofTable 1. Note that, since we further apply the external modulating 420 function \u00b5(t), we could arbitrarily normalize to 1 the value of \u03bb high , while we set \u03bb low = 0.05.",
