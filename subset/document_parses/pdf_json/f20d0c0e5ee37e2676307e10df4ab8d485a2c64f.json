More than any other mode of transportation (ocean or ground), air transport has benefited from advanced technological innovations, which have had a revolutionary effect on long-distance travel. However, with these advancements have come to some challenges. For example, the risk of global pandemic transmission has increased in recent years (Brockmann and Helbing, 2013) in part due to the airline industry with regard to diseases such as MERS in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012) and Ebola in 2014. (Bogoch et al., 2015) . In response authorities must enforce lockdown or travel restrictions to block the disease-spreading pathways; however, the impact and social cost of these policies must be evaluated.",

In the first few months of 2020, the disease spread rapidly to almost every country and led to extraordinary and previously inconceivable travel bans and lockdowns (Maneenop and Kotcharin, 2020; Monmousseau et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Suzumura et al., 2020) . The reactions of countries to the emergence of COVID-19 were quite diverse. When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic in Mach 2020), most countries were placed under partial or even full mobility/flight restrictions, which limited international travel considerably (Monmousseau et al., 2020) . Although travel restrictions and flight cancellations slowed down the spread of COVID, they severely disrupted various aspects of the transportation system (Maneenop and Kotcharin, 2020; Monmousseau et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Suzumura et al., 2020) .",

Due to the fact that many researchers (Iacus et al., 2020; Ni\u017eeti\u0107, 2020) only used graphs and descriptive statistics to roughly evaluate the potential reduction of flights during COVID-19, this study utilized the spatial analysis of the Origin-Destination (O-D) flow to get more detailed results. The O-D flow here is determined as the number of direct flights that are traveling between origin and destination airports within a specific time interval (Tennekes and Chen, 2021) . Only a few studies Suzumura et al., 2020) have been able to illustrate the airline flow changes and detect airport network trends because, in part, they didn't check the airport popularity/ranking changes specifically. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 on passenger volume, the number of flights, and airport network connectivity.",

            "text": "In this study, two different approaches were used to identify the differences in airline O-D flow characteristics before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to the fact that it is very difficult to identify changes in airline flow with illustrations using the entire dataset, a Clustering Large Application (CLARA) was implemented to group all airline O-D flow into several clusters based on their characteristics in both study periods. Our hypothesis states that some variables affect COVID-19's impact on O-D flow, such as distance, domestic/international flights, or if the origin or destination point is connected to China or not. The impact before and during the pandemic were evaluated based on passenger volume and the number of flights. In addition, four centrality measurements were used to analyze the pandemic changes in networks, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness centrality. These indices can illustrate the importance of an airport. Then, a paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to determine the significance of the changes in the O-D flow and airport network before during, and during the pandemic. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is a literature review on related topics and methodologies. Section 3 describes the data and research methodology utilized in our study. Section 4 provides an analysis of the results, and the conclusion is contained in Section 5.",

Researchers discovered a strong association between pandemic outbreaks and recessions in the airline industry due to decreases in the number of passengers (Chou et al., 2004; Iacus et al., 2020; Lee and Warner, 2006; Pine and McKercher, 2004) , the number of flights (Bajardi et al., 2011; Ni\u017eeti\u0107, 2020; Suzumura et al., 2020) and disruption of airport network connectivity . For example, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 reduced passenger volume by approximately 80% in Hong Kong (Pine and McKercher, 2004) . In Taiwan, it decreased by approximately 59.2% (Chou et al., 2004) . On a larger scale, SARS decreased the passenger volume up to 70% on the Asian continent (Lee and Warner, 2006) . The H1N1 virus, known as swine flu, also affected the airline industry significantly by decreasing approximately 40% of flights in 2009 (Bajardi et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Previous scholars found that aviation plays an important role in the spread of diseases, such as SARS/MERS (Poletto et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2015) , H1N1 (Bajardi et al., 2011) , and others, transforming a (local) epidemic into a (global) crisis (Dawood et al., 2012) . More recently, COVID-19 has become a new global pandemic, causing more than three million deaths worldwide (May 5th, 2021) (Worldometers.info, 2021). Compared to SARS and H1N1, COVID-19 has had a more devastating impact on human health, resulting in the highest number of casualties. According to a new study by Sun et al. (2021a) , Abate et al. (2020) , and Bauer et al. (2020) , the pandemic has had a particularly devastating impact on the aviation industry. Near the end of February, there were approximately 8,000 international flights per day. However, by the end of March after the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of daily flights dropped dramatically to less than 1,000 (roughly 10% of the regular seasons) (Suzumura et al., 2020) . In addition, COVID-19 reduced passenger volume in Europe by approximately 89% from January to April 2020 (Ni\u017eeti\u0107, 2020) . In the United States, the number of flights decreased by nearly 30% (Suzumura et al., 2020) . With regard to network connectivity, airport traffic in international hubs in Turkey, Russia, and France was greatly reduced due to the increasing numbers of confirmed Covid-19 cases (Tanr\u0131verdi et al., 2020) . Thus, an infectious disease directly impacted passenger volume, number of flights, and airport network connectivity, particularly because of lockdown policies that reduced people's mobility and their risk of becoming infected (Kim and Kwan, 2021; Zhang et al., 2020) . Thus, the purpose of this study was to utilize the O-D flow data to examine how COVID-19 affects the passenger volume, number of flights, airline flow patterns, and airport rankings.",

(2020) and Ni\u017eeti\u0107 (2020) used statistical analysis to explore changes in passenger volume and number of flights pre-and during-outbreak. Not surprisingly, these factors declined sharply during the pandemic outbreak. However, these traditional methods cannot show if this impact varied from place to place, such as whether or not there was an increase at the airports nearer to the country of origin (Fang et al., 2020) . Therefore, we utilized origin-destination (O-D) flow data from airlines to determine how COVID-19 affected this flow, which is shown on the following maps. It must be noted that most researchers focused on the change in the absolute value of demand instead of the relative change (such as the ranking or popularity of various airports) before and during the spread of COVID-19. Thus, in this study, we identify two critical gaps that must be addressed: determining the COVID-19's impact on origin-destination airline flow and the changes that have occurred in airport centrality.",

Therefore, we applied a clustering method to group raw O-D flow data to reveal flow mobility trends and spatial patterns based on their similarities and characteristic (Guo et al., 2020) . Four key factors were used for clustering, including flight distance (long, medium, short), flight type (international/domestic), whether or not the airport of origin, and the destination airport were connected to China. Since this information is binary or categorical, supervised learning is unsuitable because it is heavily reliant on labeled data to calculate all forms in the training phase, thus it could produce decent classification results (Fang et al., 2021) . Therefore, an unsupervised learning method, such as clustering, is more suitable for this kind of dataset.",

These include the Partitioning Around Medoid (PAM), the Clustering Large Application (CLARA) (Anderlucci and Hennig, 2014; Azimi and Zhang, 2010; Popovich et al., 2021) , Latent Class Clustering (LCC) (Sivasankaran and Balasubramanian, 2020) and the Clustering Large Applications based on Randomized Search (CLARANS) (Schubert and Rousseeuw, 2019) . The first two have been commonly implemented in transportation studies (Popovich et al., 2021) and are suitable for exploring both binary and categorical data (Watve et al., 2014) . PAM, also known as k-medoids, is an algorithm for clustering correlated elements through medoids, which are a representation of cluster centers derived from the minimum sum dissimilarity matrix. CLARA is an algorithm for clustering the correlated elements by sampling multiple times, and PAM is utilized to select the best medoid. CLARA performs better when a large dataset is involved, while PAM is more time-consuming and less efficient (Anderlucci and Hennig, 2014) . When PAM and CLARA were compared to the LCC algorithm, they yielded higher average silhouette widths than LCC. These findings suggest that PAM and CLARA successfully produce better separation and compactness of clusters. In addition, Nayyar and Puri (2017) ound that CLARA performed better with thousands of samples compared to PAM. In addition, when Azimi and Zhang (2010) applied fuzzy c-means and CLARA to classify freeway traffic flow conditions, they determined that the CLARA algorithm produced more consistent results than the fuzzy-c means technique.",

CLARANS produced higher cluster purity than the hierarchical-based algorithms, such as ROCK. Compared to CLARA, CLARANS appears to be comparable based on the number of loss total deviation, when the number of clusters is below 70 (Schubert and Rousseeuw, 2019) . However, according to Schubert and Rousseeuw, CLARANS was less efficient than CLARA with regard to processing time. CLARANS tends to have a longer processing time because it assigns random medoids to the dataset and checks it one by one until the optimal cluster is formed. In sum, CLARA is faster than CLARANS because it creates subsamples and assigns medoids within the subsample. However, their performance is similar if the number of clusters is small.",

In addition, not only does it provide faster computational running time but when the number of clusters (k) is small, the quality of CLARA remains comparable to CLARANS (Schubert and Rousseeuw, 2019).",

            "text": "For quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on airport networks, network centrality measurement was also employed in this study. It is commonly used for identifying 'central' nodes of the air transport system (main/hubs/popular airports) to establish the focal airport that is most connected within the entire airline network. Several researchers have used single or two centrality measurements to analyze the evolution of the global air transport network (Cheung et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2017; Wandelt et al., 2017; Hossain and Alam et al., 2017) or to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on this network (Sun et al., 2020, Nikolaou and Dimitriou, 2021) . For example, Cheung et al. (2020) successfully used a centrality measurement to calculate the importance of an airport based on the number of its connections (degree and eigenvector centrality), and the importance of an airport as a transit point (betweenness centrality). Their results show that Sydney Airport (SYD) and Singapore Airport (SIN) were considered to be popular transit airports particularly from 2006 to 2016, while Washington (IAD) and Frankfurt (FRA) airports were consistently utilized as hubs in North America and Europe. This method was very effective for measuring the robustness of the worldwide airport network (Sun et al., 2017) and for showing the impact of COVID-19 trends (Nikolaou and Dimitriou, 2020) . Based on Sun et al.'s, (2020) findings, the degree centrality dropped by approximately 50% during the pandemic, which means that, on average, each airport lost half of its destinations. However, previous researchers only focused on explaining the overall trend of the airport network without specifically highlighting changes in the popularity of individual airports and top hub airports during the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, in order to fill this gap, four metrics, including degree centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness centrality were utilized in this study to measure the centrality and the corresponding impact of COVID -19 on all airports and top 30 hub airports. Then, statistical tests (a paired t-test and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were employed to reveal any significant changes in airport popularity before and during COVID-19.",

There were both international and domestic flights included. Pre-COVID-19 was defined as before December 2019, and the pandemic period was set as April 2020 onward. Following the outbreak, the number of airports in operation fell from 362 to 344. There were 2,370 O-D flow flights in December 2019 and only 1,685 in April 2020.

The results were analyzed according to three factors: if the flight is connected to China, if the O-D flow is domestic or international and the flight distance.

This result indicates that during the outbreak, there were fewer long-distance flights both at all airports and the top 30 hubs. This may be due to the lockdowns and restrictions in certain countries that limit long-haul or international flights (Bauer et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020; Suzumura et al., 2020) in an effort to halt disease spread. Due to the fact that many airports limited long-haul or international flights during the pandemic, there were more airport connections with closer distances during this time which resulting a decrease in the flight distance by 10.7%-11.1% during the pandemic.

Degree centrality As shown in Table 5 , the Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that COVID-19 considerably changed the 90% confidence level of the allairport data; however, the degree centrality ranking of the top 30 hubs did not change significantly during the COVID-19 outbreaks. Overall, there was a drop in the rankings of 199 airports and an increase in 137 during COVID-19. Even though the top 30 hubs experienced a similar trend to that of all the airports, these increases and decreases were not significant. As shown in Table 6 , this result is indicated by the dominance of lighter colors with regard to the degree centrality. For example, also shown in Table 6 , the highest values were all associated with airports in China, specifically Shanghai (PVG) Airport in December 2019, followed by Beijing (PEK) Airport. The third and fourth highest were associated with Guangzhou (CAN) and Shenzhen (SZX), respectively. These rankings were followed by airports in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. In April 2020, the rankings of the top 10 airports changed very little with the exception of Hong Kong (HKG) and Taipei (TPE) airports which fell significantly. Shanghai (PVG) remains the highest-ranked, the second is Guangzhou (CAN) followed by Shenzhen (SZX) and Beijing (PEK). However, Hong Kong (HKG) and Taipei (TPE) airports have dropped from the top 10 status into the top 30. A significant change in ranking also occurred in the lower positioned airports, some of which shifted from top five to top ten. This happened because of the wide gap between the top 10 airports and the others. Even though the O-D flow decreased to a greater extent in the top 30 hub airports, the popularity rankings of the top 10 airports changed only slightly.",

The Incheon Airport (ICN) in South Korea rose to fourth place, and the Hong Kong Airport (HKG) jumped from 13 to five during the outbreak. We also discovered that airports that implemented total international flight restrictions, such as Vladivostok Airport (VVO) and Irkutsk Airport (IKT) in Russia, increased their rankings even more than those that only banned specific international flights, such as Incheon Airport (ICN) in South Korea. This is expected because the number of operating airports and international flights decreased which impacted the closeness rankings in the airport network during the outbreak.",

It must be noted that the latter was an inverse trend in which the number of airports that rose in the ranking was much higher than those that dropped. The results show that 87 airports dropped in rank while 151 rose during this time. The results illustrated in Table 6 show that several smaller airports, such as Osaka Airport (ITM), Matsuyama Airport, Niigata Airport (KIJ), and others, increased in rank significantly. Meanwhile, several hubs, such as Beijing Airport (PEK), Shanghai Airport (PVG), and Incheon Airport (ICN), had a significant drop in rankings, which could be due to the suspension of the O-D flow between these top hubs. On the other hand, if the smaller airports remained connected to their hub airports, this may have led to less of a decrease in their eigenvector centrality than that of the top 30 hub airports. Thus, several smaller airports moved into the top 30 due to an increase in their eigenvector ranking, while the hub airports experienced a drop in rank.",

As a result, travel restrictions had a serious effect on the trends of international flight networks around the world (Suzumura et al., 2020) . According to our results, the increase in the percentage of domestic flights indicated that local aviation has began to recover, particularly in China. According to Dube et al. (2021) , Chinese domestic O-D flow began to improve in February. This recovery has been sustained, with most airports making consistent gains throughout the year. As the passenger numbers, although the pandemic has significantly reduced the number of passengers on both domestic and international flights, international flights were affected to a greater extent. This finding is consistent with a previous study by Lau et al. (2020) , who found a reduction in passenger numbers during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Our findings may reflect the reduction in the number of long-distance international flights that is backed up by our cluster results.

To compensate for losses in 2020, these airports must have been able to attract significant numbers of tourists in the summer of that year. The impact on airports in Northeast Asia is somewhat similar to those in the United States, with many only partially affected.

Several airports, such as Incheon Airport (ICN), experienced an increase in the betweenness centrality values, while others in Russia, such as Novosibirsk Airport (OVB), have had a decrease. This occurred because several countries like South Korea only enacted a travel ban to China, while others such as Russia banned all international flights, especially involving countries with high infection rates (Reshetnikov et al., 2020) .

In cluster 1, all flow was in the form of short-distance domestic flights (1,100 km-1,500 km) occurring in Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, Russia, and Taiwan. In this cluster, there were 738 routes pre-COVID-19, which decreased by 1.5%-727 during the outbreak. As shown in Fig. A , although some flights in the eastern part of Russia were eliminated, more new routes were introduced in the central and southern parts of Russia during the outbreak.
