Currently, the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic has placed healthcare issues at the center of social debate, including hospitals and their websites as digital sources of trustworthy information. COVID-19 has intensified the need for quality information and the legitimacy of sources fighting the infodemic situation. In this regard hospitals become essential social actors in the spread of healthcare information. Within this framework, a qualitative study is presented with descriptive components and based on content analysis. This study examines 58 websites from the best hospitals included in the \"Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda\" ranking health sector from Latin America. The study applies an analysis methodology based on previous research focusing on specialized web studies, defining an analysis model on six variables and 65 thematic indicators. The research concludes that hospitals occupying first positions in the medical services directory are not necessarily those that have the best websites. Similarly, it is worth noting that a quarter of the studied sample do not devote a specific space to reporting coronavirus information. Brazil, Colombia and Chile are the countries with the highest number of hospitals among those with the best websites. In conclusion, digital media, specifically websites, could constitute legitime resources of healthcare information consumption, so their accuracy and proper development seem to be significant to become genuine sources that not only could provide better healthcare services but help avoid the spread of misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These are resources that could improve the services of medical professionals and centers, but which could also help citizens to become more prepared patients managing their own healthcare processes. Some studies, such as the Wald et. al. [14] , have pointed out that the use of the Internet in the health field constitutes a great tool to help patients make more informed decisions. Furthermore, digital tools and platforms are pretty valuable in promoting patients' own motivation [9] , which demands intergenerational work processes. These reflections are supported by previous literature as shown in the extensive literature review published by Kampmeijer et al. [21] in which authors evidenced how e-health and m-health tools (understood as namely apps, websites, digital content, video consults and webinars) truly improve healthcare quality for adults in the way they receive more supportive assistance and are better informed. Moreover, since COVID-19 lockdown situation occurred the role of institutional websites from hospitals, has become an essential issue, in most cases the unique communication channel between patients and healthcare services [22, 23] .",

Digital media and connected devices have evolved to a ubiquitous part of our daily life and the Internet have paved the way to a wider interactive communication in the relation with citizens [2] . Healthcare services delivery and information availability supported by digital technologies such as hospital\u00b4s websites are key issues not only in the enhancement of patient satisfaction but in the efficiency of e-Health systems [20] [21] [22] . As stated from Kotsiliers et al. [33] if these means are properly designed, they offer a double innovative pathway: from one hand giving patients the power not only to educate themselves but take part in the decision-making process of their health; and in the other hand these new channels for communication and interaction make healthcare stakeholders gain in essential aspects such as cutting costs, gaining efficiency and improving the healthcare system. At this point, is important noting that Calvo-Calvo [17] and G\u00e1mez de la Hoz [34] highlight this in their research into the quality and characteristics of the health services that hospitals and other types of clinical establishments offer on the internet.

In 2015, Latin America achieved one of the highest rates in social networks usage in the world: 78.4% of Latin American internet users participated in social networks, exceeding the percentage from North America (64.6%) and Europe (54.5%) [36] .",

The most worrying aspect is that 5.35% of the hospitals analyzed provide information regarding the size, format or download time of the documents they offer on their websites.",

One of the most important topics at present is the presence of content relating to the coronavirus pandemic. In this sense, the 73.21% of the hospitals offer specific sections or information dedicated to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is, however, worrying that, a quarter of these centers, important noting that the best in ranking, do not offer spaces or content focused on the pandemic (characteristics, advice or recommendations in the event of contagion). Having in mind the situation has provoked many collapses in several hospitals, the information, regarding to pandemic (prevention, actions, tests, disease characteristics, etc.) becomes essential and invites a deep reflection from the communication perspective. Focusing on other indicators, results show that 71.42% of the hospitals offer general health advice or recommendations, while 66% have spaces dedicated to research or training in health-centered issues in different areas. Finally, it is striking that only 44.64% of the hospitals analyzed detail how to proceed with the management of a complaint or suggestion. Of the total, only 32.14 percent include in their web sites information about the cafeteria, restaurant or shop services of their centers, an aspect which shows how the websites leave the relatives and/or companions of the patients in a second place of importance within their digital communication strategy. The fact that only 5.35% of the hospitals offer information on waiting lists invites a reflection on transparency on a subject of great seriousness and concern among citizens.",

In line with recent research [2, 4, 8, 33] the role of social networks in all areas of live is increasing, it is striking that Twitter and Instagram are in the latest positions, 41% of hospitals do not have a Instagram account and 36% do not have one in Twitter, aspects that could be linked to the difficulties of health centers to permanently generate interesting content that feeds these networks and could engage with the great amount of users they both have.",

Similarly, the need is detected in line with Calvo [17] to design studies that analyze the presence and use of organic search engine positioning techniques or SEO, a crucial aspect to increase the reach and visibility on search engines. In an infodemic context, as the WHO has pointed out, it is noteworthy that the presence of spaces or content centered on the pandemic (characteristics, advice or recommendations in the event of contagion) and related to COVID-19 disease is not present on all websites. This seem to be an important lacking in a situation in which digital media are the only information ways because of the global lockdown. The seriousness and scope of this virus should lead hospitals to offer service information on the coronavirus placed in their respective websites which would help to provide a better, informed citizenry and also avoid the collapse of many health centers [7, 10, 21] .",

In this regard, it is worth noting that COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the necessity for digital solutions, highlighting the essential role digital information plays in appropriate institutions such as hospitals, in order to face the infodemic [3] . Having in mind the global situation of citizens in an unprecedented lockdown, digital media emerge as massive resources of information consumption, so their accuracy and proper development evolve in effective and genuine sources as pointed in recent works published by Hantris et al. [3] , Yusof et al. [9] , Deneck et al. [10] or Wald et al. [14] . Accordingly, it could be said that communication strategies in hospitals have become fundamental approaches to face the pandemic and avoid misinformation and rumor which, \"among other things, hampered public health responses and effective crisis communication by sowing confusion and distrust in official and medical guidance\" [44, 45] . Even before the pandemic crisis, digital transformation and technological development encompass with communication strategies were essential issues for institutions, nowadays it become fundamental issues not only for citizens information but for counteracting misinformation and infodemic.",

In our study it is observed a significant gap between the hospitals that occupy the top positions in the rankings of medical services and those that are placed in the directory of best websites. Results give us a double conclusion: on the one hand, it could be concluded that the hospitals offering better healthcare services have not given digital communication through their websites a leading role. On the other hand, it could be said that the efficiency of the communication strategy is not always linked to economic parameters but derives from other aspects. As pointed out by Gong et al. \" [Hospitals] offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public's ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19\" [22] .",
