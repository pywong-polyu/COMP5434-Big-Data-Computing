Results: Four hundred fifteen HCPs were participated. Most of them were younger than 30 years and majority of them were postgraduate trainees. Results showed gaps in the knowledge about basic infection control measure like donning/doffing and understanding about high-risk procedures. On job training, professional and administrative support is compromising. Many of HCPs are anxious nowadays, having symptoms related to burn out with logical reasons behind. Even with all those hurdles they are committed and ready to volunteer themselves. Conclusion: The HCPs of Pakistan needs urgent attention for providing them Formal training regarding infection control measure. Administrative and professional support is required from institutions and scientific societies. Online teaching modules and webinar is a suitable option. The symptoms of burn out are significant and would increase with passage of time. This needs to be supported by occupational health committees.",

            "text": "The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID 19) is now become a global health threat. The World Health Organization (WHO) already declared the outbreak, a public health emergency of international concern. 1 It started from China in December 2019, and affected almost 210 countries. According to WHO, total confirmed cases are 2,475,743, and a death toll of 169,151 deaths over the time. With 20,130 confirmed cases and 459 total deaths till May 3, 2020, the number of cases is growing significantly in Pakistan. (Daily DAWN May 4, 2020) We, the current generation of Health Care Providers (HCPs) have never seen this type of pandemic before, hence not well prepared. Data from developed countries has shown psychological impact on HCPs leading to feeling of depression, fear and insomnia. 2 To the greater extent symptoms were directly related to risk of getting infection and inadequate protection from contamination. 3 Low middle-income countries (LMICs) like Pakistan, cannot afford strict contagion measures due to economical reasons. Moreover, our social setup, religious beliefs and educational background, is much different from advanced world. So, we should be expecting increased exposure of HCPs, both to symptomatic and asymptomatic careers. With limited health care facilities and available expertise, the gravity of this would be very severe in Pakistan. We more often discuss about the availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs). Though these are mandatory requirements, but effective management needs implementation of processes and planning. 4 Individual teams should have adequate training, administrative and professional support, not only to deal with this crisis but also to keep them healthy. This survey was designed to assess the problems; which HCPs are facing during this pandemic. The primary objective was to evaluate the basic knowledge of HCPs regarding infection control measures. This was followed by the evaluation teaching and training in context to infection control measures and provision of administrative and professional support. The secondary objective was to see the psychological impact of this on HCPs, which can act as a barrier in effective management of these patients.",

The survey was designed using \"ON line -GOOGLE FORM\". The survey consists of a set of questions focusing on: 1: Demographics: Age, sex, marital status, association with any comorbid condition. to anxiety, feeling of burn out, and perFormance at work. Survey Form was distributed using GOOGLE LINK. This was done by investigators using social media, which includes Whatsapp, Twitter, and Facebook accounts. Individual contacts were also requested to disseminate the link so that maximum HCPs can get involved. The statement regarding informed consent was disclosed. One has to be agree upon it before filling up of questionnaire. The responses were collected anonymously and individual's identity was not disclosed. Statistical Analysis: Responses of participants were exported from excel to statistical packages for social science version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) for analysis. All of these responses were compiled in tables and bar chart. Most of the questions were closed ended therefore frequency and percentages were reported. Due to large information supplementary tables and figure were also provided separately.",

The problem is severe and we should expect large number of our HCPs getting infected. According to Daily DAWN May 4, 2020, four hundred eighty healthcare professionals in Pakistan have been exposed and diagnosed to have COVID positive. Nowadays, the whole focus of discussion is about getting PPEs. However, no one is talking about administrative support and basic prerequisites required for effective management against this pandemic. The results of our audit showed non-availability of shower facilities at many places. Similarly, the quarantine facilities were not declared in most of health care setups. Hospitals are the red zones for this infection, preventing staff from getting infected needs pragmatic approach. 5 There were severe gap in formal training required for basic infection control measures like donning and doffing. Nonetheless, many of us are really inexperienced and are using these gears for the very first time. The answer is basic training related to infection control measures. This should include courses related to donning and doffing and monitoring those practices on priority basis. 6 Nationwide, professional councils and societies should work together in reinforcing practice guidelines. This would be really helpful in standardizing management protocols, hence improving the outcomes. 7 Internet facilities are widely available in Pakistan, and as depicted by our results many workers are using online resources to keep them updated. So, the best strategy would be incorporation of online teaching and training. 8 The factors acting as a barrier; like fear of death and risk of transmitting disease to family members needs urgent attention. It's not easy for anyone to work under these kinds of stresses and still have to manage difficult patient related scenarios. HCPs are at risk of exhaustion and burn out. The institution should device the mechanism of occupational support and professional well-being. This requires smart planning supporting trained staff, implementing infection control policies and stream lining care pathways. 9 ",
