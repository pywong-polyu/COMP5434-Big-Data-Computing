            "text": "Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice. Inspired by the significant progress in automatic image captioning, various deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to generate radiology reports for medical images. Despite promising results, previous works overlook the uncertainties of their models and are thus unable to provide clinicians with the reliability/confidence of the generated radiology reports to assist their decision-making. In this paper, we propose a novel method to explicitly quantify both the visual uncertainty and the textual uncertainty for DL-based radiology report generation. Such multi-modal uncertainties can sufficiently capture the model confidence degree at both the report level and the sentence level, and thus they are further leveraged to weight the losses for more comprehensive model optimization. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method for model uncertainty characterization and estimation can produce more reliable confidence scores for radiology report generation, and the modified loss function, which takes into account the uncertainties, leads to better model performance on two public radiology report datasets. In addition, the quality of the automatically generated reports was manually evaluated by human raters and the results also indicate that the proposed uncertainties can reflect the variance of clinical diagnosis. * Y.

            "text": "Radiology report generation, which combines Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate reports for medical images, has become a rapidly-growing topic in the medical imaging field. Since generating hand-crafted diagnostic reports is time-consuming and hard to follow the same protocol, automatic generation can alleviate doctor's workload and make standardized diagnosis. With the convincing performance and understandable interpretations of DL's predictions, there is a great potential to automate the clinical workflows. Most existing research for radiology report generation usually borrows ideas from natural image captioning [1] - [6] , where the images are firstly encoded into vectorial representations and then decoded to generate the captions. Despite promising results have been obtained by these DL methods, their reliability has not been explored sufficiently for the following reasons. First, learning from inadequate samples can result in unreliable models, which is prone to generate inaccurate reports. Second, existing evaluation metrics are mostly designed for mainstream NLP tasks, which have been proved to be not suitable for the task of generating radiology reports from medical images [7] , [8] . However, it has been extensively shown in [9] , [10] that some traditional factors including poor image quality, improper protocol selection, deficient clinical data, limitations in experience and technology, and lack of established diagnostic standards may affect diagnosis report uncertainty and thus interfere the clinical outcomes. Reiner BI [11] also indicated the need for report uncertainty in clinical workflow and built their relationships. As mentioned in [11] , the referring clinician may require follow-up radiographs due to the inherent uncertainty contained in the report. If, however, the clinician was presented with context and user-specific uncertainty data, they could make a further decision on the need for follow-up radiographs. Similarly, as the DL-based automatic report generation systems are data-driven and less interpretable, they can also introduce more uncertainties to the predicted reports and thus become less reliable to clincians. Therefore, it is highly desirable to assess how much patients and doctors can trust such generated radiology reports for decision making. This motivates us to present a comprehensive confidence measurement to quantify the model uncertainty in radiology report generation.",

For the visual encoder, we first adopt Monte Carlo (MC) dropout [19] to sample weights as a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). Since it is unrealistic to directly quantify the model uncertainty for visual extraction in the output space, we then design an extra AutoEncoder to obtain such visual uncertainty, VISVar, which can estimate the parameter variance for the visual extractor and encourage the model to learn meaningful and generalizable latent representations. Besides, for the generated radiology reports, a proper report similarity measurement formulates the basis of uncertianty estimation. Inspired by Word Rotator's Distance (WRD) [20] , we propose the Sentence Matched Adjusted Semantic Similarity (SMAS) to measure their similarities, which considers sufficient information and characteristics of medical diagnosis reports. Based on SMAS, SMASVar and SMASVar-l are further proposed to separately measure the model uncertainties at both the report level and the sentence level. Particularly, both uncertainty measurements focus on the semantics of sentences rather than their structures, which can provide more valuable confidence scores for the generated radiology reports. Finally, such visual-textual uncertainties are leveraged to define an uncertainty-weighted loss to achieve more comprehensive model optimization, lessen misjudgement risk and improve overall performance on radiology report generation. Our extensive experiments conducted on the Indiana University chest X-Ray (IU X-Ray) and a public COVID-19 CT Report dataset (COV-CTR) [21] have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method. More importantly, our method is better at characterizing the visual-textual uncertainties and providing more reliable confidence scores for radiology report generation than the state-of-the-art works do.",

It is related to the computer vision task for image captioning, where various CNN-RNN/LSTM architectures together with attention mechanisms have achieved promising results [22] - [27] . Recently, inspired by the capacity on parallel training, transformers [28] - [31] have been successfully applied to predicting words according to the extracted features from CNN. Generating radiology reports is much more challenging as it requires to identify the relevant information from noisy radiology images with similar patterns and generating long contextual descriptions [1] - [6] , [32] - [34] . Particularly, Liu et al. [35] proposed a domain-aware automatic generation system, which employed a hierarchical convolutional-recurrent neural network and reinforcement learning for report generation. Chen et al. [6] incorporated the relational memory into the transformer via a relational memory and memory-driven conditional layer normalization, which is capable of generating long reports with informative content. Liu et al. [32] explored the posterior and prior knowledge from a pre-defined medical knowledge graph to alleviate visual and textual data bias. Wang et al. [33] proposed an auxiliary image-text matching task to learn strongly correlated visual and text features and then the two tasks could boost each other in a progressive way. Chen et al. [34] designed a shared memory to record the alignment between images and texts, which could facilitate the interaction and generation across modalities. However, these methods only focus on achieving higher generation accuracy, but they do not actually evaluate whether the generated reports are applicable in real clinical practice.",

Therefore, we first design an AutoEncoder as a BNN to quantify visual uncertainty in the output level. To get textual uncertainty, we need to quantify the semantic similarity between two diagnostic reports. Simply calculating similarity from commonly used scores such as BLEU [41] , ROUGE [42] and METEOR [43] , or image captioning metrics such as CIDEr [44] and SPICE [45] fail to capture semantic information. BERT-based pre-trained methods such as BERTScore [46] or Sentence-BERT [47] have been shown to be ineffective for unsupervised semantic textual similarity (STS) task [20] . Recent transformer-based methods such as SIF [48] are unable to capture medical knowledge without costly training. Word Rotator's Distance (WRD) [20] performs better on STS task and it can capture medical information with proper pre-trained medical word embeddings. However, measuring similarity on diagnostic report is different from general semantic similarity measurement, because: (1) it is inappropriate to treat diagnostic reports as single long sentences, as sentences from the same report can be highly independent; (2) some key words or descriptions of diseases will greatly affect the semantic similarity between two reports.",

First, we illustrate the effectiveness of our AutoEncoder and two weighting methods separately. \"BASE\" represents the vanilla transformer architecture for image captioning. It is observed that the \"AutoEncoder\" enhances the performance on all the metrics for the highest 3.3%, which suggests that the AutoEncoder brings stronger ability for feature extraction. Note that applying \"Sen-Weighting\" and \"Rep-Weighting\" provides a large improvement. This indicates that using uncertainty to weight the loss can effectively optimize the process for reports/sentences generation. \"OURS\" represents the combination of all of the aforementioned strategies. It outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, such as R2Gen [6] , CMN [34] , Self-Boosting [33] and PPKED [32] . The qualitative results are shown in Fig. 3 , which contains three cases from IU X-Ray dataset, including one normal radiology image (first row) and two images with some abnormalities (second & third rows). In the first case, our model has the best ability to describe each region and generates more accurate and professional expressions, such as \"cardiomediastinal silhouette\", \"osseous structures\" and \"normally inflated\". The other two images contain abnormalities about \"degenerative spine\" and \"low lung volumes\", in which our model is able to capture all the symptoms while the competing methods fail to do so. The last two rows in Fig. 3 indicate two abnormal cases from COV-CTR dataset. It can also be observed that our method generates more accurate reports through finding the key information, such as \"the lower lobe of both lungs\" and \"uneven density\".",

The evaluation results indicate that our method can generate much more acceptable reports in real clinical practice.",

Report-level & Sentence-level Uncertainty 1) SMAS: Since the similarities of reports should be largely determined by the key information such as diseases and organs, we randomly select 60 reports and manually annotate their corresponding diseases and organs. For example, the sentence \"heart size mildly enlarged\" will be labeled by its organ \"Heart\" and abnormality \"Large\". Then we randomly sample 2500 Fig. 2 : Heatmap of correlation among different similarity measurements. \"Info_DIFF\" means key information difference of two diagnostic reports annotated by experts. Greater negative correlation between other scores and \"Info_DIFF\" represents better similarity measurement.",

To illustrate that our SMAS can better capture the similarities among different reports, we calculate the similarities on these pairs using different similarity scores and obtain a heatmap in Fig. 2 to show their correlations. \"Info_DIFF\" and \"Len_DIFF\" represent the absolute value of the differences on the number of labels and sentences bewteen two reports. \"WRS\", \"BLEU-4\" and \"BERTScore\" calculate the similarity scores by treating full report as a single sentence. \"Adj_BLEU-4\" and \"Adj_BERTScore\" represent applying our MATCH(\u00b7) function to BLEU-4 and BERTScore. First, we note that the correlation between \"Info_DIFF\" and \"Len_DIFF\" is 0.65, which means that we can use the inconsistency in the sentence number to roughly determine the inconsistency between reports. This is useful as extracting key information from reports manually is labor-some. Moreover, we find that there is a significantly higher negative correlation between the \"Adj_BLEU-4\" vs. the \"BLEU-4\" and \"Info_Diff\" (\u22120.73 vs. \u22120.25), which means the former gives a more faithful evaluation on the generated reports' relationships by utilizing the key information to measure similarity. Such improvements is solely achieved through our novel MATCH(\u00b7) algorithm. Lastly, note that our \"SMAS\" has the greatest negative correlation to \"Info_DIFF\", proving the strong ability to measure report similarities mostly based on key information.",

We first draw a scatter plot from the testing set in Fig. 5 (a) to show the relationship among SMASVar, VISVar and BLEU-4 score. We set a threshold curve to find out the cases with extreme high uncertainty. The threshold can be modified based on doctors' risk assessment in clinical practice. This report-level uncertainty serves as an extra important evaluation to assess the reliability or confidence of the generated reports. Fig. 4 shows two cases where A has a higher BLEU-4 score than B. However, the prediction of case A contains two redundant uncertain sentences and their VISVar and SMASVar show higher value than case B, which indicates the information contained in A is less confident than those in B. The superiorities of VISVar and SMASVar over SMAS are further discussed in Appendix. It is also noted that if most generated sentences in one report are certain while only one is uncertain, SMASVar will still be lower. The proposed sentence-level uncertainty SMASVar-l can tackle this problem and measure each sentence's uncertainty concisely. To validate our report-level uncertainty in real clinical settings, we compare it with real diagnosis variance of human evaluation. The variance of the scores from three experienced doctors could represent the real clinical uncertainty. As shown in Fig. 5(a) , red stars indicate diagnosis reports that obtain the same score from all three doctors, i.e., variance = 0, and the orange triangles represent cases that three doctors have strong disagreement on, i.e., variance = 1. It is noted that cases with higher (lower) doctor variance also have larger (smaller) VISVar and SMASVar. Therefore, our report-level uncertainty is comparable to real doctors' diagnosis variance and setting a proper threshold can help doctor make further decision on whether to follow up the automatic generated reports.",

Different colors represent the uncertainty values of the corresponding sentences. Our proposed reference report covers every information in the ground truth including lungs, pleural effusion, heart and spine with different uncertainties. One can easily observe that the sentence describing spine has the highest uncertainty, which can be explained through the uncertain predicted sentence on spine from M C \u2212 R 1 to M C \u2212 R T . This suggests that the model cannot make sure whether the spine is normal or not. Such an uncertainty should be warned by the report generation system so that doctors can make further decisions based on it.",

They have similar SMAS values as SMAS evaluates the results only from the similarity of ground-truths and predictions. However, due to the different input X-ray images, the model holds different confidence in their predictions, which can be captured by our methods in Fig. 7 . With T = 10 times MC dropout, the generated 10 predictions from the input images of case A are much uncertain while the 10 predictions are similar from B and C. Though A and B have the same SMAS, the MC-#1/#3/#6/#7 of case A include wrong information \"the heart and lungs have xxxx xxxx in the interval\", which makes the final prediction not as reliable as case B. Therefore, the SMASVar and VISVar of B are rather smaller than A, which means the model is more confident and certain in B's X-ray images.",
