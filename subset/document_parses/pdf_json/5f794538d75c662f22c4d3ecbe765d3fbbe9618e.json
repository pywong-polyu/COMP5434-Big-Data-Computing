Here we consider the hypothesis that natural Ultra-Violet (UV) light (UVA and UVB) is reducing COVID-19 infections by enhancing human immunity through vitamin-D and/or by suppressing the virus itself. We focus on the United Kingdom (UK), by examining daily COVID-19 infections (F) and UV Index (UVI) data over the period March to October 2020. We find an intriguing empirical anti-correlation between log 10 (F) and log 10 (UVI) with a correlation coefficient of -0.933 over the period from 11 May (when the first UK lockdown ended) to 28 October 2020. The anticorrelation may reflect causation with other factors which are correlated with the UVI. Either way, UVI should be included in modelling the pattern of COVID-19 infections and deaths. We started quantifying such correlations in other countries and regions. 1 We note that we identified two outliers in the number of daily infections which resulted from merging pillars of reported cases on the 1 and 2 July and hence were removed from the analysis.",

Others [2] found modest impact of UV light and other environmental effects on the reduction of COVID-19 transmission. Another study [3] pointed out that UV radiation will not be effective in places with high air pollution, where UV light turns into heat. On the other hand, other studies [4] [5] [6] have found that UV light is associated with decreased COVID-19 growth rate. Given the disagreement on the impact of UV light on COVID-19 transmission we take a fresh look at data for the UK. Our study is also strongly motivated by the second wave of COVID-19 in many Northern hemisphere countries during their winter.",

A study examined the climate of 50 cities that were affected with the COVID-19 found that 8 cities had high morbidity and mortality rates. All 8 cities were located between latitudes 30 \u2022 N and 50 \u2022 N, with a temperature between 5 \u2022 C to 11 \u2022 C, and low humidity. Countries located below latitude 35 \u2022 N had lower COVID-19 mortality rates. Countries located above 35 \u2022 N have insufficient sunlight necessary for vitamin D activation.

However, inducible NOS (i-NOS) is calcium-independent, activated during stress conditions like acute or chronic inflammation or infection [22] [23] [24] [25] .

Although the UVI is for London, the variations in different places in the UK are within 0.8 UVI. Stringency index represents the lockdown measures taken in the UK and defined in [31] . Figure 1 shows the daily infections and deaths for the UK along with the UVI and stringency index for the period 22 January to 28 October 2020. We see visually strong anti-correlation between daily infections and UVI. Figure 1 : Daily infections (dark blue) and deaths (light blue) along with the stringency index (orange) and UVI (red) for the period 22 January up to 28 October 2020 for the UK. As expected, the UVI increased from January to July when it reached a peak and then dropped. From January to April while the UVI increased, the number of infections went up too. The UK government lockdown started on 23 March and this resulted in a decrease in infections due to social distancing. The lockdown was relaxed on 11 May. However, increase in the UVI over the period 23 March to 1 July might have helped as well to decrease the number of infections. Over the period 2 July to 28 October the increase in infections is strongly anti-correlated with UVI, as we quantify in Table 1 .",

Over the periods of rise (25 March to 6 June 2020) and fall (7 June to 28 October 2020) in infections we find an anti-correlation of \u03c1 = \u22120.907 and \u03c1 = \u22120.730 respectively, in accord with the anti-correlation we found for the UK.

If the UV light directly affects the level of infections it could be either by reducing the survival of the virus itself or by improving the immunity of people via the production of Vitamin-D and possibly a combination of the two. On the other hand, the UVI may indicate other causes. For example, low UVI may imply that people spend more time with other people indoors (e.g. at home or in shops) or suffer from other winter-time diseases, increasing the chance for infection. Other possible variables are population density, temperature, humidity, air pollution and other geographical parameters.",
