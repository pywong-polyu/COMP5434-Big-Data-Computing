            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies, engineered antibodies, and antibody fragments have become important biological therapeutic platforms. The IgG format with bivalent binding sites has a modular structure with different biological roles, i.e., effector and binding functions, in different domains. We demonstrated the reconstruction of an IgG-like domain structure in vitro by protein ligation using protein trans-splicing. We produced various binding domains to replace the binding domain of IgG from Escherichia coli and the Fc domain of human IgG from Brevibacillus choshinensis as split-intein fusions. We showed that in vitro protein ligation could produce various Fc-fusions at the N-terminus in vitro from the independently produced domains from different organisms. We thus propose an off-the-shelf approach for the combinatorial production of Fc fusions in vitro with several distinct binding domains, particularly from naturally occurring binding domains. Antiviral lectins from algae are known to inhibit virus entry of HIV and SARS coronavirus. We demonstrated that a lectin could be fused with the Fc-domain in vitro by protein ligation, producing an IgG-like molecule as a \"lectibody\". Such an Fc-fusion could be produced in vitro by this approach, which could be an attractive method for developing potential therapeutic agents against rapidly emerging infectious diseases like SARS coronavirus without any genetic fusion and expression optimization.

            "text": "Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is a multidomain protein that consists of four polypeptide chains. Two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains form a Y-shaped molecule connected by disulfide bonds (Figure 1a ). While the heavy chain is composed of four structural domains called immunoglobulin domains (V H , C H 1, C H 2, and C H 3), the light chain has two immunoglobulin domains (V L and C L ) (Figure 1a ) [1] . Variable domains V H and V L constitute an antigen-binding region, bearing two binding sites per IgG. The enormous diversity of the variable domains plays an essential role in recognizing specific antigens, such as pathogens and foreign molecules in immunity [1] . Constant domains C H 2 and C H 3 of the two heavy chains construct the Fc domain, which mediates various effector functions such as antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and the activation of complement pathways in immunity. Thus, domain structures of antibodies can be dissected based on their functional roles. Antibodies from camelids (like camel and llama) lack light chains, and are therefore termed as heavy-chain antibodies (Figure 1b) [2] . Antigen-binding regions of the heavy-chain antibodies contain only one immunoglobulin fold termed V H H. The V H H domain Monoclonal antibodies such as IgG have increasingly become indispensable biological therapeutic drugs for cancer and autoimmune diseases, with currently more than 70 antibody drugs on the market [6] . Because of their therapeutic success, antibodies represent the fastest growing sector in the pharmaceutical industry. Therapeutic antibodies typically comprise intact monoclonal IgG molecules and IgG derivatives [6] . Additionally, antibody fragments have been fused with various functional moieties, including enzymes, toxins, radionuclides, and viruses, for new therapeutic functions [3, 4] . Since the therapeutic efficacy of ADCC by antibodies is mitigated by the fact that not all immune cells express antibody receptors, bispecific antibodies have been artificially engineered to simultaneously bind to two different types of antigens (Figure 1c) [7] . All IgGs, heavy-chain antibodies, and bispecific antibodies commonly contain an Fc domain with some sequence variation, while the binding sites are unique to individual formats and antigens. mAbs, Fc fusion proteins, and bispecific antibodies are usually produced from a single cell line for each BsAb, mAb, and Fc fusion by making stable cell lines to produce the genetically engineered proteins, despite the likely presence of the Fc domain among these proteins [8] . Whereas a binding domain such as VHH can be obtained by in vitro selection with directed evolution [9] , the production of each new mAb from a mammalian cell line can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially for bispecific antibodies requiring four separate constructs (encoding each of the four polypeptide chains for the production of BsAbs) to be engineered [10] .",

PTS ligates the N-terminal fragment of a protein of interest (POI N ) fused with the N-terminal split intein (Int N ) and the C-terminal fragment of POI (POI C ) fused with the C-terminal split intein (Int C ). PTS results in ligated POI N -POI C and excised Int N and Int C . The figures were adapted from [5] .",

The Fc domain with and without the core region was fused with the C-terminal fragment (Int C ) of the naturally split DnaE intein from Synechocystis species, strain PCC6803 (SspDnaE C16 ) ( Figure 4b ). We chose Npu/SspDnaE chimeric intein for protein ligation because it has been used successfully in the ligation of many protein domains in vitro, and has a higher tolerance of amino acids at the +2 position [21] . Naturally split SspDnaE and NpuDnaE inteins have a 36-residue Int C fragment ( Figure 2c ) [21] . Therefore, we termed the split-site of these inteins as C35 (excluding the start codon Met residue) [12] . However, we selected C15 as the intein split site, and used the engineered pair of NpuDnaE \u2206C16 /SspDnaE C16 , because this pair has worked better for some model proteins than the naturally split C35 pair of split inteins (Figure 2c ) [22] . We hypothesized that the shorter 15-residue Int C would disturb less the folding of the Fc domain. Three different Int C -Fc fusion proteins (Int C -Fc, Int C +1S-Fc, and Int C -CPPC-Fc) were constructed in this study ( Figure 4b ).",

We constructed Int C -Fc with or without the core hinge. Additionally, we created a variant replacing Cys+1 with Ser+1 for the active site of the intein at the so-called +1 position [21] . We first optimized the culture media and analyzed the time-course of the expression using AJNCM18P (Int C -Fc without the core hinge) as a model protein. The presence of the Int C -Fc was detected in both TM and 2SY media after three days, and no significant increase was observed after four days (Figure 4c ). Based on these results, three different Int C -Fc fusion proteins were expressed and secreted under the P2 promoter in a 4-mL scale using TM medium and compared after four days (Figure 4d ). All three fusion proteins were successfully secreted into the culture medium. Whereas the control protein HWP with the molecular weight of 118 kDa accumulated mostly in the supernatant fraction, Int C -Fc and Int C +1S-Fc were also detected in the pellet fraction, suggesting incomplete secretion of the fusion proteins or incorrect folding of the protein. In contrast, Int C -CPPC-Fc was mainly present in the supernatant fraction. ",

We constructed IntC-Fc with or without the core hinge. Additionally, we created a variant replacing Cys+1 with Ser+1 for the active site of the intein at the so-called +1 position [21] . We first optimized the culture media and analyzed the time-course of the expression using AJNCM18P (IntC-Fc without the core hinge) as a model protein. The presence of the IntC-Fc was detected in both TM and 2SY media after three days, and no significant increase was observed after four days (Figure 4c ). Based on these results, three different IntC-Fc fusion proteins were expressed and secreted under the P2 promoter in a 4-mL scale using TM medium and compared after four days (Figure 4d ).

All three Int C -Fc fusions bound to a protein A sepharose column and could be eluted by acid elution as used for IgG purification, indicating that the overexpressed Fc domain is capable of binding to the protein A column, despite the N-terminal fusion of Int C ; 35-49% of the total protein could be recovered after the protein A affinity chromatography and subsequent dialysis.

The incubation of a reaction mixture of Int C -CPPC-Fc and H 6 -GB1-Int N did not result in any ligated product (H 6 -GB1-CPPC-Fc) (Figure 5c ). However, the same reaction mixture in the presence of a reducing agent, 0.5 mM TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine), produced the ligated product H 6 -GB1-CPPC-Fc, together with the spliced-out intein fragment. Despite the slow reaction, i.e., requiring over 20 h, the in vitro ligation of Int C -CPPC-Fc with GB1 was possible under reducing conditions (Figure 5c ). We also tested in vitro ligation using 5 mM DTT instead of TCEP, yielding a slightly faster reaction (Figure 5d ). The requirement of a reducing agent suggests that disulfide bonds in the core hinge region might hinder the PTS reaction. Indeed, we observed the dimer formation of the Fc domain without a reducing agent, which could be prevented by removing the core hinge and Cys at the +1 position of Int C (Supplemental Figure S3 ). Next, we tested the SUMO domain as another model protein for in vitro protein ligation. Similar to GB1, we could produce H 6 -SUMO-CPPC-Fc in the presence of 0.5 mM TCEP (Figure 5e-g) . In the case of H 6 -SUMO, we observed some premature cleavage of H 6 -SUMO-Int N , as reported previously [22] . Since two precursor proteins, i.e., H 6 -SUMO-Int N and Int C -CPPC-Fc, have the same migration in SDS-PAGE, we could not estimate the reaction yield precisely (Figure 5e ). However, the ligation with the SUMO domain accumulated the ligated product more than the ligation with GB1. We believe that this was because GB1 has an affinity to the Fc domain, thereby limiting its access to Int C -Fc for PTS.",

Int C +1S-Fc is expected to produce Fc fusion without any cysteine in the hinge region, while both Int C -CPPC-Fc and Int C -Fc result in an additional \"CFN\" sequence in the hinge region, which could form an interchain disulfide bond ( Figure 4 ).

However, IntC+1S-Fc still required a reducing agent, suggesting that other cysteine residues in the intein, such as the first residue of NpuDnaE intein, need reducing conditions. We produced SVN as a fusion protein with thioredoxin (TRX) as previously reported, but additionally fused it with Int N (NpuDnaE \u2206C16 ) [27] . The construct TRX-H 6 -SVN-Int N was expressed in E. coli under T7 promoter and purified with a His-tag by IMAC (Figure 6a,b) . We expressed and purified the model protein GB1 with Int C, as previously reported [22, 36] . The reaction mixture of TRX-H 6 -SVN-Int N and Int C -GB1 in the presence of 0.5 mM TCEP produced the ligated product TRX-H 6 -SVN-GB1 after 8 h (Figure 6b ). The ligated product was immediately subjected to proteolytic digestion by enterokinase (EK) using an EK site engineered between the His-tag and SVN. The proteolysis of TRX-H 6 -SVN-GB1 resulted in two proteins, TRX-H 6 and SVN-GB1 (Figure 6a,b) . After digestion with EK, we removed the His-tagged TRX-H 6 by affinity chromatography using IgG sepharose (Figure 6b, lane 8) . SVN contains ten cysteines which need to form five disulfide bonds correctly, despite the presence of free cysteines of Int N . These disulfide bonds facilitate SVN folding to the native conformation [27, 28] . Since we had to use reducing conditions for PTS, we prepared segmentally isotope-labeled SVN-GB1 for the structural assessment of SVN. We used 15 Figure S4 ). The [ 1 H, 15 N]-HSQC spectra of SVN with invisible GB1 tag did not show well-dispersed peaks typical for the well-folded globular domain, indicating that SVN was incorrectly folded or unfolded. The fusion with Int N or the ligation in reducing conditions likely affected the correct folding of SVN. We assume that the ligated SVN-GB1 prepared in this study was biologically inactive.",

            "text": "Inspired by heavy-chain antibodies from camelids composed of only two heavy chains, we decided to create Fc fusion proteins in vitro at the N-terminus of the Fc region. In heavy-chain antibodies, 50-kDa antigen-binding domains of IgG, which consist of V H , V L , C L, and C H 1 domains, are replaced with a smaller 12-kDa variable domain (V H H). We hypothesized that carbohydrate-binding proteins like lectins could be able to replace the role of the variable domain of V H H as a binding domain in IgG format when fused at the N-terminus of Fc domain (Figures 3 and 6d) . Such Fc fusion proteins might function like an antibody, i.e., 'lectibody', with a bivalent binding capability [29] . Previously, a lectibody was engineered as a genetic fusion of a lectin and Fc domain, and produced in plants [29] . The production of full-length antibodies or antibody fragments in large quantities can be challenging in bacterial overexpression systems because the disulfide bonds need to form correctly [39] . Mammalian expression systems have been established for the large-scale production of monoclonal antibodies, but establishing a cell-line for each new monoclonal antibody or a fusion protein requires time-consuming optimizations [40] . Additionally, protein production in mammalian cells can be more expensive and slower compared with bacterial expression systems [39] . Heterogenous expression using mammalian cells could also be more problematic than bacterial expression for engineered foreign proteins from different organisms, such as from plants and bacteria, even in small quantities. Therefore, we developed an in vitro protein ligation approach, which provides an alternative solution for the production of Fc fusions. The in vitro protein ligation approach enabled us to produce various fusion proteins using off-the-shelf domains that were preproduced in different suitable host organisms for each domain. This off-the-shelf protein ligation approach avoids time-consuming steps to optimize the expression and purification for each fusion protein. Once individual domains have been prepared and stored, only the protein ligation step needs optimization.",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of producing N-terminal fusion proteins of the Fc domain in vitro by PTS. PTS successfully ligated the Fc domain made in Brevibacillus and other domains produced in E. coli. The method worked for the Fc domain, both with and without the core hinge region, although the reaction required reducing conditions. C-terminal fusions of a full-length IgG and Fc domains by PTS have been demonstrated previously, resulting in functional IgGs with a high ligation efficiency (80%) under reducing reaction conditions [41, 42] . Reducing conditions had to be employed in previous reports, as well as in this study. The reducing conditions affected neither antibody affinity nor integrity by the protein ligation using PTS [41, 42] . This observation indicated that Fc-fusion proteins generated by PTS could be further exploited for various in vitro products of Fc fusions, including bispecific antibodies, if two orthogonal split inteins could be used [42, 43] . We successfully demonstrated the production of an Fc fusion of SVN, which is a model lectin bearing five disulfide bridges, and the N-terminal split intein in E. coli, as previously reported [27, 28] . However, the SVN domain in the ligated product by PTS appeared to be unfolded or misfolded, as revealed by NMR analysis using segmental isotopic labeling of SVN [36, 37] . We believe that the folding problem of SVN was due to the reducing condition used in the protein ligation reaction by PTS, and that the ligated product was functionally inactive. We chose SVN from the cyanobacterium Scytonema varium as a model system. SVN binds to various viruses, including HIV glycoproteins, SARS coronavirus, and Ebola virus [28, 38, 44] . It might be possible to use the fusion protein of antiviral lectins as a therapeutic anti-HIV or anti-SARS drugs as a lectibody. In our study, however, SVN bearing five disulfide bonds turned out to be a nonideal candidate for in vitro protein ligation by PTS, at least with split DnaE inteins that require reducing conditions for PTS. Many other lectins contain no disulfide bridges, such as griffithsin from red algae, which also binds to gp120 and gp41 of HIV with high affinity, as well as to SARS coronavirus [38, 45, 46] . These lectins bearing no disulfide bonds could be more easily developed as lectibodies with therapeutic potential when the intein-Fc fusions are prepared from mammalian cells for the effector functions of IgG, such as ADCC. As the Fc domain could improve the pharmacokinetic properties, the Fc domain may be a good fusion partner for other binding domains [29] .",

We replaced the cysteine with a serine residue at the +1 position in one of the Int C -Fc precursors (Int C +1S-Fc). This construct, however, still requires reducing conditions for PTS reaction, despite the lack of cysteine in both the intein and hinge regions. This result suggests that other cysteines, such as the first residue of the intein, which is responsible for the first step of the splicing reaction, still require reducing conditions. However, the produced Fc domain retained the capability of protein A binding, indicating the proper three-dimensional structure of the Fc domain by preserving the protein A binding surface. The structure was preserved presumably because two buried intramolecular disulfide bridges in Ig folds (C H 2 and C H 3) were not influenced by a reducing agent such as 0.5 mM TCEP (Supplemental Figure S3 ). In the case of the Fc domain with core hinge, the two disulfide-bridges (CPPC) in the core hinge probably have to be reduced to avoid steric hindrance with the Int N fragment. Several inteins in nature contain no cysteine residue within their sequence, including the +1 position [47] . These cysteine-free inteins might be alternatively exploited for PTS.",

Independently prepared N-terminal domains made in E. coli were ligated in vitro with the C-terminal Fc domain produced in Brevibacillus choshinensis. The in vitro product could constitute an IgG-like Y-shape structure with bivalent binding sites. In nature, there are many natural bioactive proteins, peptides, and domains like lectins that bind to various receptors and ligands but which have not been widely used as a binding domain in IgG-like format. The production of fusion proteins with such bioactive domains in vitro using an off-the-shelf approach paves a new way for the rapid production of IgG-like molecules with known therapeutic potential without any time-consuming genetic engineering and optimization. The off-the-shelf approach using premade domains could be advantageous for drug development against rapidly emerging infectious diseases. ",
