Several classification methods were applied and compared against standard pneumonia severity scores. The need for hospitalization, ICU care, and mechanical ventilation were predicted with a validation accuracy of 88%, 87%, and 86%, respectively. Pneumonia severity scores achieve respective accuracies of 73% and 74% for ICU care and ventilation. When predictions are limited to patients with more complex disease, the accuracy of the ICU and ventilation prediction models achieved accuracy of 83% and 82%, respectively. Vital signs, age, BMI, dyspnea, and comorbidities were the most important predictors of hospitalization. Opacities on chest imaging, age, admission vital signs and symptoms, male gender, admission laboratory results, and diabetes were the most important risk factors for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. The factors identified collectively form a signature of the novel COVID-19 disease.",

            "text": "Much of the modeling work related to the pandemic has focused on spread dynamics (Kucharski et al., 2020) . Others have described patients who were hospitalized (Richardson et al., 2020 ) (n = 5700) and (Buckner et al., 2020 ) (n = 105), became critically ill (Gong et al., 2020) (n = 372), or succumbed to the disease (n = 1625 (Onder et al., 2020) , n = 270 [Wu et al., 2020] ). In data from the New York City, 14.2% required ICU treatment and 12.2% mechanical ventilation (Richardson et al., 2020) . With such rates, the logistical and ethical implications of bed allocation and potential rationing of care delivery are immense (White and Lo, 2020) . To date, while state-or country-level prognostication has developed to examine resource allocation at a mass scale, there is inadequate evidence based on a large cohort on accurate prediction of the disease progress at the individual patient level. A string of recent studies developed models to predict severe disease or mortality based on clinical and laboratory findings, for example (Yan et al., 2020 ) (n = 485), (Gong et al., 2020 ) (n = 372), (Bhargava et al., 2020) (n = 197) , ) (n = 208), and (Wang et al., 2020) (n = 296) . In these studies, several variables such as Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) (Gong et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been identified as important predictors. All of these studies considered relatively small cohorts and, with the exception of Bhargava et al., 2020, considered patients in China. Although it is believed that the virus remains the same around the globe, the physiologic response to the virus and the eventual course of disease depend on multiple other factors, many of them regional (e.g. population characteristics, hospital practices, prevalence of pre-existing conditions) and not applicable universally. Triage of adult patients with COVID-19 remains challenging with most evidence coming from expert recommendations; evidence-based methods based on larger U.S.-based cohorts have not been reported (Sprung et al., 2020) .",

To develop these models, we developed a pipeline leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to extract information from the clinical reports for each patient, employing statistical feature selection methods to retain the most predictive features for each model, and adapting a host of advance machine learning-based classification methods to develop parsimonious (hence, easier to use and interpret) predictive models. We found that the more interpretable models can, for the most part, deliver similar predictive performance compared to more complex, 'black-box' models involving ensembles of many decision trees. Our results support our initial hypothesis that important clinical outcomes can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy upon the patient's first presentation to the hospital using a relatively small number of features, which collectively compose a 'signature' of the novel COVID-19 disease.",

The study was approved by the pertinent Institutional Review Boards. eLife digest The new coronavirus (now named SARS-CoV-2) causing the disease pandemic in 2019 , has so far infected over 35 million people worldwide and killed more than 1 million. Most people with COVID-19 have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. But some become seriously ill and need hospitalization. The sickest are admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and may need mechanical ventilation to help them breath. Being able to predict which patients with COVID-19 will become severely ill could help hospitals around the world manage the huge influx of patients caused by the pandemic and save lives. Now, Hao, Sotudian, Wang, Xu et al. show that computer models using artificial intelligence technology can help predict which COVID-19 patients will be hospitalized, admitted to the ICU, or need mechanical ventilation. Using data of 2,566 COVID-19 patients from five Massachusetts hospitals, Hao et al. created three separate models that can predict hospitalization, ICU admission, and the need for mechanical ventilation with more than 86% accuracy, based on patient characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory results and chest x-rays. Hao et al. found that the patients' vital signs, age, obesity, difficulty breathing, and underlying diseases like diabetes, were the strongest predictors of the need for hospitalization. Being male, having diabetes, cloudy chest x-rays, and certain laboratory results were the most important risk factors for intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation. Laboratory results suggesting tissue damage, severe inflammation or oxygen deprivation in the body's tissues were important warning signs of severe disease.",

The prediction models are not meant to replace clinicians' judgment for determining level of care. Instead, they are designed to assist clinicians in identifying patients at risk of future decompensation. Patient vital signs were the most important predictors of hospitalization. This is expected as vital signs reflect underlying disease severity, the need for cardiorespiratory resuscitation, and the risk of future decompensation without adequate medical support. Older age and BMI were also important predictors for hospitalization. Age has been recognized as an important factor associated with severe COVID-19 in previous series (Grasselli et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020) . However, it is not known whether age itself or the presence of comorbidities place patients at risk for severe disease. Our results demonstrate that age is a stronger predictor of severe COVID-19 than a host of underlying comorbidities. In terms of patient comorbidities, adrenal insufficiency, prior transplantation, and chronic kidney disease were strongly associated with need for hospitalization. Diabetes mellitus was associated with a need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, which might be due to its detrimental effects on immune function.",

LDH is an indicator of tissue damage and has been found to be a marker of severity in P. jirovecii pneumonia (Zaman and White, 1988) . Along with CRP, it was among the two most important predictors of ICU admission and ventilation in the parsimonious model among patients who had LDH and CRP measurements on admission. This finding is consistent with previous reports identifying LDH as an important prognostic factor (Gong et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2020; Mo et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) . In addition, lower serum calcium is associated with cell lysis and tissue destruction, as it is often seen as part of the tumor lysis syndrome. Elevated serum anion gap is a marker of metabolic acidosis and ischemia, suggesting that tissue hypoxia and hypoperfusion may be components of severe disease.",

Interestingly, we can achieve AUC within 85-86% for ICU and ventilation prediction with a parsimonious linear model utilizing no more than 10 variables. In all cases, we can also develop a parsimonious model with binarized variables using medically suggested normal and abnormal variable thresholds. These binarized models have similar performance with their continuous counterparts. The ICU and ventilation models using all patients are very accurate, but, arguably, make a number of 'easier' decisions since more than 60% of the patients are never hospitalized. Many of these patients are younger, healthy, and likely present with mild-to-moderate symptoms. To test the robustness of the models to patients with potentially more 'complex' disease, we developed ICU and ventilation models on a restricted set of patients. This is the subset of patients who are hospitalized and most of the crucial labs are available for them (specifically CRP and LDH which emerged as important from our models). The best AUC for these models drops, but not below 82%, which indicates robustness of the model even when dealing with arguably harder to assess cases. LDH, CRP, calcium, lung opacity, anion gap, SpO2, sodium, and a comorbidity of insulin-controlled diabetes appear as the most significant for these patients. Interestingly, the corresponding binarized models have about 10% lower AUC; apparently, for the more severely ill, clinical variables deviate substantially from normal and knowing the exact values is crucial.",

We also examined how much in advance of the ICU or ventilation outcomes our models are able to make a prediction. Of course, this is not entirely in our control; it depends on what state the patients get admitted and how soon their condition deteriorates to require ICU admission and/or ventilation. Table 6 reports the corresponding statistics.

Such patients were hemodynamically stable and had minimal oxygen requirements on the floor, before clinical deterioration necessitated ICU admission. We identified several such patients. A typical case is that of a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obesity, and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, who presented with a 3-day history of dyspnea, cough and myalgias. In the emergency department, he was hemodynamically stable, saturating at 96-97% on 2 L of nasal cannula. The patient was admitted to the floor and did well for 3 days, saturating at 93-96% on room air. On the fourth day of hospitalization, he had increasing oxygen requirements and the decision was made to transfer him to the ICU. He was intubated and ventilated for 30 days. Our prediction models accurately predicted at the time of his presentation that he would eventually require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. This prediction was based on such variables as an elevated LDH (241 U/L) and the presence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Another such case is that of a 59-year-old male without a significant prior medical history who presented with 2 days of dyspnea, nausea, and diarrhea. At the emergency department, he was tachycardic at 110 beats per minute and saturating at 96% on room air, and the patient was admitted. For 2 days, the patient was hemodynamically stable, saturating at 94-97% on room air. On the third day of hospitalization, he had increasing oxygen requirements, eventually requiring transfer to the ICU. He was intubated and ventilated for the next 14 days. Our prediction model predicted the patient's decompensation at his presentation, due to elevations in LDH (348 U/L) and CRP (102.3 mg/L).",

Second, the negations in the text should be recognized. Simply recognizing a medical term such as 'cough' or 'fever' is not sufficient since the report may include 'Patient denies fever or cough'. We applied multiple NLP schemes to overcome these difficulties. Regular expression matching is the basic strategy we used to extract features such as body temperature values (with or without decimal followed by '?C/?F') and blood pressure values ('xx(x)/xx(x)' even if they are mixed up with a date 'mm/dd/yyyy' having similar symbols).

The key motivation of NER is that it is hard to list all possible disease names and search for them in each sentence; instead, NER models use the context to infer the possible targets, thus, even abbreviations like 'N/V' will be recognized. We used the spaCy NER model (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016 ) trained on the BC5CDR corpus.

CURB-65 uses a mental test assessment, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and the indicator of age being 65 or older. PSI uses similar information, a host of laboratory values, and comorbidities. From CURB-65 we did not score for mental status since we did not have such information. From PSI, we did not use mental status and whether the patient was a nursing home resident. Given that laboratory values are used, we computed these scores to predict ICU care and ventilator use. In each case, we computed the corresponding score and then optimized a threshold using cross-validation over the training set in order to make the prediction. We used these thresholds and evaluated performance of each scoring system in the test set.",

White blood cells (WBC) types (basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils) were reported both as an absolute count and percentage (of WBC). We eliminated the percentages and maintained the absolute counts. We also removed all laboratory test results that did not contain enough information for a significant percentage of the patients (less than 10%). This retained 65 laboratory variables.

In the test phase, RF uses the trained decision tree classifiers to classify a test sample, and then combines all the classifiers by majority voting.XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016 ) generates a series of decision trees in sequential order; each decision tree is fitted to the residual between the prediction of the previous decision tree and the target value, and this is repeated until a predetermined number of trees or a convergence criterion is reached. All decision trees computed are combined with proper weights to produce a final decision. XGBoost uses shrinkage and column subsampling to prevent overfitting and achieves fast training using a number or parallelization approaches.Both of these nonlinear models are expensive to train compared to the linear models we discuss next. Essentially, each one of them trains an ensemble of many decision trees (could be as many as 500 or more) and a decision is made by combining information from all of these trees.Among the linear classifiers, we used the support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) , which computes an optimal hyperplane separating the two classes. To render the method robust to noise and the presence of outliers (Chen and Paschalidis, 2018) we used (' 1 -or ' 2 -norm) regularized versions of SVM.We also used Logistic regression (LR) -a common classification method that uses a linear regression model to approximate the logarithmic odds (logit) of the true classification label. LR, in addition to a prediction, also provides the likelihood of the predicted outcome, which can be used as a confidence measure in decision making. Similar to SVM, we used (' 1 -or ' 2 -norm) regularized logistic regression to find the optimal subset of features from the initial feature space. In particular, based on the LR model, the predicted probability of the outcome, denoted by\u0177, is estimated by the formula:\u0177where exp \u00c1 f g denotes the exponential function, b 0 is the intercept, x 1 ; . . . ; x n \u00f0 \u00de the variables used by the model, and b 1 ; . . . ; b n \u00f0 \u00de the corresponding coefficients. Using this formula and the LR coefficients (and intercept) provided in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, one can obtain an easily computable value for the predicted probability of the corresponding outcome. Comparing that value to a threshold (in the interval [0,1]) yields a prediction. The threshold can be set depending on the desired trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, which is typically specified by the user.",

In these results, we excluded patients whose predicted outcome (ICU or intubation) occurs less than x hours from the time the admission lab results were made available, where x takes values in the set {6 hr, 12 hr, 18 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr}. Thus, the corresponding test set includes only patients with sufficient time difference from the data used to make the prediction, assessing how far into the future the predictive model could reach. We added the additional 11 patients to make sure we have a sufficient number of test patients to perform this study. As the results suggest, ICU admission estimation is fairly accurate and robust, whereas intubation prediction had moderate predictive power.Appendix 1-table 11.
