There were no COVID-19 diagnoses in the 200 patients without surgery.

The patients developed fever within 2 days after surgery, which persisted (highest temperatures of 38.7 C-39.4 C) despite the administration of anti-inflammatory drugs (cephalosporin, meropenem, and moxifloxacin). One patient had a cough and significantly decreased blood oxygen. Positive CT findings showed signs of a viral pneumonia approximately 10 days after surgery in all three patients (Fig. 1) , whereas two of them had a negative chest x-ray or CT on days 4-6 postoperatively. All patients had negative results from tests of blood and throat swab samples for seven common respiratory pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, coxsackievirus group B, The patients were transferred to a quarantine hospital and treated with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or umifenovir) combined with supportive care. As of February 20, 2020, two of the three patients had been discharged from the hospital because they had met the discharge criteria (i.e., they had neither fever nor cough for at least 3 days, the lesions of lung had become much smaller according to chest CT imaging, and repeated negative results had been obtained in at least two consecutive viral DNA tests on different days [2]); at this writing, the third patient was still being treated at the quarantine hospital.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 104, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 690, "end": 698, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Brief Communications"}, {"text": "In previous studies, nearly half of patients with COVID-19 had underlying chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, and the common symptoms at onset of illness included fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

Some patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and some of these patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure [3, 4] . Generally, the incubation period for COVID-19 can last 2 weeks, or longer [2, 5] considering that CT scan rather than x-ray of the chest plays an essential role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and that the viral detection assays are not always available or accurate [6] .

In the current study, only one of three affected persons was from metropolitan Wuhan, and the others were from nearby. In an epidemic area of COVID-19, more intensive surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 should be done before surgery. After surgery, if a patient's fever lasts for more than 3 days or is accompanied by respiratory symptoms, then COVID-19 testing should be performed, even if the patient has had no contact with other verified cases. In the present case report, the patients were older than the average age of the patients in the ward during the same time period, suggesting that age also may be a risk factor for COVID-19 after gynecologic tumor surgery. It was also observed, in all three cases, that the white blood cell count was not high and the lymphocyte count was reduced. One important finding was that there were no COVID-19 diagnoses in the no-surgery group, including 200 hospitalizations.
