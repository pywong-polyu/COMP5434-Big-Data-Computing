Methods: An online survey was designed using Google Forms focusing on the local impact of the pandemic on pancreatic surgery. The survey was conducted at 2 different time points, during and after the lockdown. Results: Twenty-five respondents (25/56) completed the survey. Many aspects of oncological care have been affected with restrictions and delays: staging, tumor board, treatment selection, postoperative course, adjuvant treatments, outpatient care, and follow-up. Overall, 60% of respondents have prioritized pancreatic cancer patients according to stage, age, and comorbidities, and 40% opted not to operate high-risk patients. However, for 96% of participants, the standards of care were guaranteed. Discussion/ Conclusions: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had an important impact on pancreatic cancer surgery in central Europe. Guidelines for prompt interventions and prevention of the spread of viral infections in the surgical environment are needed to avoid a deterioration of care in cancer patients in the event of a second wave or a new pandemic. High-volume centers for pancreatic surgery should be preferred and their activity maintained. Virtual conferences have proven to be efficient during this pandemic and should be implemented in the near future.",

Due to these limitations, surgical care was deeply impacted [2] . The reduced hospital and ICU capacity had led to restricting elective surgery in favor of emergency surgery, whereas cancer patients were prioritized by clinical priority and availability of resources [3] . Pancreatic cancer surgery, as a major oncological surgery often requiring intensive/intermediate care, has probably been even more affected by these re-strictions and the necessity of prioritizing patients [4] . Given the high aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer and the importance of the timeliness of treatments in these patients, delays and indecisions in the clinical process open up not only managerial but also ethical problems. Surgeons have had to balance between 2 aspects: on the one side, cancer patients appear to have a higher vulnerability in developing severe complications by COVID- 19 and, accordingly, increased necessity of intensive/intermediate care [5, 6] ; on the other hand, the inability to receive medical and/or surgical care seems to undermine cancer patients as well as SARS-CoV-2 and its complications [7] . On top of this, during the pandemic, patients have seemed hostile to consult a doctor, even when symptomatic, or to undergo surgical treatments, determining delays of diagnosis and treatment [8] .",

The answers were all obligatory, as well as registering the name and the institution to avoid overlap between the participants. We collected general information about the hospital and the actual situation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The critical care capacity was defined according to the CRITCON score (online suppl. Content 1). Then, with a focus on pancreatic surgery, we asked questions regarding staging modalities, treatment choice, and postoperative management before and during the pandemic. Last, personal considerations about the actual situation were also collected. A second round of the survey with 53 questions was conducted from May 4 to 22, 2020 to evaluate the evolution of the situation after the first phase of lockdown and the management of single hospitals regarding testing and equipment (online suppl.

Of note, the incidence of COVID-19 infection and death were 485 and 50 per 100,000 inhabitants in Spain in the same period. According to the Robert Koch Institute, about 350,000 tests were conducted per week in Germany during April 2020 with a mean positivity rate of 5.7% [10] . It is estimated that more than 28 million surgical procedures have been canceled or postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, 38% of which represented cancer surgery [2] . All guidelines and recommendations published during the first phase of the pandemic have suggested a precautionary reduction and postponing of elective surgery due to the limited healthcare resources and the risk of unexpected and severe postoperative complications. At that time, the virus was still unknown, and the evolution of the pandemic was not predictable; however, these suggestions were based on low-level evidences [11] [12] [13] . As a result, many clinicians involved in the care of oncologic patients have had to balance between a delay in cancer treatment and the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure for already vulnerable patients. In our survey, most surgeons have claimed important changes in the clinical practice during the pandemic, with the need to prioritize patients DOI: 10.1159/000513157 with pancreatic cancer according to 60% of the respondents.

Moreover, this issue is expected to play an important role for a longer time, even after the lockdown phase. The reduced amount of emergency surgery registered during this period also confirmed the tendency of avoiding hospitals and treatments by patients, with subsequent delays of diagnosis and the occurrence of more severe cases [8, 15] . Accordingly, we could assume that this will result in many patients presenting with more advanced disease stages in the near future due to a consistent delay of cancer diagnosis [16, 17] . However, an exact estimation of this phenomenon is not possible, yet.

Moreover, they are able to offer a more structured multidisciplinary approach to these patients. In case of a second wave or a new pandemic, where, as we learned, the risk for significant morbidity for cancer patients is even higher [5] , it seems reasonable that pancreatic surgery should be preferentially performed in high-volume centers (\u226520 pancreatoduodenectomies/year) in order to reduce the risk of long hospital stays and severe complications requiring intensive care [21] . In this setting, beside solid and diffuse preclinical testing at an early stage of the pandemic, many participants suggested to mandate pre-established hospitals, preferentially peripheral, to manage the pandemic, in order to offer a more widespread territorial assistance, to limit the diffusion of the virus and, on the other hand, to maintain the high specialized activities of tertiary centers. Moreover, a safer, more structured, and specialized approach, as provided by referral centers, should probably reassure patients and encourage them to rely on necessary care. This crisis has also shown the validity of alternative methods of patient evaluation, such as virtual tumor boards or virtual outpatient care. These instruments should be implemented to help routine clinical practice. Telemedicine might be helpful for a first screening of patients with pancreatic cancer, for example, to determine the resectability and surgical fitness, or to follow up the patients after surgery.",

The survey was conducted at the beginning of the pandemic, when the implications of the virus spread were unknown and unpredictable, and standardized protocols were lacking. Moreover, in light of this situation, each hospital adopted different measures to organize departments and employees. Therefore, we also chose to ask for subjective considerations by experts in the field.",

However, most participants declared to be satisfied with the reactions and measures adopted by their hospital; for most of them, also the restrictions of the surgical care were appropriate in Dig Surg 2021;38:158-165 DOI: 10.1159/000513157 this critical context. For the next future, it is important to design clear guidelines for prompt interventions and prevention of the spread of viral infections in the surgical environment, in order to avoid a deterioration of care in cancer patients. In addition, new approaches developed during the pandemic, as virtual tumor boards or ambulatory service, should also be implemented in a normal context to improve the healthcare service. Last, in pandemic times, consideration should be given to provide patients with appropriate information adapted to the severity of the situation without undue alarmism.",
