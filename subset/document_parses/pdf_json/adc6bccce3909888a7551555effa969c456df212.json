In the normal control group, the average value of the standard uptake value of both sides of the thyroid was used as the SUV of the thyroid gland and the highest SUV value of the patient's lesion (SUV max) represented the SUV of the lesion. After injection of imaging agent 18F-FD1G, routine imaging was performed at 1h, time-lapse imaging was performed at 2.5 h, and the changes with conventional imaging were compared to infer the benign and malignant lesions. We used SPSS software to carry out statistical analysis, respectively, carrying out analysis of variance, paired t-test, independent sample t-test, and linear correlation analysis. In the thyroid cancer group, 87.5% of the delayed imaging SUV was higher than the conventional imaging SUV, while 83.33% of the benign disease group had a lower SUV than the conventional imaging SUV. 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis in patients with Tg positive. However, it has lower sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of 131I-Dx-WBS negative DTC and 18F-FDG PET/CT. e specificity increases with the increase of serum Tg level. e above results confirm that 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging is of great significance for the diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis in patients; with PET/CT imaging, the results changed 16.13% of the Tg-positive and 131I-Dx-WBS negative DTC patients' later treatment decision. e decision-making and curative effect evaluation have certain value.",

            "text": "Recent related work is described below. In recent years, 18F-FDG PET/CT whole-body imaging has been used to distinguish benign and malignant tumors, to detect curative effects, to detect metastases, and to determine prognosis, which has achieved important clinical value [7] . yroid hypermetabolic nodules, or incidental tumors, indicate high glucose metabolism and the presence of thyroid tumors, and it is also another important imaging method to show thyroid nodules [8] . According to reports in the literature, Beyer et al. [9] performed PET examinations on 4803 healthy physical examination populations and detected 60 cases of incidental thyroid tumors, with a detection rate of 1.2%. Yang et al. [10] counted 4,525 cases examined in the PET centers of three hospitals, and 71 cases of incidental thyroid tumors were found, with a detection rate of 1.6%. Huang et al. [11] reported that 999 cases of known tumor patients and 331 healthy volunteers underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT whole-body imaging and found that there were 19 cases and 10 cases of incidental thyroid tumors, and the detection rates were 1.9% and 3.0%, respectively. Shakeel et al. [12] retrospectively analyzed the 18F-FDG PET/CT whole-body imaging of 4136 subjects without a history of thyroid disease and found 45 cases (35 cases of women, 10 cases of men) of incidental thyroid tumors; the detection rate was 1.1%. e detection rate is higher than that of men (0.8%, 0.2%). Sch\u00f6der [13] counted 1763 subjects who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations, found 70 cases of incidental thyroid tumors (the detection rate was 4.0%), and analyzed PET/CT examinations. However, in PET/CT, CT has a better positioning function and can provide more information. Liu et al. [14] performed 18F-FDG PET examination on 4,525 subjects, and 14 of 71 incidental tumors were pathologically diagnosed, of which 7 were malignant lesions, accounting for 50% of accidental tumors, 6 were high-functioning adenomas, and 1 was atypical hyperplasia of unknown origin. Lee and Lee [15] examined 1330 subjects with 18F-FDG PET and found 29 cases of incidental tumors, of which 15 cases were pathologically confirmed and 4 cases were malignant lesions, accounting for 26.7% of incidental tumors. Jager et al. [16] treated 4136 cases of thyroid incidental tumors in 45 cases without a history of thyroid disease. Among the 32 cases of pathological results, 16 cases were malignant lesions, accounting for 50% of incidental tumors. e reason for the relatively high thyroid cancer may be related to the examined population. Among the 16 malignant lesions, 14 cases were papillary carcinoma, and 2 cases were metastatic carcinomas of the breast and esophagus of origin; the other 16 cases were benign lesions, 2 cases were follicular tumors, 7 cases were nodular hyperplasia, and 7 cases were follicles of unknown nature [17] [18] [19] [20] . Some scholars have reported that in the diagnosis of cervical UPT the probability of PET/CT detecting the primary lesion is 57%, PET + CT is 52%, and CT is only 23%, suggesting that PET/CT and PET + CT are in the diagnosis of UPT [21] . Some scholars reported that PET is better than CT and MRI in diagnosing UPT of primary lesions in the head and neck, but there is no significant difference between the two in chest tumors. FDG concentration may be false positive due to chest inflammation and tuberculosis [22] . Some researchers believe that PET does not have any advantages over CT and MRI. PET has its limitations in local tissue resolution and anatomical positioning compared to CT [23] . e application of PET/CT examination that combines anatomical and functional imaging examinations significantly reduces the false-negative and false-positive rates [24] . Some scholars found 70 cases of thyroid incidental tumors in 1763 18F-FDG PET and CT subjects. Among them, 49 patients obtained pathological results. 18 cases were found to be malignant tumors, accounting for 36.7% of incidental tumors, including 16 cases of papillary cancer. One case originated from esophageal cancer metastasis, and one case was NHL [25] [26] [27] . ere have been several reports in the literature for many years [28] [29] [30] . However, PET/CT has the value of finding the primary tumor in patients with unidentified lymph node metastasis.",

Because PET imaging can directly detect tumor foci through abnormalities in local metabolic activity, it has a higher specificity, which is helpful for the identification of other benign lesions, and can detect metastases in other organs and soft tissues at the same time, which is helpful to guide the clinical selection of a more appropriate treatment plan. e decision-making of treatment plan and the evaluation of curative effect have certain value. e sample size of this study is small and has certain limitations. Moreover, this study is a retrospective analysis. e factors that affect image quality in imaging methods are not standardized. is article retrospectively analyzes 18 groups in patients suspected of having bone metastases in routine imaging examinations.

Eligibility criteria for increased thyroid 18F-FDG uptake are as follows: confirmed by two experienced nuclear medicine doctors, the patient can see the two lobes of the thyroid in the three-dimensional MIP image. eoretically speaking, the image information is dense and regular, including richness. Relative to the image, the expression of the point cloud is sparse and irregular, which makes it infeasible to directly process the point cloud using traditional perception. But the point cloud contains three-dimensional geometric structure and depth information, which is more beneficial for 3D target detection, so the two kinds of information are theoretically complementary. In addition, in the current two-dimensional image detection, deep learning methods are all based on it. Manually, we measure the degree of concentration, adjust the background to the liver brightness level, and measure the thyroid uptake on the cross-sectional PET/CT fusion image. Semiquantitative analysis of diffuse thyroid uptake: the same operator carefully delineates the region of interest (ROI) and places it at the highest point of thyroid uptake of 18F-FDG. e computer automatically calculates the intake SUVmax and selects the two leaves. On the cross-sectional image, we select the level with the highest radioactive concentration of the lesion with abnormal visual analysis and use the region of interest (ROI) method to measure the maximum standardized uptake value of the lesion. e ROI includes 2/3 of the tumor cross-sectional area. Figure 2 shows the flow of the deep learning fusion algorithm. If there is no abnormal concentration of radioactivity on PET imaging, according to the same CT or the patient's conventional CT, MRI, the location of the lesion is shown, and the method of visual fusion is used to delineate the ROI of the same size as the lesion in the corresponding part. e image analysis is performed by two experienced nuclear medicine doctors who jointly and independently read the diagnosis. When the conclusions are inconsistent, the results after discussion are used as the final diagnosis. DTC patients undergoing 131I-WBS after thyroid surgery and 131 treatment usually have normal radioactive accumulation sites: salivary glands, nasopharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and bladder. 131I-WBS image analysis excludes physiological uptake and radioactive contamination of normal tissues and locates and qualitatively diagnoses lesions with abnormal radioactive uptake. e acquisition range is from the base of the skull to the middle part of the femur. Spiral CT scan and then PET image acquisition are performed in 3D mode. e acquisition time for each bed is 5 minutes. Attenuation correction is performed on the image, and the axial, coronal, sagittal, and MIP images are obtained after iterative reconstruction, and the CT and PET images are fused.

Delayed imaging of thyroid cancer SUV is significantly higher than conventional imaging, but benign lesions do not have this feature, so it is believed that this feature is helpful for the differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid lesions. If SUV \ufffd 2.5 is used as the critical value for the diagnosis of thyroid benign and malignant lesions, it has the characteristics of high sensitivity and low specificity, and it needs to be combined with time-lapse imaging technology to enhance specificity. Taking SUV \ufffd 3.0 as the cut-off value is more suitable for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. e specificity of the diagnosis is improved but the sensitivity is reduced. Comparison of SUV between malignant bone lesions and benign lesions: in 101 patients in this study, a total of 1864 bone malignant lesions were detected by PET/CT, SUV forging was 5.54-3.8, benign lesions were 96, and SUVm was 5.7-3.6; statistical analysis showed that the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (t \ufffd 0.39, P \ufffd 0.70).

In this article, except for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism or chronic thyroiditis, although there is no pathological diagnosis in other cases, there are more people with positive antithyroid antibodies, so it may be related to thyroiditis. Figure 10 shows the PET-CT imaging sensitivity matchstick chart for different data points. In this study, the three imaging agents uptake 18F-FDG and 18F-FCH at the transplanted tumor site on PET/CT imaging. e tumor and muscle SUVmean ratios (T/NT) of the three groups of imaging agents from high to low are FCH group > FDG group > FMISO group, of which the FCH group is slightly higher than the FDG group, and both the FCH group and the FDG group are significantly higher than FMISO. FCH group is significantly higher than FDG group and FMISO group while FDG group is only slightly higher than the FMISO group. It explained that 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging has high resolution and image quality. Figure 11 shows the data fitting curve of the disease detection rate. e results show that it has high sensitivity but low specificity and false positives. e specificity and sensitivity of 18F-FCH imaging indicate that it is an ideal imaging agent, while 18F-FMISO is not an ideal imaging agent.",
