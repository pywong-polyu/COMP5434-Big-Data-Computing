To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create molecular tools allowing the investigation, diagnoses and treatment of COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denatured S proteins in all tested applications, including immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence staining of cells and immunohistochemical staining of paraffin embedded patients' tissue samples. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs can efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow the use of corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow the detection and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, even if the virus acquires novel mutations.",

Spike (S) glycoprotein is responsible for the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2. This protein contains a receptor binding domain (RBD) that interacts with the N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 with Kd of 14.7 nM [14] [15] [16] . Cryogenic electron microscopy has revealed a molecular structure of ACE2*RBD protein complex [14, 15] .

The majority of tests for SARS-CoV-2 are being performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on swabs from the nasopharynx or upper respiratory tract. Additionally, computed tomography of the chest is used to confirm the diagnosis, but its results are nonspecific and can often coincide with other diseases, therefore the diagnostic value of this method is limited [22, 23] . Serological tests of the immune response of patients are also important, as the presence of specific antibodies allows determination of the prevalence of COVID19 in society and the identification of people who can potentially be immune to the infection. Use of an immunoassay to evaluate the response to the vaccination was also proposed [24, 25] . Although the presence of neutralizing antibodies can only be confirmed by specific tests using virus-like particles [26] , high titers of IgG detected by immunoassay have been shown to positively correlate with the amount of neutralizing antibodies. To avoid the emergence of virus resistance to the antibodies, the administration of cocktails containing multiple therapeutic antibodies was proposed as a treatment strategy [27, 28] .",

The number of mAbs based drugs approved for the clinic is growing every year. In addition to human or humanized neutralizing antibodies proposed as a \"magic bullet\" for the treatment of COVID19 [30], there are a variety of antibodies produced in different species against all proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies cannot be directly used to treat patients with COVID19, but they serve as an important tool for both basic scientific research and for the development of vaccines and diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, none of these antibodies were developed in the Russian Federation.

Therefore, mAbs produced by these cells are likely nonspecific.

Thus, descendants of a single hybridoma cell will most likely produce different antibodies at early time points after fusion [34] . Therefore, we chose hybridoma #11 which showed highest immunoreactivity against the full-length S protein ( Figure 2B ) and subcloned these cells to obtain true monoclones. Culture media from 17 subclones of hybridoma #11 were tested by ELISA against RBD purified from E. coli, RBD purified from HEK293, and control protein purified from E. coli ( Figure 3A ). Based on our results, we picked 3 subclones for further analysis. Subsequent WB analysis demonstrated that all monoclones produce mAbs with higher specificity compared to the original hybridoma #11 ( Figure 3B ). It is interesting to note that mAbs from monoclone #11/13 which showed highest signal against RBD purified from E. coli but not against RBD purified from HEK293 ( Figure 3A ) were only able to detect endogenous 60 kDa human protein and showed weak binding to the full-length S protein. Therefore, it is possible that recombinant insoluble RBD has high epitope similarity to the undetermined endogenous protein. A total of fourteen hybridomas that demonstrated the strongest immunoreactivity against RBD were chosen for further analysis. Immunoblotting (WB) was performed with the culture medium from our clones to detect the S protein in the lysates of human cells that were transfected with plasmids encoding the full-length S protein or GFP as a control. Representative WBs are shown in Figure 2B . Interestingly, two clones which had highest immunoreactivity in ELISA experiment failed to detect the S protein on WB. Therefore, mAbs produced by these cells are likely nonspecific. Another important observation is that most of the tested mAbs were able to detect endogenous human protein with molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa. It is possible that this protein may have a common epitope with RBD of S protein from SARS-CoV2.",

One of the techniques for the production of such antibodies is based on the cloning of the previously identified variable domain sequences from mAbs into the artificially designed vectors encoding constant regions of the antibodies. Therefore, we aimed to determine the amino acid sequence of mAbs #11/9 which it responsible for binding to S protein. For this reason, we amplified cDNA encoding heavy and light chains of mAbs by 5\u2032 SMART RACE method. Using primers specific to k or \u03bb chains we demonstrated that mAbs #11/9 contains only k light chain ( Figure 6A ). Sequencing of PCR products revealed the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of variable domains of mAbs #11/9 ( Figure 6B ). Bioinformatic analysis showed that both light and heavy chains do not contain in frame stop codons, have the correct position of the conserved amino acids and that the corresponding nucleotide sequences have not been published previously. Therefore, the obtained sequences most likely represent viable antibodies originating from murine splenocytes but not abortive rearrangement products which theoretically could appear from X63 myeloma cells that were used for fusion. mAbs #11/9 were raised against RBD which plays the key role in the virus infection by interacting with the surface protein ACE2 [36] .

One of the techniques for the production of such antibodies is based on the cloning of the previously identified variable domain sequences from mAbs into the artificially designed vectors encoding constant regions of the antibodies. Therefore, we aimed to determine the amino acid sequence of mAbs #11/9 which it responsible for binding to S protein. For this reason, we amplified cDNA encoding heavy and light chains of mAbs by 5 SMART RACE method. Using primers specific to k or \u03bb chains we demonstrated that mAbs #11/9 contains only k light chain ( Figure 6A ). Sequencing of PCR products revealed the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of variable domains of mAbs #11/9 ( Figure 6B ). Bioinformatic analysis showed that both light and heavy chains do not contain in frame stop codons, have the correct position of the conserved amino acids and that the corresponding nucleotide sequences have not been published previously. Therefore, the obtained sequences most likely represent viable antibodies originating from murine splenocytes but not abortive rearrangement products which theoretically could appear from X63 myeloma cells that were used for fusion.",

Thus, we demonstrated that two injections of RBD mixed with FIA might be sufficient for the emergence of antibodies that can target the full-length native S protein. On the other hand, it might be worthy to note that most of the mAbs that were established during this study could interact unspecifically with the endogenous protein from human cells. This is consistent with recently published observations, showing that a substantial fraction of naturally occurring SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies show cross-reactivity to self-antigens [40] . This polyreactivity could be explained by the fact that most of the anti-RBD antibodies have a germline or near germline configuration. Thus, it was shown that in COVID19 patients the average somatic hypermutation (SHM) rate of anti-RBD antibodies is relatively low-reaching 2.2-2.8% [40, 41] . Consistently, the SHM of mAbs #11/9 was calculated to be 3.4%. In future studies it will be important to determine self-proteins which bind to anti-RBD antibodies and to investigate how these unspecific interactions may affect COVID19 patients.",

Bacteria were incubated at 37 \u2022 C in a shaker until OD 600 reached 0.7. Next, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the bacteria were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 \u2022 C. Then, a quantity of 200 mL media with bacteria were centrifuged for 15 min, 5000\u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C and the pellet was resuspended in 12 mL of lysis buffer B (200 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 8 M Urea, 0.5 mM DTT) and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Next, solution was centrifuged for 15 min, 20,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C and supernatant was incubated with 2 mL of Ni-NTA resin for 1 h under a constant agitation. Suspension was transferred to a column and washed with 20 mL of buffer B and 10 mL of buffer C (same as buffer B but pH 6.3). Bounded proteins were eluted with buffer D (buffer C with 250 mM of imidazole) and dialyzed overnight against PBS with 1 mM DTT. The purity of obtained protein was assessed by electrophoresis and subsequent Coomassie Blue staining. The RBD fragment of the S protein purified from HEK293 cells was kindly provided by Dr. Vassili Lazarev from the Center for Precision Genome Editing and Genetic Technologies for Biomedicine, Federal Research and Clinical Center of Physical-Chemical Medicine of Federal Medical Biological Agency.",
