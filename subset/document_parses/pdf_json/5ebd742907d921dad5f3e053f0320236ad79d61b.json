None of the patients were able to be awakened even after the tracheostomy. Prone positioning was not implemented or delayed in the on-ECMO group.

It may be speculated that in patients with COVID-19, heparin discontinuation during VV-ECMO may promote disseminated intravascular coagulation because of microthrombi formation, resulting in consumptive coagulopathy. Although only one patient (with HIT) required a circuit change after the tracheostomy, physicians should generally be aware of the possibility of circuit-related problems during heparin discontinuation. Valchanov et al. 7 reported that 39% of patients who underwent a tracheostomy during VV-ECMO did not discontinue heparin because of concerns about the hypercoagulable state in COVID-19. Whether or not heparin should be continued in patients with VV-ECMO for COVID-19 requires further study of hypercoagulability using viscoelasticity tests.",

Moreover, healthcare workers were required to wear personal protective equipment when treating patients with COVID-19, and because all the patients were housed in an individual negative-pressure room, the nursing staff was unable to respond immediately even when a patient was awake and exhibiting disturbing behavior. Therefore, deep sedation management also facilitated safe patient care. Prone positioning is recommended for patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation and is applied at our hospital even during VV-ECMO use. 8 However, prone positioning was not applied in the early phase in the on-ECMO group because of concerns about hemorrhaging at the tracheostomy site and dislodgement of the tracheostomy tube. Although a tracheostomy is not contraindicated for prone positioning, oral intubation may be preferable because there is no need for concern about bleeding at the stoma site. Deep sedation is essential for performing prone positioning, and concomitant use of a muscle relaxant may be considered.",
