Thus, as they worked frontline to take care of infected people without the required protection, nurses were particularly exposed to the virus. Indeed, nurses were the most frequently infected among all HCW [4] , and 2200 of them have died since the outbreak's start [5] . Besides, previous studies, relating to other epidemics like Ebola [6] , have shown that healthcare workers (HCW) and their families may be stigmatized to the point of physical or verbal abuse.",

These different elements had also consequences on their personal life and well-being, which have been poorly explored in-depth [9] . However, to our knowledge, no study has focused on the experiences and perceptions of frontline nurses' relatives. Yet, families have been identified as resourceful for helping HCW to cope with the pandemic's consequences [7] . Thereby, we sought to elucidate the consequences of nurses' frontline position on their personal and social life, and to compare them with nurses' own relatives.",

Thus, representations allow behaviors and actions to be explained and also meaning to be given to practices [13] . We did not aim to define the social representations related to the pandemic in this study. However, we considered this approach accurate in limiting social desirability answers [15] . Indeed, it enables indirect questions to be asked by grasping the \"mute zone\", where the participants can attribute certain ideas to others in order to reduce \"normative pressure\" [16] . Thus, probing questions, such as \"What was your colleague's feeling about this?\" were used to explore the mute zone and enhance the depth of discussion. Potential sensitive issues could occur during the interviews.

Besides, some nurses, especially in nursing homes, felt devalued as they noticed COVID-19 units had more PPE than other units. This imbalance between services angered them, as they would have wished for more safety and better working conditions: \"Nurses in non-acute services did not feel they were treated in the same way as those working in COVID units. They lived this situation very badly and felt forgotten by the management.\" RN-ICU Thus, some nurses were certain that they wanted to quit their job after the crisis, while others gained confidence and wanted to keep working as a nurse. Indeed, of the 55 nurses interviewed (including relatives): four nurses (7%) expressed their desire to leave the nursing profession, four other nurses (7%) would have left the nursing profession if they had not already been engaged in a career evolution and five nurses (9%) are considering leaving their establishment following this health crisis. Thus, nearly a quarter of the nurses (23%) admit that they are considering a change of career path. However, this might be an underestimation, as other nurses complained about the poor management they had experienced. \"I'm thinking of changing my profession to go towards what is human, such as sophrology and relaxation, because I have the impression that there is no longer any humanity, either with the patients or the staff.\" RN-NH",

Thus, as in previous studies [21] , nurses and nursing students were driven by their sense of responsibility to work frontline but the challenging and harmful working conditions (i.e., PPE and medical devices shortages) jeopardized their own and the patients' safety. Thus, nurses felt overexposed to the virus and were vulnerable to death anxiety, which they experienced through the high COVID-19 mortality rate or their inability to help patients as in previous researches [22] . Our results also highlighted nurses' perceptions of other death anxiety factors, as the avoidable deaths, the rapid health declines leading to death, and the lack of human dignity for the dying and the deceased patients (e.g., Symbolic Exchange and Uncertainty Paradoxes) [22] . Besides, nurses' vulnerability was also induced by their difficulties in providing care in this context [23] [24] [25] which disrupted their professional core values as they faced ethical dilemmas through patients' prioritization and the lack of human dignity surrounding patients' deaths [24, 26, 27] . Indeed, nurses were shocked by some of COVID-19 patients' deaths as they considered they would have been avoidable if there had been no patient prioritization [24] . These different situations strengthened nurses' death anxiety and weakened their mental health, as their frontline position reminded them of both their own vulnerability and that of their families. Nursing students felt also vulnerable, at the opposite side of another study [28] , but lesser than registered nurses.",

Thus, healthcare institutions should alleviate the perceived low job resources by improving inclusive leadership and organizational support through different strategies, which should also include their families as shown in Figure 1 [25] . Thus, institution managers should better recognize nursing issues [25, 42] , enhance frontline nurses' job engagement through gratitude expressions and rewards, and organize the provision of tailored psychological support to help nurses, nursing students, and their families to manage their anxiety [22, 36] . It is also crucial to provide nurses' families reliable and comprehensive information through educational online programs [43] .

The frontline position appears mostly as a factor of suffering, as nurses and nursing students were emotionally and physically strained. Their vulnerability was reinforced when they felt abandoned and inadequately supported by the top managers. After one year of pandemic pressure, these findings remain accurate, as nurses' working conditions worldwide are perceived to be unsatisfactory to some of them, who still feel poorly rewarded and supported. Therefore, institutions should address their specific concerns (i.e., better recognition, better organizational support, and inclusive leadership) to preserve nurses' job engagement and resilience.
