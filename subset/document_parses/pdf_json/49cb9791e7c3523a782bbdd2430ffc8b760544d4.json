Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses are proven to be instrumental in evaluating the efficiencies of therapeutics, owing to their ease in application and safety when compared to handling the live virus. However, a comprehensive protocol that includes selecting transfection reagents, validating different packaging systems for high-throughput screening of neutralizing antibodies, is still a requisite. To this end, we designed and synthesized amide linker-based cationic lipids with varying hydrophilic head groups from dimethyl (Lipo-DME) to methyl, ethylhydroxyl (Lipo-MeOH), and diethylhydroxyl (Lipo-DOH) keeping the hydrophobic tail, stearic acid, as constant. Among the liposomal formulations of these lipids, Lipo-DOH was found to be superior in delivering plasmids and demonstrated comparable transfection efficiencies with commercial standard Lipofectamine 3000. We further used Lipo-DOH for lentivirus and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirion preparation. For comparing different lentivirus packaging systems, we optimized conditions using Addgene and BEI systems and found that the BEI lenti plasmid system was found to be efficient in making lentiviruses using Lipo-DOH. Using the optimized transfection reagent and the lentivirus system, we developed a robust protocol for the generation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions and characterized their infectivity in human ACE2 expressing HEK-293T cells and neutralizing properties in IgG against spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 positive human sera from individuals recovered from COVID-19.",

The spike (S) glycoprotein present on the virus envelope is responsible for attachment and entry into host cells by binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptors (Hoffmann et al., 2020b) . The vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2 including mRNA, protein subunit, and viral vaccines induce a robust immune response resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that efficiently neutralize virus infectivity, thereby providing in virus neutralization which correlated with protection from re-infection or COVID-19 (Corbett et al., 2020; Erasmus et al., 2020; Laczk\u00f3 et al., 2020; De Alwis et al., 2021; Kyriakidis et al., 2021; Mandolesi et al., 2021; Mart\u00ednez-Flores et al., 2021) . The level of nAbs is an important parameter to determine the disease progression, quality of convalescent plasma (which has been used to treat hospitalized patients to prevent COVID-19 progression), and vaccines efficacy. (Zeng et al., 2020; Chmielewska et al., 2021; Klassen et al., 2021) . Recently reported that the SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially new variants of concern (VOCs) increase disease transmissibility and mortality than wild SARS-CoV-2 type (Chmielewska et al., 2021; Harvey et al., 2021) . Thus, it necessitates the development of high-throughput and low-cost methods for screening of nAbs in the COVID-19 pandemic for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The assays are widely adopted for determining the level of nAbs by using a live virus (such as micro-neutralization (MN) and the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)) and replication-deficient pseudovirions expressing SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins. Handling of the live virus requires handling with biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) practices, thus limiting its use to only in facilities with higher containment. MN and PRNT are low-throughput assays and cannot be deployed to scale for population-based testing. As SARS-CoV-2 is highly infective and pathogenic in nature, the live virus is extremely challenging, has low-throughput, and requires BSL-3 (Bewley et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021) .",

Hence, their applications were well popularized in the pandemic period. To mimic the natural infectivity of the virus, recent protocols have been used for the production of pseudoviruses expressing spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in other viral backbones such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Almahboub et al., 2020; Condor Capcha et al., 2020; Crawford et al., 2020; Hyseni et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2020; Donofrio et al., 2021; Kalkeri et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Neerukonda et al., 2021) . The efficiency of pseudovirus production critically depends on the backbone used in making the pseudovirus and the efficiency of the transfection reagent in delivering the viral plasmids into the cells. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive manufacturing protocol for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus that includes selecting transfection reagents and validating different packaging systems for facile and robust manufacturing is not reported yet.",

Lentiviruses have vesicular stromatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) on their envelope for broader infectivity into multiple cell types (Connolly, 2002) . Typically, the lentivirus system contains packaging plasmid, envelope plasmid, and transfer plasmids. Sequences of spike protein were inserted in the place of VSV-G in the case of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system (Wu et al., 2000) . Usually, these plasmids are transfected with the help of transfecting reagents into HEK-293T for producing viruses. Polyetheneimine (PEI) is the most commonly used transfection reagent (Yang et al., 2017) . However, high cytotoxicity and a requisite for media change post-transfection result in low titer virus production (Corbett et al., 2020) . Other commercially available liposomal transfection reagents, such as Lipofectamine 3000, are efficient with low cytotoxicity that results in high titer production (Lana and Strauss, 2020) . However, the high cost of the transfection reagent is a challenge for large scale pseudovirus production for high-throughput screening (Mart\u00ednez-Molina et al., 2020) .",

All liposomal formulations showed complete lipoplex formation with pDNA in all charge ratios except the Lipo-DME 1:1 ratio, which showed some part of unbound pDNA. Moreover, we have seen that Lipo-DOH lipoplexes form tight complexation with pDNA than other liposomal formulations. Lipo-DOH lipoplexes prevent ethidium bromide intercalation with DNA, and hence signal is less in wells (Supplementary Figure S17A) . Furthermore, we evaluated lipoplex stability by the DNase I sensitivity assay. Strong DNA complexation by liposomes prevents DNA from DNase I-mediated degradation. At 2:1 lipid to DNA charge ratio, we observed that all liposomal formulations completely protected DNA from degradation, and the result showed that plasmid was intact and band density was much comparable with naked pDNA control, which was not treated with DNase I (Supplementary Figure S17B ). The rationale for varying the hydrophilicity on the hydrophilic head group is to evaluate the optimal ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic within the lipid for having efficient pDNA complexation and intracellular localization. We observed that Lipo-DOH showed strong complexation with lenti plasmid system, protected pDNA from enzymatic degradation, and demonstrated superior transfection efficiencies than those of Lipo-DME and Lipo-MeOH and comparable to commercial transfection reagent, Lipofectamine 3000. These findings are in corroboration with previous findings that some of the lipids with the dihydroxy head group were found to be efficient in delivering plasmid DNAs (Venkata Srilakshmi et al., 2002) .",

For pseudovirus production, we used the lentiviral transfer plasmid (pLenti-Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen, BEI #-NR-52516) as it has both ZsGreen and luciferase reporter genes. This makes it easy to monitor the pseudovirus functional titer by flow cytometry as well as pseudovirus infectivity by the luciferase assay ( Figure 3C) . The yield and functional titer (TU) of pseudovirus were estimated by p24 ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. The results showed that the level of p24 protein was significantly higher in both spike-G614 and VSV-G pseudovirus produced by BEI than in the Addgene lentiviral production system, and the functional titer of these pseudoviruses also increased in the BEI system (Supplementary Figures S18A,B) . The spike G614 pseudovirus production efficacy of Lipo-DOH and LF-3000 were evaluated in HEK-293T cells. The Lipo-DOH liposome produced an equal level of spike G614 pseudovirus as LF-3000 liposome ( Figure 3B ). As we expected, the produced spike G614 pseudovirus infection was high in hACE2 overexpressing 293T-hACE2 cells than in 293T cells, but broad-spectrum VSV-G pseudovirus infected efficiently both 293T and 293T-hACE2 cells. This is confirmed by both fluorescent imaging as well as TU tire flow cytometry ( Figure 3D,E) . Moreover, the functional titer of produced spike G614 pseudovirus in 293T-hACE2 cells showed equal efficiency as LF-3000 in 293T-hACE2 cells ( Figure 3E) .",

Both antibody and hACE2 protein effectively neutralized the spike G614 pseudovirus infectivity. The antibody at above~10 \u03bcg/ml concentration showed inhibitory concentrations of 50% (IC50), whereas hACE2 protein efficiently neutralize even at above~1 \u03bcg/ml ( Figure 4A,B) . These data revealed that spike G614 mutant protein has more affinity to hACE2 protein, thus the hACE2 protein neutralizes more spike G614 pseudovirus at a lower concentration than the RBD antibody. This could be due to G614 mutation in the spike protein of pseudovirus which was well proven to have stronger interactions. Finally, we validated pseudovirus with IgG against spike positive sera from individuals recovered from COVID-19. Before the evaluation of the spike G614 pseudovirus neutralization assay using human SARS-CoV-2 patient sera, we performed a trimeric spike-hACE2 blocking assay to find the levels of spike antibodies blocking the binding of spike-hACE2 in human patient sera samples at different dilution. We found that all the SARS-CoV-2 patient sera samples have different levels of spike blocking antibodies when compared to control sera (Supplementary Figure S19) . Among that 20/ D2328, 20/D1985, and 20/D2294 patient sera have a high level of spike blocking antibodies than other sera samples (Supplementary Figure S19 ). Based on this study, we selected 20/D2328, 20/D1985, 20/D2294, and 20/D1196 (have less spike blocking antibodies) sera samples and used them for the spike G614 pseudovirus neutralization assay.",

Liposomal gene delivery has the advantage of having good transfection efficiency with lower cytotoxicity than cationic polymers. However, delivering plasmids over 10 kb is always a challenging task with the liposomal system (Meisel and Gokel, 2016) . More importantly, all the plasmids used for lentivirus production have more than 5 kb, which results in low titer with liposomes (Jiang et al., 2015) . To overcome this challenge, we designed amide linker-based cationic lipids, varying their head group from dimethyl (DME18) to methyl, ethylhydroxyl (MeOH18), and diethylhydroxyl (DOH18) keeping lipophilic stearic acid twin chains as constant. Typically, cationic lipid consists of a hydrophilic head group, hydrophobic tail, and linker functionality. In our prior findings, we demonstrated that amide linker lipids showed superior transfection efficiencies than ester linker based lipids and provided protection to DNA from enzymatic degradation . The rationale for varying the hydrophilicity on the hydrophilic head group is to evaluate the optimal ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic within the lipid for having efficient pDNA complexation and intracellular localization. We observed that Lipo-DOH showed strong complexation with the lenti plasmid system, protected pDNA from enzymatic degradation, and demonstrated superior transfection efficiencies than Lipo-DME and Lipo-MeOH and comparable to the commercial transfection reagent Lipofectamine 3000. These findings are in corroboration with previous findings that some of the lipids with the dihydroxy head group found to be efficient in delivering plasmid DNAs.",

In line with the prior findings, we made pseudovirus with the most common virus used in gene transfer studies, lentivirus. For optimizing the lentivirus production, we compared the Addgene lentiviral plasmid system, which consists of a three plasmid system, with the BEI lentiviral plasmid system, which consists of five plasmids. In both the plasmid systems, envelope and transfer plasmids are the same but packaging plasmids are different. Addgene has psPAX2 with a size of 11 kb as the packaging plasmid, whereas BEI has three different plasmids, namely, HDM-Hgpm2 (NR-52517), pRC-CMV-Rev1b (NR-52519), and HDM-tat1b (NR-52518) with sizes~4-8 kb. The size of the plasmid directly correlates to the expression in the transfections. Plasmids below 10 kb have better nuclear delivery than plasmids above 10 kb as their nuclear entry is compromised that in turn affect their transfection properties. Taking cues from the literature, we hypothesized that due to the lower size of packaging plasmids, BEI could have produced high titer lentivirus than the Addgene system. Furthermore, we used the BEI lentiviral production system for spike-G614 pseudovirus production. The spike G614 mutant protein increases virion density and infectivity of SARS-CoV2 virus through highaffinity binding toward the hACE2 receptor than wild-type spike D614 protein (Baric, 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Daniloski et al., 2021) . Thus, we selected spike G614 mutant for the production of pseudovirus in this study.",
