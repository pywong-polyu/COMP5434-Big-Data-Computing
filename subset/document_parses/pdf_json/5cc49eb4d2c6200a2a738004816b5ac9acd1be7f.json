After this, when the outbreak of the first wave was contained, the local government implemented additional testing capabilities, running free testing for every islander [28, 29] . The first cases in Galapagos were reported on March 24th by the ministry of health, totaling four infections ( Table 1) . Cases grew slowly and reached 227 by end of October with one confirmed death. In order to contain the spread, strict travel restrictions were implemented, local epidemiological surveillances was successfully put in place, and as soon as they were available vaccination campaigns were deployed. As a result Galapagos only reported 819 confirmed cases and 19 officially recorded deaths as of June 2021, while the country as a whole recorded 446,633 confirmed cases and 21,304 deaths [30] .",

To the best of the author's knowledge, only two studies related to psychological functioning in the Galapagos Islands are present in the peer-reviewed literature: one looking at maternal stress and its impact on infant development [31] and another one surveying cognitive decline in the islands [32] . The importance of obtaining data on mental health on this locality is underscored by the islands limited resources and tourismdependent economies that are particularly vulnerable to disruptive natural and social phenomena [33] . There is an urgent need to consider the well-being of the inhabitants in the face of crisis situations, such as the current pandemic, specifically by studying anxiety and depression, both of which can become elevated in the face of disasters [34] . To date, there are no indicators of the mental health of the inhabitants of the Galapagos islands, either before or during the pandemic. Thus, the present study aims to determine the levels of anxiety and depression in the context of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in the general population of the Galapagos archipelago. This work can be seen as a continuation of the work by Paz et al. [20] and Paz et al. [35] , which examined the emotional functioning of people in continental Ecuador but contained no information about inhabitants of the Galapagos Islands, because of a lack of reported COVID-19 cases in the islands at the time that study was conducted.",

Age ranged from 18 to 66 years with a mean of 35 (SD = 9.60); most of the participants were within 18-35 (58.3%, n = 215), 34.7% (n = 128) within 26-53 years and 7% (n = 26) were older than 53 years. Of the total sample, 356 provide information to calculate a score for the PHQ-9, resulting in a mean total score of 2.18 (SD = 3.47). A total of 361 participants had enough data to calculate a score of the GAD-7, resulting in a mean score of 2.57 (SD = 3.42). Finally, 365 participants provided enough data to calculate a PSS-10 total score, resulting in a mean score of 13.6 (SD = 5.60). The prevalence by severity of each of the assessed symptoms is presented in Table 2 . Prevalence of clinically significant anxiety (GAD-7 \u2265 10) was 4%, and prevalence for depression was 3.65% (PHQ-9 \u2265 10). Table 3 presents t-test, ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U test analyses contrasting sociodemographic variables and scores on the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PSS-10, as well as their relationship to the six aforementioned questions related to various behavioral and emotional reactions to the pandemic. There were significant gender differences for symptoms of depression and perceived stress, with women scoring higher. Also, higher scores on the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PSS-10 were associated with the presence of financial distress, interpersonal conflicts, feelings of isolation and fear of contagion of COVID-19. Finally, those who reported avoiding leaving home presented with lower levels of stress.",

While approximately 17%-23% of the sample showed at least mild symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, only a small proportion of the participants endorsed enough symptoms to be considered clinically problematic. Just 4% of the participants presented moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 3.65% reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression. However, more than half the sample reported moderate levels of perceived stress in response to the pandemic. The prevalence of anxiety and depression found in this study is considerably lower than what has been published to date. Recent meta-analyses present a prevalence of anxiety between 16.6% and 32.6%, and depression between 27.6% and 37.7%, depending on the study [45] [46] [47] . Furthermore, prior studies of emotional functioning during the pandemic in Ecuador also showed higher prevalence of psychological problems; Paz et al. [20] , utilizing a methodology similar to the current study but including information only about continental Ecuador, found a prevalence of 20.9% for depression and 22.5% for anxiety early in the pandemic, on March of 2020). Passavanti et al. [9] found a mean score of 8.75 on the PHQ-9 for Ecuadorian participants in a multi-country study, compared to a PHQ-9 mean score of 2.18 on the current one. Levels of perceived stress in this study appear to be more indicative of psychological distress, with 52% reporting moderate levels. However, results are also lower than those reported by Passavanti et al. [9] with an Ecuadorian sample, who found a higher mean level of perceived stress on the PSS-10 than the current study (19.25 vs. 13.60 ). In addition, the percentage of persons presenting low levels of stress was higher in our study (46.3%) that in Passavanti et al. [9] . Rodas et al. [24] administered the CES-D to a sample of 663 participants in Ecuador during the early stages of the pandemic (March to June) and, although prevalence scores for depression were not reported, the sample average was 19.6 (SD = 11.05), which is above the suggested cut-off score of 18 for the detection of depression. Furthermore, Tusev et al. [22] and Caycho-Rodriguez et al. [21] both found higher levels of significant depression (25% and 25.9% respectively) and anxiety (31.8% and 25.4% respectively) in large online samples.",

            "text": "Several factors may account for the stark differences in symptomatology between other regions and the Galapagos Islands. The existing studies focused heavily on the early months of the pandemic: four of five took samples between March and June exclusively. These were considered the most difficult months in the country with regards to cases and deaths at the national level [48] . The current study, however, looked at data obtained in October. In addition, cases and deaths in Galapagos were lower than the peaks experienced in large rural areas like Guayaquil and Quito [48] . As of the end of October of 2020, the Galapagos Islands reported 227 cases and one death. It is possible the psychological impact is thus lower because of these values. Higher stress levels identified, however, may be a response to the economic pressures the islanders were suffering due to the restrictions, which is illustrated by the statistically significant relationship found between self-reported economic problems and levels of stress. Regardless of lower levels of symptom report of anxiety and depression found in this study, perceived stress might be considered for future interventions in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. More than a half of the participants reported moderate levels of perceived stress. It is also relevant to note that PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are self-reports measures for the past 2 weeks, while the PSS-10 asks to report feelings and thoughts in the last month, probably capturing a longer lasting mental health state.",

This is not surprising given that, even prior to the pandemic, gender differences have been reported around the world [49] Women also presented with higher levels of perceived stress in this study, consistent with results from a 48-country study of perceived stress during the pandemic [50] . Hidalgo-Andrade et al. [51] also found higher levels of perceived stress in Ecuadorian female teachers during the pandemic. Gender differences in stress levels were thought to be related to unequal domestic task distribution in that study, as participants who reported being responsible for taking care of children and/or older adults presented with higher levels of distress and perceived stress. Other variables previously found to be associated with psychological functioning during the pandemic include age, income, and educational level. Present results did not show an association between age and psychological functioning, while other sociodemographic variables were not included in the analysis. Lastly, it is unclear why those who endorsed avoiding leaving home had lower levels of stress, but it may reflect reduced fear of contagion and feelings of safety at home.",

It is also likely less significant infection and mortality in the Galapagos Islands contributed to lower levels of psychopathology, which are possibly close to baseline. However, perceived stress levels were higher and this may in part be related to the changes in everyday life related to pandemic restrictions, including economic distress. In addition, certain problematic behaviors and emotional reactions are associated with higher symptom load overall, most notably financial distress, increased personal conflicts, feelings of isolation and fear of contagion.
