            "text": "Modeling the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic spread is a challenging and relevant problem. Established models for the epidemic spread such as compartmental epidemiological models e.g. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models and its variants, have been discussed extensively in the literature and utilized to forecast the growth of the pandemic across different hot-spots in the world. The standard formulations of SIR models rely upon summary-level data, which may not be able to fully capture the complete dynamics of the pandemic growth. Since the disease spreads from carriers to susceptible individuals via some form of contact, it inherently relies upon a network of individuals for its growth, with edges established via direct interaction, such as shared physical proximity. Using individual-level COVID-19 data from the early days (January 30 to April 15, 2020) of the pandemic in India, and under a network-based SIR model framework, we performed state-specific forecasting under multiple scenarios characterized by the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across 34 Indian states and union territories. We validated our short-term projections using observed case counts and the long-term projections using national sero-survey findings. Based on healthcare availability data, we also performed projections to assess the burdens on the infrastructure along the spectrum of the pandemic growth. We have developed an interactive dashboard summarizing our results. Our predictions successfully identified the initial hot-spots of India such as Maharashtra and Delhi, and those that emerged later, such as Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. These models have the potential to inform appropriate policies for isolation and mitigation strategies to contain the pandemic, through a phased approach by appropriate resource prioritization and allocation.",

COVID-19 has afflicted more than 105 million people -resulting in over 2.6 million deaths [as of March 7, 2021, end of day], sending billions into lockdown and ravaging economies and healthcare infrastructure with each passing day. This is a pandemic at a scale that the living generation has rarely seen. The novel viral strain, SARS-CoV-2, is highly contagious and hence spreads easily when humans come in close contact. This motivates a closer ad rem look at the inherent dynamics of the spread at a micro-scale which can help assess its multifold ramifications on the cultural, economic and health infrastructures. Using COVID-19 individual-level data and a contact network framework in the initial stages of the pandemic in India, we attempted to answer some critical questions to inform a phased approach to dealing with the pandemic by appropriate resource prioritization and allocation.",

            "text": "At a fundamental level, epidemics spread over a human to human network -where carriers spread the contagion by coming in contact with other people. A simple illustration is available in Figure 1 , where the population-level network consists of 100 individuals (nodes), and they are potentially connected among themselves via edges that are meant to simulate human to human interactions. The blue, red and green nodes indicate individuals in the susceptible (\"at risk\"), infected and removed (recovered or deceased) states, respectively. A transition from the susceptible to the infected state may happen if a susceptible node is connected to an infected node, akin to an uninfected individual coming in contact with an already infected individual. The changing composition of the nodes over time exemplify the typical spreading mechanism of an infectious disease like COVID-19. Such networks are established through various channels such as social and professional interactions, transport and travel or simply any form of shared physical proximity. As shown in Figure 1 , where nodes represent hypothetical individuals, the dynamics of spread of the disease is exhibited across time intervals. Established models for epidemic spread, which are further discussed in Section 2, assume random and homogeneous mixing between individuals, which might not be realistic since the general population has defined organizational units (geographical, social etc.) and individuals tend to interact within their sphere of influence. These \"links\" between individuals form a network and contagions spread along the infection paths wired along these networks. Containment procedures such as lockdowns, social distancing, smart quarantines effectively break this human to human \"link\" to disconnect the infected network, and hence confine and reduce the spread. Subsequently, using contact networks developed with high geo-specificity and resolution, one can learn specific spread mechanisms and inform precise action planning for mitigation and building health care capacities.",

As per the data released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, till the end of March 7, 2021, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in India was more than 11.2 millions, with a little more than 180,000 out of those cases still being active and more than 157,000 of the confirmed cases having been deceased 4 . The large population size and high population density of India rendered it to be on a potentially vulnerable ground from day one. While the eventual fatality rates are relatively low (1.45%, compared to a global fatality rate of 2.2%) 5 , a large population consisting of several significantly sized subpopulations with known co-morbidities had spelled potential troubles for India from the very beginning (Gupta et al., 2011; Arumugam et al., 2020) . At the time of the genesis of this project, in early March 2020, the first set of hot-spot Indian states like Kerala, Maharashtra, and Delhi were experiencing rising counts of cases while a number of other states were only beginning to have a surge in their relatively lower case numbers till date.",

We utilized individual-level (location-informed) crowdsourced data from publicly available databases for a total of 34 states and union territories of India across the dates of January 30 to April 15, 2020, covering a total of around 12,000 confirmed cases.

A sample locationbased network covering the data used is presented in Figure 2 . This figure presents all the individual COVID-19 infected patients who are included in the data used for our analyses, with their location information being used to plot them on the map.

In these class of models, the population is classified into several classes, or compartments, based on the stage of the infection that is affecting them. These models are primarily governed by a system of ordinary differential equations that take into account the time-discoursed infection status of the population compartments. The simplest of such classifications has two population groups, namely, susceptible, and infected. The corresponding epidemiological models, like the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model or the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model, take only the aforementioned compartments into account to model the infection dynamics. For a particular disease or infection, the susceptible compartment comprises of those people in the population who are non-infected, but have a potential to catch the disease. On the other hand, the infected compartment comprises of those who have the infection at that given point of time and with a potential to infect others. We now briefly discuss the basic compartmental models alongside explaining the various other compartments and the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing them.",

However, unlike the basic SI model, in this case the entire population is not infected, and the infectious fraction approaches (1\u2212\u03b2/\u03b4) as t \u2192 \u221e. This is referred to as the endemic state of the disease, where a certain fraction of the population always stay infected. If \u03b2 < \u03b4, the infections decay to zero exponentially. Hence the threshold value of \u03b2/\u03b4 acts as the endemic threshold which governs whether the disease will become an endemic or will eventually die out.",

In cases of infections like seasonal flu, where the immunity diminishes with time, a recovered individual becomes prone to re-infection, in which case the SIR model can be extended to the SIRS model.

It is interesting to explore the size of the outbreak r \u221e , given by lim t\u2192\u221e r(t). It satisfies the expression r \u221e = 1 \u2212 e \u2212r\u221e\u03b2/\u03b3 .

The transition that happens where \u03b2 = \u03b3 is referred to as the epidemic transition. In this regard, we can see the role that is commanded by the ratio \u03b2/\u03b3. To explore it with more depth, we need to introduce the concept of basic reproduction number, denoted by R 0 . R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by an infected individual during the latter's infectious period.

This parameter controls the rate at which an infected individual becomes infectious. Apart from the aspect of compartmentalization, the models discussed above rely heavily upon the assumption of homogeneous mixing, that is, each susceptible individual has equal chance of coming in contact with an infected individual, and hence having the potential to get infected. However, this assumption is very strong, and heavily depends on the nature of infection spread. For example, in case of SARS-CoV-2, the primary mode of spread is through respiratory droplets having a high volume of viral load. Aerosol transmission, though has a low viral load, contributes to infection spread. Other modes include fomites (surface transmission) and airborne transmission. In the latter case, recent research findings show that the virus can stay in the air for as long as 16 hours (Fears et al., 2020) . For more details on modes of transmission, we refer the readers to the scientific brief provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) titled 'Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: implications for infection prevention precautions' 6 . Thus, the infection can only spread via a contact network. Hence it is more appropriate to define the compartmental models over a network of contacts, and explore the network topology to model the spread of the disease. In the next section, we shall discuss epidemiological modeling over a network, that is precisely aimed to capture these phenomena.",

On the other hand, for a sparse network, the maximum eigenvalue \u03bb 1 would be small, so that, for the disease to spread, the infection rate \u03b2 must be very large and the recovery rate \u03b3 must be very small. Hence it is difficult for the infection to spread in sparse networks. This phenomenon illustrates the scientific principle behind isolation strategies and lockdowns as mitigation procedures in the early stages of a pandemic to curtail the spread of the disease in a given population.

In contrast, for high levels of degree heterogeneity, there are increased chances of 'super-spreaders' in the network that can infect a large number of nodes quickly, so that the disease spread becomes more pronounced. This makes the usage of network models more effective, in the sense that if we can trace and isolate these 'hub' nodes, then the degree heterogeneity is reduced via dropping of related edges in the network, thus leading to a drop in R 0 . This makes network-based modeling especially appealing to model large-scale pandemics such as COVID-19.

With its capital Mumbai being the commercial hub of the country, a significant portion of infections in the population were left untraced due to inadequate levels of testing 10 . Another major talking point comes from the Bhilwara district in Rajasthan, once deemed as 'India's Italy' by BBC 11 . Bhilwara had been successful in restricting the infection from spreading in less than 2 weeks from its first reported case, with the last reported case registered on March 31 (during the period of our study). The success story had been attributed to massive testing, extensive tracking and enforcing strict isolation, apart from door-to-door surveys and continued screening of the population in the district (Meghwal et al., 2020) . This led to screening a whopping number of 2.2 million people in the district which accounts for 92% of its population. The Bhilwara model serves as a paramount example of how the policy of testing-tracing-isolation-treatment can work wonders in containing the spread of the disease. Odisha had been dynamic as well from the very beginning of the outbreak, starting with locking down its capital Bhubaneshwar from March 12, before the state-wide lockdown from March 24 (Lancet, 2020) . The state closely followed the Bhilwara model and had also announced an extension of the lockdown in the state till April 30, even before the announcement of the second phase of country-wide closure. The strong health workforce had synchronized in complete harmony with numerous self-help groups and policy-makers to effectively take benefit from the lockdown.",

These survey based studies check for the presence of antibodies of a disease using blood serum specimens. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), along with Dept of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India and National Center for Disease Control, on May 12, 2020, announced to conduct multiple national level community based sero-surveys across several states in India. The subsequent sero-survey findings are quite interesting. The first serosurvey was conducted in May-June 2020 among adults aged 18 or older across 21 states in the country. Although the seroprevalance was reported to be as low as 0.73% (95% CI: 0.34% -1.13%) , the infection-to-case ratio was estimated to be between 81.6 and 130.1 infections per reported case of the disease till June 2020. Lockdown relaxations were being adopted across the country in phases after this period, and a second serosurvey exercise was done during August-September 2020. The second serosurvey also included individuals who are 10 years or older. The sero-prevalance was estimated to be 7.1% (95% CI: 6.2% -8.2%) among adults aged 18 years or older, with estimated 26-32 infections per reported case, thus leading to around 74.3 million infections in the country by mid-August 2020. The detailed findings have been reported in Murhekar et al. (2021) , including details on the districts and states included in the survey. Our network-based estimate were 0.13 million, 3.95 million, and 6.32 million on August 12, 2020, the last day of prediction, under the three scenarios, respectively. The observed number of infections falls within this range, but the seroprevalence adjusted estimate is much higher. We note that it is not readily possible to validate the seroprevalance estimates with the network-based estimates owing to the fact that we had constructed the network using the observed cases only. The third round of the ICMR serosurvey conducted during the period of December 2020 -January 2021, reported roughly a three-fold increase in the number of infections since August 2020, with a infection prevalence rate of 21.5% for persons aged 10 years or above. India has a reported number of a little over 10 million infections, thus putting the estimated number of infections to be around 270 million (27 actual cases per reported case). These results have been released by ICMR via a press-conference on February 04, 2021, and are yet to be formally published (as of the time of writing this article). The serosurvey findings thus validate, to an extent, the estimates based on our network-based methods, additionally indicating that managing regional contact networks are crucial along with other best practices such as maintaining basic hygiene practices and wearing of masks.",

These included imposition of an extended nationwide lockdown and campaigns to increase awareness about preventive and behavioral measures. Such measures were expected to contribute towards flattening the curve, which was absolutely essential to prevent a situation where the healthcare infrastructure of the country being no longer able to handle the burden. The predictions of our network-based models showed alarming counts for the number of people who could potentially get infected over time. Such a situation could overburden the existing healthcare infrastructure in the country. Specifically, our initial forecasts indicated that the public healthcare facilities might see a huge surge in patients as the majority of the Indian population depends on public healthcare resources. This was the ground situation indeed till the point where the infection growth curve started coming down. Hence, it was important to assess if the infrastructure was ready to handle a huge surge of COVID-19 confirmed cases.

Assuming that half of the cases who are hospitalized will need ventilators, we also plotted the requirement of ventilators across these states. These additional hospital bed requirements are also plotted on a map of India for all the states and union territories in Figures 6-8 (Panel B) . We saw that many smaller states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and Sikkim, and the union territories had sufficient healthcare infrastructure to deal with a surge under the assumptions considered. Whereas states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, and West Bengal were forecast to be in desperate need of additional hospital beds and healthcare infrastructure to successfully deal with a pandemic of such scale.",

A representative snapshot of the different functionalities of the dashboard is available at Figure 9 . The interactive dashboard attempts to forecast the state-wise number of COVID-19 cases for India over the weeks/months following April 15, 2020 using state-level case data and the network-based SIR compartmental model approach as described before. Further, it offers SEIR model-based simulations to predict the potential shortage in healthcare facilities and infrastructure for specific regions, as outlined in the previous subsection. All the plots are interactive and update themselves based on user inputs for several epidemiological and infrastructural parameters. The user may also hover over the figures for looking at the exact numbers, and click the camera icon on top of each figure to download the plots as png files. The home page of the dashboard sets up the network modeling context with respect to the 13 https://data.gov.in/resources/state-wise-population-decadal-population-growth-rateand-population-density-2011-0 14 https://alhill.shinyapps.io/COVID19seir/ Indian COVID-19 scenario, using figures akin to Figures 1-2 in this paper. The \"Case Predictions across States/UTs: Network SIR\" tab outlines the network SIR model briefly, with relevant references for the theoretical backgrounds and some discussions on the parameter choices and simulation procedure. It offers case forecast time series plots similar to those in Figures 3-5 in this paper (for the entire country or for a particular state/union territory) under user-specified values of the basic reproduction number R 0 and the average time spent in infected state T \u03b3 . Dynamic bar plots are available for the three intensity scenarios discussed in this paper. The \"Healthcare Forecasting: SEIR\" tab describes the SEIR model in the Indian healthcare context, along with relevant resources and discussions on the default parameter choices. A static geo-located visualization is presented at an assumed 50% rate of hospital bed occupancy and default transmission rates that lead to R 0 = 2. Self-updating waterfall plots are then offered for user-specified choices of region (national/state-specific), bed occupancy rate and transmission rates for different infection stages.

We believe such methods could be profitably used to inform policy-level decisions by allowing detection of hotspots and identification of key predictors characterizing these hotspots such as population density, co-morbidities, socio-economic and demographic factors, and access of health care facilities. Our hope is such nuanced modeling can aid more rapid and focused containment and subsequent mitigation with regional specificity, minimal disruption to the overall economy and sensitivity to humanitarian concerns. The data and analyses in this article along with the interactive app can aid regional/state level specificity to allow a proportional response, prepare for the surge by planning for different scenarios, and create a road-map so the country can eventually come back to normalcy in a phased manner that is socially responsible, equitable, and sustained.

We used spatial/location information to construct our networks which, while admittedly limited, provided some broad clues regarding the early pandemic spread in India. The network reconstruction can be further improved by layering with more precise information that can be collected e.g. micro-level county/district level data, more efficient contact tracing channels, travel information etc. Given the limitations of our current dataset, we did not explore these avenues but these could provide valuable insights, prospectively or retrospectively, for learning the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread. In terms of methodology, there are several refinements possible. We only focused on simulation based on assumed parameter choices such as R 0 , and not on any formal inference or hypothesis testing. One interesting avenue could be to construct a unified framework, through likelihood based constructions for network-based models and employ a frequentist or Bayesian estimation procedure and obtain uncertainty quantifications.

            "text": "When we started this work in March 2020, given the lack of tests and the large number of asymptomatic carriers, the strategy for slowing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had changed from containment to mitigation (Parodi and Liu, 2020) . In essence, the focus was on slowing the further spread of the virus, reducing the anticipated surge in health care use, providing patients with the right level of care to maximize the likelihood that the majority of patients will only require time-limited home isolation, expanding testing capability to increase available hospital capacity, and tailoring isolation to minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In a country like India density is ubiquitous given the population. The social fabric consists of extensive family and societal networks. The challenge is coming up with immediate responses, such as rapid lock-downs, that will have a lasting effect on many classes of society, especially the urban poor. What is needed is a resilient and sustainable approach, with regional sensitivity and national connectivity. Moving forward, a strategy is needed which makes India's density its advantage in dealing with COVID-19 and future pandemics. Using technological infrastructures, such as leveraging the massive mobile network of India -ensures that the reminders about social distancing, hand-washing and hygiene are not overlooked. This can also ensure that testing is strategic (not possible to test everyone), contact tracing is immediate (once a person is tested positive it is relatively easy to trace previous contacts and isolate them immediately), and quarantine is smart (right level of quarantine based on the level of risk). In addition, one has to ensure that healthcare facilities are ready for the surge by decanting non-critical services, rapidly converting existing facilities, ramping up medical equipment and supplies, and leveraging alternate care facilities. The biggest challenge will be to do this in a humane, culturally sensitive and respectful way. We believe the strongest response to contagions is through building resilient communities that can manage the contact networks -and our models can potential aid this endeavor for current and future pandemics.",
