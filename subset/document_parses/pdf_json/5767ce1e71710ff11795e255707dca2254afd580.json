Methods: Consecutive adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis in stable clinical remission (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] B 3 for at least 12 months) receiving maintenance biological therapy answered a survey investigating whether they would choose telemedicine or inperson visit for the next scheduled visit and the reasons behind their preference. The survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was developed according to a structured process. Results: Of the 246 participants in the survey, 118 (48%) preferred telemedicine over an inperson visit for their next scheduled visit with a dermatologist. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that previous experience with digital video-communication tools was a significant predictor for the preference for telemedicine (odds ratio [OR] 10.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.61-32.03), while older age (\\ 60 years) was negatively associated with the preference for telemedicine (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10-0.90). The most common reasons (75%) for preferring telemedicine were saving time and safety in relation to the risk presented by the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic (38%). In contrast, 56% of the patients who preferred the in-person visit option declared that they were unable to use video-communication tools. Conclusion: About half of the patients with stable psoriasis receiving biological drugs may be good candidates for telemedicine. ",

Telemedicine allows the delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies which enable the sharing of valid information for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease [5] . In the dermatological context there is a need to identify those patients who may be good candidates for telemedicine. It could be hypothesized that patients with plaque psoriasis in stable clinical remission with maintenance biological therapy could be good candidates for telemedicine, but the attitude of this patient group toward telemedicine has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the preference for telemedicine versus the in-person visit among patients with psoriasis receiving biological drugs and the reported reasons behind their preferences.",

The text was then amended and rearranged to improve the ease of comprehension, and its final version was subsequently administered to those consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The questionnaire included a sociodemographic section capturing the following variables: sex, age, type of biological drug, educational level and occupational status, frequency of follow-up visits to the dermatologist in the last year, distance from the hospital (km), need for accompaniment, exemption from insurance copayment charges and previous experience with digital video-communication tools (such as Skype\u00d2, Zoom\u00d2 or Google Meet\u00d2) and telemedicine. In the second part of the questionnaire the patient was directly asked if he/she would prefer to have the next follow-up dermatological control visit in-person or by telemedicine and the reasons associated with the stated preference.

The analysis of our patients' characteristics showed that the choice of telemedicine was strongly associated with being younger, being confident with the videocommunication tools, having a higher educational level and/or a managerial job and having accessibility to an internet connection at home. These results indicate that a possible negative consequence of a random and large-scale implementation of telemedicine may be inequal access to care within the National Health System to the detriment of those who are older, have a lower level of education and who have either no access to the internet or are not confident with the use of video-communication tools.

Conversely, others have reported that telemedicine, even in an oncological setting, is perceived as a safe and effective option and that it does not compromise medical care or the patient-physician relationship [15] .

In our opinion, the best candidates are patients with established chronic skin disorders, such as psoriasis, acne, rosacea and eczema, while other conditions requiring a thorough total body skin examination or special device, such as dermoscopy, are less likely candidates for telemedicine [18] . Interestingly, teledermatology is preferred by the younger patient population with more benign skin conditions, compared to those with neoplastic processes and severe diseases that are more prone for in-person visits to the dermatologist [19] . As early as 2012, teledematology was found to be a promising and reliable tool for the long-term management of patients with psoriasis on systemic treatment (e.g. biologics), and also recommended by those patients who tried it [20, 21] . The effectiveness in assessing the severity of psoriasis was even evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in 296 patients, with the results demonstrating that telemedicine was as effective as the inperson visit [22] . Telemedicine could provide a cost-effectiveness service with an important saving of money by patients [18] . A study on store and forward teledermatology demonstrated that it saves patients from US$ 33.23 to US$ 230.35 per visit [23] .",

Nevertheless, the purpose of the designed descriptive questionnaire was exploratory, with the aim to investigate the propensity of patients to choose telemedicine compared to in-person visit. Another limitation is the small sample size, with the patients restricted to those attending two medical centers. It is plausible that the results could be generalized to other Italian areas, but not to other European and extra-European cultures. Finally, we could not address whether the longterm follow-up of the same patient with telemedicine is possible. Further studies are needed to investigate these issues.",
