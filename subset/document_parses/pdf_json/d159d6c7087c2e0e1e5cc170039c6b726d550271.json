Severe ocular trauma remains a challenge for physicians and may cause permanent blindness and even the loss of an eyeball. As ocular trauma refers exclusively to globe trauma, the use of the term \"ophthalmic trauma\" has been recommended to involve globe, adnexal, and orbital trauma.

Chen et al. analyzed 622 adult patients with light perception or no light perception after open globe injury. They found that 8.5% of the eyes received primary evisceration because of no possible anatomical reconstruction. There were 239 eyes that received vitreoretinal surgery. Over the 6-month follow-up, 21.9% of eyes were eviscerated, 24.0% atrophied, only 21.1% had some visual acuity, and 8.5% had vision better than 0.3. In Chen's other study of pediatric open globe injury, they found the most common injury type was penetration (89%). Scissors, knives, pens, and wood were common causes. Most (76.1%) of the injuries were in zone 1. In general, the articles on this Research Topic and current advancements in the field of ophthalmic trauma have provided updated information on the animal model, incidence, risk factors, clinical spectrum, precise diagnosis, intervention, and prognosis of a patient with an eye injury. There are some potential difficulties in the research of ocular trauma. There is a lack of large sample size high-quality datasets with long-time followup. It is not easy to conduct randomized control trials because of highly heterogenous clinical characteristics. Multicenter, even multinational collaboration is needed to collect large sample size, high-quality data and conduct randomized control trials to provide higher-level evidence for clinical decisions (4). The secure web-based global all-encompassing registries like IGATES, can provide real-time pooled data analysis that will not only advance our understanding in the field of ophthalmic trauma but also help us with predictive modeling and novel tools for evidence-based counseling of a trauma victim (4).",

            "text": "After management, 32.2% had vision better than 0.3, and 2.7% were eviscerated. Su et al. reported a case with central retinal artery occlusion after a bee sting on the face, accompanied by hypersensitivity, hypercoagulable state, myocardial damage, and hepatic damage. Surgical interventions are usually needed for severely injured eyes. Wang et al. reported allogeneic cultivated limbal epithelial cell sheet transplantation for severe symblepharon after chemical and thermal burns in 36 cases. Complete lysis was achieved after one surgery in 83.3% of cases and two surgeries in 16.7% without recurrence. Ma et al. compared the paths of giant intraocular foreign body (IOFB) removal in 73 cases. They found that eyes with IOFBs removed from the entrance wound path had a better visual outcome than those with a limbal path. The entrance wound path also allows for larger intraocular foreign body removal compared to the pars plana path. Chen et al. reported two novel suturing techniques to fix traumatic choroidal avulsion in 24 cases. Both techniques, trans-scleral mattress suturing and intraocular suturing, reattached the choroid well and improved both visual acuity and intraocular pressure. Zhou et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of vitrectomy vs. spontaneous closure of a traumatic macular hole. They found that the pooled macular hole closure rate was 0.37 in the observation group and 0.90 in the surgery group. The pooled rate of visual acuity improvement was 0.39 in the observation group and 0.72 in the surgery group. These articles provide evidence for clinicians to determine interventions for patients with ocular injury. Studies on predicting outcomes would help us manage patients. Mai et al. reported that eyes with intraocular foreign body injury had generally delayed implicit time and reduced amplitude in all waves of five electroretinogram responses. The maximum change was found in oscillatory potential, which also had the strongest correlation with visual outcome. Their results would help select the appropriate ERG parameter and predict the visual outcome. Mohamed-Noriega et al. reported that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and platelet to lymphocyte ratio were correlated with the visual outcome after surgical repair of open globe injuries in 197 cases. He et al. reported that the incidence of band keratopathy was 28% in a silicone oil tamponade for open globe injury. Silicone oil retention time \u22656 months and zone III injury were significant risk factors for band keratopathy.",
