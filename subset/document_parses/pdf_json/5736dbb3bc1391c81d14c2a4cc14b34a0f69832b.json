Three factors are required to evaluate the plant's health. The first factor is the temperature, we obtain the temperature of the plant using the temperature and humidity sensor then we process is with our algorithm.

We obtain the humidity level of the plant using the temperature and humidity sensor.

There is an algorithm that we are using as shown below, The third factor is, identifying the plant's health using the color difference of the leaves.

However, the government is currently attempting to lift such limitations to allow people to return to regular work in Sri Lanka. People are starting to do their jobs because of this scenario, and they do not have time to continue planting in their gardens. We discussed the issue and attempted to develop a solution that would allow them to continue working while doing so. The main issue is that individuals cannot constantly watch their plants to safeguard their gardens. As a result, we decided to automate the garden labor. Gardeners may use our innovative solution to monitor critical parameters such as plant health and illness, soil moisture level, air humidity level, and surrounding temperature, as well as water their garden from anywhere in the globe at any time. The current approach is based on observation with the naked eye, which is a time-consuming process. To detect plant disease at an early stage, automatic detection of plant disease can be used. Farmers have utilized a variety of disease control techniques daily to prevent plant illnesses. Plant disease has a substantial influence on plant growth, productivity, and agricultural product quality. The objective of this research is to develop an automated system that can detect the health of plants. An automated health detection system is built based on fluctuations in plant leaf health conditions using sensors such as temperature, humidity, and color. The illness starts on the plant leaves in most cases. As a result, we have considered the detection of plant health on leaves in the proposed study.
