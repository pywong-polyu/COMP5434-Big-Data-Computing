Here, we summarize rapidly emerging evidence highlighting transmission by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. Viral load of asymptomatic carriers is comparable to symptomatic patients, viral shedding is highest before symptom onset suggesting high transmissibility before symptoms. Within universally tested subgroups, surprisingly high percentages of COVID-19 positive asymptomatic individuals were found. Asymptomatic transmission was reported in several clusters. A Wuhan study showed an alarming rate of intrahospital transmission, and several countries reported higher prevalence among healthcare workers than the general population. This raises concern that health workers could act as silent disease vectors.",

The emerging evidence presented below makes a compelling case that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals are the major drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic and argues for reassessment of public health strategies. Certain groups serving vulnerable populations (e.g. health care workers (HCWs), long-term care facility (LTCF) staff, first responders, etc.) have a higher probability of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and thus are at high risk of unknowingly contributing to disease transmission during asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic phases. It is proposed here that the early identification of infected asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals should be an area of focus with priority on universal testing of those who interact with vulnerable populations.",

In Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 12% of patients who tested positive for MERS-CoV were asymptomatic [8, 9] . During the SARS-CoV outbreak in Singapore in 2003, 7.5% of serology positive HCWs and 13% of cases in the general population were asymptomatic [10] . Data suggest that SARS-COV-2 can be highly contagious in individuals before symptom onset and in individuals who never develop symptoms. Researchers have hypothesized that salivary glands may function as potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic infected individuals [11] . A study on quantitative viral load found that an asymptomatic individual had similar viral load as symptomatic patients, suggesting a similar A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 transmission potential [12] . An asymptomatic 6-month old infant with COVID-19 had a high viral load on nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, with similar viral load as his symptomatic mother. Daily NP swabs for this infant remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 and eventually became negative on day 17 of his admission. His symptomatic mother's NP swabs became negative on day 18 of her illness [13] . A mathematical model incorporating asymptomatic carriers indicated that basic reproduction number Ro is likely to be from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4. This suggests that asymptomatic individuals are major drivers for the growth of COVID-19 pandemic [14] .",

Additionally, it was found that viral loads decreased each day following symptom onset in a monotonical manner. The infectiousness was determined to peak at 0.7 days (95% CI -0.2 -2.0 days) before symptom onset, suggesting highest viral loads were present immediately prior to or on the day of symptom onset [5] . Similarly, a study using 28 pairs of index cases and their respective secondary cases estimated the serial interval for SARS-CoV-2. Serial interval was defined as the time from symptom onset in the index case (infector) to symptom onset in the secondary case (infectee). This interval was found to be 4.0 days (95% CrI, 3.1-4.9) and is shorter than the estimated mean incubation period of 5 days, suggesting pre-symptomatic transmission occurs more frequently than symptomatic transmission [15] .",

This testing was undertaken after expeditiously removing 15 symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed patients from the shelter. Of 408 guests tested, 36% (147) were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and vast majority of the PCR positive guests had no symptoms. Prevalence of fever (0.7%), cough (7.5%), shortness of breath (1.4%), was very low and not different among the SARS-CoV-2 positive guests when compared to those who tested negative.

This led to initiation of universal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing for all patients admitted to Labor units irrespective of symptoms, exposure and travel history [26] . Among 214 women who had PCR testing, 15% (33) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 87.9% (n=29) of these women were asymptomatic at the time of testing.

Current WHO guidelines for interrupting transmission include: reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers by focusing on rapid identification, diagnosis and management of cases, and identification and follow up of contacts [1]. The US CDC recommends \"source control\" to control for possibility of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. This involves use of universal face covers whenever leaving one's house. All individuals entering health care facilities should be screened for symptoms and have face coverings regardless of symptoms [2] . Evidence discussed earlier suggests that viral loads for SARS-CoV-2 are similar in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, and that asymptomatic patients may continue to test positive for up to 21 days [5, 13] . Current CDC guidelines prioritize symptomatic individuals for testing, and asymptomatic individuals are given least priority [2] . Viral shedding in symptomatic patients can begin 2 to 3 days before appearance of symptoms, and peaks 0.7 days before symptom onset, after which it decreases [5] . This suggests that testing symptomatic individuals only will miss those infected individuals who have highest transmissibility, and thus universal testing irrespective of symptoms may be needed.",

Above evidence is based on highly heterogeneous studies, some of which have been reported in the news media or in pre-print journals awaiting peer-review. There are still gaps in the understanding of effective screening methods during the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic phase [37] . Limitations still exist in the effectiveness of current PCR testing as an infection identification tool [38] . Antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 is now being used in population-based studies to estimate prevalence of infection and studies report many seropositive patients had no history of symptoms [39] . Antibody testing, however, is not a A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 12 reliable method to screen for asymptomatic carriers due to the temporal lag between viral exposure and development of antibodies, persistence of antibodies beyond infection clearance, and false negative rates with low titers [40] . Therefore, in this review, we focus on PCR testing as a means to identify asymptomatic carriers while they are infectious in order to limit transmission through early identification.",

This review summarizes evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not only possible but likely highest during pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic phases. It also highlights the high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in several universally tested sub-populations with some studies showing that more than 50% of positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Therefore, strategies to curb viral spread can no longer solely rely on 'symptom onset' to identify all infected individuals. An approach that focuses on universal source control and early identification of infected individuals regardless of symptoms is of utmost importance. Universal testing of asymptomatic exposed individuals using PCR testing must be considered. Further investigation is needed into transmission by asymptomatic carriers and rapid methods of identification of such carriers. Additional epidemiologic research is also needed for the optimal approach in resource limited settings where universal testing cannot be undertaken. Surveillance with interval testing of vulnerable populations can be considered, and targeted testing of those with high frequency contact with infected individuals (HCWs, LTCF staff, first responders etc.) may be prioritized.
