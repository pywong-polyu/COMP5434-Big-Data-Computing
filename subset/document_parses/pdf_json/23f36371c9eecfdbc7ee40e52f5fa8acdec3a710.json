            "text": "Hypoglycemia occurs frequently in patients with diabetes treated with insulin and/or insulin secretagogues (Fisher et al., 2018; Johnson-Rabbett and Seaquist, 2019) . Approximately 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) taking insulin for >5 years have severe hypoglycemic episodes, which is the same as the rate of severe hypoglycemic episodes in adults with type 1 diabetes diagnosed within 5 years (UK Hypoglycaemia Study Group, 2007; Heller et al., 2020) . The unpleasant symptoms caused by hypoglycemia may make the patients feel frightened; as a result, the patients may maintain high blood glucose levels to prevent hypoglycemia, which may limit the achievement of glycemic control targets (Amiri et al., 2015) . The issue of fear of hypoglycemia (FoH) is of great concern worldwide because of its high prevalence and negative influences. In Japan, the prevalence of FoH in insulin-treated patients with T2D was 27.7% (Sakane et al., 2015) . FoH not only influences the glycemic control of patients with T2D but also impairs their quality of life (McCoy et al., 2013) , resulting in subsequent negative effects on physical and psychological consequences (Benroubi, 2011) . Therefore, FoH is one of the crucial factors affecting the psychological health and self-management of patients with T2D. Globally, the number of patients with diabetes was about 463 million in 2019 and will rise to 578 million by 2030, of which T2D accounts for 90% (Zheng et al., 2018; Saeedi et al., 2019) . As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise and the psychological problems of patients with T2D become increasingly serious (Mukherjee and Chaturvedi, 2019; Saeedi et al., 2019) , exploring the potential factors associated with FoH is both critical and important.",

Good emotional regulation ability plays a key role in psychological, social and physical health . However, individuals with stronger neuroticism are more sensitive to negative information and are more susceptible to mental illness . Moreover, because of the oversensitivity to internal stimuli, people with high neuroticism tend to exhibit exaggerated physical symptoms (Johnson, 2003; Ozer and Benet-Martinez, 2006) . The relationship between neuroticism and fear-related disorders has been explored in previous studies and the results showed a significant positive association between neuroticism and fear-related disorders (Ng et al., 2019; Dursun et al., 2021; Perez-Mengual et al., 2021) . More specifically, neuroticism has a positive effect on the patient's tendency to fear about hypoglycemia (Hepburn et al., 1994) . The negative tendency of neuroticism may cause patients to pay more attention to hypoglycemia, perceive uncomfortable symptoms more easily, and experience more FoH. However, personality traits tend to be inflexible and stable (Barlow et al., 2014) , so more flexible intervention programs are necessary. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have explored the potential mechanisms between neuroticism and FoH.",

Several previous studies have shown that there is a strong link between anxiety and FoH (Gonder-Frederick et al., 2006; Anderbro et al., 2015; Rechenberg et al., 2017 ). An anxiety-prone personality is a predictive factor for FoH (Castellano-Guerrero et al., 2018) . Moreover, neuroticism is an anxiety-related endophenotype (Gottschalk and Domschke, 2017) that is positively associated with anxiety (Liao et al., 2019) . Based on these findings, we can infer that anxiety may be a mediating variable in the relationship between neuroticism and FoH, which to some extent helps us to propose the hypothesis (H2) that anxiety also mediates the effect of neuroticism on FoH.",

A study reported that cognitive fusion was positively associated with FoH (Wang, 2019) . Furthermore, neuroticism is strongly related to psychological inflexibility (Latzman and Masuda, 2013) , and cognitive fusion is a component of psychological inflexibility (Hayes et al., 2012) . Therefore, cognitive fusion may be a mediating variable in the relation between neuroticism and FoH. Based on this accumulating evidence, in this study, we hypothesize (H3) that cognitive fusion also mediates the effect of neuroticism on FoH.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform structural equation model to reveal whether the relationship between neuroticism and FoH is mediated by diabetes distress, anxiety, and cognitive fusion. The separate and parallel mediation analyses conducted by the bootstrapping method supported our research hypotheses. The results of this study substantiated the significant mediating role of diabetes distress, anxiety, and cognitive fusion in the relationship between neuroticism and FoH. Moreover, in the parallel mediation model, these three constructs were full mediators; among them, anxiety had the highest level of indirect effects, followed by cognitive fusion and diabetes distress. These three mediators were conducive to explaining the mechanism of why neuroticism may be one of the contributors to FoH. First, the results of the current study revealed that diabetes distress mediated the relationship between neuroticism and FoH. In this model, neuroticism was related to a high risk of diabetes distress and diabetes distress was associated with high risks of FoH, which was in line with previous studies (Sanatkar et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021) . Patients with diabetes need to adhere to hypoglycemic treatments and a series of management methods, such as diet control, for a long time due to the chronic and long-term nature of diabetes, which can easily give rise to negative emotions in patients (Skinner et al., 2020) . Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results showed that neuroticism scores were inversely related to the activation of some brain regions during negative emotion regulation, indicating that neuroticism weakens one's ability to regulate emotions . More specifically, patients with high neuroticism are even more unable to regulate negative emotions when coping with diabetes and tend to produce a sense of powerlessness and distress, which may ultimately lead to fear-related disorders such as FoH (Fisher et al., 2019) . Therefore, a potential explanation for the positive correlation between neuroticism and FoH is that patients with high levels of neuroticism may develop FoH due to the high risks of diabetes distress.",

            "text": "Interventions aimed at improving neuroticism and diabetes distress should be provided for patients with T2D due to the mediating effects of diabetes distress on the relationship between neuroticism and FoH. Second, we found that anxiety was a significant mediator in the relationship between neuroticism and FoH. A previous study found that there was an overlap between the genetic factors that affect the variation of neuroticism among individuals and those that increase anxiety (Hettema et al., 2004 ). The vulnerability model claims that personality is always formed before the development of mental illness (Kotov et al., 2010) . In other words, neuroticism indicates an anxiety-prone personality (Brandes and Bienvenu, 2006) . This neuroticism-anxiety orientation is consistent with our results that neuroticism has a positive predictive effect on anxiety. Furthermore, increased anxiety can trigger defensive and maladaptive behaviors in patients, leading to clinical problems (Grecucci et al., 2020) . For example, patients with FoH tend to show avoidance behaviors, including cutting the dose of insulin, overeating, and reducing physical activity, etc. As shown in several studies, the relationship between anxiety and FoH was significant (Gonder-Frederick et al., 2006; Anderbro et al., 2015; Rechenberg et al., 2017; Castellano-Guerrero et al., 2018) , and a study regarded FoH as one of the anxiety-related syndromes associated with diabetes (Majidi et al., 2015) . Consequently, patients with anxiety may be more susceptible to FoH. Another potential explanation for the positive correlation between neuroticism and FoH is that patients with high neuroticism personality traits may be more prone to anxiety, and the negative effects caused by anxiety may further increase one's risk of FoH. Our results indicate that anxiety is also a useful intervention target for FoH in patients with T2D.",

Some studies showed a significant correlation between neuroticism and psychological inflexibility (Latzman and Masuda, 2013; Paulus et al., 2016) , which was in line with our results that neuroticism was significantly positively related to cognitive fusion. People with neuroticism traits are more likely to perceive negative information, and cognitive fusion makes people susceptible to these negative emotions. Further, we also found that cognitive fusion was significantly related to FoH, which was aligned with previous research (Wang, 2019) . This may mean that cognitive fusion prompts patients to automatically extract the literal meaning of negative thinking and produce incorrect self-cognition, thereby promoting or aggravating the fear and worry of hypoglycemia. Consequently, the third potential explanation for the positive correlation between neuroticism and FoH is that patients with high neuroticism may be more susceptible to cognitive fusion, thereby increasing their risks of FoH. These results further indicate that interventions aimed at improving cognitive fusion may contribute to the improvement of FoH.",

In terms of clinical implications, this study offers an understanding of the associated factors that may contribute to ameliorate patients' FoH and provides a theoretical basis for healthcare providers to take measures to directly and indirectly improve FoH via improving neuroticism, diabetes distress, anxiety, and cognitive fusion. The evaluation tools used in this study have sufficient internal consistency coefficients and composite reliability coefficients in this sample, indicating that the results are highly reliable. Despite such strengths, our study also has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to explain strong causality. Therefore, future studies should adopt longitudinal designs. Second, the study only recruited patients in China. There may be cultural differences among patients in different countries; therefore, future studies need to investigate whether patients in different countries also fit the same mediation model. Third, the questionnaires were all self-reported in nature, which may lead to social desirability bias and memory recall bias. Finally, this study only investigated patients with T2D; thus, future studies should verify whether patients with type 1 diabetes experience the same mediating effects.",
