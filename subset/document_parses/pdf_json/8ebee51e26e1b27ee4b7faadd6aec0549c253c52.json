To make better use of such heritage collections, this work considers the task of large scale question answering on long-term news article archives. Questions on such archives are often eventrelated. In addition, they usually exhibit strong temporal aspects and can be roughly categorized into two types: (1) ones containing explicit temporal expressions, and (2) ones only implicitly associated with particular time periods. We focus on the latter type as such questions are more difficult to be answered, and we propose a retriever-reader model with an additional module for reranking articles by exploiting temporal information from different angles.

News article archives help users to learn detailed information on events that occurred at specific time points in the past and constitute part of our heritage [1] . Some professionals, like historians, sociologists, or journalists need to deal with these time-aligned document collections for a variety of purposes [2] . Moreover, average users can verify information about the past using original, primary resources. However, it is difficult for users to efficiently make use of news archives due to their large sizes and complexities. Large scale question answering systems (QA systems) can solve the problem, with the aim to identify the most correct answer from relevant documents for a particular information need, expressed as a natural language question. User questions on these archives are often event-related and include temporal aspects. They can be divided into two types: (1) those with explicit temporal expressions (e.g., \"NATO signed a peace treaty with which country in 1999?\"), and (2) those only implicitly associated to time periods, hence not containing any temporal expression (e.g., \"How many members of International Olympic Committee were expelled or resigned because of the bribery scandal?\"). We focus on the latter type, which is more challenging, as the temporal information cannot be obtained directly. Table 1 shows some examples of the questions that we use. This paper presents a large scale question answering system called QANA (Question Answering in News Archives) designed specifically for answering eventrelated questions on news article archives. It exploits the temporal information of a question, of a document content and of its timestamp for reranking candidate documents. In the experiments, we use New York Times (NYT) archive as the underlying knowledge source and a carefully constructed test set of questions which are associated with past events. The questions are selected from existing datasets and history quiz websites, and they lack any temporal expressions which makes them particularly difficult to be answered.

Building a system that makes full use of the past news articles and satisfies different user information needs is however of great importance due to the continuously growing document archives. Temporal Information Retrieval. In Information Retrieval (IR) domain, several research studies have already been proposed for temporal ranking of documents [14] [15] [16] . Li and Croft [17] introduce a time-based language model that takes into account timestamp information of documents to favor recent documents. Metzler et al. [18] propose a method that analyzes query frequencies over time to infer the implicit temporal information of queries and exploit this information for ranking results. Arikan et al. [19] design a temporal retrieval model that integrates temporal expressions of document content into query-likelihood language modeling. Berberich et al. [20] propose a similar model but also consider uncertainty in temporal expressions. However, in [19] and [20] , the temporal scopes of queries are explicitly given in their setting and the proposed methods do not utilize timestamp information. Kanhabua and N\u00f8rv\u00e5g [21] propose three different methods to determine the implicit temporal scope of queries and exploit this temporal information to improve the retrieval effectiveness by reranking documents. [21] is probably the most related work to ours as it also linearly combines both textual and temporal similarity to rerank documents, however, that work does not use any temporal information embedded in document content and the linear combination is done in a static way.

Moreover, we also analyze the impact of the number of bursts on performance. About half of the questions (96 questions) have few bursts (less than or equal to 4). Table 5 shows that both QANA and QA-Not-Rerank perform much better when answering such questions. The events in questions with many bursts are likely to be similar to other events that occurred at different times, which causes the difficulty to distinguish between the events. As our system considers the importance of bursts by assigning weights to them, it significantly outperforms QA-Not-Rerank. Although \u03b1(Q) is smaller in this case (according to Eq. 9), it still plays an important part in selecting relevant documents. For example, if the number of bursts of a question is 10, \u03b1(Q) approximately equals to 0.1, which means that the final reranking is driven by about 10% of the temporal score.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 244, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 817, "end": 824, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Experimental Results"}, {"text": "Finally, we examine the effect of \u03b1(Q), which determines the proportion between temporal relevance score and query relevance score.

Following [25] that uses typical values of \u03b2 equal to 1.5-2.0, we use 2.0 in the experiments. In Fig. 2, the red solid lines show the bursts of previously mentioned two example questions. The inferred time scope of the first question is [('1998-03', '1999-05')], while the time scope of the second question contains three periods: [('2003-08', '2004-02'), ('2004-06', '2004-06'), ('2004-09', '2004-10')]. Note that the second time period of the second time scope is actually a single time point (shown as a single small red point in the graph).After calculating T (Q), each candidate period is assigned a weight indicating its importance, which is obtained by dividing the number of documents published within the period over the total number of documents published in all the candidate periods of time scope T (Q). For example, for the second example question, the number of documents published within the period ('2003-08', '2004-02') is 43, while the total number of documents published within all the periods T (Q) is 55, so the weight assigned to this period is 43 55 .
