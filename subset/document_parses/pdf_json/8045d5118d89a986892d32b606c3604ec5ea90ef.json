            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has cumulatively caused 300 million confirmed cases worldwide, with three million deaths reported by January 7th, 2022 (Dong et al., 2020) . Most countries have imposed ''lockdown'' measures to contain the spread of coronavirus when their domestic pandemic has reached a relatively severe level, including, e.g., mobility restriction, border closures, and plant shutdown. At the peak of the lockdown, economic activities around the world came to a near standstill (Diffenbaugh et al., 2020) . The consequences caused by lockdown measures include not only the disruption of existing production but also the suspension of construction of new facilities. During a pandemic, the delay of production capacity expansion can be irreversible and thus affect the supply in the long run despite a possible gradual recovery of production and consumption to the prepandemic level with the lift of lockdown restrictions. For example, it is estimated that China's newly installed capacity of battery production in 2020 would be 26 GWh lower than originally planned due to the pandemic restriction measures (Wood Mackenzie, 2020) . Although vaccination is becoming widely available, there are still many uncertainties in future development of the pandemic (Jason, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020b) . Thus, it is very possible that lockdown measures will be repeatedly imposed until the pandemic is fully contained (which already happened in some countries), causing suspensions of production and capacity building for several times.",

A few studies have explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EV industry. For example, McClone et al. (2021) Previous literature provided static evaluation for the existing impacts of the pandemic on EV industry. However, potential dynamic impact of lockdown measures on supply-demand balance of global EV industrial chain in the long run has hitherto not been fully investigated. To fill this gap, we developed an integrated model to explore whether the supply delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will be a bottleneck on the growth target of global EV market. The integrated model structure is shown in Figure 1 . We first quantified the severity of the pandemic in 185 countries and regions to evaluate the probability of supply disruption of 17 core EV-related commodities throughout its supply chain. Based on these results, we further developed a bottom-up projection model to estimate available lithium-ion battery (LIB) production capacity under three pandemic development scenarios from 2020 to 2030. Such production constraints were then incorporated as input in the Transport Impact Model to assess future EV sales.",

If the pandemic could be gradually contained in the short term, the growth trajectory of EV market will not be affected by lockdown measures. Current excess production capacity of LIBs and relevant raw materials will provide a large buffer for supply disruption constraints on consumption growth. However, if the pandemic spread is not controlled in the short term, the development of EV industry could be seriously jeopardized before 2030. The results imply that the postpandemic recovery of EV industry should seek the window of opportunity created by this pandemic to upgrade the quality rather than the quantity of production capacity.

A total of 17 commodities were identified most relevant for the EV supply chain, from battery-related critical minerals to final products (Sun et al., 2017 (Sun et al., , 2018b (Sun et al., , 2020 . The distribution of supply of different commodities and the extent to which different countries are affected by the pandemic cause the diverse probability of supply disruption of various commodities. Based on the infection rate and growth rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases on the country level, we developed a Regional COVID-19 Severity Index (RCSI) to quantify the severity each country is affected by the pandemic. Further a Commodity Criticality Index (CCI) was proposed to reflect the potential risk embodied in the supply of each of the 17 commodities based on the corresponding supply structure by country (see Tables S4-S20) , RCSI, and the impact of commodities on the EV industry. The detailed methodologies of calculating RCSI and CCI are presented in STAR Methods section. The final quantization results are shown in Figure 2 (see Tables S1-S3 for detailed values) .",

We developed the Battery Supply Projection Model based on the production capacity planning of LIB suppliers and two key parameters: (1) release efficiency of existing production capacity, quantifying the influence of (2) construction efficiency of new production capacity, quantifying the influence of suspension of new plant construction on annual growth rate of production capacity.

Our model results suggest that this development trajectory is promising to continue if the pandemic could be effectively controlled in the short-term because the quantity of production capacity is more likely not to be a constraint. However, it does not mean that the current overcapacity for LIB production is worth advocating; this is particularly true considering that the automotive power battery market presents an oversupply of low-grade batteries and inefficiency of high-grade batteries (Chen, 2018) . The market performance of leading enterprises and small-sized enterprises shows a polarization. The global production capacity utilization rate of automotive power batteries in 2019 was only 38% (collation of the enterprise public information, see Table S20 ). CATL and LG Chem, the two largest LIB suppliers, had a capacity utilization rate of 51%. The next top eight companies had an average capacity utilization rate of 33%. The remaining LIB companies were running at a capacity utilization rate of 22%. According to our estimation, current scheduled production expansion of LIB suppliers is sufficient to meet the future demand of LIBs before 2030.

China's low RCSI and large production share are the major reasons for its construction efficiency and release efficiency to remain over 80% under the LTC scenario. During iScience Article the COVID-19 pandemic, government policies and executive forces vary significantly from country to country (Andreas and Llewelyn, 2020) . It took China three months to bring the pandemic almost completely under control, keeping the number of domestic new confirmed cases under 1000. In the USA, the pandemic has been continuously going on, with daily confirmed cases fluctuating from tens of thousands to over 1 million. These gaps in industrial chain stability should be considered by relevant stakeholders in their capacity planning. For instance, for investment of lithium mining projects, priority might be given to better performing countries such as Australia. The above suggestions are put forward from the perspective of reducing the impact of large-scale public security incidents on the industrial chain. However, there is generally an inevitable ''trade-off'' between risk mitigation and cost control . In addition, constraints from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulations on business investment are increasingly mighty (Roskill, 2020) . Site selection and layout of production capacity, of course, need a multidimensional comprehensive evaluation system.",

Release efficiency of existing production capacity is estimated based on the current pandemic data and information about lockdown measures of each country. The average duration of a single lockdown period is 64 days (Table S21 ). The average interval between two waves of COVID-19 pandemic is 79 days. Thus the efficacy duration of lockdown measures is 143 days (64 + 79). The efficacy duration is more than 1/3 of one year but less than 1/2 of one year.

Here we use the RCSI to estimate the operation rate of each country during the lockdown period, which is assumed to be: 100% (RCSI: 0-10); 80% (RCSI: 10-15); 60% (RCSI: 15-20); 40% (RCSI: 20-25); 20% (RCSI: 25-30); 0% (RCSI>30).

Based on the current supply structure of lithium mineral (Table S4) , only 59% of its production can be guaranteed, meaning that 59% of LIB production capacity can be released when lockdown measure is taken. Finally we can get that annual release efficiency of existing production capacity when the pandemic continues to spread is ((365-128) + 128*59%)/365 = 86%. According to the WHO's COVID-19 Vaccine Implementation Plan, 2 billion vaccines will be provided per year starting in 2021 (World Health Organization, 2020a).
