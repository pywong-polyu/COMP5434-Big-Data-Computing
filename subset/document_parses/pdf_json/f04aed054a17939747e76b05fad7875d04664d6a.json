Scientific events such as conferences play an important role in scholarly communication and knowledge exchange. Researchers in many fields, such as computer science, often need to search for events to publish their research results, establish connections for collaborations with other researchers and stay up to date with recent works. Researchers need to have a meta-research understanding of the quality of scientific events to publish in high-quality venues. However, there are many diverse and complex criteria to be explored for the evaluation of events. Thus, finding events with quality-related criteria becomes a time-consuming task for researchers and often results in an experience-based subjective evaluation. OpenResearch.org is a crowd-sourcing platform that provides features to explore previous and upcoming events of computer science, based on a knowledge graph. In this paper, we devise an ontology representing scientific events metadata. Furthermore, we introduce an analytical study of the evolution of Computer Science events leveraging the OpenResearch.org knowledge graph. We identify common characteristics of these events, formalize them, and combine them as a group of metrics. These metrics can be used by potential authors to identify high-quality events. On top of the improved ontology, we analyzed the metadata of renowned conferences in various computer science communities, such as VLDB, ISWC, ESWC, WIMS, and SEMANTiCS, in order to inspect their potential as event metrics.",

This way of communication has developed over time and consists of certain steps and involves corresponding stakeholders such as publishers, authors, reviewers, and organizers. Institutions, research groups, and researchers find themselves in a competitive scholarly communication system. In recent years, scholarly communication has faced rapid changes leading to the production of a large volume of scholarly artifacts that have become easily accessible Priem (2013). Publishing via scientific events such as conferences and workshops is one of the main channels for disseminating research results for certain scholarly communities. Scientific events are also considered as the main target for researchers who want to connect with other community members and stay informed about their topics of interest. In today's scholarly communication, the career of scholars generally depends on the extent to which their success is recognized by the community.",

            "text": "Due to the often subjective nature of the concept of quality in research, there exist several definitions by different researchers. Quality is defined as excellence, value, conformance to specifications, or meeting user expectations Kahn et al. (2002) . More generally, it is widely accepted as fitness for use Juran (1974); Knight and Burn (2005) which we follow in this research work as well. Application of this meaning on the domain of scholarly communication reflects the extent to which the totality of features and characteristics of an artifact lead to a successful fulfillment of scholar's needs. The cumulative nature of scientific knowledge necessitates the quality assessment of artifacts and involved agents, organizations, and events particularly important for scholarly communication. The quality of scholarly artifacts and other elements of scholarly communication, such as events, has multiple characteristics. Researchers combine assessments of these characteristics in different ways depending on their view or task. For researchers, upcoming events on a specific topic can be interesting concerning the closeness of the location, the validity of the publisher, and the reputation of speakers and organizers. Another researcher may only focus on the reputation of the events with respect to their acceptance rate. Therefore, depending on the incentive and objectives of the individual researchers or communities, there is a wide range of requirements and needs in the context of the scholarly communication domain. Particularly, the question of how to assess the quality of a scientific event has been discussed recently in the context of \"predatory conferences\".",

We show an example of discovering a potential list of scientific events within a certain community. Possible types of stakeholders among researchers are either event organizers, authors, reviewers, sponsors, speakers, and participants, etc. Finding the right scientific events is crucial from the roles and parties point of view, however, this can only be developed over time by the researchers themselves which requires time and experience and is prone to omissions. Therefore, it is helpful to have automatic methods that can ease the discovery of events considering quality with regards to a set of certain metrics. Let us consider a case where a researcher (e.g., Amanda) wants to determine events, satisfying certain criteria such as topic-relatedness, geographical restrictions, and time, in order to submit her work. One trivial way to solve this is to ask colleagues and read the call for papers (CfP) published in conference management services (popular ones are listed below), which is time-consuming and takes effort. For example, with these two sources (i.e., asking colleagues and reading CfP), he is only able to find the events that take place in Europe and are related to his field of interest. However, the call for papers of different events gives limited or no clues about the quality of the event, which can be reflected by the reputation of the organizers and keynote speakers, the values of sponsors, etc. Therefore, Amanda has to check events websites, previous related events and possibly has to read the proceedings, to obtain more information about these events. One key quality indicator of the scientific rigor of an event, the acceptance rate, for example, is in most cases only available from the preface of the proceedings. Now, the knowledge that is gathered/acquired by Amanda about events series is not accessible to others especially newcomers (cf. Fig. 1 ). To address this, we developed the service OpenResearch.org to curate and present event metadata in a structured format in order to make it publicly available as Linked Open Data (LOD) (more details in Sect. 6).",

Scientific presentation talks accompanied by articles are the communication means of scientific events.

One characteristic of events is the existence of sponsors in that event. Event homepages list their sponsors and additional sponsorship opportunities are provided.

Here we will base quality metrics on the willingness of sponsors to pay an amount of Fig. 4 Ontology of scientific event series, with the information about their regularity and temporality. All event series keep a certain acronym unless it changes or good reasons money for certain benefits. Events provide so-called \"packages\" and title them with names like \"Gold Sponsorship\" or \"Bronze Sponsorship\". These packages have different monetary values, for a real-world example, VLDB2017 charges $10,000 for Gold Sponsorship and $3000 for a Bronze Sponsorship. The common benefit classes can be identified such as adding the \"logo on the website\" or having an \"advertisement in conference brochure\" which are purchasable at several event series.

Figure 5 shows such a trend chart for the SEMAN-TiCS conference series illustrated for years of 2012 to 2017. In this period, the sponsors could get the following benefit types: Acknowledgment in press releases, free conference registrations, advertise in the conference brochures, advertised via social media, advertisement inside the conference material and proceedings and in participant bags, article on the conference website, banners at the conference venue (physical conferences), booth at the conference, logos appearing at the conference website, logos appearing in the conference brochure, having own workshop or co-occurring events, giving speeches at the conference, adding sub-pages on the website, tweet with specific hashtags, and gaining Twitter followers by the conference iteself or its participants. Each benefit makes a single set of data points. Along the y axis, we have the monetary value of the benefit. As the gradients of the trend lines are not easy to see all the time we colored trend lines with a positive gradient in half opaque green and the ones with a negative gradient in half opaque orange. The trend lines start at the first year the benefit is available and end at the last year the benefit is available. For SEMANTiCS, we overall observed nine positive and five negative trends. The strongest positive gradient of the long-term benefits is of the benefit \"booth at the conference\" which costs a minimum of 2200\u20ac in 2012 and 4750\u20ac in 2017. The only higher gradient for SEMANTiCS is of \"acknowledgment in press releases\" which develops from 2012 with 3500\u20ac to 2017 with 4750\u20ac. The two going trends from 2012 to 2017 are \"logo on website\" and \"logo in conference brochure\". They started quite high but reduced the minimal price for the last years to a lower value, which you can also see in Table 1 . Another interesting point to see in the trends is that when SEMANTiCS changes from a sister-event as i-SEMANTiCS in 2014 to its own event since 2015 many new benefits come available for sponsors.

After defining the ontology in general, we present how it can be implemented at OpenResearch.org and what opportunities are given by that. An already implemented wiki system is used as the basis for injecting the defined schema for scientific events. The OpenResearch.org platform is based on Semantic MediaWiki 21 (SMW). SMW is an extension to MediaWiki 22 , which adds semantic annotations to explicitly state facts which turns a Wiki (with all known Wiki features) into a collaborative database (with all known semantic knowledge graph features, like adding facts and querying the graph). Semantic MediaWiki extensions advance the internal linking and add semantic meaning to the links. An article about a subject represents the subject itself in SMW and a link from one article to another represents a special relationship between the subjects. In SMW these links can be prefixed with a not displayed property name. The OpenResearch.org ontology specifies or:isFollowedBy for the relationship between two subsequent events. A reasoner can now identify this relationship and include this fact. If a user queries what is the following event for VLDB2012, the VLDB2013 wiki page will be returned. In addition to semantic linking between articles, Semantic MediaWiki also introduces a similar function to express facts that have a literal data value as an object.",

First, we provide a description of the world of scientific events in the context of OpenResearch.org (RQ.1). The ontology of OpenResearch.org, which was already aligned with other ontologies, has been extended by introducing new concepts, such as sponsorship, and a more variable model for the role of event organizers. After defining the concept of scientific events and their properties more clearly, the next driving question was whether events can be compared using these properties (RQ.2). One of the hidden characteristics is the amount of sponsoring that sponsors invest in an event. In this regard, we compared and analysed the sponsoring costs associated with the same benefits across the four conference series. There are notable differences, which hint that well-established, renowned conferences can convert their reputation into increasing sponsorship revenues. We obtained criteria based on event metadata and showed that it is possible to build metrics for these criteria that can be used to compare events (RQ.3). With these metrics, researchers or other stakeholders can compare events and find reasonable matches for their intent. Towards automating the analysis introduced in this work employing the OpenResearch.org platform, our plan is to employ ML-based approaches for generating recommendations.",

Another future work direction is a stronger interlinking with other data sets and ontologies. Another future work might be to use the constructed knowledge graph from OpenResearch as a source for knowledge graph analysis techniques and suggest new events based on this knowledge. A major change wrt. organizing and attending scientific events in the year 2020 was due to the global pandemic of COVID-19 virus. Due to preventing health issues many of the gatherings including scientific events and educational activities which were planned as physical gatherings had to change.
