On the one hand, telework is found to increase individual autonomy, work/life balance, work control and productivity and reduce work related stress [1, 2, 5, [7] [8] [9] . On the other hand, telework is associated with increased stress, low boundary control (i.e., difficulty separating work and life domains), overtime work, lack of work motivation, and insufficient time for recovery [5, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Thus, research shows disparate results with respect to the effect of telework on staff health and well-being.",

            "text": "According to a report from Eurofound and the International Labour Office [9] , telework is usually practiced by those with high education and/or organizational position in so-called \"knowledge-and information organizations\" such as IT-enterprises and universities [1, 5, 9, 16, 17] . The high adoption of telework among academic staff has been related to expanding work demands caused by digitalization, such as increased demands on staff availability, teaching and research performance [4, 11, 14, [18] [19] [20] [21] . In order to cope with this demanding work situation, academic staff may exceed normal working hours by compensating with their free time [4, 11, [19] [20] [21] . Studies on the academic work environment show that staff report high levels of stress and lack of time for relaxation, sleep disturbance, work/life interference and decreased levels of physical activity [4, 11, [18] [19] [20] 22] . Regarding telework, Currie and Eveline [11] found that academics experienced difficulties separating work and private life and reported longer working hours and stress-related disorders. Moreover, a study on Swedish academics showed that staff who teleworked frequently (>3 days per week) perceived high stress related to indistinct organization and conflicts [15] . In contrast, Tustin [23] found that home-based academic teleworkers perceived lower levels of fatigue, more satisfaction with their work and experienced higher productivity than non-teleworkers.",

However, since self-reports of sedentary behavior may be biased [26, 27] , the effects of telework in physical activity and sedentary behavior should also be investigated using objective measurements. It has been shown that physical activity can reduce psychophysiological reactivity while sedentary behavior can increase it [28] [29] [30] [31] . Because of this, measures of physical activity are often combined with measures of physiological reactivity (e.g., pulse recordings), to study stress in different work settings [26, 29, [32] [33] [34] . Several reports and studies emphasize the importance of research on postures and movements to understand health outcomes among teleworkers [1, 5, 9] .",

We believe it is important to investigate these factors in order to get a deeper understanding of what risks and/or possibilities telework could entail for academic staffs' health.

The heart rate and heart rate variability measures generated complete data for 20 participants, data from the remaining participants were excluded due to low quality. In the repeated measures analysis of variance (n = 20), Workplace and Time had a significant interaction effect on heart rate (bpm), which was highest before and after workhours and slightly lower during regular workhours at the office compared to telework. For heart rate variability, a significant Workplace and Time interaction effect were seen in all variables ( Table 2 ).

Our results stand in contrast to Lundberg and Lindfors findings [24] where elevated blood pressure after teleworking hours was found among men compared to women. The authors [24] suggested that this difference might be attributed to overtime work. In the present study, overtime work reported in the participants' diaries averaged 4.5 h (n = 5) and was equal for men and women, and was excluded from leisure time after workhours. Thus, there seems to be no differences in men and women's psychophysiological reactivity to telework versus office work when only regular workhours are considered.",

This may have affected findings in present study, as the participants were experienced teleworkers with the majority teleworking several times per month or several times per week. Furthermore, a high degree of autonomy has been shown to mediate the relationship between telework and favorable health effects by, e.g., increasing individual work control [1, 5, 55, 56] . The participants in the present study held professions that entail high work autonomy [18, 47] and thus, this may also affect the impact of telework on our sample and explain the difference between our findings and findings among other professions [24] . Psychosocial factors in the work environment (e.g., social relationships with colleagues) has previously been suggested to affect work stress and staffs' choice to practice telework [57, 58] . Since information about psychosocial factors were not collected in this study, we cannot determine whether social work relations might have affected participants' levels of stress at the office or during telework.",
