[5] [6] [7] [8] When considered in isolation, each of these issues contributes to higher mortality rates compared to the general population. [9] [10] [11] [12] However, there is a growing appreciation of the intersecting nature of these needs and the compounding effect these can have on health outcomes. 5 All-cause mortality rates for people with MCN compared to the UK general population is almost seven times higher for men and almost twelve times higher for women, with major causes of deaths including injury, poisoning, external causes (i.e. accidents, homicide, or suicide), and social exclusion. 13 Despite such inequality, gaps remain in our understanding of the perspectives of individuals with lived experienced of MCN and those who support them (e.g. health and social care workers) on the factors contributing to high death rates in this population. 14 Involving peer researchers across the continuum of research, from concept development, to data collection, analysis, and dissemination, can help provide valuable access to participants from marginalized populations, as well as offering unique insights on how evidence should be collected and interpreted. 8, [15] [16] [17] Peer researchers are individuals who have lived experience of the phenomenon under study and are at a stage where they are ready to support others discuss their own experiences. 8 Although there is increasing recognition of the need to involve peer researchers in health and social care research, there remains limited representation in current literature on mortality and MCN.",

Participants were recruited from both operational (frontline) and commissioning/managerial levels to ensure diversity of staff perspectives. Additionally, variation was sought in terms of gender, different components of MCN, and age for participants with lived experience, although all were aged 18 and over.

Participants in the focus groups pointed to issues with the present system and identified that early prevention and targeting interventions at \"critical life events\" (i.e. transitions in service provision or at experiences of heightened adversity) could be important in reducing deaths in MCN groups. There was a particular emphasis on creating interventions targeting youth to address concerns earlier on in the prevention spectrum. Evidence highlighting the link between experiences of childhood adversity and later life MCN reiterate the need to create preventative interventions surrounding this time period. 5, 7, 23 Additionally, our findings suggest that future provision should focus on interventions that are developed collaboratively across sectors 5, 24 targeting critical life events 7, 23 using person-centred and trauma-informed practices, 24, 25 and peer support. 26 The novelty of this study is it has shown the value of listening to individuals with experience of MCN. It enabled an exploration of an issue that directly affects their community and supported understanding of some of the underlying issues, as well as identifying some avenues for possible preventive interventions. This enrichment of the research aligns with existing literature exploring peer research use for vulnerable populations or sensitive topics. 8, [15] [16] [17] Furthermore, the insights specific to opportunities for service provision take into consideration the lived experience of the target population, which can lead to more equitable service delivery and engagement. 16",

There were limitations in the representativeness of individuals with MCN; a recruitment challenge experienced in previous studies. 16 Nonetheless, by engaging peer researchers throughout the research process, we feel this potential limitation was reduced. There is also the risk that participants might have felt more comfortable speaking to an outsider rather than a peer about certain issues. 17 However, as the study focused less on the individual and more on the overarching issues related to mortality rates, this was likely minimal.",

Findings from this study provide valuable insights from people with lived experience and staff supporting MCN groups on the complexity underpinning this trend. Reducing mortality rates among MCN groups requires addressing issues related to dual diagnosis, providing support around critical life events, and investing in early prevention. The intersecting nature of MCN should be factored into the design of future interventions to address the challenges related to service navigation and availability. The need to address the underlying causes of MCN and develop effective and sustainable interventions to address high mortality rates has become even more important in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated issues around service access, health inequalities, and social isolation. 27 ",
