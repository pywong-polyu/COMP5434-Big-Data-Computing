Near the start of the current pandemic, Australia instigated community restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 infection. As with many aspects of societal function, healthcare delivery was significantly affected. However, the Australian government implemented strategies to maintain a functioning system, including wider accessibility to telehealth. 1 This study sought to understand broadly the impacts of the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australian patients with inflammatory arthritis, including their overall mental and physical health. We aimed to determine the level of difficulty and patient confidence in accessing healthcare services, including pathology, radiology, pharmacy, general practitioner (GP) and rheumatology consultations. The other major objective was to determine if telehealth use was deemed suitable to patients during and after the pandemic.",

We found that despite the early lockdown, there was an overall low level of difficulty and high confidence accessing required community health services up to May 2020. Factors that may have increased confidence include Australia having relatively low positive COVID-19 cases compared to many countries at that time, 4 as well as strategies to maintain access such as medication home delivery and scheduled pathology and radiology times to minimise infection exposure. The overall positive impression of healthcare delivery may have been affected by being conducted early in the pandemic, when high appreciation for any access to healthcare was possible. As we expected, a significant number of respondents reported some difficulty accessing a clinic consultation with their GP and/or rheumatologist, but the rapid uptake of telehealth and telephone reviews meant only 9.0 and 11.4% had difficulty accessing their GP and rheumatologist remotely. While not necessarily a consequence of the pandemic, patients from nonmetropolitan areas were unsurprisingly less confident about accessing their rheumatologist in person, but had similar confidence accessing their rheumatologist via telehealth, highlighting how telehealth can reduce inequities of access to specialist care. Telehealth consultations have been Medicare rebatable for specialist reviews with rural and eligible aged-care patients since July 2011. 5 As the early pandemic evolved quickly with a public health mandate for social distancing, the Australian government introduced new COVID-19-specific Medicare rebates for telehealth and telephone consultations. 6 There was broad agreement among respondents that telehealth was acceptable during the pandemic, with only a small proportion not agreeing it was suitable to continue afterwards. Given the survey was conducted during the early stage of the pandemic, the support for telehealth was likely in the context of some respondents having not yet experienced a medical appointment by telehealth or telephone. Previous studies in rheumatology cohorts have suggested many patients are satisfied with telehealth as a consultation option. 7-10 We did not identify any specific patient characteristics in this study associated with support for telehealth. Another local study from the early pandemic found a higher proportion (98.4%) of rheumatology patients that considered the current use of telehealth appropriate, but also more (28.4%) that thought telehealth was only appropriate while strict infection control measures were required. 11 In our cohort, over 80% of respondents' views on telehealth were the same whether it be for use during or after the pandemic, including those that did not support its use at all. The high acceptability and utilisation of telehealth in our cohort during the pandemic may reflect an unmet desire in our patients for telehealth in general.",

Many respondents reported poor physical and mental health. That physical health was worse than mental health in a significant proportion of this cohort may reflect the short duration of restrictions when surveyed. However, there were still 169 (16.4%) respondents that rated their mental health as poor or fair.",

Most respondents were being treated with immunomodulating therapies capturing a potentially at-risk group in a pandemic. Limitations include the survey being sent online to regular ARAD respondents who had higher baseline mental health and education level than nonrespondents, which may affect generalisability to less engaged patients. This study could not identify the reasons supporting or opposing telehealth use. The survey was also conducted during the first wave of the pandemic with significant unknowns and therefore results may not be generalisable to later time periods when case numbers and restrictions varied across Australia. We were unable directly to compare respondents' current physical and mental health to prior to the pandemic as these attributes were not measured in the same way. Even prior to the pandemic physical and mental health were reduced in our cohort based upon SF-36 Standardised Physical and Mental Health Summaries.",
