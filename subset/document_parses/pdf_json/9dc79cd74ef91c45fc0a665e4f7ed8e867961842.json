Then we 231 collected and tested more samples. Sample No. 7 to No. 24 were all identified as M. canis (Figs S1 232 and S2A). We were surprised about the results for sample No. 3, as it was initially diagnosed with 233 dermatophytosis in clinics. We inoculated all 25 clinical samples on SDA plate and incubated at 30\u2103 234 for 2 weeks, and all samples were grown expect for negative control sample No. 25 (Figs 6C and 235 S2B). Then we performed micromorphology study and ITS sequencing using ITS1 and ITS4 as 236 primer set for these clinic isolates. After observing the macromorphology of fungal colony, 237 micromorphology of macroconidia and performing NCBI Blast of ITS sequencing, 23 samples 238 (except for samples No. 3) were identified as M. canis (Figs 6C and S2B). The RPA-Cas12a 239 fluorescence test matched the fungal culture and ITS sequencing results. The result of negative control 240 (No. 25 sample) was also consistent with the results of fungal culture and clinical diagnosis (Fig. 241 S2B). After statistical analysis, RPA-Cas12a method can achieve 100% sensitivity and 100% 242 specificity (Table 3). The main colony of sample No. 3 in the medium was sequenced and identified 243as Chaetomium globosum, which is a saprophytic fungus (not dermatophytes). 2444 | DISCUSSION245At present, the identification of dermatophytes in small animals still relies on comprehensive 246 diagnosis methods, such as Wood's lamp examination and microscopy in clinical practice. Some 247 clinics can perform fungal culture and dermatophyte PCR for further diagnosis. However, not every 248 clinic has relative equipment that can be used and the fungal culture will delay the diagnosis for about249 1-2 weeks. Actually, there is no gold standard diagnostic test for dermatophytosis. 3 Every diagnosis 250 method used clinically has its own limitations. For example, hair loss, scaling, crusting and erythema 251 are the most common clinical lesions. Due to the variability of the lesions, pruritus and other lesions 252 may occur in different animals. Moreover, it also can be confused with other diseases such as 253 pemphigus foliaceus. As for Wood's lamp examination, only 50% of M. canis infections can be 254 detected with fluorescence, while other dermatophytes (such as N. gypsea or M. persicolor 32 ) do not 255 produce fluorescence. 33 It can cause confusion and inaccuracy at the same time. 2 Direct microscopic 256 examination may be a simple and rapid way to screen for microconidia and hyphae, however, 257 only >85% of cases can be accurately diagnosed. 3 In addition, the professional requirements for 258 microscopic examination are very high. Two recognized disadvantages of fungal culture are 259 time-consuming and demanding (about 1-2 weeks), which can delay the diagnostic outcome and 260 treatment. Molecular tools are increasingly used in the laboratory for the fungal identification.261",

It 398 only takes 30 minutes after DNA extraction with high specificity and sensitivity; (2) Conventional 399 detection methods. With Wood's lamp, only 50% M. canis can be detected. Meanwhile, other foreign 400matters will also fluoresce, which may cause interference. Microscopic identification is a rapid 401 diagnostic method, but it requires qualified personnel and may lead to misdiagnosis. Fungal culture is 402 an accurate method of detecting fungal infections, but it can be time-consuming (2 weeks) and 403 requires qualified personnel. Dermatophyte PCR and qPCR as specific molecular tools have the 404 disadvantages of expensive equipment requirement, which brings inconvenience to clinical 405",
