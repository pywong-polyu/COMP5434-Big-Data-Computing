            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune connective tissue disease that leads to disability and premature death. 1 The symptoms of the disease mainly affect the locomotor system. As they intensify, RA patients lose the ability to function on a day-to-day basis with regard to self-maintenance and performance of work activities. 2 The limitations caused by the disease often lead to a loss of independence and result in dependency on outside help. The recurrent pain associated with inflammation and limited joint mobility as well as the loss of autonomy have a negative influence on other aspects of functioning (mental, physical, social and environmental), which affects the perceived quality of life in these patients. 3 Modern medicine aims both to increase the lifespan of patients and to improve their quality of life to a level comparable to that before the onset of the disease. As for the latter, the most commonly used definition is healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL), which is an important complement to the evaluation of clinical parameters. However, HRQoL can only be assessed by patients themselves. The assessment consists in comparing one's current health condition with the desired health status. 4, 5 A patient's subjective assessment of their health status is a practical factor that allows for a better planning and improvement of the quality of care provided to the patient. A patient's self-assessment of their health indicates their limitations in functioning caused by the disease or the treatment administered. 4 With the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there have been concerns that patients with rheumatic conditions may be at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus and experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms, especially during acute episodes of their condition. 8 This is due, on the one hand, to reduced immunity during inflammation, and on the other hand to the changes caused by an intensive treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. 9 The slogans\"stay at home\", \"quarantine\" and \"maintain social distance\" during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been of particular relevance for patients with rheumatic conditions. If a patient with a rheumatic condition contracts COVID-19, it is important that the treatment of their condition is discontinued and resumed after 2 weeks of symptom-free observation. 9 The current ACR and EULAR recommendations for the management of inflammatory joint diseases state that treatment with disease-modifying drugs, including biologics, should be continued only in those patients who were not infected or exposed. 7, 9 During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, most primary and specialist care outpatient clinics have started to offer their patients teleconsultation appointments as well as electronic prescriptions and referrals. For many patients it was the only available way to access medical care. In the case of RA patients, this form of care may seem to be a perfect solution, as rheumatology specialists have access to the medical records of their patients and know most of them. The ability to monitor the health condition of patients and provide medical advice by telephone allows doctors to continuously provide their patients with treatment appropriate to their health status and allows patients to avoid unnecessary contacts. 10 This model of care may in principle seem to be appropriate for patients with rheumatic conditions. However, the opinions voiced by patients suggest that they are not fully satisfied with this form of care and that they were more satisfied with face-to-face appointments with specialists, which they considered to have been more effective in their treatment. 11 One major problem during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been the lack of access to rehabilitation, which is as important as pharmacological treatment in the case of patients with rheumatic conditions. Rehabilitation plays an important role in improving the ability of young patients to perform work-related activities and allows older patients to maintain mobility. Both the treatment methods should be used to ensure that comprehensive treatment is provided. 6 In light of the above, we carried out a study on patients with RA, whose aim was to assess the quality of life in these patients and determine the factors that may affect their perceived QoL. The study also included an assessment of satisfaction with telehealth services and its impact on QoL. Moreover, the study addressed the issue of loneliness, which in the last year has been experienced by many people confined to their homes because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The study took into account such factors as the severity of symptoms, loneliness, and satisfaction with remote consultations with specialists, including consultations carried out using electronic means only.",

Questionnaire of satisfaction with teleconsultations and care provided by specialist outpatient clinics during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which investigated the level of satisfaction with the quality of remote consultations and their comparison with face-to-face appointments, comprehensibility of the information provided during teleconsultation appointments, and the possibility of having a teleconsultation appointment when needed. Satisfaction with the prescriptions provided during teleconsultation appointments was also assessed. The questionnaire comprises four items, with one point scored for each answer starting with 'Yes'. The total score in the questionnaire ranges from 0 to 4, with a higher score denoting a higher level of satisfaction with teleconsultations. The results of the questionnaire are presented as a percentage of points that can be scored in the questions answered by the respondent. Thus, the level of satisfaction with teleconsultations ranges from 0 to 100%. Based on their scores for satisfaction with teleconsultations, respondents were divided into two groups, with a \u226450% cut-off point denoting dissatisfaction with teleconsultations: group 1 -patients dissatisfied with teleconsultations (n=75; 52.45%), group 2 -patients satisfied with teleconsultations (n=68, 47.55%). 4.

By meeting the expectations of patients, who play a vital role in healthcare facilities and other health entities, high quality services can be ensured. 19 In our study, the patients surveyed were dissatisfied with teleconsultations, with less than half of respondents reporting satisfaction with this form of care. The majority of patients stated that the quality of teleconsultations is not comparable to the quality of in-person appointments.

In the survey of satisfaction with remote services conducted at the request of the Polish government, the services provided by primary care physicians were rated highly by patients. 21 Some respondents in the survey stated that telephone/ video consultations could be one of the main channels of contact between patients and primary care physicians, who would determine whether a face-to-face appointment is required. In the own study, according to approx. 30% of respondents, the quality of teleconsultation appointments is comparable to that of in-person appointments. The survey also found that as many as 80% of respondents had used the option to book a face-to-face appointment with their primary care physician following a teleconsultation appointment, which indicates that patients have a strong need for face-to-face contact with a doctor. 21 The difference in the level of satisfaction with this form of care between our study and the survey referred to above may result from differences in the profile of the patients surveyed. In our study, the mean age of respondents was 45, whereas the largest proportion of patients using primary care services in the aforementioned survey were aged \u2265 60. The number of teleconsultation appointments also differed between the studies. In our study it was 3.3, whereas in the survey of patients using primary health care services, it was only 1.",

            "text": "Today, the expectations of patients continue to rise. Factors determining the quality of the medical services provided, and thus affecting patients' level of satisfaction with these services, include: the way the patient is treated, the amount and quality of information provided, the time and attention given to patients by doctors and nurses, as well as the safety and accessibility of health services. 22 The patients participating in our study rated the quality of teleconsultations negatively and complained that their doctor provided them only with general information about their treatment, rehabilitation and psychological problems. They also stressed that medical personnel showed no initiative during those interactions, which were perfunctory and limited to answering the questions asked. Once their main health-related problems have been attended to, patients may expect a different quality of care or have other needs, including those relating to the doctor-patient relationship. 21 All aspects of care aimed at ensuring a holistic approach are extremely important for patients with chronic conditions. 6 It is not only essential to treat the medical problems of patients, but also take care of their mind and spirit, especially in the light of the uncertainty, stress, limitation of social, professional and family interactions, as well as loneliness associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 23 Studies have shown that over 20% of RA patients are diagnosed with depression 25 and that the higher the level of depression, the lower the self-care abilities and the higher the level of helplessness and loneliness in patients. 26 It has been observed that widowed persons who do not have support from a loved one find it more difficult to cope with different aspects of life, including in particular the physical 27 and social 28 ones, as compared with people who are married or who are single by choice. Authors of studies on patients with chronic conditions indicate that loneliness has a significant negative impact on self-care ability, 29 adherence 30 and quality of life. 31 Similarly to studies on patients with cardiac problems, 32 our study found moderate levels of loneliness in the patients surveyed, which had a significant negative impact on the perceived quality of life and negatively influenced satisfaction with the medical services received. However, the latter relationship was not statistically significant. Studies have found a correlation between loneliness and an increased pro-inflammatory gene expression, which may initiate the development and progression of both acute and chronic conditions that contribute to comorbidities and mortality. 33, 34 It has also been reported that a lower level of loneliness results in improved immunity and reduced C-reactive protein levels. 34 Loneliness and the pandemic situation are associated with high levels of stress. In her paper, Felsted notes that mindfulness is an effective treatment for a number of chronic conditions in older adults. 35 It was found that mindfulness has an impact on both stress levels and disease activity in patients with RA. It was also demonstrated that mindfulness plays an important role in reducing psychological stress and the severity of joint stiffness, pain and tenderness. 35 It is believed that there is a significant link between the mental status and QoL. According to Bai et al, 36 there is a link between the medical measures of QoL and the mental status of patients, which suggests that it is necessary to ensure that treatment includes psychological interventions, especially in this difficult time of the SARS-CoV -2 pandemic. Researchers investigating health-related quality of life stress that for a patient-client higher quality of life does not mean a change in health parameters, but rather a perceived improvement in social and personal functioning. This clearly indicates that pharmacological treatment alone is not sufficient. 37 Hand and wrist joint pain was the most severe symptom reported by the RA patients surveyed. In addition to medication, the treatment of pain should include non-pharmacological interventions, which are associated with a holistic approach and psychological measures aimed at teaching patients how to cope with pain and form positive attitudes. 6 In her study, Felsted notes that there is a significant relationship between mindfulness and both reduction in pain intensity and improvement in sleep quality and quality of life. 35 In light of the findings from our study, indicating that the patients surveyed were not satisfied with communication with their doctor during teleconsultation appointments, this may be difficult to achieve. This is because the patients complained that they did not receive sufficient information from their doctor during the appointments and that the doctor only focused on solving their physical health problem and issuing prescriptions. When confronted with the challenges associated with their condition, patients develop individual, subjective perception of their quality of life, which is not consistent with the assessment performed by a doctor based on external, objective determinants of QoL. 37 It is worth stressing that wellbeing is a concept that encompasses two separate components: a balance between positive and negative emotions, and the cognitive evaluation of one's life. 38 In the case of patients with chronic conditions, negative emotions caused by pain, body deformities and restricted mobility may prevail, but this does not necessarily lead to a negative perception of one's entire life. 37 However, when the emotions experienced are coupled with loneliness and dissatisfaction with the medical services received, negative emotions can dominate and even an improvement and reduction in the symptoms associated with a given condition will not have the desired impact and will not result in an improvement in QoL.",

One additional problem is that the findings obtained during the pandemic were not compared to the results obtained before the pandemic. Another limitation of the study is the fact of using ASQoL questionnaire designed for patients with ankylosing spondylitis in patients with RA.The majority of patients were in a low clinical activity status, what may be important when examining QoL in RA patients. Another limitation of the study was the lack of assessment of depression, as a determinant of QoL and a common factor in RA patients. It is possible that feelings of loneliness and satisfaction with telemedicine may be more impaired in RA patients with depression. Additionally, according to the DAS-28 data, most patients had low disease activity, which made the results of the study more focused on patients responding to medication. Another limitation of our study is the fact of recruiting patients via the Internet on social networks, which may have an impact on the selection of the group. However, paying attention to the purpose of the study, it can be concluded that this group is the most frequently used telemedicine.",

The authors emphasise that when developing teleconsultation services, it is appropriate to focus on improving such aspects as the ability to get through to primary care outpatient clinics by telephone and the provision of full and comprehensive information about treatment and all the necessary documents to patients during teleconsultation appointments. What is also important is the possibility to book an in-person appointment whenever the teleconsultation appointment does not have the expected outcome.",
