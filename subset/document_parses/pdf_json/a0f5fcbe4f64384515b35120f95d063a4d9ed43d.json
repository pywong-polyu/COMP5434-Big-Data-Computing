Community health systems (CHSs) provide an alternative to traditional facility-based health systems through a set of local actors, relationships, and processes supporting health at community and household levels. Community health workers (CHWs) have been the cornerstone of CHSs playing a crucial role in providing preventive, promotive, and curative health services to local communities. Countries worldwide seek to leverage the skills, community knowledge, and cultural competency that CHWs can bring, connecting those most at risk for poor health outcomes with the formal health system. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Furthermore, CHW programs are a proven, costeffective approach compared to conventional health provider-based service delivery models. [6] [7] With nearly 60% of its population living in rural areas, 8 sub-Saharan Africa relies on CHWs as a cost-effective alternative to traditional facilitybased service delivery approaches. However, the scarcity of domestic funding for these programs hampers financial sustainability. Sub-Saharan African countries benefited from high (70.2%) development assistance disbursed to CHW-targeted projects between 2007 and 2017, with external donors accounting for nearly 46% of the average annual total funding amount. 9 For the past 3 decades, Mali's community health system has played a significant role in determining the supply of and demand for community-level health services. Populations across the country ensure that key health services are available in communities through public-private partnerships. Community-level health service delivery is built on a network of privately owned nonprofit community health centers (CHCs) founded by communities and managed by elected community health boards (CBs). 10 Through a public-private partnership agreement between the central government and CBs, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) provides technical supervision and other support and the CHCs provide public health services to their catchment area. The National Federation of Community Health Boards (NFCB) was created as a central body providing regulatory oversight over and management support to CBs. The first CHC was created in 1989 10 ; as of December 2018, there were 1,368. 11 The Malian government introduced CHWs to strengthen rural health care delivery with the support of international partners, following the 2009 census findings that mortality ratios for mothers and children (aged 12-59 months) were respectively 5 and 2 times higher in rural areas. 12 Since then, CHWs have been delivering ECC to rural populations (i.e., those living more than 5 km from a CHC). The CHW program is funded primarily by international donors, heightening concern for the sustainability of this critical workforce as donors announce decreases in financial support.",

Unreliable information about the number, location, terms of service, employment prerequisites, and modes of payment of CHWs in Mali make planning difficult. Lack of cost data further hinders adequate domestic financing of CHW programs and efficient use of available resources as communities and government entities could not rely on accurate data on the real cost of service provision components, including human resources (salary and benefits), drugs and supplies, pre-and in-service training, supervision, and other program management costs. Part of this challenge is explained by the absence of a central repository with information on financing sources for remunerations, equipment, and other program funding areas.

To derive the normative cost of each service, we analyzed national norms and standards, calculated direct costs of the resources or ingredients required for each service (a \"bottom-up\" activity-based approach), and Efficiency Analyses of Community Health Worker Program in Mali www.ghspjournal.org allocated indirect costs in proportion to the share of CHW time spent on each service (a \"top-down\" approach). This provider perspective approach to calculating cost per service focuses on the supplyside dimension of service quality. Provider communication, bias, and other key aspects of service quality from the client's perspective client were excluded. The national ECC implementation guide defines the ECC package provided by CHWs. We analyzed its composition by identifying individual services and their link to public health programs. Building from the expenditure information identified in the situational analysis, we traced the main program elements with identifiable costs needed to deliver services. Labor, medicines, and supplies were classified as direct costs entirely attributable to service delivery. Management, supervision, equipment, and training were considered indirect costs incurred regardless of whether service delivery occurs and cannot be assigned solely to a specific service. CHW equipment (thermometer, scale, bicycle, etc.) was considered an indirect cost as specific aspects, like length and frequency of use directly attributable to each service, were not measured. Determining a standard level of inputs for the ECC package provided by CHWs involved direct measurement or estimation of the time needed to provide each individual service plus required diagnostic tests, medicines, and supplies. We combined contributions from the expert panel with existing national standard care protocols for child health (a MOHSA document) to determine or confirm standard treatment guidelines and estimate standardized normative inputs required for all ECC services. The CHW standardized treatment sheet for sick children was considered a reference to assess and compare quality of care among children and was designed to encourage efficiency through resource optimization and rational use of treatment inputs. Community health experts confirmed data from nationally published statistics. Information was collected from health authorities and implementing partners on costs of personnel supporting the program (CHWs and managers), expected frequency, and cost of training and supervision.",

Roles and responsibilities were defined, and guidelines were provided to ensure that delivery of these services, supervision, and reporting are integrated as a package across 5 public health programs. The ECC package is linked to services under community mobiliza-tion/behavior change communication, nutrition, reproductive health/family planning, malaria, and maternal and child health. Direct and indirect labor costs for CHWs contributed to 20% of total cost per service. Activity reporting was the most laborintensive and expensive \"service\" with 95% of its cost attributed to indirects. Management of moderate acute malnutrition was the second most expensive service due to high supplies and medicines costs because of extensive use of ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) for child nutritional rehabilitation (Table 3) . Results for all services are available in a Supplement. The CHW program spent US$10.50 on average per service in 2015 to provide 1.24 million ECC services, 55% more than the estimated US$6.80 on average per intervention that would have been needed to achieve the same service volume if standard care protocols were followed which would reduce aggregate spending by 36% (US$8.36 million). The number of ECC services provided per CHW in 2015 varied significantly across districts, with estimates ranging between 94 to 2,287. The proportion of CHW total time available for ECC services in a year spent on direct service provision also varied widely between districts, from 3% to 43%. Comparably low shares of time spent on direct service provision were observed in similar work on integrated community case management programs in other sub-Saharan African countries. 20 The CHW-topopulation ratio ranges from 1 CHW to 702 to 3,478 people per CHW across districts. Funding required for ECC per CHW per year, independent of the quantity of service provided, was estimated at US$2,422 per CHW per year and represented the Some areas of the CHW program (defined as areas with quantifiable costs related to an identifiable source) benefited from a funding surplus, while others faced a deficit. Figure 1 compares the funding needed in 2015 across program inputs if standard care protocols had been followed, with corresponding spending allocations reported by funding sources. Program input areas such as medicines and supplies, and start-up training had more funding than needed. The excess was estimated at US$6.88 million, 76% of which can be attributed to RUSF and related commodities. Supervision, program management, and recurrent training components were underfunded by US$2.2 million.",

Technical and allocative efficiency gaps for each health district within the Kayes region, illustrated via red and green cells, present opportunities for reallocation of theoretical funding surplus. Calculations for the 5 regions are available in a Supplement. Figure 3 compares actual district-level spending on services (in US$) delivered with the estimated normative spending to show the magnitude of potential efficiency gains and resource optimization at scale (same population covered and service volume produced). Opportunities for cost saving were identified in 41 of 44 districts (indicated in green in Figure 3 ), varying in value between US$29,218 and US$637,935 and cumulatively representing US$6.16 million. Repurposing the funding from technical efficiency improvements within districts could cover over 2.1 million more people in rural areas without any redistribution across districts, representing an additional 32.3 percentage points of the rural population and increasing coverage in the 5 regions from 49.0% to 81.3%. Amounts spent by 3 other districts (indicated in red in Figure 3 ) were lower than their normative spending estimates. Districts in 4 regions spent above what was needed to reach technical efficiency requirements (based on national guidelines) meeting the use of ECC by their covered and total rural population.

Opportunities for funding reallocation were identified in 20 of 44 districts with a surplus between Repurposing funding from technical efficiency improvements within districts could cover over 2.1 million more people in rural areas without any redistribution across districts. Figure 5 presents an example of how the theoretical funding surplus available for reallocation can be applied to reach an optimal number of districts supporting the use of ECC services by their entire population (i.e., prioritizing districts with the smallest deficits). In this example, reallocating the funding surplus would bring 20 additional districts to full coverage of their rural population and reach more than 850,000 people, increasing rural population coverage by 13.1 percentage points (from 81.3% to 94.4%). In 13 districts with a funding deficit, 1,637 noncovered villages were located more than 5 km from any point of service (health facility or CHW). We refer to such communities as \"isolated villages.\" Figure 6 displays the results of prioritizing districts with villages most isolated from the health system, i.e. districts with the farthest average distance between isolated villages and the nearest covered village (based on Euclidean distance). We estimate that this approach would bring 10 additional districts to full coverage, reach rural populations located in approximately 1,468 isolated villages, and increase rural population coverage across 5 regions to 91.6% ( Figure 6 ). The opposite approachprioritizing districts where isolated villages are located closer to covered villages and are thus easier to reach-would bring 10 additional districts to full coverage, reach approximately 1,278 isolated villages, and increase rural population coverage",

For example, CHW supervision, often considered one of the weakest links in CHW programs (although noted as critical for CHW effectiveness and efficiency), 7, 22 was severely underfunded in 2015, meeting only 26% of the normative cost required. While donor funding provided adequate total funding for most aspects of the CHW program, we found internal inefficiencies and misalignments of funding. Some areas got more support, as did some geographies. Other areas had access challenges. Norms were not followed, leading to inefficient spending of available resources. Mali could make better use of CHW program funding if guided by data that inform efficient use of domestic resources mobilized, while also adequately resourcing key program areas. Given budget and health workforce constraints in lower-and middle-income countries, CHWs face challenges without receiving the needed support in providing expected services. The productivity differences were discussed with local stakeholders. These discussions generated possible explanations, including the presence of user fees and variability in population density (captured by the populationto-CHW ratio) linked to the mining industry. Although user fees are authorized in Mali, they are known to inhibit access to care in other settings. 23, 24 Mali is a major producer of mined gold in Africa. 25 The presence of gold extraction sites may distort population dynamics and affect density as human activity increases significantly in these regions or districts. 26 Enforcing national protocols for ECC services through an adequately funded supportive supervision system would allow significant cost savings by improving CHWs' ability to comply with technical efficiency requirements that would, in turn, lead to less costly service provision. Optimizing limited resources through cost savings provides opportunities to increase coverage to currently noncovered populations. Mali geospatial analyses illustrate options for decision makers. Planning can be more engaging by visually supporting identification and prioritization of districts with the highest opportunities for technical efficiency improvements. Using recognizable maps makes advocating for funding surplus reallocations and investments easier. Location data (distance and proximity) used in geospatial targeting help stakeholders reflect critically on CHW resource planning and make evidence easier to act upon. Geospatial analytics and supported interfaces facilitate analytical reasoning for decision makers by turning data into information, information into insight, and insight into practical decision making. Geospatial analytics can further help organizations anticipate and prepare for upcoming changes due to evolving spatial conditions or location-based events such as a community-level response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Robust data and results from these types of analyses offer entry points to engage government and communities to invest more in CHWs together. At the central level, findings can demonstrate that costs required for CHW-delivered interventions meeting current rural demand and unmet need for ECC services can be significantly reduced without sacrificing quality. At a local level, results give stakeholders analytical insight and understanding that spending can be geographically targeted to optimize service use by rural populations.",

Demand-side factors such as financial barriers affecting use of services in CHW-covered areas were not assessed, as information on user fees possibly charged by CHWs for some of the services provided were not collected. Costs did not include health system strengthening activities required to increase compliance with norms and standards of care. Differences affecting use of ECC services were not accounted for between CHW-covered and noncovered villages within the same health district. Elements that might explain the variation in CHW productivity such as workload, adequate supplies and equipment, and acceptance and respect from the community and health systems were not explored in our analyses. 36 Although a useful proxy in regions where common routes are not always mapped, Euclidean distance does not consider constraints in travel such as road conditions, rivers, and terrain.",

Results from Mali's case show how efficiency analyses can provide an evidence base to build stronger stakeholder engagement and support improved decision making for CHW financing. Our analyses bring a level of understanding of CHW program costs and challenges that allows the Malian government and other stakeholders to prioritize resources efficiently, and thus afford targeted investments to begin sustainably financing the CHW program. Evidence presented indicates system and program implementation changes that could be tested to suggest future adaptations. Such changes could further guide operations research in other sub-Saharan African countries to improve community health and the sustainability of CHW programs. Building CHSs from the ground up, while carefully considering local contexts, is essential to inform decisions about where, when, and how care is provided within a community. Our findings can also further contribute to global thinking and local actions around system integration. They can debunk frequent misconceptions which present CHW programs as a unidimensional human resource solution to health care access at the community level without recognizing the dynamics of CHS local actors, implementing partners, and the broader health system.",
