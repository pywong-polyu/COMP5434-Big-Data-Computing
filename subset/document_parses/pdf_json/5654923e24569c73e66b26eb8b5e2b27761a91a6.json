Individuals who participated in the qualitative interviews were approached again during August 2021 to participate in the ED PREM content validation study. The preliminary ED PREM comprised 37 items. A two-round modified, online Delphi study was undertaken where patient participants were asked to rate the clarity, relevance, and importance of ED PREM items on a 4-point content validity index scale. Each round lasted for two-weeks, with 1 week in between for analysis. Consensus was a priori defined as item-level content validity index scores of \u22650.80. A scale-level content validity index score was also calculated.",

Valuebased healthcare seeks to incentivise care providers and services for high quality care that supports improved patient outcomes, patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experiences [5, 7] . In the United States, 25% of annual hospital reimbursement via the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program is based on patient experience scores [11] . Similar schemes also operate in the United Kingdom in both primary and secondary care settings [12, 13] . In Australia, patient experience data is used to monitor health service quality and improvements [9] , and establish key service performance indicators [14] . Thus, given the critical role that PREMs play in monitoring, evaluating and improving health services and systems globally, it is essential that they are valid and reliable instruments with strong conceptual foundations.",

First, the concepts of patient experience and patient satisfaction are often used synonymously and interchangeably [15] [16] [17] . However, where patient experience captures an objective report of what happened during a care encounter and how it happened, patient satisfaction captures a subjective evaluation of the care experience; namely which of the patients' expectations were met or not [16, 17] . Second, many PREMs exhibit varying levels of validity and reliability [1, [18] [19] [20] . Thus, there is some uncertainty regarding whether PREMs measure what they purport to measure (validity), and whether they are able to perform consistently (reliability) [21] .

An existing review of ED PREMs was also consulted [18] . The results of both reviews demonstrated that existing instruments were limited by their length, ambiguous conceptual underpinnings, and heavy reliance on branch logic, which prevents existing PREM datasets from undergoing item reduction analysis such as exploratory factor analysis (as items tend to group where skip logic occurs, as opposed to where there are conceptual relations).

The systematic mixed studies review highlighted complex interplay between patients and their relationship with ED care providers and the ED environment [30] . The qualitative findings reinforced this notion, additionally emphasising the importance of specific relational attributes of care (i.e., person-centeredness, confidence, and engagement), as well as tangible and intangible ED environmental factors.

These experts, who had previously participated in a qualitative study with the research team, were purposively sampled for maximum variation of age, gender, and reason for presentation to the ED (under review). Thirty participants were interviewed relative to their availability to undertake a telephone interview within 2-weeks of their ED presentation. After being interviewed, participants were asked if they consented to being contacted in the future to participate in the Delphi study. Of the 30 patients interviewed, 24 (80%) consented to future participation. All potential experts were contacted via email or mobile, provided a brief overview of the study, and asked whether they were willing to participate. They were offered an AU$20 gift voucher to compensate for their time. Experts were eligible to participate in the Delphi study if they were aged 18 years or older; able to speak, read and comprehend English; and able to complete the Delphi survey independently online. [23] . This is the most frequently used variation of the CVI scale [35] . Using open dialogue boxes, experts were also asked to suggest item wording, domain name and domain definition revisions (if applicable); and suggest additional items for any experiential aspects of care missing. Demographic questions included gender, year of birth, highest educational qualification, identification as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander, and number of ED presentations in the past 12-months. Experts were given 2-weeks to complete the round 1 survey, after which time the survey was closed and results were exported into Microsoft Excel. A reminder email was sent to participants on days 5 and 12 of the round 1 survey period if they had not yet participated. Round 2: The second round was a priori determined to be the final Delphi round, and commenced 1-week after the completion of round 1 in September 2021. Experts were emailed a second survey invitation and asked to rate the revised items relative to clarity, relevance, and importance using the 4-point CVI scale; and to suggest item revisions.

As there are few examples of PREM content validation in the peer-reviewed literature, this study can be used to inform other researchers in their own PREM content validation endeavours.",

            "text": "Two studies support the conceptual foundations of this ED PREM. First, a systematic mixed studies review, which described patient experiences in the ED as a complex interplay between patients, care providers and the ED environment [30] . Second, qualitative interviews with ED patients where patient experiences culminated into four themes; 'Caring relationships between patients and ED care providers' , 'Being in the ED environment' , 'Variations in waiting for care' , and 'Having a companion in the ED' (under review). The findings from these two studies were combined to formulate the conceptual model of ED patient experience (Fig. 1) underpinning the development of the ED PREM. These conceptual foundations strongly align with existing literature, reinforcing the ED PREMs' content validity, and suggesting its' applicability to ED services broadly. Sonis and colleagues previously identified that the most commonly described themes of ED patient experience in the literature were staff-patient communication (described in 78% of included studies), ED wait times (56%), and staff empathy and compassion (44%) [37] . Australian research reported that patients place greatest value on the time they spend waiting, symptom relief, receiving a diagnosis and explanation of the problem, and friendly, caring and concerned ED staff [38, 39] . Additionally, a synthesis of qualitative research highlighted that emotions associated with an emergency situation (e.g., vulnerability and anxiety), staff-patient interactions, waiting, having family in the ED, and the emergency environment were characteristic of ED patient experiences [40] . Thus, not only does the newly developed ED PREM demonstrate good content validity from the patients' perspective, but it also aligns with experiential aspects of ED care previously articulated in the literature.",

            "text": "The current study aimed to address a significant gap in the PREM development literature -the lack of PREMspecific guidance for content validation and psychometric evaluation methodologies more generally. A review of 88 PREMs identified that only 37.5% of instruments met COSMIN criteria for demonstrating appropriate The ED was quiet. 0.73 0.60 0.67 D n/a n/a n/a n/a content validation; content validation was either unclear or unknown for the others [1] . While COSMIN currently presents the best available criteria for good content validation processes [23] , these criteria were developed for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) which are conceptually and operationally different to PREMs [2] . PROMs capture a patients' health and wellbeing relative to care (e.g. physical functioning after surgery) [2] . The lack of PREM-specific guidance impacts on the standardisation and rigor of current practices used in PREM development. Thus, the development of PREM-specific content validation and psychometric evaluation guidance is an area of research that warrants investigation. The use of the modified Delphi technique for this study presents several strengths relative to other consensus methodologies such as Nominal Group Technique (NGT) and Q-methodology. Briefly, NGT is conducted face-toface and involves five highly structured steps that aim to facilitate effective group decision-making in response to a question [41] [42] [43] . Q-methodology involves participants ranking a set of items relative to a defined outcome (e.g., importance of those items), employing inverted factor analyses to interpret participant item rankings, and subsequently ascribing qualitative meaning to the resultant factor structure [44, 45] . The modified Delphi technique was advantageous because each round of the study was conducted anonymously and independently online. This gave each participant equal opportunity to have input into the study and reduced the risk of response bias that can arise in group settings (e.g., herd mentality or groupthink) [46] . The online capability also minimised the impact of COVID-19 on the conduct of the study. Additionally, each round took place over a two-week period, giving participants the flexibility to choose when and where they participated. This is not an option in NGT, where participants are required to attend a face-to-face meeting [43] . Finally, calculating I-CVIs and S-CVIs is analytically simple, whereas the analysis employed in Q-methodology requires a working knowledge of factor analysis [44] . Thus, this method may not be as feasible to those who are new to instrument development and psychometric evaluation.",

            "text": "A key consideration of this study was striking a balance between adequately representing the concept of ED patient experience, and ensuring that the number of items presented to patient participants was not overly burdensome. It has been suggested that for instrument development, \"the larger the item pool, the better\" [47] . Yet, while there is no prescribed optimal number of survey items, instruments that are shorter in length tend to have a higher response rate, and lower proportion of missing data when administered on a large-scale [48] . Thus, the resultant information is of greater quality and more likely to be generalisable to the target population. Most ED PREMs are over 40 items long, with response rates ranging between 18 and 51% depending on the mode of administration [18, 49, 50] . Thus, reducing respondent burden is critical to minimising the impacts of response biases and improving the quality of participant data [51] . Future psychometric evaluation of the ED PREM will further contribute to item reduction [52] . Thus, while items examined in content validation studies need to be comprehensive, minimising conceptually redundant items is also important for reducing participant burden both during content validation and subsequent administrations of the instrument.

Consequently, the ratings of clarity, relevance and importance for ED PREM items may not be representative of all Australian ED patient perspectives. However, the use of a maximum variation sampling frame aimed to minimise this by ensuring that individuals with wideranging demographic and clinical characteristics were involved in the study.",

We used a modified, online Delphi technique to demonstrate the content validity of a 35-item ED PREM that will now undergo further psychometric evaluation. This study can be used to inform content validation methods and procedures of other PREMs, and supports the need for PREM-specific guidance on content validation and psychometric evaluation more generally.
