Within the wider sphere of self-care practice, self-medication, and specifically self-medication with nonprescription drugs, stands out as distinct through its context-dependent and often debatable nature: Is it possible to draw a line between beneficial and potential harmful practices? If yes, where and on what basis can we distinguish the positive and negative sides of the self-medication process? [8, 9] . Furthermore, what are the possible factors associated with and driving self-medication practices?",

However, selfmedication is often discussed from a healthcare reform perspective, highlighting patient independence or patient empowerment [10] , which resembles related perspectives from a patient-as-consumer or pharmaceutical consumer paradigm [11, 12] . Focusing on the negative aspects, most salient are issues of inaccurate self-diagnosis, incorrect dosage and use, negative interaction with other pre-existing conditions or other medications [13] , the potential for pathogen resistance due to incorrect application and increased morbidity [14] . At a psychological level, self-medication can lead to choice paradoxes (e.g., over-choice) and issues around individual responsibility, which has negative consequences for wellbeing [15] [16] [17] .",

The available evidence parallels the patterns found in low-income contexts: individuals often have a rather poor knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of self-medication but perceive the practice positively [18, 19] . While there is no widely shared theoretical framework for research into self-medication, the extant research in European countries has been concentrated around reporting the type of medicine used (the most commonly discussed are analgesics, antibiotics, digestives and brain enhancing drugs), most frequently sources of information for self-medication decisions [18] and the sociodemographic characteristics of individuals self-medicating [14, 20] . One major topic of interest in recent years has been the use of antibiotics [21] [22] [23] , especially in treating flu symptoms and colds. One common framework, as well as its variations, that has been used in the study of antibiotics use is the Knowledge-Perception-Practice (KPP) approach, which assesses what is known, believed and done about self-medication, capturing both cognitive and non-cognitive aspects relevant for self-medication behavior [24] . The main assumption underlying the model is that, by altering knowledge and perception, practices can be changed [25] . Previous studies using this framework in the area of self-medication have examined the often erroneous beliefs about the use of antibiotics [26, 27] , which tend to correlate with lower educational levels and appear to be more common in rural areas [28] , but also pointed to a gap between knowledge and behavior in the case of healthcare (medicine and pharmacy) students [29] .",

Furthermore, the available research has reported differences across European countries and a relative lack of studies in Eastern European countries such as Romania [22] [23] [24] . Our study aimed to contribute to the literature by investigating views on self-medication practices in Romania. Romania currently ranks as an upper-middle economy, being a post-communist society with a centralized healthcare system that, despite constant reforms, has some of the worst statistics within Europe for indicators such as life expectancy and mortality rates [30] . Further complicating the situation, the low level of institutional trust (including towards hospitals and medical doctors) and an extended shadow economy [31] are likely factors that further increase the positive perceptions of self-medication as an informal beneficial practice. In line with this broader pattern, marketing studies have reported that 62% of Romanians resort to self-medication for cold or flu, headaches, joint or muscle pain, gastric burns or abdominal pain and 68% reported having an \"emergency stock\" of medicine to be taken in case of cold or flu, as well as pain killers and vitamins [32] . Extensive advertising, especially TV commercials, devoted to over-the-count drugs, portray self-medication as \"the new normal\", enhancing perceptions of behavioral control and perceived self-efficacy and emphasizing possible benefits of the practice [33] . Most TV commercials advertising over-the-counter drugs include recommendations to carefully read the leaflet, which may warn consumers about possible adverse effects. These figures and TV commercials provide the background for recent statements by the Romanian Ministry of Health and health officials that urge Romanians to avoid self-medication, especially when the symptoms resemble those of cold, flu or infectious diseases [34] . However, are these public health communications effective? What factors are associated with self-medication in this population?",

Globally, self-medication in the case of cold/flu/viral infection is the third most common form of self-medication [35] . Cold or flu symptoms often improve over relatively short periods of time even without medication, therefore, self-medication in the case of flu or cold symptoms is likely to increase the subjective efficacy of the practice, giving patients a sense of self-efficacy, which then leads to consumption of non-prescribed medication in other health contexts. Therefore, cold or flu infection may be an entry point for developing a habit of self-medication for other conditions and ailments. Furthermore, our research focused on the social aspects of selfmedication. The practice of taking non-prescribed medication may be motivated through recommendations by others within one's social network, especially in an environment where trust in official institutions is low and people tend to rely on close social networks to support each other in the absence of an efficient institutional system. To date, research has not explicitly focused on these social determinants of self-medication, which may be of importance in contexts where official health systems are perceived as inadequate.",

Contrasting and comparing the responses to these three different questions about self-medication can also provide greater nuances and insights into the practices of self-medication. A second contribution to the literature is the consideration of possible nonlinear associations between determinants of self-medication. Previous research and health policy have generally assumed linear relationships, leading to a more is better or more effective perspective. We tested whether there are possible saturation or turning points beyond which predictors may become less relevant or important. Any such patterns should be of interest to policy makers.

Our estimation is based on Factor-based PLS Type CFM1, which complies with the common factor model assumptions. The advantage of the WarpPLS software over other options that conduct similar estimations is the availability to identify potential nonlinear relationships among the variables involved in the model.

In contrast, practice based on similarity is highly significant in predicting self-medication in the case of flu (\u03b2 = 0.524, p < 0.001), self-medication in unspecified contexts (\u03b2 = 0.282, p < 0.001) and self-medication based on others' recommendations (\u03b2 = 0.390, p < 0.001). Habits predict both self-medication in case of flu (\u03b2 = 0.250, p < 0.001) and self-medication in unspecified contexts (\u03b2 = 0.087, p = 0.005). Table 3 presents the performance indicators for each model, along with their corresponding threshold values. The results show that all three models are reliable. The first model, explaining a specific type of behavior (a specific ailment), has the highest explana-tory power (53%), while the second and the third model explain less variance (32% in case of self-medication in general and 19% in case of self-medication based on recommendations). Table 4 presents the effect sizes of each KPP predictor using the equivalent of Cohen's f2 within the context of PLSF, assuming linear relationships. Typically, effect sizes larger than 0.02 are considered of sufficient magnitude to justify recommendations for practical intervention [49] . Effect sizes below this threshold indicate that the relationship is not practically relevant, even though it may be statistically significant [50] . Table 4 shows that self-medication practice based on similarity is not only statistically significant in predicting each of the three types of self-medication behaviors but also of sufficient magnitude to have some practical implications. The same applies to habits (in relation to flu/cold selfmedication). In contrast, information on how the drug works was the only significant predictor in one of the three models, but the effect size estimate was below the minimum level recommended for practical intervention. We focused on the overall statistical patterns of our models, without including the greater complexities and insights that can be gained by using a PLSF framework. In Appendix A, we present more information on the nonlinear dynamics between our variables. To provide one example, Figure 1 shows the nonlinear relationship between selfmedication for cold/flu symptoms and understanding the risks and side-effects. Overall, the linear relationship is not significant. However, as can be seen in Figure 1 , the relationship follows a U-curve. Individuals below the value of 0.27 on the scaled risk latent factor do not show a reliable association with taking flu medication without prescription (p = 0.25), whereas those individuals with more awareness of risks show a reliable association and increased likelihood to self-medicate (p = 0.05). The linear effect in the whole sample was not significant.",

However, we need to emphasize that this general lack of significant relationships of information related factors is not important. Certainly, information and knowledge are relevant to provide options for individuals to act upon, therefore information is important when combined with other behavioral interventions. For instance, Dusseldorp et al. [56] demonstrated that the most effective interventions in changing health behaviors are those in which the information about the behavior-health link is enhanced by prompting intention formation (defined as \"encouraging the person to decide to act or to set a general goal\") and follow-up communication (defined as \"contacting the person again after the main part of the intervention is complete\").",

For example, we demonstrated that the social influence of peers in shaping self-medication practices is one important driver that illustrates the limits of individual choice: individuals \"are never totally independent-they are subject to a thousand influences, from those around them as well as the whole society\" [57] . A wide range of studies have highlighted that the use of behavioral information (so-called nudges) focusing on social comparisons or norms is highly effective in influencing tax compliance, deterring corruption or energy saving. Such interventions are based on \"eliciting social expectations with the intent of inducing desirable behavior\" [58] and usually they present information on social norms. Our model focusing on self-medication as a response to social influence (advice offered by relatives, neighbors or friends) showed that social influence is salient for self-medication, yet this information is currently underexplored for self-medication interventions. There is evidence that nudging is effective for health policies [59, 60] . This further highlights the importance of community-level interventions combining individual and environmental change strategies [61] for addressing behavioral health problems. For example, a school curriculum or a training program offered by patients' organizations on health and medication literacy [62, 63] could be coupled with a normative messaging intervention (describing the decisions of people from the same reference group as the target population), leveraging group dynamics in addition to individual behavior change [64] .",

Depending on how strong the habit is, interventions could be targeted on novel or ambiguous situations when habits do not directly apply and therefore behavioral routines could be more effectively shifted. For self-medication such points may arise when people are facing a new health issue or when they change healthcare providers, e.g., family doctors, etc. A second option might be to target the larger structural context in which the habit is embedded. In the case of self-medication, this could include a closer examination of the institutional structures and services available and used by individuals within a specific context, including family medicine, health insurance, pharmaceutical services, etc. Targeting self-medication habits with a comprehensive strategy aimed at breaking habits should ideally include both options and allow for variations depending on the specific type of self-medication.",

The systematic dimension may involve education campaigns (especially important for youth to develop healthy habits) and providing economic incentives (via public health insurance options or potential subsidies offered for specific patients or diseases groups). One issue to address is the relatively undefined and unregulated position of family medicine in Central and Eastern European healthcare systems, which is especially true for the case of Romania [66, 67] . The gate-keeping role of family doctors is still weak, and there is a need for regaining trust for this primary healthcare link. One option to achieve this would be through improving communication and making the interaction less formal and bureaucratic. Technology can play a significant role in advancing progress in this area by facilitating the communication with family doctors via online options, formalizing digital medical prescription procedures (according to appropriate diagnosis protocols) and offering telemedicine options. The current COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this development by increasing the presence of telemedicine and by reinforcing the role of family doctors in the larger healthcare environment [67] . In summary, the long-term goal of a health policy addressing the selfmedication phenomena should be to create healthy habits around the use of medicine, which requires interventions targeting both individual and institutional factors supporting behavior change.",

In Appendix A (see Figures A1-A3) , we show the lines of best fit for each model, which imply that assumptions of linearity do not necessarily hold. This is highly relevant when discussing further mechanisms why the cognitive determinants of self-medication are not significant or actionable. Figure 1 shows that understanding risks and adverse effects decreases the inclination towards self-administration of anti-flu or cold medication, but only up to a point. After that threshold, the tendency starts to increase again. This may be because the perceived knowledge gave individuals a sense of self-efficacy (being aware of the risks in general) or because the risks were judged as trivial. This in turn may have increased a sense of security in taking unprescribed medicine. The graph suggests that assumptions of a linear relationship common in traditional statistics can be misleading. The underlying pattern if confirmed in larger studies has important policy implications: most of the campaigns are meant to raise awareness about the potential adverse effects of self-medication and provide information and knowledge about possible side-effects. However, according to Figure 1 , if the awareness regarding potential risks of self-medication increases, self-administration of drugs in the case of flu decreases up to a point and then increases again as individuals perceive to have more information. Hence, the paradox is that both no information on side-effects at all as well as perceptions to have adequate information can lead to increases in self-medication, challenging simple assumptions about the effectiveness of information campaigns.",

Figures A2  and A3 show that, as the information becomes richer, self-medication practice may increase again (yet does not reach the reported levels in the absence of information). Hence, there might be an optimal level of information. Table 2 shows that only habits and practices based on similarity are relevant in predicting self-medication. If we relied on these results only, we might conclude that there is no point in providing information to people.
