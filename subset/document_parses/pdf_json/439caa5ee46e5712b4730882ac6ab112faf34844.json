Since these reviews affect the buying decision of customers and control the success of the different e-commerce websites, the activity of fake reviews posting is more and more increasing. These fraudulent reviews are posted by a large number of spammers who try to promote or demote target products or companies. The reviewers spammers generally work collaboratively under group of spammers to take control of reviews given to some products, which seriously damage the review system. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel method aim to detect group spammers while relying on various group spamming behavioral indicators. Our approach is based on the K-nearest neighbors algorithm under the belief function theory to treat the uncertainty in the used behavioral indicators. Our method succeeds in distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent group of reviewers.

To increase their market share and to stay ahead of their competitors, companies and business try to over qualify their products by posting fake positive reviews, and even by posting fake negative reviews to damage their competitors' e-reputation. Those who post these fake reviews are called fake reviewers or review spammers, and the products being spammed are called target products.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "As the commercialization of these fraudulent activities, such spammers are organized to collaboratively write fake reviews in order magnify the effect of review manipulation. Such review group spammers are more frequently occurred to control the sentiment of the target products. They are even more harmful than individual review spammers' cause over their ability to deviate the overall rating in a short time interval and with different reviewers profiles to mislead spammer detection tools. The review spam detection issue attracts significant researchers during the last years. The main objective of these methods is to distinguish between fake and genuine reviews in order to protect ensure a safe environment and an equitable concurrence between companies. These research can be classified into three categories [11] ; review spam detection, review spammer detection and group spammer detection. Several approaches are based on the review spam text information as the semantic and linguistic aspects [7, 17] . Moreover, there are different methods which try to detect spammers through graph based aspects [1, 8, 23] . Others, detect spammers while relying on the spammers behavioral indicators [12, 15, 18] , and on the brust patterns as new indicators [9] . These approaches give significant results in the spam reviews detection field. Recently, there were increasingly research interests in group spamming detection aspects cause of their powerful manipulation thanks to their huge reviewers' members. The first study was introduced by Mukherjee et al. [14] , in which they rely on the Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) technique to generate candidate review spammers groups. This technique considers reviewers as items and products as transactions. Through the FIM technique and by initializing the minimum support count to 3, they can spot at least 2 reviewers, while each reviewer review at least 3 common products. Many techniques rely on these candidate groups and propose different computing frameworks to evaluate the suspicion of each candidate spammer groups. Such that, in [14] authors proposed an iterative computing GSRank to rank candidate groups which spots the relationship among candidate groups, target products and individual reviewers. Xu et al. [27] introduce a statistical model based on the EM algorithm to calculate the collusiveness of each group member from one FIM candidate group at least. Another proposed method in [24] relies on FIM method to capture bicliques or sub-bicliques candidates them check them to detect real collusion groups through group spam indicators. Moreover, Xu et al. [28] use FIM to find groups of reviewers who have reviewed various common products. They introduce a KNN-based method and a graph based classification method to predict the fake or not fake labels for each reviewer belonging to at least one FIM candidate group. They evaluated the effectiveness of the used group spammer indicators on a large Chinese review websites. The KNN-method proves its performance in this study. Some other recent works in this aspect do not rely on the FIM techniques such in [25] , where authors propose a top-down computing framework (GGSpam) to detect review spammer groups by exploiting the topological structure of the underlying reviewer graph. We can also cite [26] which propose an unsupervised approach named LDA-based group spamming detection in product reviews (GSLDA) which adapt Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in order to bound the closely related group spammers into small cluster of reviewers and extracts high suspicious reviewers groups from each LDA-clusters. These proposed methods achieve also significant results. The spam review detection issue can be considerate as one of the most uncertain challenging problem due to the ambiguity provided by the spammers and the group spammers to mislead the detection systems. Nevertheless, the previous proposed methods did not take into consideration the uncertain aspect while trying to detect group spammers. We think that ignoring such uncertainty may deeply affect the quality of detection. For these reasons, we propose a novel method aims to detect group spammers based on the FIM technique to generate candidate group and also on the different group spammer indicators, using the K-nearest neighbors' algorithm within the belief function theory. This theory has shown its robustness in this field through our previous methods which achieve significant results [2] [3] [4] . Furthermore, the use of the Evidential K-NN has been based on its robustness in the real world classification problems under uncertainty. We seek to involve imprecision in the Group spammers behaviors indicators which are considered as the fundamental interest in our approach since they are used as features for the Evidential K-NN. In such way, our method predicts the labels spammers or not spammers reviewers (belonging or not to the FIM candidate groups).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 818, "end": 822, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1009, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1013, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1114, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1117, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1121, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1204, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1208, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1212, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1262, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1566, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2088, "end": 2092, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2270, "end": 2274, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2449, "end": 2453, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2623, "end": 2627, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3125, "end": 3129, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3317, "end": 3321, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4482, "end": 4485, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 4486, "end": 4489, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 4490, "end": 4493, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This paper is structured as follows: In the first section, we present the basic concepts of the belief function theory and the Evidential K-nearest neighbors, then we elucidate the proposed method in Sect. 2.

We record at best an accuracy improvement over 10% in both YelpZip and YelpNYC data-sets compared to DGRS and over 7% compared to GSRank.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 635, "end": 639, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 803, "end": 810, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Experimental Results"}, {"text": "In this work, we tackle the group spammer review detection problem which become a real issue to the online rating systems and we propose a novel approach that aims to distinguish between the spammer and the innocent reviewers while taking into account the uncertainty in the different suspicious behavioral group spammer indicators.
