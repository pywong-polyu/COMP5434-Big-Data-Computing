It has also been found that people who exercise could present certain obsessive behaviors due to the cult to esthetic aspects that do not necessarily benefit their health [9] .

Since the development of body image constitutes one of the most important psychological experiences for the human being, associated with the quality of life [45] and human health [46] , there is a need to valid and reliable instruments for its assessment. For this reason, the present study analyzed the psychometric properties proposed by Solano-Pinto and Cano-Vindel [20] for the IMAGEN questionnaire. In addition, this study serves as a premise for future research on the study of instruments for measuring body image in populations with different personal and cultural factors. Finally, this instrument can be widely used for application in different areas of research such as, descriptive or intervention studies. ",
