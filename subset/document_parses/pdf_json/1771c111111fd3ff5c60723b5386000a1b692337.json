            "text": "Pharmaceutical sales representatives (PSRs) are one of the most frequently used drug information sources for physicians in both the United States and China. During face-to-face interactions, PSRs use various promotional strategies to impact the prescribing behavior. In the United States, PSRs provide physicians small gifts, free drug samples, and \"sincere friendships\", whereas in China, they played an indispensable role in medical corruption over the past three decades. To cope with the undue influence of PSRs, both these countries have taken positive but insufficient measures to eliminate the effect thus far. By comparing the strategies of American and Chinese PSRs, it was found that building a friendly personal relationship with physicians in a relatively closed private environment (such as physician's office) is a key factor to exert an individualized influence on physicians, even in different social backgrounds and healthcare contexts. Therefore, this essay suggests that it is necessary to limit the establishment of personal relationships and maintain a more professional interaction to reduce the personalized psychological and emotional influences on physicians' professional judgment. To achieve this goal, it is proposed to transfer the physician-PSR interaction to a professional public space as a supplement to current countermeasures and suggestions. The presence of others and the possibility of third party participation will stimulate more ethical and reputational concerns. It is hoped that the increased transparency of the interaction will promote participants to consider more professional norms and mitigate the undue influence of PSRs' individualized strategies.",

Compared to other information resources like magazines, journals, or websites, one of the advantages of interacting with PSRs is the convenience of acquiring drug information [30, 66, 87, 96, 97] . Physicians do not need to wade through mountains of literature in their busy schedules as research evidence on drugs will be presented to them during the meeting with PSRs, and conversation makes it easier to remember key information [87] . Drug detailing by PSRs is an effective way to spread information especially when new drugs come to market [2] , and physicians' questions and needs can be fed back to pharmaceutical companies easily and directly. If the interactions take place within a professional context and physicians can get more accurate and fair information so that their prescribing behavior can be improved, the PSRs' visits would be welcomed [36] . The fact is, however, that PSRs always try to exert undue influence on prescribing by marketing tricks rather than simply providing education and information [33, 93, 94] .",

Nonetheless, these efforts have not stopped PSRs from using promotional strategies for commercial purposes during their interactions with medical professionals. Then, in different social/cultural backgrounds and healthcare environments in the United States and China, what strategies have PSRs adopted? What influence have they had on prescribing behavior? Are there universal strategies that work in different environments? What are the main current interventions in these two countries? What are the achievements and shortcomings? Are there any other promising measures? This essay will attempt to address these questions by comparing the situation in the United States and China, then put forward a theoretical proposal of a public space for the interaction between physicians and PSRs as a supplement to the current coping measures.",

A study suggested that physicians' confidence was due to psychological dynamics, that is, the relationship with PSRs encouraged them to use a variety of denials and rationalizations to resolve their \"cognitive dissonance\"( which means they recognize the conflicts of interest but still welcome the interactions) [17] . From another perspective, the influence of PSRs is imperceptible, as small gifts and free lunches are considered out of kindness and friendship rather than a bribe to the physicians. Free drug samples are more ethically acceptable for the sake of patients' interest [83, 65, 23] . PSRs use their carefully designed topics and gifts as a bond to maintain the relationship with physicians, creating a kind of \"obligation\" to encourage them to respond to their \"friendship\" through prescriptions [98] .",

According to the Open Payments Data of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the pharmaceutical industry made payments to about 627,000 physicians totaling over 9.35 billion U.S. dollars for speaker and/or consulting fees or for the cumulative value of ownership interests in 2018 [98] . The selected physicians would be paid at least 500 dollars just for one-hour \"Lunch and Learn\" talks at local physicians' offices, and an additional \"honorarium\" if they could drive or fly to some other cities [13] . The payments impacted physicians' behaviors especially along with PSRs' psychological tricks. When recruiting KOLs, PSRs will praise the target physician's expertise in the field and their superior competence and reputation as a speaker, express their eagerness in offering the invitation through the attitude and content of the conversation, as well as an impressive payment commitment. Physicians will feel fully respected, valued, and well treated, therefore psychologically satisfied (and uncritical) to an extent. The invitation will become \"hard to refuse\" [13] . Meanwhile, PSRs will lead the speakers to believe that the purpose of the lectures is to provide useful information and assistance for other physicians to serve more patients [108] , thereby eliminating the obvious conflict of interest in the invitation and promoting speakers to accept payments more easily without concerns [32] . Before giving a speech, the KOL often does not have enough time and resources to conduct adequate independent research on the drug, therefore the PSRs provide all the information, data, cases, and even the slides required. All of these can seem to be scientifically valid but chosen and framed with marketing goals, the scientific evidence will more likely benefit commercial interests rather than patient interests.

The fact that KOLs tend to be high prescribers proves that they are always the first \"true believers\" of their lectures [33] . During the presentation, many KOLs use the strategies with which they were trained by pharmaceutical companies to make themselves more convincing [74] . On the one hand, it is based on a normal psychological expectation that speakers usually want more recognition and agreement. On the other hand, when a KOL receives a payment from the company, an obligation has been created. Protecting the reputation of the drug, as well as their own, has become an underlying duty of the presentation. When faced with doubts from the audience, KOLs will subconsciously defend their point of view through all the favorable evidence they have. For instance, there will always be some adverse effects of new drugs reported for unknown reasons in the first years of use. Before the relationship between these effects and the drug is confirmed, as a professional, physicians should pay more attention to the uncertain risk that may harm their patients and be more cautious about the drug, while as a KOL, they can always find some arguments to defend the continued use of that drug [13] . In other words, during the process of the so-called education, the professionalism of KOLs has been seriously impacted, as they are more on the side of drug companies than patients. Furthermore, for the audience, as the information provider is an expert, the herd mentality and trust in expertise will more or less affect their judgment of the drug [77] .",

Before the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy in 1978, China was relatively closed under the planned economy. All medical resources and health service facilities were run entirely by the state and there was a serious shortage of medicines and medical technologies, with few imported drugs for treatment [49, 16] . After nearly 10 years of economic reform, western drugs and pharmaceutical companies gradually entered the Chinese market. In 1985, Janssen Pharmaceutical set up a joint venture with a local Chinese pharmaceutical company to bring the model of PSR to China for the first time, training the first batch of Chinese PSRs according to the American experience [116] . The emergence of PSRs catered to the huge market demand. They brought advanced western drug information and treatment methods to hospitals and physicians, playing a positive role in education in the first few years [116, 111] . Since the 1990s, China's pharmaceutical market has grown rapidly, with a sharp increase in the number of both local pharmaceutical companies and PSRs in a short time. The role of PSRs, however, shifted from educators to salespersons.",

They maintain frequent personal interactions with their clients, often sending greetings to physicians at 7:30 a.m. in the morning and \"clock in\" at the hospital with breakfast for physicians at 8:00 a.m. At festivals and holidays, PSRs gift physicians concert tickets or top-quality tea in the name of \"appreciation for friendship\" or \"maintaining the relationship\". When physicians' children get married, PSRs also attend the weddings with nice gifts [116, 111, 119] .

A PSR said, Actually, not providing kickbacks or maintaining the relationships will be OK if your drug is irreplaceable. But most drugs are facing competition. For example, norfloxacin. There are more than 340 companies producing this medicine in our country. Not much difference in quality between these drugs. Why should the hospitals stock your drug? Why should the physicians prescribe your drug? [116] Indeed, this \"sales with kickbacks\" model is often used not only by small companies without competitive products but also by many large companies. From 2016 to 2019, more than half of the top 100 pharmaceutical companies in China provided kickbacks directly or indirectly [70] .",

For instance, some PSRs provide physicians with transportation services, pay the bill when physicians entertain their guests, offer assistance when physicians want their children to get into a better school or go abroad, or even hire nannies for their families [119, 70, 20] . A director of a municipal hospital was bribed by selling two properties under his name to a PSR for 64% and 28% above market prices.

Therefore, trying to manipulate prescriptions directly would be very unwise and the marketing goals of PSRs need to be well disguised. The industry was keenly aware that physicians are feeling overworked, overwhelmed with information and paperwork, and underappreciated [33] . A \"feel-good economy\" has been created through small gifts, free lunch, respect, and sympathy. Physicians would receive respite and feel understood during the meeting with PSRs, if only for a moment, and that is when they are susceptible to influence [108, 10] . From the first day of medical school to the last days before retirement, physicians are immersed in this culture [26, 45] . They are used to receiving gifts and payments for conferences or lectures, rationalizing them as an entitlement of their careers [53] . While carefully maintaining physicians' confidence in resisting the influence, PSRs are realistically increasing the rate of prescribing [24, 21] , the number of prescriptions and daily doses [66] , the market size [47] , etc.",

Since physicians' professional labor has not been fully valued [126, 12] , the labor fee for diagnosis and treatment is low, so drug sales 1 have become an important way for physicians and their hospitals to make a profit [4, 7, 127] . Overprescribing behaviors are encouraged by economic incentives [15, 43, 71, 120, 123] . A partnership based on common interests forged [122] . Physicians are more the agents for hospitals rather than for their patients [68] . Even so, the average salary level of physicians is still not high. They are overworked but underpaid, thus, this perverse economic incentive may have directly eroded their ethics [68, 48] , and the urgent need to increase income may have crowded out their concerns for other important aspects such as professionalism.

Neither inspiring physicians' reciprocity motivations, nor encouraging them to receive bribes can be achieved by simply providing drug information. Often, PSRs fully show their respect, understanding, and sympathy for the physicians personally rather than in general, with all the gifts, free meals and personal topics representing the medium for expressing those feelings. Their relationship would gradually shift from \"salesperson/educator/information provider and medical professional\" to \"friends\". After that, more psychological tricks or financial incentives would come into play. Just like a PSR said, \"I rely on making a strong personal connection to those docs, something to make me stand out from the crowd.\" [33] ",

For a very long time, some people held similar views, but at least so far, they have been proven mistaken [54, 10] . The public seems to have got used to the fact that physicians have long accepted gifts and payments from industry. People felt it was \"less wrong\" for physicians to accept gifts from PSRs than it was for judges from lawyers and sports referees from players [41] . Quite a few patients believed that surgeons would make the best choices for their health regardless of financial relationship with industry, and the interactions between surgeons and device manufacturers would improve their care or not be affected [28] .",

Over the next few years, several states enacted statutes to further limit industry gifts. For example, Minnesota prohibits gifts with a total annual combined retail value of over 50 dollars since 2006 [34] . In 2009, Massachusetts issued regulations including a ban on all gifts except for modest meals in the provider's practice setting, drug samples, and indirect support for educational programs [85] .

Since 2000, China began to implement the centralized drug bidding and procurement system in public medical institutions [75] . Specifically, the government selected the highest therapeutic and cost-efficient drugs, and created the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) [101] . Generally, only the drugs on the NRDL are allowed to be prescribed in public hospitals (a very small number of offlist drugs may be prescribed under certain circumstances). Then, the government, instead of hospitals, took the responsibility to negotiate drug prices through bidding and purchase drugs from pharmaceutical companies directly. Hospitals chose the specific drugs they needed from the NRDL and regularly reported those needs to the government. In the last 20 years, this system has been constantly adjusted and improved. Since 2017, the national government has published several policies based on the previous system, including the \"two-invoice system\" 2 [79] and \"4 + 7 purchase with quantity\" 3 [38, 118] . The former aimed to reduce intermediaries between hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, compress the gap between the ex-factory and retail price which agents and PSRs could use to make profits. The latter was to integrate public hospitals' drug demands in exchange for drug price reductions. Only brand-name drugs and domestic generics that have passed consistency evaluations of their quality and efficacy were eligible for bidding. This policy was designed to increase the market share of high-quality drugs and encourage drug research and development by local pharmaceutical companies, which were expected to improve the situation wherein low-quality domestic generics flooded the market and vicious competition was maximized by PSRs through bribery.",

First, these health policies shifted purchasing power from public hospitals to the government, which determined the scope and price of drug procurements. The activity space of PSRs and prescribing rights of physicians have been limited externally, meanwhile, the decrease in drug revenue placed financial strain on hospitals directly, hence, physicians' salaries and supplementary income were cut. These policies not only harmed the vested interests of participants in the short term, but also made no promise of reasonable compensation in the long term and failed to stimulate their internal motivation to restrain their behaviors. Second, although drug procurement is dominated by the government, public hospitals still have the right to decide which specific drugs to purchase. Once a drug gets on the NRDL, the next step is to encourage the hospitals and physicians to procure and prescribe wisely. Hospital managers and physicians are still the primary targets of PSRs. Perhaps because of behavioral inertia, at least so far, there has been no significant change in PSRs' strategies. Third, strict regulations by some local governments that limited PSRs' access to hospitals, or contact with physicians, have not been well implemented, and the positive effect is currently limited [116, 70] . Nonetheless, if they work well in the future, PSRs as an information channel will also be blocked.",

First, could a radical solution, prohibiting all physician-PSR interactions, be achieved? In the short term, the answer seems to be no. In the United States, drug detailing as a kind of promotion is perfectly legal as long as the information is scientifically accurate and fair and presented appropriately. Commercial speech is protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution [55] . While many studies have shown the negative influences of PSRs on prescribing behavior [113, 21, 29] , the evidence on the outcomes at the health system level regarding overall costs and quality of care is insufficient [59] . In China, the 2015 revision of the \"Classification of Occupations of PRC\" first defined the PSR as a formal occupation [35] . This official definition confirmed the legitimacy of PSR as an occupation and justified their interactions with physicians as educators and information providers. Moreover, studies suggested that PSRs played a positive role in information spreading especially when new drugs launched [87, 105] . Without a lengthy and enormous fight against the pharmaceutical industry, it is not likely to impose a complete ban on physician-PSR interactions.",

PSRs in the United States and China use different promotion strategies according to physicians' different needs and situations in different social backgrounds but always seek to build a personal relationship with physicians in their interactions. In other words, the establishment of personal relationship is an important factor of the strategies which make undue influences on physicians, even in different contexts. In this case, I argue that adjusting how physician-PSR interact, more precisely, limiting the establishment of a personal relationship, could be helpful to mitigate PSRs' undue influence, as a supplementary measure especially before the effects of long-term measures such as education and virtue cultivation became evident.",

However, the problem is that, except for drug information, PSRs' speaking strategies and psychological tricks are also customized. Physicians often meet with PSRs in their office, which is a relatively closed and private space. In a one-to-one environment, PSRs always try to portray themselves as a \"friend\" rather than a scheming salesperson [93, 33] , and bridging the psychological distance with physicians by talking about some designed personal topics, providing small gifts, or having lunch together [91] . As a former PSR stated: I frame everything as a gesture of friendship. I give them free samples not because it's my job, but because I like them so much. I provide office lunches because visiting them is such a pleasant relief from all the other docs. My drugs rarely get mentioned by me during our dinners. [33] The \"likes\" and gifts increase their emotional connection [93] , making physicians feel an \"obligation\" of reciprocity insensibly [54] . In the Chinese context, this closed space once provided an unsupervised \"dark room\" for briberies.",

China has taken a much tougher approach. In some cities, PSRs are only permitted to visit at fixed times and places (such as hospital conference rooms), received by hospital designated personnel, and their conversations must be recorded [107, 100] . The interactions are strictly supervised and managed under such conditions. However, as physicians cannot arrange the meeting with PSRs freely according to their own drug information needs, the convenience of this information resource is greatly reduced. My suggestion lies somewhere between these measures, seeking more transparency and openness in their interactions to limit the establishment of a personal relationship while keeping PSRs as a convenient information resource as much as possible.",

To be specific, this proposal is to transfer physician-PSR meetings from a private environment to a public space, break the original dual structures of their interaction, expose the interaction process and details, and open the conversation to others. The physician and the PSR are not the only participants, their conversations will be listened to, their actions will be watched, and their interactions will be joined by others. Social psychological research has proved that the presence of others increases physiological arousal on performance [125] , creating apprehension about being evaluated [19] .

In the specific scenario of the physician-PSR interaction, the \"officially accredited values\" undoubtedly include the expectation for physicians, as professionals, to maintain professionalism and resist commercial influences, since the goal of their meeting is supposed to be the better use of drugs and patients' benefit rather than the gifts and free lunch. In this case, it is inappropriate for physicians to interact with PSRs as \"friends\" or involve too many personal topics in the meeting. To protect the professional image and reputation, physicians will be more motivated to consider more professional norms and avoid conflicts of interest [95] . With this reduction in personal connections, the methods that physicians use to manage their cognitive dissonance, including denying, ignoring, and rationalizing conflicts of interest, may also be weakened, thereby motivating physicians to re-examine their interactions more critically.",

To avoid being counterproductive, focusing the conversation more on the drugs than physicians as individuals would be a smart move. On the other hand, participants may differ in their attitude toward a specific drug and the degree of familiarity with the drug information. Ambiguous statements are likely to be pursued or cause critical discontent. Exaggerating advantages or covering up weaknesses may lead to a greater risk of loss of trust. The assessment of speaking strategies and benefits appear to be more complex and uncertain than in a private environment. In this situation, the motivation to maintain a public image and increasing credibility may stimulate PSRs to adopt more conservative strategies when they are giving speeches.",

Indeed, this proposal is more about the possibility of the transformation of the physician-PSR interaction model at a theoretical level, although my hope is that it could be concretely implemented. Due to an absence of empirical data, we cannot assert that this suggestion will have advantages or disadvantages in terms of economic costs, time costs, information transparency, or the impact on prescribing behavior. Nonetheless, people are always averse to being viewed as biased. With the commitment to put the interests of patients first, physicians have more reason to protect and demonstrate their professional independence to the public. If they truly believe that their interactions with PSRs are appropriate and they are not unduly influenced, then disclosing the interactions in a public space voluntarily rather than hiding in the corner would be helpful to prove their claim and improve public trust.",

The public space can also be a virtual space, such as multiparty video conferencing or remote interaction platform. Indeed, interacting with physicians electronically is not new as e-detailing occurred as early as 20 years ago [8] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, video conferencing has been more widely used, and e-detailing has been accepted by more health professionals and pharmaceutical companies [46, 57] . Similar to office visits, current e-detailing is mainly via video conferencing between a physician and a PSR. With the support of technology in the future, if e-detailing can be performed on an open platform and allow other users to join in, this would be a great form to realize the proposal of a professional public space.",

The proposal of professional public space does not mean to place barriers for physicians to access drug information from PSRs; rather, the goal is to reduce the influence of non-professional factors and improve the transparency of information through the psychological influence caused by the presence of others in public interactions. Although even in a public space, there is no guarantee that every physician-PSR interaction will involve other participants, as long as the interaction is public, it means that other people may notice or join them at any time. Compared with a physician's office, a relatively open professional environment, where colleagues or patients may appear at any time, is more likely to remind the interactors to be vigilant.

If their interactions can be transferred from the current closed private space to a relatively open professional public space, the presence of others and the possibility of more relevant subjects participating may simulate more ethical and reputational concerns, motivating physicians to consider more professional norms and maintain the interaction in a professional field. The restriction on personal relationships will weaken the power of PSRs' psychological tricks. Accepting conflicts of interest as a professional will face a greater ethical challenge than accepting gifts from friends as individuals. Meanwhile, exposing the interaction will also be helpful to increase transparency and public trust.",
