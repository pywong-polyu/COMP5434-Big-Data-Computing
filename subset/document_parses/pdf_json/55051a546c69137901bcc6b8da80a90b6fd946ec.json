Here, we report the binding of well-known antibiotic sulfonamide drugs (sulfamethazine, SMZ; and sulfadiazine, SDZ) with heme protein myoglobin (Mb) using spectroscopic, calorimetric, \u03b6 potential, and computational methods. Formation of a 1:1 complex between the ligand and Mb through well-defined equilibrium was observed. The binding constants obtained between Mb and SMZ/ SDZ drugs were on the order of 10 4 M \u22121 . SMZ with two additional methyl (\u2212CH 3 ) substitutions has higher affinity than SDZ. Upon drug binding, a notable loss in the helicity (via circular dichroism) and perturbation of the three-dimensional (3D) protein structure (via infrared and synchronous fluorescence experiments) were observed. The binding also indicated the dominance of nonpolyelectrolytic forces between the amino acid residues of the protein and the drugs. The ligand\u2212protein binding distance signified high probability of energy transfer between them. Destabilization of the protein structure upon binding was evident from differential scanning calorimetry results and \u03b6 potential analyses. Molecular docking presented the best probable binding sites of the drugs inside protein pockets. Thus, the present study explores the potential binding characteristics of two sulfonamide drugs (with different substitutions) with myoglobin, correlating the structural and energetic aspects.

So, antibiotic drugs when found irregularly in the environment can be hazardous to our condition and to human health because of their toxic and cancer-causing properties. Therefore, it is important to evaluate their binding to proteins, to exploit their utility, and furthermore to comprehend and understand their toxic and poisonous impact. Several researchers have focused on understanding the mechanisms of drug\u2212protein interaction from various aspects to model molecular recognition. 14\u221217 Development in structural biology and biophysical chemistry has showed that despite the availability of structural data, it is significant to predict the mechanism of molecular recognition.

Mb ( Figure 1C ) is a single-polypeptide globular heme protein consisting of \u223c150 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 16.5 kDa. The tertiary structure of Mb is composed of eight separate right-handed \u03b1-helices connected by short nonhelical regions. 17, 18 The helices provide a rigid structural framework to the heme pocket. Mb is a useful molecular biomarker for advanced assessment of ill health such as severe myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. 19, 20 When the muscle tissues are damaged, Mb moves to the bloodstream, which further increases the level of Mb, converting it into an undesired toxic molecule that may in turn lead to various serious cases like kidney failure. 21 However, during the transient decrease in the blood O 2 level, a high concentration of Mb allows organisms to hold their breath longer by supplying O 2 to the organism. The main function of Mb succeeds only after receiving oxygen from red blood cells (hemoglobin (Hb)), transporting it to the mitochondria of the red muscle cells to produce energy. 22, 23 The previous study presents the interaction pattern of the drug with Hb; this work describes further the binding of the drugs with heme protein Mb. 24 There are several reports on the interaction study of Mb with antibiotic drugs such as ciprofloxacin, promazine, amoxicillin, aspirin, sodium penicillin, sodium cloxacillin, and sodium dicloxacillin. 25\u221227 However, its interaction study with sulfonamide group drugs is not known yet; hence, this directed us to study the undiscovered heme protein\u2212sulfonamide drug interaction.",

Advancement in the field of molecular biology and biochemistry research provides overview information on the functional and molecular effects of the individual protein. 28 Protein\u2212small molecule binding interaction studies are vital for understanding their biological processes at the molecular level affecting the absorption, disposition, cellular uptake, and activity of the drug in the cardiovascular framework. 29, 30 After drug\u2212protein binding, just a couple of few unbound small molecules are able to pass through the membrane bar and be used in body metabolism. Thus, drug association with other compounds at the molecular level can determine its pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) and pharmacodynamics (effect) in the circulatory system. 31 In this work, drug\u2212protein binding of SMZ/SDZ and Mb is performed and elucidated through various biophysical tools, e.g., spectroscopic (UV\u2212vis, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), and Fourier transform infrared), calorimetric (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)), \u03b6 potential, and computational (density functional theory (DFT) and molecular docking) methods. The binding constants, stoichiometry values, and thermodynamic parameters have been elucidated in detail. Conformational changes of the 3D protein structure and probable binding sites of the ligands are also reported. Thus, the present study provides a comparative understanding of the interaction between the antibiotic drug SMZ/SDZ (which differ from each other in \u2212CH 3 substitutions) and the globular protein Mb at the molecular level. Thus, this research describes the variable binding affinity of sulfa molecules with different substitutions quantitatively. The structural effect of the organic molecule on its binding properties is hence collated.",

UV\u2212vis spectroscopy is an efficient and powerful method used for determining the complex formation in drug\u2212protein interaction studies. 32, 33 The absorption spectra of Mb revealed two prominent peaks at 280 and 409 nm (Figure 2A,B) . The weaker band in the near-UV zone with a maximum at 280 nm was due to the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0* transition of the aromatic rings in the amino acid residues (for tyrosine and tryptophan (Trp)), and the latter most extreme wavelength at 409 nm was due to the heme or the porphyrin Soret band. 34 The peak at 280 nm increased with increasing concentration of both drugs with a hyperchromic blue shift along the tryptophan and tyrosine residues. The increase in the peak was due to the dominant concentration of the drug (\u03bb max of SMZ at 260 nm and \u03bb max of SDZ at 255 nm), which is in agreement with or almost in the same range as that of the 280 nm peak arising from the aromatic rings in the amino acid residues. Upon titration, the spectra increased due to the concentration effect of the drug and shifted toward the absorbance maximum of the drug and hence toward a shorter wavelength, giving rise to a prominent blue shift. The Soret band region of Mb at 409 nm (inset peaks) showed a gradual decrease with increasing concentration of the drugs. Isosbestic points at 360 nm for SMZ\u2212Mb and 370 nm for SDZ\u2212Mb complexes obtained in the spectra indicate equilibrium between the free and bound drugs with Mb. The significant decrease in the Soret band region and isosbestic point in the spectra revealed binding and complex formation between the protein, Mb, and the drugs (SMZ, SDZ). 35 Thus, the overall spectral analysis can be concluded as a state of penetration of the drugs into the protein molecule, resulting in complex formation restricting the mobility of the ligand. However, not many changes were observed in the Soret band region at 409 nm so the binding parameters were not evaluated from the UV\u2212vis absorption experiments.",

            "text": "Steady-State Fluorescence Spectral Study. Fluorescence spectroscopy is an important and useful technique for determining drug\u2212protein interaction and providing information about drug association to proteins. 36, 37 Various binding mechanism details on the binding site, binding affinity, and structural and conformational adaptations can be studied from fluorescence spectrophotometry studies. 38\u221240 For the binding study of Mb with SMZ and SDZ, the excitation wavelength was examined at 295 nm, which selectively excites the emission maxima at 337 nm. The intrinsic fluorescence is mainly due to tyrosine (Tyr103, Tyr143, Tyr151) and tryptophan (Trp7, Trp14) residues present in Mb, which are subtle for the change in its microenvironment. Both Trp and Tyr excite at 280 nm wavelength; however, among all of the fluorophore amino acid residues in the protein, Trp remains the dominant intrinsic fluorophore and absorbs 5 times more than the Tyr residue at 280 nm wavelength. 41, 42 So, to excite the Trp residue specifically, the protein was excited at 295 nm, which absorbs 30 times more than that of the Tyr residue. Both SMZ and SDZ exhibited strong quenching of the fluorophore molecule, and the spectral changes are illustrated in Figure 3A ,B. With an increase in the concentration of the drugs, a gradual quenching decrease (hypochromic shift) with a slight red bathochromic shift was observed in the spectra for both cases. In the case of SMZ, a shift in the peak by 5\u22126 nm was observed, while for SDZ, the shift of the bathochromic peak was 4 nm, signifying changes in the polarity or an increase in the polarity around the Trp moiety upon titration with the drugs. The results from the spectra show that the hypochromic red shift was due to the nonradiative interaction of the specific complex formed. The spectra were further analyzed, and the quenching constant was obtained from the Stern\u2212Volmer plot (eq 1). ) where F 0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher, K q is the quenching rate constant, K sv is the Stern\u2212Volmer quenching constant, \u03c4 o is the average fluorescence lifetime, and [Q] is the concentration of the quencher (SMZ or SDZ here). The values obtained from both the quenching data were found to be 2.4 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 for the SMZ\u2212Mb complex and 1.9 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 for the SDZ\u2212Mb complex, respectively. The quenching constant for the SMZ\u2212 Mb complex was found to be comparatively higher as compared to that for the SDZ\u2212Mb complex. To further support the fluorimetric titration data, the following calorimetric experiments have been carried out. pH-Dependent Fluorescence Study. Ionizable amino acid residues in protein play a major role in the function, stability, and solubility of a protein determined by their net charges, which influence the binding of proteins to other small molecules. 43 The stability of a protein depending on its pH condition is controlled by a change in the ionization state of the protein residues. 44 Therefore, the nature of interaction or binding between the ligand and the protein may depend on the pH of the medium. The influence of pH on the binding of SMZ/SDZ with Mb was investigated using steady-state fluorescence studies by exciting the protein at 295 nm in the presence of the SMZ or SDZ drug at different pH levels\ue0d55.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively; the pH ranges selected were slightly above and below the pI of the protein. 45 The data obtained from Stern\u2212Volmer plots are presented in Table 1 .",

The energy transfer between Mb and SMZ or SDZ was determined using the FRET technique. FRET is a physical phenomenon whereby the donor fluorophore in its excitation state excites energy nonradiatively to the acceptor molecule, causing the acceptor fluorophore to emit its characteristic fluorescence. 55 Energy transfer takes place when the emission spectrum (donor) overlaps the (acceptor) absorption band ( Figure 5 ). FRET is highly delicate to the distance of the transition dipole between the donor and acceptor molecules, which is within the 2\u22128 nm range. This technique is dependent on the reciprocal of the sixth power of the distance between Mb and SMZ/SDZ (r) and the Forster radius (R 0 ), which is the energy transfer distance at 50% efficacy. The intrinsic fluorescence of Mb is caused by two Trp residues (Trp14 and Trp7), located in the \u03b1-helix A, one of which (Trp7) is exposed to the solvent, while the other (Trp14) is in the hydrophobic matrix of the protein. 56\u221258 The interaction of Mb with SMZ/SDZ was studied by selectively quenching the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein [tryptophan (Trp) residues] at 295 nm wavelength.",

The greater shift in the SMZ\u2212Mb binding may be due to better quenching affinity than that of SDZ\u2212Mb binding as reported from the quenching experiment data.",

Protein structures are best determined in the far-UV region (190\u2212250 nm) of spectra. To reveal the secondary structure of proteins, the required characteristic for the \u03b1-helix unit is the excitation-state coupling of \u03c0\u2212\u03c0* transition, forming a perpendicular positive \u03c0\u2212\u03c0* transition at 192 nm and also leading to negative transitions of \u03c0\u2212\u03c0* and n\u2212\u03c0* at 208 and 222 nm parallel to each other, respectively. 64, 65 However, the complication in determining the quantitative estimation of \u03b2-sheet is due to the massive design and spectral varieties of \u03b2-sheet structures. 66 To understand the effect of antibiotics (SMZ/SDZ) on Mb, CD analysis of the far-UV region was carried out. The structural information associated with binding can be demonstrated by circular dichroism. Figure 6A ,B shows the spectra of SMZ\u2212Mb and SDZ\u2212Mb complexes, respectively. A negative \u03c0\u2212\u03c0* transition at 212 nm parallel to n\u2212\u03c0* transition at 222 nm signifies the \u03b1-helical structure of Mb. Upon binding with SMZ and SDZ, the intensity decreased with increasing concentrations with no shift in the peak, signifying loss in \u03b1helicity and suggesting changes in the secondary structure of the protein (Mb). However, the antibiotics are CD-inactive and do not exhibit any spectra. The \u03b1-helix contents of free and SMZ/SDZ-bound Mb were calculated in terms of the molar residual ellipticity (MRE) values at 222 nm using the following equation. 67, 68 n l C MRE 10",

However, three different physiological conformations of myoglobin, namely, deoxymyoglobin, oxymyoglobin, and metmyoglobin (ferrimyoglobin) can give different percentages of 55\u221280% under neutral and mildly acidic conditions. 69\u221271 The secondary structure (\u03b1-helix) content of Mb was found to be 66.66% at 222 nm. However, after the saturation point of the protein treated with 26 \u03bcM SMZ/SDZ, the loss of \u03b1helicity for the bound SMZ\u2212Mb complex reduced to 19.53% at 222 nm. However, for the bound SDZ\u2212Mb complex, it decreased to 4.44% at 222 nm. Thus, the reduced percentage for both the complexes denotes unfolding and loss of the secondary structure of the protein molecule. The greater loss of the \u03b1-helix structure in the case of the SMZ\u2212Mb complex as compared to that of the SDZ\u2212Mb complex may be due to the better binding affinity for SMZ of Mb. The change in the Soret CD band region of Mb was analyzed by taking the spectra ranging from 350 to 500 nm. This region was studied to measure the change in the heme group present in the protein and the aromatic side chains with the drugs. The spectra presented in Figure 6C ,D showed a positive peak at around 400 nm, which arises due to the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0* transition of the porphyrin ring and those of the aromatic side chains. 72, 73 Upon binding with the drugs at different concentrations, there was a gradual decrease in the peak signifying the change in the planarity of the porphyrin ring, which shifted toward a longer wavelength (red shift) for the SMZ\u2212Mb complex and toward a shorter wavelength (blue shift) for the SDZ\u2212Mb complex. This indicates changes in the microenvironment of the porphyrin region of the protein; the red shift may be due to the folding/aggregation of the peptide membranes of the protein upon binding with the SMZ drug, while the blue shift suggests changes in the steric pattern or denaturation of Mb with heme being more exposed to the solvent than in the native structure. 74, 75 IR Spectroscopy Study. Infrared spectroscopy studies the measurement of vibrations of the atom. The vibrational transition in the molecule is caused by the absorption of infrared radiation.

The association constant or binding constant, also known as equilibrium constant, which is the measure of binding affinity between the protein and the drug molecules at equilibrium, was measured. It is associated with the binding and unbinding reactions of the protein (P) and drug (D) molecules, P + D \u21cc PD. The values obtained for binding affinity (K) between the protein (Mb) and the drugs (SMZ and SDZ) from the experiment at 298 K are 5.36 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 for the SMZ\u2212Mb complex and 3.23 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 for the SDZ\u2212Mb complex, slightly higher for SMZ than that for SDZ, in accordance with the spectroscopic data. This confirms the stronger structural perturbation of the protein structure with SMZ upon binding as compared to that with SDZ and their effect on the stability of the complexes as reported from the above studies.",

Partial ionization of various amino acids contributes to the surface charge of protein molecules. 89 The study of charge distribution by the \u03b6 potential method provides knowledge about the overall surface charge information of the protein particle and changes in the surface potential of the complex after adding the drug. The myoglobin molecule had a negative \u03b6 potential charge of \u22125.0 mV; however, after addition of the antibiotic drug molecules, the net negative charge changed to \u22123.3 mV for the SMZ\u2212Mb complex and \u22123.6 mV for the SDZ\u2212Mb complex (Figure 9 ). The low charge obtained for the protein molecule may be because of the existence of the proteins in their aggregation form. 90 However, after binding, there is coagulation of the drug and the protein, and the changes in charge signify the interaction between them. These results suggest structural modifications along with alteration of the \u03b6 potential value after the complex formation, which are in agreement with the CD and IR spectroscopy results. 91 Computational Methods. DFT Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital\u2212Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO\u2212LUMO) Study. DFT is a computational quantum\u2212 mechanical modeling method useful for determining electronic structure, electronic transition, etc. 92 The HOMO\u2212LUMO energy gap signifies the compound stability index and its chemical activities and bioactive properties. The higher energy value of HOMO (SMZ = \u22126.179 eV, SDZ = \u22126.21018 eV) is associated with the electron-donating ability and is related to the ionization potential of the molecule, whereas the lower LUMO (SMZ = \u22121.193 eV, SDZ = \u22121.147 eV) energy is directly related to the electron affinity and its ability to accept electrons. 93 Figure 10 shows the electronic excitation of the optimized ground and excited states of the antibiotic drugs, SMZ and SDZ. SMZ and SDZ show similar kinds (values) of HOMO\u2212LUMO energy gaps, slightly lower for SMZ (\u0394E = 4.98 eV) than that for SDZ (\u0394E = 5.06 eV). The lower energy gap for SMZ denotes better stability of the molecule with better bioactive properties. Thus, we can conclude that SMZ is a better antibiotic drug than SDZ. However, the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO for both the drugs (SMZ and SDZ) indicates that they are capable of binding to biomacromolecules. These results support the above experimental data (spectroscopy, calorimetry, etc.), wherein successful protein\u2212ligand interactions have been elucidated.",

The non-polyelectrolytic (\u0394G t 0 ) components were calculated from the difference between \u0394G 0 and \u0394G pe 0 . The \u0394G t 0 values at 10, 20, and 50 mM salt concentrations were found to be \u22124.79, \u22124.88, and \u22124.8 kcal/ mol and \u22124.75, \u22124.77, and 4.75 kcal/mol for SMZ\u2212Mb and SDZ\u2212Mb complexes, respectively. The higher values for \u0394G t 0 than \u0394G pe 0 show that the non-polyelectrolytic interactions like hydrophobic, van der Waals, H-bonding, etc. dominate the binding process between the amino acids of the protein and the drugs and remain almost invariant at all salt concentrations.",
