Furthermore, to verify whether the quality requirement of aPDT-treated plasma is acceptable, the differences of the levels of clotting factors, total plasma proteins, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies titrations in plasma of patient before and after aPDT treatment were investigated. Materials and Methods: Cur@PLGA-NPs was synthesized using Electrospinning process and characterized by different analysis including Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy assays. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the plasma samples of patients suspected of having COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Then, the treated plasma samples with Cur@PLGA-NPs plus blue laser were exposed to Vero cells. Eventually, cell cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects of treated Vero cells were evaluated. Levels of clotting factors including prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), total plasma proteins, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies measurements were performed using the coagulometer, method of Bradford, and titration procedure, respectively. Results: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 84.3 % of samples. Different concentrations of Cur@PLGA-NPs (3, 5, 7, and 10 % wt.), the irradiation times of blue laser (1, 3, and 5 min), and aPDT with the maximum dosed of blue laser light (522.8 J/cm 2 ) plus 10 % wt. Cur@PLGA-NPs had no cytotoxicity. Although there were significant cell degradation and apoptotic effects in treated Vero cells with treated plasma using 10 % wt. Cur@PLGA-NPs, and a blue laser at an energy density of 522.8 J/cm 2 , no visible changes in cells and apoptosis were observed following aPDT. Total plasma protein content, PT, APTT, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies titers showed no significant changes (P > 0.05 for all comparisons) in treated plasma as compared to untreated plasma. Conclusion: aPDT exhibited in vitro anti-COVID-19 activities in the treated plasma containing SARS-COV-2 without Vero cell apoptosis and any adverse effects on plasma quality in aPDT-exposed plasma.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by a new strain of coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. It has since rapidly spread worldwide, resulting in an ongoing pandemic [1] . SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome [2] . It can enter the host cells by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein. This glycoprotein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that specifically recognizes its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By inhibiting RBD binding to its receptor can be prevented from the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 to the host cells and reduced the proliferation and pathogenicity of the virus [3] . SARS-CoV-2 is able to invade and affect the upper respiratory tract (throat, nose, and sinuses) and the lower respiratory tract (lungs). The lungs are the main organ affected by SARS-CoV-2 because the virus accesses type II alveolar cells of the lungs via ACE2, which is most abundant in these pneumocytes. As the alveolar disease progresses, SARS-CoV-2 may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs, and systemic disease might develop as well as death may follow [3] .",

However, some infinitely proliferating cell lines, including Calu-3, Caco-2, Huh7, and HEK293 T have been used in SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments. These cell lines generate low titer of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and do not exactly mimic human physiological systems and complexity. Regarding this limitation, valuable information about infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 can be learned from studies using these cell lines. Among the several infinitely proliferating cell lines, a cell line, such as Vero cells, that can easily replicate and isolate higher titer virus is essential for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments. Despite the primary human airway epithelial cells, Vero cells do not produce interferon (IFN) when infected with viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The IFN deficiency permits SARSCoV-2 to replicate efficiently in Vero cells and has given a high titer of the virus [5] .",

Unfortunately, Cur evidences different problems for its clinical application, including extremely poor oral bioavailability, low-aqueous solubility, inadequate tissue absorption, and rapid systemic clearance [16] . To overcome these drawbacks, different delivery systems and strategies such as nano-encapsulation of Cur in poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) have been investigated [17, 18] .

One-stage coagulation tests including prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are the most widely used tests to investigate coagulation disorders. The PT test is used to monitor specifically the quantity and quality of the plasma coagulation factors VII, V, and X, fibrinogen, and prothrombin. A prolonged PT reveals a decrease in the quantity and quality of the mentioned factors. The activated partial APTT is a test performed to investigate bleeding abnormalities specifically the missing or defective of the intrinsic (Factors XII, XI, VIII, IX) and common clotting pathways [28] . The importance of the measurement anti-A and anti-B is hemagglutinins in the serum originates from the universality of its antibodies. It has been revealed that the levels of anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies appear to be influenced mainly by interfering factors and determination of their levels (titers) and reactivity are the main indicator of plasma quality [29] .

PLGA (with an inherent viscosity midpoint of 2.3 dL/g; Purac corporation) was added to the solvent system to increase its concentration by 0.5 %w/w. After that, 2 mM Cur (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was poured into the viscous solution, and the mixing process continued for 24 h. After the homogenous solution was obtained, the electrospinning process for the preparation of nanoparticles began, as follows: 5 mL of the resulting solution was poured into a syringe equipped with a 22-gauge needle. The distance from the needle to the collector was set at 20 cm. Then, a voltage of 20 kV was applied to form nanoparticles on the collector, which was covered with aluminum foil. The flow rate was fixed on 2 mL/h, which is low enough to allow the solvent to evaporate completely, preventing secondary droplets. The process was performed at room temperature and the foil was placed in a vacuum dryer to remove any remaining solvent from the particles. Finally, the nanoparticles were extracted from the mentioned foil. The schematic diagram of Cur@PLGA-NLs synthesis is shown in Fig. 1 .",

The plasma was separated from the blood cells by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The plasmas showing evidence of clot formation and/or hemolysis were discarded. The PT test was done by adding thromboplastin, to the patient's plasma that converts prothrombin to thrombin. After incubation of the mixtures in a water bath (37 \u2022 C) for one minute, the calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) was added to the mixtures to neutralize the sodium citrate and allow clotting to start. The PT test is timed from the addition of the CaCl 2 until the plasma clots. This time is called PT. The PT within the 10\u2212 15 s range shows that the patient has normal amounts of the clotting factors. In the APTT test calcium, kaolin, and cephalin were added to the plasma to start the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. Kaolin serves to activate the contact-dependent Factor XII and cephalin substitutes for platelet phospholipids. The APTT is the time it takes for clot formation.

There were no significant changes in the anticoagulation factors (PT and APTT), total plasma protein content, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies titers between before and after aPDT treatment, thus indicating no adverse effects on plasma quality in aPDT-exposed plasma which could induce the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 contaminants.",

Also, the apoptotic activities of Cur@PLGA-NPs and blue laser were significantly higher than aPDT and control groups. Based on the data obtained, it could be concluded that aPDT exhibited in vitro anti\u2212 COVID-19 activities without induction of apoptosis and destruction of Vero cells. Fig. 12 .

However, further in vivo animal and clinical trial studies are needed to confirm the effect of aPDT (Cur@PLGA-NPs in combination with blue laser light) on plasma clearance of SARS-CoV-2.
