The early testing shortfall in some parts of the US can be traced to an initial shortage of supplies, expertise and/or instrumentation necessary to detect the virus by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Here we show that academic biochemistry and molecular biology laboratories equipped with appropriate expertise and infrastructure can produce the RT-qPCR assay and backfill pipeline shortages. The Georgia Tech COVID-19 Test Kit Support Group synthesized multiplexed primers and probes and formulated a master mix composed of enzymes and proteins produced in-house. We compare the performance of our inhouse kit to a commercial product used for diagnostic testing and describe implementation of environmental testing to monitor surfaces across various campus laboratories for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.",

These strategies will continue to be instrumental in containing the virus until a vaccine or other effective treatment is universally available 1 .

In RT-qPCR, RNA is reverse transcribed to cDNA which is then amplified via PCR until a detection threshold is reached. The TaqMan RT-qPCR method is widely considered the \"gold standard\" for SARS-CoV-2 testing due to its robustness, high sensitivity, linearity, and specificity 6 . In a TaqMan RT-qPCR, the 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 exonuclease activity of a thermostable DNA polymerase cleaves a TaqMan oligonucleotide probe hybridized to the PCR amplicon. One terminus of the TaqMan probe is linked to a fluorophore and the other terminus is linked to a quencher. Success in reverse transcription and PCR is detected as an increase in fluorescence upon probe cleavage during successive rounds of PCR, producing a sensitive and quantitative fluorescence signal that may be monitored in real time.",

These solutions are mixed with a sample suspected to contain the RNA (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 RNA), run through a thermal cycling protocol in an RT-qPCR instrument, and monitored for an increase in fluorescence indicative of the presence of the target RNA. Solutions of matched probe and primer can be designed to detect one (singleplex) or multiple (multiplex) targets in a single reaction. Detection of a target usually needs to be differentiable from other targets in a multiplex reaction. In this case, a distinct fluorophore, with non-overlapping emission wavelength, is used for each target. Commercial enzyme master mixes are sometimes branded for use with multiplex or singleplex primers and probes.",

The latter is a control reaction for monitoring performance of the sample collection and RNA extraction. The CDC N3 primers/probe were later eliminated due template contamination and because they are unnecessary for specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 7,8 , leaving three distinct reactions per sample. All probes in the CDC singleplex assay bear the common FAM fluorophore. Many companies subsequently developed FDA-approved multiplex SARS-CoV-2 primer/probe sets with a variety of fluorophores, enabling detection of all targets in a single reaction. Compared to singleplex, use of multiplex primer/probe sets substantially reduces the amount of enzyme mix and plasticware needed to process one patient sample but requires RT-qPCR instrumentation capable of monitoring the specific combination of fluorophores used.",

A panel of reactions was performed in which various templates were used: synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ATCC #VR-3276SD), HEK293T cell RNA (containing RNase P RNA) generated in-house by TRIzol (Invitrogen #15596026) extraction of HEK293T cells grown to 60% confluency, a mixture of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and HEK293T cell RNA, nuclease-free water (negative, no template control), or SARS-CoV-2 plasmid (2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control, IDT #10006625, 10,000-50,000 copies/rxn).

Multiplex assay interpretation A MATLAB script (https://github.com/rmannino3/COVID19DataAnalysis) was written to interpret the results of RT-qPCR assays conducted with GT multiplexed (FAM/HEX) primers and probes based on 96-well data exported from QuantStudio 6 and StepOne Plus qPCR instruments. The user sets the cycle threshold (C t ), as well as the location of both the positive and negative controls via an interactive prompt. A folder of Excel files containing RT-qPCR data (exported directly from the instrument) are processed to yield a visual readout. The output is a color-coded 96-well grid, with green corresponding to a Negative \"-\" result (no amplification in the FAM channel below the C t and amplification in the HEX channel below the C t ), red corresponding to a Positive \"+\" result (amplification in the FAM channel below the C t and amplification in the HEX channel below the C t ), and yellow corresponding to an \"Inconclusive\" result (no amplification in the HEX channel below the C t ). Finally, the script determines whether the HEX intensity threshold is set properly. In practice, the HEX intensity threshold should be set above the max intensity value of the HEX signal in the nCoV positive control wells, where no human RNA is present. The function provides a warning to the user in the MATLAB command window if this condition is not met.",

Briefly, primers were designed to create an inverse PCR product with one primer harboring the mutation and the other primer blunt ending the mutation primer in the 3' direction. A linear plasmid was created in exponential fashion which was then ligated according to the KLD Enzyme Mix protocol (NEB), where phosphokinase, ligase, and DPN1 were mixed together to circularize the plasmid and digest the parent plasmid to only create colonies of mutational origin after transformation of the circularized plasmid.

His-tagged Taq constructs were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli ArcticExpress (Agilent) strains. Expression in BL21(DE3) expression followed the protocol for GT-RTX except 200 mL Overnight Express media 14 supplemented with kanamycin (25 \u00b5g/mL) was used. Expression in E. coli ArcticExpress followed the same protocol as for GT-MMLV above. Comparable yields were achieved for all Histagged Taq constructs (see Results).",

Reactions were run on an Applied BioSystems StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR instrument. Except for experiments that tested master mix stability over time, reaction mixtures were prepared by mixing stock reagents immediately prior to conducting the RT-qPCR. The template was Quantitative Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA: ORF, E, N (ATCC #VR-3276S). ROX TM reference dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific #2223012) was included in all reactions for fluorescence normalization. The water used in formulations buffers and reactions was HyClone\u2122 HyPure, Molecular Biology Grade (GE Healthcare #SH30538). Tris-HCl buffers tested ranged from 20-50 mM and pH 8.0-8.8. Monovalent salts (KCl, NaCl, NH 4 (SO 4 ) 2 ) ranged from 10-200 mM. Divalent salts (MgCl 2 , MgSO 4 ) ranged from 1.5-5 mM. Standard dNTPs were included at 0.4-0.5 mM (each). Detergents (0.1% CHAPSO, 0.1% Triton X-100), and other additives (0-1 M betaine, 0-10% trehalose, 0-1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA)) were tested. Prior to the availability of GT-RT, GT-His-Taq, and GT-rRI, commercial materials, namely SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific #18080093), Platinum II Taq Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific #14966001) or Taq DNA Polymerase (NEB #M0273), and RNaseOUT (Thermo Fisher Scientific #10777019) or SUPERase\u2022In (Thermo Fisher Scientific #AM2694), were used. IDT N1 primer/probe mix (IDT #10006606), GT multiplex primers/probes, and GT singleplex primers/probes were evaluated. RT-qPCR thermal cycling conditions were modified from those used by the CDC protocol 10 ( Table 2) . Unless otherwise noted, the amplification threshold was set to 0.1 and the baseline cycle range was manually set as 3-15 for each run. Once optimal buffer components for GT-produced proteins were identified ( Table 4) , a 2X master mix containing all reaction components except template and primer/probe mix was prepared, tested by RT-qPCR, stored at -20\u00b0C, then re-tested by RT-qPCR after sequential freeze-thaw cycles to assess stability and performance over time. PCR efficiency was assessed with Quantitative Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ATCC #VR-3276S) or a mixture of full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA (gift from Dr. Robert Jeffrey Hogan, UGA) and total RNA extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen #15596026) from HEK293T cells grown to 60% confluency.",

We initially synthesized and assayed the same singleplex primers and probes specified by the CDC. We then converted the CDC singleplex probes and primers to a multiplex system, in which N1 and N2 are detected via a common channel, and RNase P is detected in a separate channel. Specifically, the CDC FAM-RP-BHQ1 probe was converted to HEX-RP-BHQ1 to allow its simultaneous detection alongside FAM-N1-BHQ1 and FAM-N2-BHQ1, and the three probe/primer sets were combined in a single solution. The HEX fluorophore (maximum \u03bb em =556nm) is compatible with standard fluorophore channels of commercial RT-qPCR instruments and distinguishable from the FAM emission maximum at 518 nm. In addition, HEX has the second highest quantum yield (0.7) after FAM (0.9) and is commercially available. During development of our multiplex probe set, the OPTI SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR multiplex test kit 23 which uses the same HEX-RP-BHQ1/FAM-N1-BHQ1/FAM-N2-BHQ1 probe configuration as our GT kit, gained EUA from the US FDA (May 2020).",

Initially, HPLC was used to purify probes, but cross-contamination was detected from IDT positive control plasmid that was handled in the same laboratory (see details in environmental testing below). Learning from contamination issues faced by CDC 8 , and to further avoid potential contamination across the multi-tasking academic labs, a cartridge method was subsequently used to polish the FAM probes in a separate academic building, and HPLC was only used to analyze purity of an aliquot of the material (Supp. Fig. S1A-D) . Primer purity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis after 32 P end-labeling (Supp. Fig. S1E) . For the HEX probe, we used unpurified, but carefully synthesized HEX probe based on the literature precedent that it should achieve similar efficiency as the high purity probe 24 . HEX probe purity ranged from 35-60% over different synthetic batches (not shown). The HEX probe exhibited temperature-dependent enhancement of fluorescence intensity, as expected (Supp. Fig. S1F) .",

The GT multiplex primers and probes mix was evaluated using several commercially available enzyme master mixes. The performance of multiplexed primers and probes did not differ among any of the enzyme master mixes tested (Fig. 3) , and did not differ from the singleplex system (Supp. Fig. S2C) . Thus, multiplexing did not impair enzyme function or deplete potentially limiting reagents, like dNTPs, from the master mix. Consistent with the greater quantum yield of FAM relative to HEX, probes that contained FAM (\u03bb abs =494/\u03bb em =518nm) always generated a greater \u0394Rn signal than did probes that contained HEX (\u03bb abs =535/(\u03bb em =556nm) in RT-qPCR experiments (Supp. Fig. S2C ). In fact, the spectral characteristics and intensity of the FAM signal were such that a portion of the signal could be observed in the adjacent HEX channel of the instrument, albeit at a much lower intensity ('bleed-through' ; Fig. 3) . The observed bleed-through of the FAM signal into the HEX channel likely arises due to spectral overlap of both HEX and FAM with the broad blue LED .

Inhibition of disulfide bond formation is particularly challenging with RI, which contains two pairs of adjacent Cys residues 30, 31 . We focused on porcine RI, which is known to be an effective RNase inhibitor and is amenable to recombinant production 32 . Our GT-rRI has an N-terminal histag because that variant expressed better than the C-terminal-histag. However, contrary to prior reports 33, 34 , the presence of DTT in the media did not alter our yield (not shown). Purification was carried out in the presence of fresh DTT. GT-rRI eluted from the Ni 2+ -affinity column at a high level of purity (Supp. Fig. S5A ) and did not require further column purification. Inhibition of RNase A by GT-rRI was comparable to that by commercial RNaseOUT (Supp. Fig. S5A ). GT-rRI was stored in aliquots of ~1 mg/mL in the presence of 8 mM DTT and was used in RT-qPCRs at volumes of 0.5-1 \u00b5L/20 \u00b5L (see below).

Addition of known stabilizers BSA and trehalose to our master mix did not affect RT-qPCR performance (Fig. 4A,  Fig. 4B ) so both were retained in the final formulation (trehalose, 9.5%; BSA, 1 mg/mL; Table  4 ). Other additives such as betaine (0.5 or 1 M), a secondary structure reducer, or oligo(dT) and a random DNA hexamer, which enhance reverse transcription, did not improve C t values or fluorescence signals (data not shown). Three freeze/thaw cycles and storage for six days did not affect performance our master mix (Fig. 4C) in the presence of stabilizers. Finally, the qPCR efficiency over a 5-log range (5-50,000 copies RNA) in our GT-MM for the multiplex primer set was 91.6% (r 2 = 0.991), similar to the efficiency observed when the singleplex primers and probes were tested; 87.8% (r 2 =0.997) for the GT-N1 primer and probe, 77.1% (r 2 =0.995) for the GT-N2 probe, and 86.4% (r 2 =0.999) for the GT-RP probe (Fig. 4D) . For comparison, efficiency of the GT-N1 primer and probe in TaqPath was 100.3% (r 2 =0.999) (Fig. 4D) . The GT multiplex assay is linear over the same 5-log range as TaqPath suggesting a similar limit of detection (Fig.  4D) . In sum, our GT RT-qPCR assay, composed of proteins and enzymes produced in house, with either singleplex or multiplexed primers and probes kit exhibits a high level of qPCR efficiency and storage stability.",

Environmental testing detected the SARS-CoV-2 positive control plasmid DNA on surfaces and equipment in the laboratory in which the plasmid was handled, as well as in remote laboratories, indicating that it had been transferred, likely by personnel movements (Supp. Fig. S8D) . The extreme sensitivity of RT-qPCR-the presence of even a single plasmid copy may give rise to an amplification signal-demands a level of stringency that is unfamiliar to most academic biochemists. To combat the contamination, we treated surfaces and pipettes with 10% bleach which was shown by subsequent rounds of environmental testing to be an effective means of eliminating plasmid DNA. After new primers and probes were synthesized, all RT-qPCR components including enzymes and buffers were tested exhaustively (to ensure the absence of contaminating viral template.

While the presence of viral RNA on surfaces does not necessarily indicate live virus or suggest a source of viral transmission, monitoring of high touch surfaces on a residential college campus will be beneficial to evaluate the effectiveness of preventative decontamination protocols. We found that a minimum swab medium consisting of water and EDTA is sufficient for viral recovery from surfaces and prevention of RNA degradation. While the inclusion of detergents disrupts the viral envelope, heat was most important to ensure viral lysis. To further improve the detection limit of our environmental protocol, additional reduction of volume may be required. Addition of proteinase K or RNase inhibitors to the swab medium may enable sample transport at room temperature.",

            "text": "One advantage of our environmental sampling method is that we minimize the volume of liquid used in all steps of the process, which maintains high sample concentration and negates the need for a separate RNA extraction step. Dry or nominally wet swabs 44,51,52 used here are an attractive replacement for VTM, a viral culturing medium used routinely during clinical SARS-CoV-2 sample collection and transport. VTM increases exposure risks during collection, transport, and handling of live virus and introduces large quantities (3 mL) of biological material. Such solutions are prone to spillage during transport (personal communication), dilute the swab sample by at least 100-fold, and must be removed through an extraction protocol before RT-qPCR can be conducted. Our wet swabs are also simpler than non-biological commercial substitutes such as DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research) or Trizol (Thermo Fisher).",

            "text": "The goal of the Georgia Tech COVID-19 Test Kit Support Group was to create contingency SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test components in the face of supply line insecurity. We translated published information about RT-qPCR and sophisticated commercial kits into a series of fundamental protocols, executable with consumables and equipment routinely used in academic biochemistry laboratories. While most assay reagents were produced in-house, key specialty chemicals still needed to be purchased (phosphoramidites and fluorophores used in primer and probe synthesis; dNTPs, ROX TM , molecular biology grade DTT, BSA, and trehalose used in the GT-MM). Our blueprint should be readily reproducible by research teams at other academic institutions, and our protocols may be modified and adapted to enable SARS-CoV-2 detection in more resource-limited settings. With a detailed protocol for an RT-qPCR assay in hand, we can maintain a pipeline for kit production and file for an EUA in order to backfill master mix and primers should new shortages arise. We can also monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on high-touch surfaces throughout our campus community. In the long term, our protocols should be adaptable to the detection of other novel or seasonal infectious viral agents. Das .

GT multiplex primer/probe performance in commercial TaqPath, TaqPath Multiplex, and TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step master mixes. Commercial master mix identity had no detectable impact on performance of the GT-made multiplex primer/probe mix. Due to the proximity of FAM and HEX channels, bleed-through from the FAM into the HEX channel was observed (see bottom nCov plasmid panels), but was of lower intensity than signal generated by the HEX-RP-BHQ1 probe (see top panels) and did not interfere with analyses when the HEX fluorescence threshold (blue dashed line) was set above the bleed-through noise. Template in the top row consisted of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ATCC) mixed with HEK293T RNA. Results are consistent with those expected for a positive patient sample. A negative sample would consist of a single amplification curve in the HEX channel (blue line). Template in the bottom row was 2019_nCoV_N_Positive Control (IDT) plasmid DNA.
