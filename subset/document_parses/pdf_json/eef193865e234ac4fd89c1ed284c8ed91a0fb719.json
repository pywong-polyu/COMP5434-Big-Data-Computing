Recent emerging viral threats, including Zika virus, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV-2 responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlight the cost and difficulty in responding rapidly. To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches that mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show nonenzymatic detection of viral RNA with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with sample preparation using either RNA extraction or isothermal preamplification. Our assay requires minimal laboratory infrastructure and is adaptable to other viruses, as demonstrated by quickly developing DNA nanoswitches to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. Further development and field implementation will improve our ability to detect emergent viral threats and ultimately limit their impact.",

Diagnosing RNA viruses is made challenging by several factors including a limited time window for detection, low or varying viral load, cross-reactive IgM antibodies, and laboratory resources. The detection time windows can vary widely from as short as a few days to as long as several months (5) , and molecular detection techniques are usually most reliable if performed within the first 2 weeks of the disease (9, 10) . Depending on the timing of testing relative to infection, even highly sensitive NAT assays may still produce false-negative or false-positive results (6) . On the other hand, results from IgM serology tests often cannot distinguish related viruses or different strains of the same virus because of crossreactivity of IgM antibodies, thus leading to false positive results (11, 12) . These detection challenges are further exacerbated when outbreaks occur in low-resource settings where infrastructure for these laboratory-intensive tests can be lacking, accelerating the spread of disease (7, 13) .",

Among these are methods that adopt nanoparticles (14) , graphene-based biosensors (15) , and CRISPR-based methods (16, 17) , to name a few. Many of these proposed strategies, although based on cutting-edge technology, require multiple reactions or signal transformation steps. Here, we addressed these biosensing challenges by developing an assay that uses programmable DNA nanoswitches (18) for detection of viral RNA at clinically relevant levels. We validate our viral RNA detection strategy using ZIKV as a model virus. Zika has high global health relevance and is a continued threat due to its reemerging mosquito-borne nature. Although ZIKV infections are typically associated with mild symptoms, they have been linked to devastating birth defects associated with intrauterine infections, development of Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults, and the possibility of sexual transmission (7, 10) . Moreover, despite substantial advances in understanding the molecular biology of ZIKV, there is still a lack of antiviral drugs and vaccines, making robust detection of ZIKV vital to controlling the spread of the disease and implementing early treatments (19) .",

            "text": "Our strategy for detecting the presence of viral RNA is based on using DNA nanoswitches that have been designed to undergo a conformational change (from linear to looped) upon binding a target viral RNA (Fig. 1A) . The presence of the viral RNA would be indicated by shifted migration of the looped nanoswitch by gel electrophoresis. The system is designed to use common nucleic acid staining of the nanoswitch itself that can intercalate thousands of dye molecules to provide an inherently strong signal. Previously, we demonstrated sensitive and specific detection of DNA oligonucleotides (20) and microRNAs (~22 nucleotides long) (21) using this approach. Applied here to viral RNA detection, we solve many challenges of detecting a long viral RNA (>10,000 nucleotides) in clinically relevant samples. We develop an RNA fragmentation strategy, a novel signal multiplication strategy, a custom algorithm for choosing target sequences, and new workflows for measuring viral loads in biological and mock clinical samples with or without RNA preamplification. Using this approach, we show how multiplexing can be used to detect multiple viruses simultaneously from a single sample and demonstrate high specificity even between closely related strains of Zika. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly developed and validated DNA nanoswitches (Fig. 1B) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked into human saliva. Our approach is inherently nonenzymatic but can optionally be combined with an isothermal amplification step, allowing use in low-resource areas (Fig. 1C ). This work enables direct detection of viral RNA without amplification and paves the way toward a low-cost assay for detection of RNA viruses.",

We made the DNA nanoswitches by hybridizing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligos to linearized single-stranded M13mp18 (M13) genomic DNA in a thermal annealing ramp for 1 hour (18) and purified them by high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) (23) . For our initial detection target, we in vitro transcribed RNA from the pFLZIKV infectious plasmid containing the full-length genome of the Cambodia ZIKV isolate (FSS13025) (fig. S1) (24) . Previous results have shown robust nanoswitch detection of small DNA and RNA sequences (20-30 nucleotides), but the long viral RNA is expected to have strong secondary structures that may interfere with our detection (25) . To overcome this, we used a chemical fragmentation method to segment the RNA into small pieces that are mostly shorter than 200 nucleotides (Fig. 2, A and B, and  fig. S2 ). By incubating with our nanoswitch in an annealing temperature ramp, we showed successful detection of the fragmented viral RNAs by gel electrophoresis, thus validating our approach (Fig. 2C) .",

Once the long viral RNA is fragmented, the number of available target sequences increases markedly. Because our detection signal is proportional to the number of looped nanoswitches, a nanoswitch mixture for different target sequences within the viral genome is expected to provide an increased signal. To test this, we developed an algorithm for choosing multiple sequence regions in the viral genome that can be targeted by the nanoswitches (note S1). First, we chose the default target length as 30 nucleotides based on results from screening nanoswitches with different detection arm lengths ( fig. S3 ). Then, the algorithm selectively excluded target sequences that could form stable secondary structures (fig .  S4 ) and cross-binding with nanoswitch backbone oligos ( fig. S5 ), and enforced GC content and uniqueness of sequences. On the basis of these criteria, we chose 18 target regions along the entire ZIKV RNA for testing and designed the nanoswitches. To facilitate use of our MATLAB-based software, we have built a graphical user interface ( fig. S6 ) and made it freely available (data file S1).",

We ranked the nanoswitches from the strongest to the weakest signal and made a series of equimolar nanoswitch mixtures. Using these mixtures, we validated our inherent signal multiplication strategy using a low-concentration pool of equimolar DNA fragments to mimic the fragmented RNA. We observed that our detection signal increased steadily up to around 12 different nanoswitches (Fig. 2 , D and E) and then plateaued above that value.

We reacted the DNA nanoswitch mixture with different amounts of fragmented RNA in a 12-hour annealing temperature ramp from 40\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C.

Because ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) have overlap-ping geographical distributions and clinical symptoms, infection with either virus may result in clinical misdiagnosis (27) . Serological diagnostic assays are known to show antibody cross-reactivity between the two viruses, and DENV has some similarity to ZIKV in its envelope protein (11) and genome sequence (17, 25) . To test the specificity of our approach, we designed a similar panel of nanoswitches to detect DENV (fig. S10). Using the pooled nanoswitches specific for ZIKV and DENV, we mixed each set with in vitro transcribed RNA from each virus and found perfect specificity, with each assay only detecting its correct target RNA (Fig. 3A ). Using the programmability of the nanoswitch, we further demonstrated a multiplexed system for simultaneous detection of ZIKV and DENV. In this case, we modified the DENV responsive nanoswitches to form a smaller loop size (fig. S11), causing two distinct detection bands to migrate to different positions in the gel. Specifically, ZIKV RNA-nanoswitch complex migrated slower/higher in the gel, while the complex of DENV RNA and the nanoswitch migrated faster/lower in the gel (Fig. 3B) . Therefore, in a single reaction, our nanoswitch showed differential and specific detection of ZIKV and DENV RNA. By programming different loop sizes for different targets, this assay can be expanded for up to five viral targets (21) .",

The viral loads can vary markedly between individuals, body fluid, and postinfection time (6, 7) , but are frequently in the subfemtomolar (sub-fM) to femtomolar range, with ZIKV in human urine reported as high as 220 \u00d7 10 6 copies per milliliter (365 fM) (26) . While our nanoswitch sensitivity for in vitro transcribed viral RNA in buffer approaches clinically relevant concentrations, detection from body fluids is further challenged by varying viral loads and by body fluids that can reduce the performance of the nanoswitches due to physiological conditions and nuclease activity (20, 33) . To overcome these potential difficulties, we investigated two independent solutions: (i) adding a preprocessing step to extract RNA from body fluids such as urine or (ii) adding an isothermal preamplification step. In the first approach, we spiked a clinically relevant amount of in vitro transcribed ZIKV RNA into human urine and processed viral RNA extraction using a commercial RNA extraction kit. Ribonuclease (RNase) inhibitors were included to minimize RNA degradation in urine. We then mixed the extracted RNA with the nanoswitches and demonstrated nonenzymatic, clinical-level detection of the RNA at 1.7 \u00d7 10 5 copies/\uf06dl (0.28 pM) (Fig. 5A and fig.  S14 ). In the second approach, we demonstrated that our detection can be coupled with other amplification approaches such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) (34) . NASBA combines multiple enzymes and primers to achieve RNA amplification in a one-pot isothermal reaction ( fig. S15A ). First, we showed feasibility of the amplification of ZIKV RNA by NASBA in water, followed by nanoswitch detection (fig. S15 ). To mimic clinical samples, we spiked infectious ZIKV particles into either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 10% human urine at clinical levels (897 to 20 pfu/\uf06dl). From these samples, our assay detected ZIKV RNA in ~5 hours ( Fig. 5B and fig. S15 ). We went one step further and showed that our assay can be performed using a commercially available bufferless gel cartridge (Thermo Fisher Scientific E-Gel) and imaged on a small and potentially portable gel reader ( fig. S16 ). With the help of NASBA amplification, the detection ability of our method has about 1000-fold increase, from sub-pM (~10 5 copies/\uf06dl) (Fig. 5A ) to sub-fM (~10 2 copies/\uf06dl) ( fig. S15) , and the detection time was reduced from ~13 to ~5 hours.",

Following our ZIKV protocol, we validated nanoswitch detection of an in vitro transcript of a short segment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ~5 hours and cross-validated with RT-PCR ( fig. S17 ). Further optimizing the protocol times, we achieved detection of SARS-CoV-2-positive control RNA at a concentration as low as 200 copies/\uf06dl [around the clinical median; (35) (36) (37) ] in about 2 hours (1-hour NASBA, 40-min nanoswitch incubation, 25-min gel) (Fig. 5C and  fig.

The platform has key advantages over existing methodologies in terms of selectivity and specificity, as shown in our experiments with ZIKV and closely related DENV, as well as two closely related ZIKV strains. Moreover, DNA nanoswitch viral RNA detection strategy has femtomolar detection limit without an RNA amplification step, and attomolar detection limit when used with amplification. These limits are within a clinically relevant range, and therefore, our DNA nanoswitch assay together with the bufferless gel cartridge presents a putative diagnostic assay for clinical detection of RNA viruses in low-resource areas without substantial laboratory infrastructure.",

However, most designs are complex and require laborious readout with advanced microscopy that reduces their practicality. A few approaches have overcome this practicality hurdle to provide widely useful solutions to problems in biological imaging [e.g., DNA points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) in super-resolution microscopy (44) and DNA scaffolds for NMR (45) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (46) ] and biosensing [e.g., detection of lysosomal disorders (47) and mapping of cellular endocytic pathways (48) ]. Our DNA nanoswitches take a reductionist approach, resulting in assays that are robust and sensitive, yet simple to adapt and do not require multiple steps or expensive equipment.

Using this approach, we reached near-clinical levels of detection in urine without the use of enzymemediated amplification strategies. This achievement is of significance because enzymes can be key drivers of assay cost and complexity due to requirements including cold storage/transportation, special buffers and reagents, and strict operating temperatures. These factors make enzymatic assays difficult for field use or for use in low-resource areas without modern laboratory infrastructure. Despite these challenges, most currently available techniques rely on enzyme-triggered amplification (7, 17, 49) . For our assay, we demonstrated compatibility and marked signal improvement with an optional enzymatic preamplification step (Fig. 5, B and C) . However, we believe that further improvements should enable complete coverage of the clinical range without enzymes. A 30-ml sample of urine from a ZIKVinfected patient would contain from 10 5 to 10 9 copies of viral RNA (50) , theoretically surpassing our current detection limit. Efficient sample preparation using a viral RNA extraction kit (Fig. 5A) , for example, could facilitate use with our DNA nanoswitch assay.",

Our DNA nanoswitches align with the goals of the \"frugal science\" movement, where cost and accessibility to new technologies are valued alongside typical performance metrics (51, 52) . Our nanoswitches cost around 1 penny per reaction and can be stored dry at room temperature for at least a month and could be delivered globally without transportation or biosafety concerns. The assay consists of a few steps and can be performed in a matter of hours with limited laboratory needs ( fig. S19 ). Our assay uses a readout by gel electrophoresis, which is relatively inexpensive and already part of the workflow in many laboratories, which is comparatively simpler than many nanotechnology-based assays involving multiple incubation and wash steps. Improvements to the signal readout could potentially help make this approach even more laboratory independent. Successful detection with a commercially available bufferless gel system (fig.

These viruses can be detected with high specificity, as we have shown for ZIKV and DENV (Fig. 3, A and B) and for different strains of ZIKV (Fig. 3, C and D) , even in a multiplexed fashion. We have focused here on single-stranded RNA viruses, but assays for other RNA or DNA viruses could likely be developed similarly. The fast construction and purification processes can facilitate rapid production of DNA nanoswitches to detect an emerging viral threat, potentially in as little as 1 to 2 days from knowledge of the target sequences, limited mostly by oligo synthesis turnaround time (Fig. 1B) . Because of the low cost of the test, our assay could also be useful for monitoring viral progression over time in patients or for testing potentially infected insects or animals. Therefore, with future optimization toward point-of-care clinical applications in resource-limited environments, the platform we describe here has the potential to improve accuracy and ease of diagnosis in humans, nonhuman vectors, and other animals. Ultimately, this system can enhance our ability to control spread of infection and more rapidly respond to emerging viral threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and work toward a reduced death toll and economic burden for these diseases.",

Then, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was spiked into diluted saliva (10%) with blocking oligos (~200 nM) and RNase Inhibitor (2 U/\uf06dl). For the NASBA-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA purchased from Twist Biosciences, NASBA kits purchased from Life Sciences Advanced Technologies Inc. were used. Briefly, 3.3 \uf06dl of 3\u00d7 buffer (NECB-24), 1.7 \uf06dl of 6\u00d7 nucleotide mix, 0.4 \uf06dl of two primers mix at 10 \uf06dM, 0.25 \uf06dl of RNase Inhibitor at 40 U/\uf06dl (NEB, Murine), and 2 \uf06dl of viral RNA sample with different concentrations were mixed first and heated at 65\u00b0C for 2 min, and then the samples were incubated at 41\u00b0C and 2.5 \uf06dl of Enzyme COCKTAIL (NEC-1-24) was mixed. The samples were incubated at 41\u00b0C for 40 min in the thermal cycler followed by heating at 94\u00b0C for 5 min to deactivate all enzymes.",

After mixing with GelRed at 1\u00d7 concentration and 2 \uf06dl of 6\u00d7 blue loading dye, the detection samples were loaded to the 25-ml 0.8% agarose gel, which was run in 0.5\u00d7 TBE buffer at 90 V at room temperature for 25 min.",

Imaging was completed on a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR+ imager with different exposure times based on the brightness of the detection bands. The detection efficiency was analyzed using included Image Lab software (Fig. 2E) . The profiles of detection bands were obtained in ImageJ (57) , and then their integrated intensities were obtained by using the peak analysis function in Origin (OriginLab Corporation), such as the data presented in Figs. 2F, 4C, and 5 (A and B) . The detailed analysis procedure can be found in our previous publication (21) . For the E-Gel-related experiments, we used Invitrogen E-Gel agarose system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and its precast agarose gel (1.0%, SYBR stained). Ten microliters of nanoswitch detection sample was loaded to each lane, and the gel was run at 48 V for 1 hour at room temperature. Because the E-Gel system does not allow user control of the voltage, we used an external power supply connected with the negative and positive electrodes of the precast agarose gel to supply 48 V.",
