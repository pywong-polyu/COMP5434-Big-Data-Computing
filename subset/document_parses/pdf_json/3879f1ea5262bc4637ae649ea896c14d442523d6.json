For instance, the administration of steroids has been advocated for patients with COVID-19 [4] ; yet, steroids are contraindicated for influenza patients [5] . Furthermore, diagnostic tests for both COVID-19 and influenza are not always accurate [6, 7] . Also, these tests are costly and often not readily available [8] . Clinical presentations of COVID-19 and influenza share many similarities, although some differences have been reported [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, many of these previous studies had a rather small sample size and they often focused on specific aspects such as stroke or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [10, 11, 13, 16] . Also, in one study COVID-19 and influenza patients were recruited from different hospitals, introducing selection bias; similarly, in another study COVID-19 patients were compared to influenza patients from previous seasons, which also limits the comparability of groups [11, 12] .",

Between November 1st 2019 and April 1st 2020, patients presenting with acute respiratory illness (ARI) routinely underwent testing for influenza A and B (Alere or multiplex PCR); starting from March 1st 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR (realtime-PCR or GeneXpert) was routinely performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from ARI patients. In case of an initial negative test for SARS-CoV-2 or influenza, but high clinical suspicion, a second PCR -either again from the nasopharynx or from specimens of the lower respiratory tract -was performed. Only patients admitted to the general ward or the intensive care unit (ICU), with a minimum stay of 24 h, were included.

At each step of the procedure, one predictor and one cutpoint are automatically selected to maximize the difference in outcome distribution (here: COVID-19 proportion) between the two resulting subsets. These two subsets can be further subdivided using different predictors. We allowed splitting to continue as long as a subdivision was significant at the 5% level (without adjustment for multiple testing) and as long as the subset to split included at least 70 patients. This analysis was performed with the package party in the software R, version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 2020).

However, we identified several variables, which might help to discriminate these patients, the most important being a longer latency between symptom onset and hospital admission for COVID-19 compared to influenza patients. The relatively large sample size is highly representative of all hospitalized patients with these conditions, and the analysis of data from the same time period and the same hospital strengthens the comparability between patient groups. The variable that discriminated best between COVID-19 and influenza was the time between symptom onset until hospital admission. This finding probably reflects the fact that clinical deterioration commonly occurs on day 5 to 8 after symptom onset in COVID-19 patients, which then causes patients to seek medical care. This important difference between COVID-19 and influenza patients, which has previously been reported by another study [14] , could be helpful in the early assessment of patients with ARI. We can however not exclude that public lockdown measures, which were in place during the time when most COVID-19 patients presented to our hospital, may have prolonged the time delay between symptom onset and hospital admission in some patients. Several other variables were significantly different between patient groups. Males were more common among COVID-19 patients. Indeed, male sex is one of the most important risk factors for severe COVID-19 [21] . However, two previous studies could not confirm this association, potentially because of their small sample sizes [12, 13] . Influenza patients had a higher comorbidity score than COVID-19 patients, which corresponds to previous observations [12] .",

We observed more COVID-19 patients with dyspnea than influenza patients, being in line with the slightly lower oxygen saturation in COVID-19 patients; however, opposite findings have been reported by others [12] . On the other hand, coryza, nasal congestion and sore throat were less common among COVID-19 patients, which has been found in previous studies [12, 14] . Sputum production has been reported to occur more frequently in influenza patients [12, 14] ; accordingly, productive sputum was identified as important discriminating variable in the classification tree. Headache was slightly more common in influenza (43%) compared to COVID-19 patients (31%). In the literature, headache has been reported in about 14% of COVID-19 patients [22] , while the frequency seems indeed to be higher in influenza patients, with some studies reporting a prevalence of over 50% [23] . A limitation of our study is the fact that anosmia or loss of taste were not routinely asked in this early phase of the pandemic. Other studies show that these symptoms might be very useful in distinguishing COVID-19 from other respiratory illnesses, including influenza [12, 14] . Systolic blood pressure was higher among COVID-19 patients. This could be due to the fact that arterial hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for severe COVID-19 [21] . Other studies reported no difference in the systolic blood pressure values [13] . We identified several laboratory values which were different in COVID-19 and influenza patients. These included the lactate dehydrogenase and the aspartate transaminase (both higher in COVID-19 patients). However, these variables were not helpful in the generation of the classification trees, potentially because of the overlapping range of values between the two groups. Furthermore, these two laboratory findings are generally not very specific. We observed a lower white blood cell count in COVID-19 patients which has been reported by others [10, 14] . Also, band neutrophils were more common in influenza patients, supporting the hypothesis of more frequent bacterial superinfection, as previously suggested [24] . This is the first study to present a clinical classification tree to discriminate COVID-19 from influenza patients. This method has the advantage that it easily identifies interaction effects between variables, which are not readily captured with traditional multivariable analyses. As seen in our tree, different variables are important in discriminating patient groups, depending on the time since symptom onset. For instance, sputum production as a sign for bacterial superinfection plays a role after a latency of at least 5 days after symptom onset, but seems to be of minor importance shortly after patients become symptomatic. We were able to classify almost half of patients with reasonable certainty in one of either group, using parameters which can be simply collected in any healthcare setting. However, external validation of these data is necessary.",

First, due to the retrospective study design patient symptoms were not systematically collected, which could have introduced reporting bias. Second, the exploratory character of our analysis comes along with the possibility of type I errors, finding statistically significant associations where there are in fact none. Third, clinical presentation of seasonal influenza may vary from year to year due to differences in circulating subtypes. The same might also apply to the clinical presentation of COVID-19, in particular with the emergence of B.1.1.7 and other viral variants.",
