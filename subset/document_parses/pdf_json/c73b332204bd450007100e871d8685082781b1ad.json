            "text": "Galaxy sizes correlate closely with the sizes of their parent dark matter haloes, suggesting a link between halo formation and galaxy growth. However, the precise nature of this relation and its scatter remains to be understood fully, especially for low-mass galaxies. We analyse the galaxy-halo size relation for low-mass ( \u2605 \u223c 10 7\u22129 M ) central galaxies over the past 12.5 billion years with the help of cosmological volume simulations (FIREbox) from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We find a nearly linear relationship between the half-stellar mass galaxy size 1/2 and the parent dark matter halo virial radius vir . This relation evolves only weakly since redshift = 5: 1/2 [kpc] = (0.053 \u00b1 0.002) ( vir /35 kpc) 0.934\u00b10.054 , with a nearly constant scatter = 0.084 [dex]. Whilst this ratio is similar to what is expected from models where galaxy disc sizes are set by halo angular momentum, the low-mass galaxies in our sample are not angular momentum supported, with stellar rotational to circular velocity ratios rot / circ \u223c 0.15. Introducing redshift as another parameter to the GHSR does not decrease the scatter. Furthermore, this scatter does not correlate with any of the halo properties we investigate -including spin and concentrationsuggesting that baryonic processes and feedback physics are instead critical in setting the scatter in the galaxy-halo size relation. Given the relatively small scatter and the weak dependence of the galaxy-halo size relation on redshift and halo properties for these low-mass central galaxies, we propose using galaxy sizes as an independent method from stellar masses to infer halo masses.",

            "text": "According to the standard picture of galaxy formation, galaxies form at the centres of their parent dark matter haloes (White & Rees 1978; Cole et al. 2000) . Haloes tend to form bottom-up, with small haloes collapsing first and subsequently merging into larger and more massive haloes (Blumenthal et al. 1984) . This gravity-driven hierarchical picture of halo collapse, however, contrasts with a much more complex picture of galaxy formation which is set by a variety of baryonic processes (e.g., Somerville & Dav\u00e9 2014 , and references therein). The link between galaxies and their parent haloes is therefore far from trivial, especially given that the latter are more than order of magnitude larger and more massive than the former.",

For instance, the stellar-to-halomass relation (SHMR), also called the \u2605 \u2212 halo relation, has been widely studied empirically (via abundance matching, Kravtsov & Klypin 1999; Kravtsov et al. 2004; Conroy & Wechsler 2009; Behroozi et al. 2010) , observationally via -e.g., gravitational lensing (Mandelbaum et al. 2006; Behroozi et al. 2019) or galaxy kinematics (More et al. 2011; Kravtsov et al. 2018 ) -and theoretically, with the help of analytic models (e.g., White & Frank 1991; Mo et al. 1998; Wechsler et al. 1998; White et al. 2007 ) and cosmological simulations (Pearce et al. 2001; Berlind et al. 2003; Simha et al. 2012; Hopkins et al. 2014; Khandai et al. 2015; McAlpine et al. 2016; Feldmann et al. 2016; Chaves-Montero et al. 2016; Pillepich et al. 2018b; Engler et al. 2020) . This relation forms a broken power law of increasing galaxy formation efficiency with halo mass until a peak at halo \u223c 10 12 M and a sharp decrease towards higher halo masses (Wechsler & Tinker 2018) . Interestingly this relation has a nearly constant scatter over five orders of magnitude in halo mass ( halo \u223c 10 10\u221215 M ), and the baryonic feedback processes -such as stellar winds, supernovae, cosmic rays and active galactic nuclei (AGN) -largely determine the shape of this relation despite the haloes dominating in size and mass (e.g., Dekel & Silk 1986; Silk & Rees 1998; Bullock et al. 2000; Croton et al. 2006; Hopkins et al. 2012b ).",

Unlike the SHMR, this galaxy-halo size relation (GHSR) forms an approximately linear relation with constant scatter across nearly three orders of magnitude in halo size ( halo \u223c 5 \u2212 1, 500 kpc, corresponding to halo \u223c 10 8\u221215 M ). Furthermore, this relationship is largely independent of galaxy morphology and nearly identical for centrals and satellites. The observation of the GHSR at = 0 thus raises a variety of intriguing questions such as: When was the GHSR established? How do its slope, normalization, and scatter evolve over cosmic time? Are the GHSR and its scatter linked to the growth histories of structure in the Universe?",

For instance, measuring galaxy and halo sizes with sufficiently high spatial resolution becomes increasingly more challenging at higher redshift. Fortunately, a variety of approaches have been developed to probe the galaxy-halo link at earlier cosmic times. For instance, di Teodoro & Fraternali (2015) show that fitting a 3D-tilted ring models can resolve intrinsic rotation curves and velocity dispersion from low spatial resolution observations. Other recent works have recovered connections between galaxies and their host haloes at high redshifts (Shibuya et al. 2015; Huang et al. 2017; Hirtenstein et al. 2019; Zanisi et al. 2020 Zanisi et al. , 2021a .

            "text": "Another approach is to simulate galaxy formation in a cosmological context to study the galaxy-halo connection across cosmic history (see Somerville & Dav\u00e9 2014 , for a recent review). Over the past decade, advances in computational power and numerical techniques (e.g., Springel 2005 Springel , 2010 have made it possible to simulate not only the gravitational collapse of dark matter, but also the hydrodynamics of gas, and the complex baryonic processes such as gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback (e.g., Vogelsberger et al. 2014; Schaye et al. 2015; Crain et al. 2015; Tremmel et al. 2017; Hopkins et al. 2018; Pillepich et al. 2018a; Nelson et al. 2018) . Recent simulations provide a deeper understanding of, and challenge long-standing assumptions about, galaxy formation and evolution. Perhaps contrary to the expectation based on specific angular momentum conservation (Fall & Efstathiou 1980; Mo et al. 1998) , Desmond et al. (2017) find in the EAGLE simulation that at a fixed stellar mass, the galaxy size weakly correlates with halo mass, concentration or spin. On top of that, Somerville et al. (2018) conclude from their sample of Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) and the Cosmic Assembly Near Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy (CANDELS) surveys mapped to the Bolshoi-Planck dissipationless \u2212body simulation that the ratio of galaxy to halo size decreases slightly with cosmic time for less massive galaxies, while the ratio of galaxy size to halo size times halo spin -1/2 /( vir ) -is lower for more massive galaxies below 3. In the VELA (Ceverino et al. 2014; Zolotov et al. 2015) and NIHAO (Wang et al. 2015) zoom-in simulations, Jiang et al. (2019) find that the halo spin only weakly correlates with that of the galaxy, and this correlation becomes weaker with increasing redshift. Moreover, the gas that builds galaxies in cosmological simulations typically has higher specific angular momentum than that of the dark matter (e.g., Danovich et al. 2015; Stewart et al. 2017; Zjupa & Springel 2017; El-Badry et al. 2018; Kretschmer et al. 2020) .",

We consider the total galaxy radius to be 10% of the halo virial radius (Price et al. 2017) .At lower redshifts Hopkins et al. (2018); Samuel et al. (2020) find that satellites can exist within 0.1 vir for massive galaxies, but this does not affect our sample of low mass galaxies.

We calculate the galaxy stellar mass \u2605 \u2261 \u2605 (< 0.1 vir ) by linearly interpolating in log \u2212 log space between radii and the cumulative stellar mass \u2605 (< ).

            "text": "Of the resolved galaxies, we study a selected range of halo sizes that depends on redshift and simulation resolution. At each redshift, we define a lower limit on vir such that the number of haloes in each vir bin decreases with increasing halo size. This lower limit on the halo size translates to a nearly constant lower limit on the halo mass of vir 10 9.8 M since = 5. This lower limit cuts out a small percentage (\u223c 4 \u2212 8%, see Table 1 column 5) of additional objects at each redshift. When we instead employ a looser criterion of a minimum halo mass of vir > 10 9 M , we only exclude a few additional haloes (< 5 at each redshift), and the results remain qualitatively consistent. At large vir , the FIREbox galaxy sizes no longer increase with increasing halo size, which disagrees with observational results at these halo sizes (Kravtsov 2013; Huang et al. 2017; Zanisi et al. 2020) . At a fixed halo mass at = 0, these galaxies also have . The open circles represent the galaxies within the selected vir , denoted 'FB-S,' and the filled squares the galaxies with larger vir , denoted 'FB-L.' Average sizes within each lg vir bin are overplotted with standard errors indicated by error bars. We also plot galaxy-halo pairs from FIRE-2 zoom simulations as triangles (Wetzel et al. 2016; Hopkins et al. 2018 ). These high resolution (gold triangles, \u2248 7 \u00d7 10 3 M ) zoom-in simulations have an 8 times higher peak resolution than the FIREbox pathfinder (1024 3 ). Medium resolution zoom-in runs (grey triangles; b \u2248 6 \u00d7 10 4 M ) have comparable mass resolution to the 1024 3 run. FIREbox galaxies in moderately massive haloes ( vir \u223c 10 11\u221213 at = 0 \u2212 2) have approximately constant size with increasing halo size. In this study, we focus on the 'FB-S' galaxies. The figure shows that the 1/2 \u2212 vir relation appears converged at both = 0 and = 2 for the FIREbox pathfinder run. slightly larger stellar masses than is expected from the SHMR (see Feldmann et al., in prep for more details). Moreover, these galaxies have more rotational support ( rot / circ \u223c 0.4 at = 0; see \u00a7 5.2 for more details) than the galaxies at smaller vir ( rot / circ \u223c 0.1\u22120.2). Lower-mass galaxies are more dispersion supported both for isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (Wheeler et al. 2017 ) and in the FIRE-1 zoom simulations (Wheeler et al. 2015 (Wheeler et al. , 2017 . Hereafter, we denote the galaxies in the large-size regime as 'FB-L', and the fiducial sample within the selected halo size range as 'FB-S'. Due to the differences in the GHSR and amount of dispersion or rotational support between the 'FB-L' and 'FB-S' samples, we focus on the low-mass 'FB-S' galaxies here. We plan to study the rotation supported, higher-mass 'FB-L' galaxies in more detail in future work. Table 1 summarises these limits and gives the number of galaxy/halo pairs at each redshift. Figure 1 displays the GHSR at redshifts = 0 and = 2 for the 256 3 , 512 3 and 1024 3 FIREbox simulations for galaxies residing in both small ('FB-S') and large haloes ('FB-L'). We also compare the predictions by FIREbox with recent FIRE-2 zoom simulations (Wetzel et al. 2016; Hopkins et al. 2018) . The latter reach a mass resolution up to \u223c 8\u00d7 higher than FIREbox pathfinder run allowing us to check for resolution effects. We also show results from 8 and 64 times lower resolution re-runs of these zoom-ins. The figure shows that the 1/2 \u2212 vir relation appears well converged at both = 0 and = 2 for the 1024 3 FIREbox run. However, Hopkins et al. (2018) shows that galaxy properties, including size, may still change when the mass resolution changes from \u2248 6 \u00d7 10 4 M to \u2248 7 \u00d7 10 3 M . Interestingly, the 'FB-L' galaxies shows a prominent turn-over, i.e., a decrease in galaxy size with increasing halo size for vir \u223c 10 11 \u2212 10 12 M haloes. They also show an increased scatter. A few of the galaxies from the highest resolution zoom simulations have smaller sizes than the 'FB-S' galaxies, which stems from the \u2605 criterion. At a fixed vir , the zoom simulations can resolve galaxies with 8\u00d7 lower stellar masses than the FIREbox pathfinder simulation. However, the 'FB-S' sample contains many more galaxies larger than the zoom simulations, facilitating statistical analysis across a range of halo sizes.",

We assume that on average for a random projection, the intrinsic three-dimensional halfstellar mass radius 1/2 is similar to the projected two-dimensional half-mass radius mass (van de Ven & van der Wel 2021, see their text for how this approximation varies with intrinsic ellipsoidal axis ratios and for comparisons between 1/2 and eff ).

Assuming that our 3D half-stellar mass radius 1/2 has on average the same value in 2D projected space (van de Ven & van der Wel 2021), then we convert our 1/2 to a projected half-light radius eff (Suess et al. 2019a , see text for more details). Similarly to Figure 1 , the open circles and filled squares represent the 'FB-S' and 'FB-L' galaxies at = 2, respectively. The dark shaded areas mark the mass range above the completeness limits of Mowla et al. (2019b) , and the lighter regions show the relations extrapolated to lower masses. The completeness limit of Suess et al. (2019a) is \u2605 10 10 M . The 'FB-S' galaxies lies along the extrapolated relation for star forming galaxies. Figure 3 . The galaxy size distribution for the 'FB-S' galaxies ( \u2605 \u223c 10 7\u22129 M ) at = 0 \u2212 5. The distribution is well described by a log-normal at each redshift. The distribution parameters change with redshift, however. The Gaussian fitted means lg[ 1/2 /kpc] are listed in the upper right corner. The average galaxy size increases with cosmic time (decreases with redshift and lookback time), qualitatively agreeing with observations (Shibuya et al. 2015) . We find an approximately constant standard deviation lg 1/2 = 0.12 [dex] since = 5, also in qualitative agreement with Shibuya et al. (2015) . relation for star-forming galaxies either continues or becomes flatter in the low-mass regime, while the quiescent relation flattens out for low-mass galaxies. There are no observational studies of dwarf galaxies at = 2. See Appendix B for more details regarding the galaxy size-stellar mass relation, and for the figures at = 0 ( Figure B1 ). Briefly, at = 0 the FIREbox galaxies follow the galaxy size-stellar mass relation for star-forming galaxies from Nedkova et al. (2021), but they are systematically larger by \u223c 0.3\u22120.5 [dex] at a fixed stellar mass. The value of the discrepancy depends on the correction factor employed from Suess et al. (2019b) . We emphasize that Figures 2 and B1 should be understood as illustrations rather than proper com-parisons with observations; we plan to analyse synthetic images of FIREbox galaxies using radiative transfer (e.g., Liang et al. 2019 Liang et al. , 2021 in future work. Shibuya et al. (2015) find that a log-normal distribution well approximates the eff distribution in their combined legacy dataset of 3D-HST, CANDELS, Hubble Ultra Deep Fields (HUDF) 09+12 and the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) surveys. While their sample of star-forming and Lyman break galaxies focuses on more massive galaxies ( \u2605 \u223c 10 8.5\u221211 M since = 6), our 1/2 distribution qualitatively agrees. Figure 3 shows our best fitting Gaussians to the histograms of lg 1/2 in our final samples at each redshift. We create Q-Q plots for the fits to each redshift (omitted here), which indicate that a Gaussian well approximates each snapshot's lg 1/2 distribution. However, the Shapiro-Wilks tests and chi-squared -values for normal distributions indicate that the distributions are likely not perfectly log-normal. Further, Shibuya et al. (2015) find that the average galaxy size decreases significantly towards higher redshift whilst maintaining a roughly constant standard deviation. Figure 3 demonstrates that 'FB-S' galaxies display the same behaviour.",

Then we calculate the average scatter as the standard deviation of the residuals std (\u0394 lg 1/2 ) from the fiducial power-law. Lastly, we fit a power-law to this scatter as function of lg vir . Figure 4 displays these results for = 2, where the top panel shows the GHSR and the bottom panel details the scatter (standard deviation of the residuals). We also fit power-laws to the binned means and medians and found similar best fitting functions. The best fitting power-law index of the GHSR at = 2, GHSR = 0.939 \u00b1 0.025, is close to unity. The approximately linear GHSR in FIREbox at Cosmic Noon in our target sample is qualitatively consistent with similar findings at = 0 (Kravtsov 2013) and at higher redshifts (Huang et al. 2017; Zanisi et al. 2020 ). However, we note that our sample consists of smaller and lower-mass galaxies than in those observational studies. The scatter in the GHSR of the 'FB-S' galaxies exhibits a moderate increase with vir , as indicated by the nonvanishing power-law index = 0.144 \u00b1 0.023.

The average value of the residuals \u0394 lg 1/2 is null, and the standard deviation \u0394 lg 1/2 is consistent with the average scatter in the GHSR. A Shapiro-Wilks test and the chi-squared -value for a normal distribution indicate that the GHSR residuals \u0394 lg 1/2 do not form a perfect normal distribution, but the Gaussian fit is a good approximation. Table 2 summarises the main parameters for the GHSR and residuals for each of the analyzed redshifts. See Table A1 for the same table using the iterative galaxy definition (Hopkins et al. 2018) . Given that the GHSR is consistent with being linear (column 2), the normalisation stays roughly constant (column 3), and the average scatter does not vary with redshift (column 4), we conclude that the GHSR in FIREbox is approximately constant since = 5. We calculate the weighted averages of each of the redshifts considered and find that the power-law index GHSR = 0.934 \u00b1 0.054 is approximately linear and the scatter = 0.084 is constant with individual snapshots. Figure 6 displays the probability distributions of the galaxy to halo size ratio at each redshift. We fit log-normal distributions to histograms of lg[ 1/2 / vir ], but we do not show the histograms for clarity. There is little redshift evolution in either the mean or the scatter of this size ratio, and we find typical values of 1/2 / vir \u223c 0.05, which is higher than Kravtsov (2013) ; Shibuya et al. (2015) ; Somerville et al. (2018) who find values closer to \u223c 0.02. However, these studies focus on more massive galaxies than the low-mass centrals analyzed here. As Figure 1 shows, low-and high-mass FIREbox galaxies do not necessarily follow the same GHSR. Somerville et al. (2018) find a weak redshift dependence on this ratio (see their Figure 12 ). However, this dependence decreases with decreasing halo mass, and our sample is more than an order of magnitude less massive than their least massive bin.",

This means that the definition of vir is a function of redshift, because vir depends on the top hat collapse factor times the background density \u0394 back = \u0394( ) back ( ) (Bryan & Norman 1998) . Figure 7 displays these results, where the top panel shows the GHSR and the bottom panel the standard deviation of the residuals. The combined sample spans over an order of magnitude in halo size, and there is a \"discretely smooth\" transition between the six redshift snapshots. The best fitting power-law index decreases to = 0.894 \u00b1 0.005, indicating that this combined sample is slightly sub-linear. This contrasts with the individual and averaged GHSRs, whose power-law index remains consistent with linear at = 0.934 \u00b1 0.054. At any given instant in time the GHSR is linear, but the size of a given halo typically grows slightly faster than the size of its central galaxy over much of cosmic history. This sub-linearity and the slight decrease of lg[ 1/2 / vir ] with cosmic time ( Figure 6 ) are qualitatively consistent with expectations of pseudo-evolution of halo sizes (Diemer et al. 2013 ). However, these low-mass central galaxies remain star-forming until = 0, so their galaxy sizes continue growing as well. Nonetheless, it appears that halo sizes grow slightly quicker than galaxy sizes since = 5. Hence, the average lg[ 1/2 / vir ] in Figure 6 shift leftward with cosmic time (decreasing ), and the power-law fit to the all-z sample is less linear than the fits to each individual redshift in Figure 7 .",

Because including redshift as another parameter to the GHSR does not decrease this scatter, we now investigate halo ( \u00a7 5.1), galaxy ( \u00a7 5.2), and environment ( \u00a7 5.3) properties that could determine this scatter. Specifically, we correlate the GHSR residuals with these physical properties. If there is a strong correlation and the average scatter decreases, then this property is important in setting the GHSR scatter. Figure 8 exemplifies six of these scatter plots for the 'FB-S' galaxies from all redshifts. The vertical axis shows the residuals -i.e., the difference in log space of the true galaxy size 1/2 and that predicted from the GHSR and the halo's vir -as a function of various properties. We employ a linear regression between the log residuals and functions of the properties. For physical propertiese.g., halo spin , stellar mass \u2605 , and local density -we fit the residuals \u0394 lg 1/2 with the lg( ) of the physical property ; for fractional properties -e.g., shape parameters / and mass fractions \u2605 / bar -we use the logit ( ) \u2261 lg( /(1\u2212 )) of the property. These functional choices (lg( ) for physical properties \u2208 (0, \u221e); logit ( ) for fractional properties \u2208 (0, 1)) map their respective properties to all real numbers (\u2212\u221e, \u221e). For each of these residual-parameter figures, we study the statistical significance ,0 of the slope from 0 and the percent reduction in scatter %\u0394 . We also calculate the vertical offset of the fit and the Pearson correlation coefficient . Table 3 details these results for the 'FB-S' galaxies for the halo (top), galaxy (middle), and environment (bottom) properties respectively.

Hence, at a fixed halo size, galaxies that are less spherical have larger 1/2 . This can be expected based on our spherical definition of 1/2 . For example, let a triaxial galaxy have axes > > and total stellar mass \u2605 (< ). As we integrate the interior stellar mass \u2605 (< ) with increasing radius , we reach the edge of the shortest axis first at = . If \u2605 (< = ) < 0.5 \u2605 (< ), then we must continue to further radii to determine 1/2 . Thus in the direction of the axis, we do not accumulate any more stellar material. The same argument holds for the axis, when \u2605 (< = ) < 0.5 \u2605 (< ).

This technique is independent from, and as accurate as, other commonly-employed mass-based methods, namely abundance matching, and has the potential to be a better environmental indicator in low-mass galaxy surveys (Yang et al. 2007 (Yang et al. , 2009 . Especially with upcoming low-mass galaxy surveys at high redshifts, with, for example, the James Webb Space Telescope, we suggest inferring halo masses and sizes from the galaxy sizes. Given a measurement of a galaxy's stellar mass \u2605 , one can estimate the halo mass vir using the SHMR and associated scatter \u2248 0.25 [dex] . That is, a halo mass lg[ vir ( \u2605 )/M ] inferred from the stellar mass \u2605 has an associated error of roughly \u00b10.25 [dex] . Now with the galaxy size 1/2 , one can estimate the halo size vir via the GHSR using the scatter \u2248 0.08 \u2212 0.09 [dex] for the 'FB-S' galaxies. Then a halo size lg[ vir ( 1/2 )/kpc] inferred from the galaxy size 1/2 has an associated error \u00b10.08 \u2212 0.09 [dex] . Because vir scales exactly as vir \u221d 3 vir , then the error on estimating lg[ vir /M ] is three times that of estimating the halo size, given the galaxy size. That is, a halo mass lg[ vir ( 1/2 )/M ] estimated from the galaxy size 1/2 has an associated error of approximately \u00b10.24 \u2212 0.27 [dex], comparable to the error from using \u2605 . However, using galaxy sizes could be more beneficial than using stellar masses because the GHSR depends less on the unobservable dark matter halo properties, namely spin and concentration. Thus for dispersion supported, low-mass, central galaxies, we suggest that the galaxy-halo size relation is just as or even more fundamental than the SHMR. ",

The 'FB-S' galaxies follow a similar galaxy size-stellar mass relation to the star-forming galaxies from Nedkova et al. (2021) within this sphere.

We require that the DMO halo is a main halo, since the ALL-hydro halo is by a main halo by definition. Then we require the DMO virial mass be within a factor of 2 of that of the ALL-hydro halo.
