This study focused on the significant behavioral phenomenon, including self-control, optimism, herding, and loss aversion with a perspective of the digital economy. To test the proposed hypothesis, the primary data collection method was used. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect data from 102 individual households through the convenience sampling technique. SmartPLS was used to analyze collected data. This study found the negative impact of self-control, optimism, and herding on financial inclusion. In contrast, loss aversion contributes to the uplift of financial inclusion in Pakistan. Similarly, financial literacy proved to have a decreasing effect on financial inclusion because of religious concerns. The moderation effect of financial literacy was also significantly positive except for loss aversion. The behavioral phenomenon proved to have a significant impact on financial inclusion. This research shows that individual households who do not use developed technological services and products from formal financial inclusion can overcome the behavioral biases that hinder them from making informed financial decisions. This research work will significantly help households use financial services to improve their standard of living and overall long-term financial well-being. This research is essential because many households are not using bank services and have low financial knowledge in Pakistan. The key contribution of this research study is that it found the relation between behavioral factors and financial inclusion. Financial literacy also has a moderating effect on their relations.",

            "text": "The origin of financial inclusion is microcredit and microfinance with the emerging context of global financial exclusion. The thematic concept of financial inclusion brings access to individuals and businesses for consummating financial services and products. Financial inclusion refers to providing financial services including credit, insurance, deposits, payment, and loan services to people equally and according to their ease. It also aims to include the people in the financial circle who are either not using these services or not accessing the financial products. Although credit unions and financial intermediaries have played a significant role in providing financial assistance, almost 2.5 billion people still do not have their saving account or are not using financial services. Financial inclusion is the concept to bring all these people who are not using the financial product into the financial circle. According to major agencies that have an active role in the development of countries around the world, including the United Nations Development Programme, World Bank, G20, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, there is an immense need for financial inclusion from all the sectors of the population to achieve sustainable economic growth and eliminate poverty, significantly in developing countries (Bongomin et al., 2018; Valencia et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "According to the statistics of the State Bank of Pakistan, more than 17% (27 million) of the population of Pakistan are earning <$1 a day. Similarly, <$2 is earned by 73% or 116 million of the total population of Pakistan per day. But banks and other microfinance institutions are availed by only 2% of the poor individual. People living in rural areas are not using financial services, including account opening, bank deposits, insurance, and, most importantly, bank credit. Thus, the financial inclusion rate in Pakistan is very low. Technically, the reason behind this situation is the financial illiteracy of people about the financial concepts, so they may not access these services. Behavioral finance is comparatively a new approach in the financial area that emerged due to the problems faced by individuals in traditional finance. Behavioral finance describes the irrational behavioral phenomenon by developing the critical behavioral model. While making financial decisions, whether they are household individuals and the decision making for business, people faced different types of cognitive and emotional errors named biases that mislead them into making false decisions. Behavioral finance provides an understanding of such emotional errors and tells how people could escape from these misleading factors while making decisions among different choices. Behavioral finance emerged as a new field discussed in different newspapers, publications, and journals in the 1990s. But different authors considered that behavioral finance originated in 1800 or 1900, as was discussed in different books at that time. It is also linked with sociology, psychology, and finance (Ricciardi and Simon, 2000; Mohsin et al., 2020a) .",

These biases also affect the decisions related to financial products and services. This study considers the effects of these behavioral factors on financial inclusion. Research shows that financial inclusion helps in poverty reduction and in achieving millennium development goals. It is also found that it leads to eliminating inequality in society (Chibba, 2009; Polloni-Silva et al., 2021) . Female empowerment increases as they have access to saving accounts to decide about the proper utilization of their savings. Access to credit also improves the job situation and mental health of individuals. The State bank of Pakistan has also taken the initiative to improve the statistics of financial inclusion in Pakistan, but this program is still in progress. Earnings management plays a moderating role in the Small and Mediumsized Enterprises (SMEs) cash holdings (Sarfraz et al., 2020b) .",

Financial literacy refers to understanding the financial concepts as the individual needs to choose among different financial services. It facilitates the individuals to effectively use the financial products as it directly impacts financial inclusion (Cohen and Nelson, 2011; Naseem et al., 2020; Menyelim et al., 2021) . Individuals with an understanding of the financial rules would manage their expenses efficiently, saving money leading to certain investments properly. Ignorance of financial knowledge may bring consequences to the life of an individual. By considering all this valuable information, this paper is aimed to determine the role of these behavioral biases on financial inclusion in Pakistan, considering the role of financial literacy as the moderator. Several research pieces have been conducted to evaluate the role of behavioral biases on investor behavior or the behavior of individual households while making choices among alternate financial products and services. This also helps the individual find ways to escape these mental errors and make good financial decisions. Studies have also been conducted to determine the impact of these biases on the financial behavior of an individual, how they manage their expenses and save for the future and their impact on their long-term financial well-being. But this research work is not enough in behavioral finance, and there is still scope for more contributions.",

According to the United Nations survey, nearly three billion people worldwide have not accessed the financial services and products offered by banks or other financial institutions such as a safe place to save money, credit, loan, and insurance. Mostly the financially excluded people in developing countries are the average class people. Providing financial services to individuals to handle money in formal ways will help them reduce poverty and help achieve millennium development goals (Chibba, 2009; Mohsin et al., 2020b) . Countries like Pakistan are resource-constrained and face additional challenges for financial inclusion than a developed country. Globally, there are gender differences that are more severe in developing countries in handling financial recourses, security, and empowerment (Ibtasam et al., 2018) .",

But the financial system is not fully expanded to all the sectors of society, especially in rural areas. In Pakistan, financial exclusion is caused by many reasons, including geographical locations as 67% of people live in rural areas, cultural or language barriers, banking services, behavior, lack of support at provincial levels, regulatory restraints including money laundering, and suitability of financial products (Menyelim et al., 2021) . The efficient policies of state banks and initiatives by the government have not yet achieved the goals of including people into the financial circle completely. According to Husain (2011) , one of the fundamental problems in expanding final inclusion in Pakistan is mismatching the long-term loans and short-term deposits of bank customers. But this problem is resolved, and the gap is filled to some extent by the long-term Islamic Sukuk bonds, insurance by different institutions, pension funds, municipal bonds, and endowment funds. But the progress in financial inclusion is plodding than the developed nations.",

Selfcontrol is interchangeable with self-discipline as it is the ability to put down some solid responses for achieving some higher goals. Still, these restrictions are not automatic and require conscious efforts (Duckworth and Seligman, 2006) . Individuals with low self-control tend to be more self-centered and impulsive, enjoy ease, and become riskier.

Thus, people with an upbeat nature are more likely to think that their future will be risk-free. Such people say they will remain financially strong in the future and do not need to save for rainy days, which results in not using the services of financial institutions.

People mostly get influenced by the choices of others in their purchase decisions.

In the light of these entire viewpoints, it is argued that household individuals exhibit herding behavior when choosing among alternatives in their financial decisions. Pakistani people, mostly, the rural areas and the poor who do not have financial knowledge, do not consider bank credit as the source when they need money. They mostly get loans from their relatives and friends instead of considering banks as an opportunity.

Thus, avoiding the risk is common in households that can affect their household financial decisions (Ngoc, 2014) .

According to the prospect theory, people judge the outcomes of their decisions in terms of gain or losses, concerning some reference point, and they have more sensitivity for losses than the gains. The drawback of loss aversion is people have more probability weightage for the losses than the probability estimation for gains (Abdellaoui et al., 2007) . Prospect theory defines human behavior when they are under the situation of risk and uncertainty. It is also linked with status quo bias. The reference point of the outcomes is also considered the status quo, against which any loss is not bearable for the people (K\u00f6bberling and Wakker, 2005) .",

Fisher and Montalto (2011) conducted a research study using the U.S. survey of consumer financial data to determine the saving behavior of households. The research findings confirmed the asymmetric impact of good or bad news related to the income of an individual on his/her saving behavior. Households are loss averse, as the increase in the income above the reference level does not significantly relate to savings chances. In light of all these research contributions, this study aimed to investigate the role of loss aversion on the financial inclusion of an individual household. Loss-averse people have fewer intentions toward saving even when their income is above the reference level. Similarly, the loss-averse behavior of individuals could also affect the choices of financial services provided by banks and other financial institutions.",

            "text": "The study aimed to explore all the behavior factors that caused low financial inclusion in Pakistan. A small proportion of the total population in Pakistan uses financial products and The results identified whether the findings had supported the hypothesis we developed or not. The H 1 hypothesis argues that there is a significant relationship between self-control and financial inclusion. Still, results suggest an insignificant negative relationship between self-control and financial inclusion with values (\u03b2 = \u22120.161, \u03c1 = 0.146). However, the researchers argue the financial satisfaction and habitual saving of money among the individuals having self-control in their financial matters (Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck et al., 2017) . That will be expected to increase their usage of financial services to deposit money. The negative relation between self-control and financial inclusion indicates that people may have savings but not use banking services because of cultural barriers and religious beliefs. Especially in rural areas, Pakistani people prefer to deposit money with their relatives because they lack knowledge or access to financial services. The second hypothesis elaborates as the relation between optimism and financial inclusion is insignificantly negative (\u03b2 = \u22120.019, \u03c1 = 0.862), as the highly optimistic people do not consider saving for the future or investing in opportunities. As Peterson (2000) described, bright people judge their future on their expectations based on pleasure or desirable outcomes; they overestimate the likelihood of positive events and underestimate the likelihood of negative events (Sharot et al., 2012) . The findings of the current research study are also aligned with previous literature as the people with \"rose eyed glasses\" may think their future is financially safe, so they do not need to plan for future financial events. This will reduce their savings and also the usage of financial products and services. The third hypothesis is justified by analytical process which confirmed that there is also a negative relationship between herding and financial inclusion (\u03b2 = \u22120.156, \u03c1 = 0.158) because herding involves irrational decision-making without the informed knowledge. Zhang and Chen (2017) argue that people show herding behavior when following choices of others without rational decisions. For example, most people in Pakistan make their financial decisions by observing the behavior of others because of a lack of financial knowledge. There is also the possibility that they will not consider banking and other financial institutions as opportunities to avail of financial services due to their herding behavior, so these findings align with the arguments of previous researchers. The loss of aversion and financial inclusion are significantly positively related (\u03b2 = 221, \u03c1 = 0.010). People are most sensitive to losses, as they feel more distress from a loss than pleasure from an equal amount of gain (Ngoc, 2014; G\u00e1lvez-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2021) . This loss aversion behavior is expected in individuals to place their money with secure investments. Banks and other financial institutions are safe and secure options for depositing money and investing; it is expected to increase financial inclusion due to the loss aversion nature of individuals. There is a significantly negative relationship between financial inclusion and financial literacy (\u03b2 = \u22120.228, \u03c1 = 0.027), although previous research found a positive impact of financial literacy on financial inclusion. For example, Bernheim et al. (2001) argued that individuals who studied finance courses are more likely to save in the future and use financial services. In Pakistan, this negative relation exhibits low participation of people in banking services because of their religious beliefs. The majority of the population of Pakistan is Muslim; people avoid the conventional banking system because of the interest element prohibited in Islam. Thus, they may have the literacy of financial matters, but their religious and cultural factors forced them to avoid banking services. Similarly, the research findings demonstrate the positive impact of moderating variable financial literacy on the relationship between independent variables self-control, optimism, and herding with dependent variable financial literacy by values (\u03b2 = 0.133, \u03c1 = 0.306), (\u03b2 = 0.010, \u03c1 = 0.950), and (\u03b2 = 0.400, \u03c1 = 0.047), respectively. Thus, the moderator contributes to the lowering strength of the relationship between loss aversion and financial inclusion.",

This research indicates that individual behavior is biased when they decide to take financial services. Individual decision-making behavioral biases strongly cause the low rate of financial inclusion in Pakistan. The fundamental aim of this research was to investigate the moderating role of financial literacy and how the literacy level of an individual could play a role in overcoming these biases and increasing financial inclusion. The analysis of the data collected by 102 respondents proved the negative impact of self-control, optimism, and herding biases on financial inclusion. Individuals may have savings, but they do not consider the potential investment opportunities of banks and other financial institutions. Their religious beliefs are a major cause of this issue with the banking system.",

People who are highly encouraging see their future positively and do not invest in potential financial products. Optimism is also proved to have a negative relation with financial inclusion. Furthermore, herding behavior results in low inclusion in Pakistan. An individual may herd the irrational choices of other people that are also a leading factor of low inclusion. Only loss aversion positively impacts financial inclusion because the individuals who know the banking system and its terms do not consider it a loss and avail of financial services. Research findings suggest that financial literacy as a moderator positively impacts the relationship between biases and financial inclusion, except for the relationship between loss aversion and financial inclusion. Therefore, the increasing rate of literacy could improve the inclusion level in Pakistan. The negative relation between financial literacy and financial inclusion indicates the low participation of the individual in banking services because of their religious beliefs. In Pakistan, Muslims have strict behavior toward interest, as interest is prohibited in Islam. So, the religious beliefs of the individual restrict them from using banking services. Based on the findings of this research work, a framework could be designed to create awareness and enhance the financial literacy level of households, which will help them recognize financial opportunities by banks and other institutions. Banks also have the advantage of this study as it will help increase their customer base by overcoming the biases of household individuals toward financial decisions. This will also contribute to the financial inclusion program of the State Bank of Pakistan, as increasing individuals into the financial circle will contribute to achieving its financial inclusion goals.",
