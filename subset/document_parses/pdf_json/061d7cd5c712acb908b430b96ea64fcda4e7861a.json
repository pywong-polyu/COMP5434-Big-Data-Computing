The aim of this study was to 4 evaluate the association between recent exposure to ACEIs/ARBs and in-hospital mortality in 5 patients with Methods: We used the data from a nationwide cohort of patients with COVID-19 from the 7 health insurance claims data of South Korea, which were released for research purposes for 8 public health by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea. Patients with COVID-19 9 were identified using the relevant diagnostic code. Propensity score-matching (1:1) was 10 carried out among patients with CVD according to the type of medication (ACEIs/ARBs vs. 11 other), and the risk of death was assessed. 12 Results: A total of 4936 patients with COVID-19 were analyzed, of whom 1048 (21.2%) had 13 CVD. Of the 1048 patients with CVD, 864 (82.4%) received at least one anti-hypertensive 14 medication prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19, including 359 (41.6%) who received 15 ACEIs/ARBs and 505 (58.4%) who received drugs other than ACEIs/ARBs. Using the 16 propensity scores for ACEIs/ARBs use, we matched 305 pairs of patients receiving 17 ACEIs/ARBs and patients receiving other drugs. The recent use of ACEIs/ARBs was not 18 significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in unadjusted analysis (odds ratio [OR], 19",
