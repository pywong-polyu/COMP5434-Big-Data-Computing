Several pathogens are implicated, both viruses and bacteria, one of which, Mycoplasma bovis, is under-researched. This worldwide-distributed bacterium has been shown to be highly resistant in vitro to the main antimicrobials used to treat BRD. Our objective was to monitor the relative prevalence of M. bovis during BRD episodes, its diversity, and its resistance phenotype in relation to antimicrobial use. For this purpose, a two-year longitudinal follow-up of 25 feedlots was organized and 537 nasal swabs were collected on 358 veal calves at their arrival in the lot, at the BRD peak and 4 weeks after collective antimicrobial treatments. The presence of M. bovis was assessed by real-time PCR and culture. The clones isolated were then subtyped (polC subtyping and PFGE analysis), and their susceptibility to five antimicrobials was determined. The course of the disease and the antimicrobials used had no influence on the genetic diversity of the M. bovis strains: The subtype distribution was the same throughout the BRD episode and similar to that already described in France, with a major narrowly-variable subtype circulating, st2. The same conclusion holds for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes: All the clones were already multiresistant to the main antimicrobials used (except for fluoroquinolones) prior to any treatments.

It is a complex viral and/or bacterial infection affecting the upper or lower respiratory tracts in cattle, with a particularly high prevalence in recently weaned calves within the first days or weeks of arrival at the feedlot [2] . Multiple stress factors (weaning, transportation, co-mingling in lots or in markets, changes in diet, weather changes, etc.) with additive effects are known to influence the susceptibility of calves to developing BRD [3] . The percentage of morbidity and mortality can reach 70% but varies with the management system in place, prevention programs and the kind of pathogens involved, bacteria Pathogens 2020, 9, 593 2 of 15 being more often fatal than viruses alone [1] . The disease most often results from an overwhelming, dysregulated host immune response [4] . Classical clinical signs of bacterial BRD include fever over 40 \u2022 C, dyspnea, nasal discharge, coughing and depression with diminished or no appetite [2] . The most common viral agents associated with BRD include Bovine Herpes Virus type 1 (BHV-1), Parainfluenza-3 virus (PI3), Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) and Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV). The main bacteria are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma (M.) bovis [5, 6] . These agents are not all equivalent in terms of pathogenesis, duration of the clinical disease or shedding after exposure [5, 6] . Viral agents are thought to be mainly initiators of the disease that then facilitate colonization by bacterial pathogens or aggravating factors during co-infection [7] . Among bacteria, M. bovis is still regarded as the least well-characterized BRD pathogen [6] [7] [8] . It has been reported to rapidly proliferate in the nasopharynx within the first 14 days of feedlot placement as a preliminary step in the development of BRD [3, 9] .

Detection rate was 2%: 5/271 calves by culture and 6/271 by rtPCR, with a mean Ct of 36.7[25.4-36.8], this difference being compatible with a weak infectious load in the positive calves. Four weeks after the antimicrobial treatment (T2), the presence of M. bovis remained high as determined by rtPCR (49%, 39/79, 12/13 feedlots being positive(Supplementary Table S1) with a mean Ct of 30.4[23.6-36.7].
