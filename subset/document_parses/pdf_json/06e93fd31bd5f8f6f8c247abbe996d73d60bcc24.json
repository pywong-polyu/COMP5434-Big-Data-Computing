SARS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein to enter ACE2-expressing cells. 1 ACE-2 is a component of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation which plays an important role in hypertension.

This postulate also prompted studies on the effect of the ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection. Studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of ACEIs and ARBs on the overall outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection. A pooled analysis of 6 studies showed no statistically significant association between ACEI/ARB use in patients with COVID-19 and mortality. 2 However, this study did not specifically examine this association in patients with hypertension and concurrent COVID-19 infection. Feng et al 3 suggested that the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with hypertension and concurrent COVID-19 infection can reduce mortality. On the other hand, Khera et al 4 showed no significant difference in mortality between patients with hypertension and COVID-19 receiving ACEIs/ARBs and those who were receiving other antihypertensive agents. Small meta-analyses showed lower risk of mortality in patients with concurrent COVID-19 and hypertension who were on ACEI/ARB compared to those who were not.

ACE2 activation has vasodilator properties, and as such a loss of ACE2 expression and function could lead to the development of hypertension. 16 Although not conclusively shown, it is possible that RAS inhibition enhances tissue ACE2 expression and function, and ACE2 upregulation by ACEIs/ARBs might explain the survival benefit associated with their use is patients with hypertension and concurrent COVID-19 infection. 16 Sama et al 17 recently showed a reduction in plasma ACE2 levels in a large number of heart failure patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs.
