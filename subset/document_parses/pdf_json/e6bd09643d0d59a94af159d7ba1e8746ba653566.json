            "text": "Background: Early appropriate antibiotic therapy reduces morbidity and mortality of severe pneumonia. However, the emergence of bacterial resistance requires the earliest use of antibiotics with the narrowest possible spectrum. The Unyvero Hospitalized Pneumonia (HPN, Curetis) test is a multiplex PCR (M-PCR) system detecting 21 bacteria and 19 resistance genes on respiratory samples within 5 h. We assessed the performance and the potential impact of the M-PCR on the antibiotic therapy of ICU patients. Methods: In this prospective study, we performed a M-PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or plugged telescoping catheter (PTC) samples of patients with ventilated HAP or VAP with Gram-negative bacilli or clustered Gram-positive cocci. This study was conducted in 3 ICUs in a French academic hospital: the medical and infectious diseases ICU, the surgical ICU, and the cardio-surgical ICU. A multidisciplinary expert panel simulated the antibiotic changes they would have made if the M-PCR results had been available. Results: We analyzed 95 clinical samples of ventilated HAP or VAP (72 BAL and 23 PTC) from 85 patients (62 males, median age 64 years). The median turnaround time of the M-PCR was 4.6 h (IQR 4.4-5). A total of 90/112 bacteria were detected by the M-PCR system with a global sensitivity of 80% (95% CI, 73-88%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI 99-100). The sensitivity was better for Gram-negative bacteria (90%) than for Gram-positive cocci (62%) (p = 0.005). Moreover, 5/8 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (CTX-M gene) and 4/4 carbapenemases genes (3 NDM, one oxa-48) were detected. The M-PCR could have led to the earlier initiation of an effective antibiotic in 20/95 patients (21%) and to early de-escalation in 37 patients (39%) but could also have led to one (1%) inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Among 17 empiric antibiotic treatments with carbapenems, 10 could have been de-escalated in the following hours according to the M-PCR results. The M-PCR also led to 2 unexpected diagnosis of severe legionellosis confirmed by culture methods.",

            "text": "Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP) are the most common healthcare-associated infections in adults and are the leading causes of death in critical care [1, 2] . HAP and VAP are associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, hospitalization, and increased healthcare cost [3] . They are thus associated with an excess of morbidity and mortality [4] . HAP and VAP may be caused by a wide variety of pathogens and can be polymicrobial [5, 6] . Moreover, multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria, especially Gram-negative bacilli, are increasingly frequently isolated in HAP and VAP and are associated with mortality rates over 50% [7] . Early appropriate antibiotic therapy undoubtedly reduces morbidity and mortality of HAP and VAP, but these infections are responsible for up to half of the consumption of antibiotics in ICU [8, 9] . Therefore, international guidelines advocate the empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics including carbapenems in the treatment of VAP caused by Gram-negative bacilli in the case of prior antibiotic therapy, in patients colonized by multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR), or in any late-onset VAP (more than 5 days after the beginning of mechanical ventilation) [1, 4] . Usually, the time between respiratory sampling and the definitive microbiological results including antibiotic susceptibility testing is at least 48 h, during which time treatment is empirical. However, even very short exposure (1 to 3 days) to carbapenem is associated with a 5fold higher risk of emergence of imipenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in the intestinal microbiota of ICU patients [10] . Intensivists are thus confronted with a permanent dilemma between the initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy and the risk of increasing MDR bacteria [3, 11] by the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

New rapid diagnostic tests, based on molecular methods directly performed on clinical samples, are emerging in the diagnostic market [13] . They allow the identification of the micro-organisms present in the clinical sample and the detection of targeted resistance genes only a few hours after sampling.

The data reviewed were the entire medical file of the patients including clinical, radiological, and Gram staining results related to the episode of pneumonia and medical history with comorbidities as well as previous bacteriological results including carriage, colonization, and infections with susceptibility profiles and previous antimicrobial therapies. Antibiotic changes were split into appropriate and inappropriate changes. Appropriate changes included adequacy, de-escalation, and optimization of the antibiotic therapy, and inappropriate changes included inadequacy, escalation, and de-optimization. We defined adequacy as the introduction of an effective antibiotic on causative bacteria that were not correctly treated before the results of the M-PCR. We defined de-escalation as the appropriate use of a narrower-spectrum antibiotic as described by Weiss et al. for \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [16] . De-escalation was considered (i) when a carbapenem was replaced by another \u03b2-lactam antibiotic; (ii) when piperacillin/tazobactam or a fourth-generation cephalosporin was replaced by amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin, ticarcillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin; and (iii) when a third-generation cephalosporin was replaced by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or In the case of treatment with a combination of \u03b2-lactam plus aminoglycoside, only susceptibility to the \u03b2-lactam was taken into account because monotherapy with aminoglycosides was considered inadequate. We defined optimization as the use of a fourth-generation cephalosporin such as cefepime instead a third-generation cephalosporin for the treatment of AMP-C producing Enterobacteriales (Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, or Morganella morganii) [17] . De-optimization was the opposite. The change was considered as inadequate (inadequacy) when Unyvero results led to a switch from an effective antibiotic to an ineffective antibiotic on causative bacteria. An escalation was the introduction after the results of the M-PCR of an antibiotic with a broader spectrum that was not needed in light of the culture results.",

In two cases, the test missed either an Enterobacter cloacae or a Hafnia alvei and could have led to a switch from cefepime to ceftazidime.

As in our study, Papan et al. reported a better performance of the system for Gram-negative bacteria than for Gram-positive cocci on 79 respiratory samples from children and neonates [18] . This might be due to the cell wall structure of Gram-positive bacteria, which have a thicker For culture, only bacteria that were superior to diagnostic thresholds (10 4 CFU/ml for BAL and 10 3 CFU/ml for PTC) were considered *Organisms not screened on the multiplex PCR system peptidoglycan than Gram-negative bacteria and thus may be more stable to the lysis process required for DNA extraction. In our study, the sensitivity of the M-PCR for polymicrobial samples was lower than the overall sensitivity (73% vs 80%) but this difference was not statistically significant. This potential difference probably deserves to be studied in larger samples of patients. We did not encounter machine failure in our study, but machine failure rates over 10% have been reported in the literature [19, 21] . In our study, the M-PCR had a sensitivity of 100% for the detection of carbapenemase genes but only of 63% for the detection of CTX-M genes. This result is difficult to compare with previous studies due to the low number of samples with resistance genes in all studies [18, 22] . The low CTX-M detection rate (63%) observed in our study may be due to the lack of detection of the CTX-M-9 group by the Unyvero HPN kit which only detects the CTX-M-1 group. Indeed, in a recent publication, the proportion of CTX-M-9 group among ESBLproducing E. coli isolated in VAP was as high as 40% [23] . This is a limitation of the test for the detection of ESBL that may lead to inappropriate antibiotic prescription.",

The green color is used for antibiotic de-escalation and the red color for antibiotic escalation according to Weiss et al (Supplementary material). The gray color is for switches that are neither escalation nor de-escalation of molecular diagnostic tools could be helpful to initiate the optimal empiric antibiotic. In this study, a multidisciplinary expert panel reviewed each case and estimated that the M-PCR results would have led to antibiotic changes in 63/95 (66%) patients (60 appropriate changes and 3 inappropriate). It is important to note that we considered a carbapenem as the only effective therapy in patients infected by an ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. This is in line with the results of the MERINO trial [24] and with recent studies showing a superiority of carbapenems over piperacillin-tazobactam [25] [26] [27] . However, de-escalation to piperacillin-tazobactam could be discussed for stabilized patients infected by bacteria with a MIC under 4 mg/L to piperacillin-tazobactam [28] . Very few studies have assessed the potential impact of a M-PCR system for pneumonia on patient management [29] . In a study on 49 patients with severe HAP, the authors observed that initial empirical treatment was modified in 67.3% of the patients based on the availability of the M-PCR [14] . However, in this study, the authors considered all the pathogens found by the Unyvero system as causative bacteria for the pneumonia and did not report the sensitivity or specificity of the M-PCR as compared to conventional culture. In a case-control study using the BioFire FilmArray (BioMerieux) [30] , the authors described an early modification of the antibiotic therapy in 37/56 (66%) patients with severe pneumonia in the ICU. We identified in our study 3 species of bacteria that are not included in the M-PCR but were involved in 8 pneumonia: Hafnia alvei (n = 5), Citrobacter koseri (n = 2), and Serratia rubidaea (n = 1). The lack of a common marker for Enterobacteriales which could detect the presence of any of the species included in this family was considered as a limit by the expert panel. A recent review also underlined the need to include a larger range of targets to improve the sensitivity [31] . It is thus important to note that these tools, because of their lack of exhaustivity, must be used in addition to conventional culture techniques but cannot replace them. M-PCR equipment and cartridge are more costly than conventional methods, and cost-effectiveness studies are needed to decide which samples should be tested with a M-PCR.",

Moreover, owing to the development of new techniques, M-PCR might become outdated even before they are widely used. Indeed, clinical metagenomics, the comprehensive sequencing of microbial and host genetic material in clinical samples [32] , has the potential to improve microbiological diagnostics [33] . In a recent proof of concept study, Langelier et al. combined microbiological and host transcriptome data in tracheal aspirates of 26 patients with a lower respiratory tract infection in the ICU and identified the causative pathogens with an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.83-0.97); however, this kind of techniques is expensive and not routinely available.",

Indeed, clinical microbiologists are at the interface between physicians and diagnostic tools and can bridge the gap between demand and supply of innovative systems that could help clinicians take the right decisions at the point of care. It is essential to know the spectrum of the panel to avoid missing treatment for HAP or VAP caused by bacteria that are not included in the panel. The results of this study have to be interpreted in light of the wider context of diagnostics in the ICU: accelerating the microbiology diagnosis is only a part of what is needed to improve empiric antimicrobial therapy [34] . Indeed, the time from sampling to diagnosis is often shorter than the delay between the suspicion of infection and sampling or between microbiological results and change of therapy [35, 36] . Full exploitation of the advantages offered by M-PCR requires a re-organization of the clinical microbiology laboratory, an organized implementation of the technique tailored to the routine workflow, and trained physicians to best integrate the results within clinical care [37] .",

We simulated the potential impact of the M-PCR results, but clinical studies are obviously needed to evaluate the impact of a M-PCR system in real-life settings. The design of our study does not allow to easily separate what is directly related to the M-PCR results from the impact of a multidisciplinary review of each file. As with other innovative tools [38] , clinical trials, preferably randomized and multicentric, should be conducted to evaluate clinical outcomes, including adverse outcomes, process improvement, and ecological impact. Special attention should be paid to the integration and implementation of systems into clinical practice and their adoption and utilization by clinicians. While waiting for the results of clinical trials, implementation outcomes such as appropriateness or fidelity may be key intermediate outcomes to study the success of strategies aiming to bring M-PCR systems to the clinical practice [33] . The question of whether or not M-PCR reduces antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance, direct costs, and indirect costs should be a priority area for future research. In our study, each episode of VAP or ventilated HAP was analyzed by a multidisciplinary expert panel of senior intensivists and clinical microbiologists. In routine practice, this may not always be the case and trials should aim to study the potential difficulties of the integration of M-PCR in the clinical practice such as the management of the results in case of lack of experienced clinical staff to interpret the results. Our results are limited regarding the detection of resistance because of a low number of patients with ESBL or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Finally, we only included samples with Gram-negative bacilli or clustered Gram-positive cocci on Gram staining in three ICUs in the same hospital preventing the extrapolation of our results to other samples or other contexts. Indeed, the performance of the M-PCR could be different in another setting characterized by a higher proportion of Gram-positive bacteria and/or a different prevalence of Enterobacterales.",
