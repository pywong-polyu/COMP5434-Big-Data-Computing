            "text": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene. Patients with this disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings give technical insights on how iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors can be derived from SCA7 patients and demonstrate that these cells express molecular and electrophysiological differences that may be indicative of impaired neuronal health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts to establish the cellderived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are needed to develop patient-specific treatments.",

Since the translation of this CAG repeat leads to an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract within the resultant protein, SCA7 is classified as a polyQ repeat disorder. Other diseases with a similar pathophysiology include five different SCAs (SCA 1, 2, 3, 6 and 17), as well as Huntington disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and spinal bulbar muscular atrophy [1] . Clinically, SCA7 patients present with ataxia, dysarthria and visual loss. This is caused by a selective degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors [2] . Symptoms progressively worsen over a period of 10 to 30 years, leading ultimately to brainstem dysfunction, blindness, physical disability and death.",

ATXN7 is known to be a component of the mammalian transcription coactivator complex, STAGA (SPT3-TAF9-ADA-GCN5 acetyltransferase) [3] . This protein has been shown to facilitate the interaction between STAGA and the cone-rod homeobox (CRX) transactivator of photoreceptor genes, linking the function of ATXN7 with the retinal phenotype observed in SCA7 patients [4] . In addition, several studies have highlighted the role of transcriptional aberrations in the neuronal cell dysfunction that precedes the onset of disease symptoms [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . These gene expression changes may arise either directly from alterations in transcriptional regulation by mutant ATXN7, or indirectly, as a consequence of a generalised cellular response to the presence of mutant ATXN7. More recently, dysfunction in cell metabolism has been proposed as an additional pathogenic mechanism [8, 9] .",

South African SCA7 patients also display a unique phenomenon-a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within ATXN7 (rs3774729), which is linked to the mutation in all patients studied to date [14] . Approximately 43% of these individuals are heterozygous for the polymorphism, allowing for allelic discrimination, and providing an ideal target for developing an allele-specific silencing therapy. This haplotype has been shown to extend into other Southern African populations, suggesting that such a therapy may be more widely applicable than was first thought [15] . We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of an allele-specific RNAi treatment in an over-expression cell model of SCA7 [16] , as well as in SCA7 patient fibroblasts [17] . Disease-relevant cell lines generated from these patients are thus of vital importance in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and the development of therapies, as they carry the patient's full genomic sequence, including SNPs which may be used as targets for gene silencing.",

Following the attainment of a wholecell patch, current pulses of between 0 and 10 pA were applied. Individual cells displayed four general types of spiking responses: a purely passive (Fig 2A) , abortive spike (Fig 2B) , single spike ( Fig 2C) and recurrent spiking response (Fig 2D) . These spiking properties are similar to those observed in acute human fetal brain slices [34] , hESC-derived neurons [35] [36] [37] and iPSC-derived neurons [38] . A postmitotic neuron matures by inserting voltage-gated channels into its plasma membrane [39] .

The retinal genes included: arrestin 3 (ARR3); cone-rod homeobox (CRX); guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein); alpha transducing activity polypeptide 1 (GNAT1); Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF); neural retina leucine zipper (NRL); orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2); paired box 6 (PAX6); recoverin (RCVRN); rhodopsin (RHO) and retinal pigment epithelium-specific protein 65kDa (RPE65). As observed in the NPC cells, both ATXN7 (p = 0.04) and KAT2A (p = 0.02) were down regulated in the retinal cells. In addition, we also noticed expression changes in genes that appeared to be specific to the SCA7 photoreceptors. These included GRIA2, encoding the glutamate receptor, ionotropic, AMPA2 (GluR2) (downregulated, p = 0.04); and three retinal-specific genes, OTX2 (upregulated, p = 0.002), RCVRN (downregulated, p = 0.01) and RPE65 (upregulated, p = 0.001). Lastly, and in contrast to the SCA7 NPCs, BEX1 expression appear to be upregulated in SCA7 photoreceptors (p = 0.0006). The opposing BEX1 transcription changes (up in photoreceptors and down in NPCs) may be indicative of a possible differential response by the different cell types to the presence of mutant ATXN7. As with the NPCs, ATXN7 CAG repeat alleles were confirmed using an RT-PCR (S5 Fig). ",

Furthermore, we show that we are able to differentiate these iPSCs from SCA7 into neurons and retinal photoreceptors. The SCA7 patient iPSCs generated in this study were capable of differentiation to NPC, and subsequent self-renewal for up to 30 passages, with morphological similarities to neuroepithelial cells, as has been previously reported (20) . The generation of sustainable populations of neural progenitors from SCA7 patients is significant, as these cells may act as a starting point for the generation of numerous diseaseaffected neuronal subtypes, which can be expanded for large-scale experiments at relatively low cost. Both patient-and control-derived NPCs appeared capable of differentiating into neurons expressing \u03b2III-Tubulin and GABA, with comparable efficiencies. This corresponds with results from previous studies of neurodegenerative conditions, including other polyQ diseases (25, 26, 33) , which found no difference in differentiation potential between patient and control iPSCs. In addition, no obvious difference in the ability to generate GABA-positive processes could be detected between SCA7 and control iPSC-derived neurons.",

We do acknowledge a major limitation in these findings being significant variability across cell lines. This is likely due to unappreciated differences in culturing conditions between cell lines, which may have masked our ability to detect a reliable difference in spiking responses caused by the mutant ATXN7. Alternatively, it may be that mutant ATXN7 does not affect the spiking properties of neurons at early stages of development, suggesting that an extrinsic stressor of some kind might be required to elicit a pathological phenotype. Indeed, similar functional analysis of neurons derived from patients with SCA3, a related polyQ-repeat disorder, showed no difference between control and patient cells until neurons were excited via bath application of glutamate [33] .",

Patient cells had more negative resting membrane potentials and increased input resistance compared to control cells. A more hyperpolarised membrane potential is usually associated with neuronal maturity whist the high input resistance is usually associated with neuronal immaturity. These conflicting findings will need to be further explored in future studies to provide a more conclusive understanding as to how SCA7 specific changes cause changes in neuronal maturation or drive alternative functional alterations. We can, however, postulate that the more hyperpolarised membrane potential in the patient cells may be indicative of a reduction in the excitability of neurons containing mutant ATXN7 in response to synaptic input. Reductions in Purkinje cell excitability have previously been observed in animal models of SCA1 and SCA2 [40, 41] and could represent a common functional endpoint in several polyQ disorders [42] . Future work will involve exploring the underlying mechanisms that might explain these differences in resting membrane potential and input resistance. Importantly, it will be necessary to repeat this physiological functional analysis on iPSC-derived neurons of the Purkinje cell lineage in order to fully recapitulate the cerebellar-specific elements of the disease using the recently published protocols [43, 44] .",

No obvious aggregates were observed in either the iPSCs or the differentiated cells (Figs 1E, 1F and 4A ). This strongly suggests that the differentiated cells represent a population of cells at an early stage of development, rather than recapitulating the age or disease stage of the patient from which the primary cells were derived. Previous studies employing similar models for the study of neurodegenerative disease have raised concerns regarding the relevance of modelling adolescent-and adult-onset diseases over the short lifespan of cultured neurons [46, 47] . These findings suggest that pathological hallmarks of disease such as the formation of aggregates may take decades to manifest, requiring the gradual accumulation of toxic proteins as a result of age-dependent deficiencies in protein homeostasis. Although some studies suggest that aggregates may be detected at earlier stages, the major determinants of aggregate formation remain the length of the polyQ expansion, and the levels of expression of the polyQ-containing protein [48, 49] . Thus, a cell line derived from an individual expressing endogenous levels of a moderately expanded ATXN7 protein may be less likely to demonstrate an observable cellular phenotype. Alternatively, the aggregation of mutant protein may require prolonged periods in culture, or an exogenous trigger, such as exposure to oxidative stress or neurotoxins, or excitation-induced calcium influx [33] .",

The iPSC-derived NPCs and retinal photoreceptors displayed changes in expression of these key transcripts, suggesting that these cells may serve as useful models of neurodegenerative disease progression and for the testing of potential therapies (Figs 1D and 4H ). It should be noted that the low cell numbers and heterogeneity of mature neuronal cultures proved a challenge to obtaining significant biological material to perform reliable expression analysis. Hence, the decision was made to perform this analysis on the relatively homogeneous NPC cultures, with the view that these cells may yield insights into the early cellular dysfunction underlying SCA7 pathology.",

Previous studies in SCA7 patient fibroblasts and mouse models have demonstrated a disease-associated increase in ATXN7 expression, mediated by non-coding RNAs [54, 57] . The contradictory decrease in ATXN7 expression in SCA7 NPCs and photoreceptors observed here could reflect the early developmental stage of the cells, but further analysis of the regulatory pathways will be required in order to elucidate the basis for this apparent decrease in the disease-causing protein in affected cell types. KAT2A encodes the histone acetyltransferase GCN5. Although there are no established links between ATXN7 and the expression of KAT2A, numerous studies have identified a functional interaction between the two proteins, which results in changes in STAGA activity in in vitro and in vivo models of SCA7 [4, 58, 59] . Loss of GCN5 expression has been shown to result in increased retinal degeneration in SCA7 mice [58] .",

None of these target genes (including ARR3, GNAT1 or RHO) showed consistent changes in patient cells. However, transcriptional changes in the expression of additional retinal genes, including OTX2 (involved in the determination of photoreceptor cell fate), RCVRN (expressed in photoreceptors), and RPE65 (expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells), were noted in the patient derived cells. A significant degree of heterogeneity was observed in the differentiated retinal cells, both in terms of morphology, and gene/protein expression (Fig 4) , therefore additional investigation will be required on additional iPSC cell lines to determine whether these differences can be attributed to experimental differences or pathogenic mechanisms.",

Whilst, in this study, comparisons were not made between isogenic geneedited lines, they do retain significantly similar background genetics, as they are all generated from the same immediate family, minimising (to a degree) the extensive differences between unrelated individuals. Future studies need to will focus on recruitment, in order to extend these investigations in a larger patient cohort and to allow for a greater number of cell lines to be produced. To control for the inherent genetic variability associated with comparisons between unrelated patients, future work should include the generation of isogenic control lines, by means of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. This approach has already been demonstrated in editing trinucleotide repeat expansions in both Huntington's disease [62, 63] and myotonic dystrophy [64] . It remains, however, technically challenging to target the disease-causing repeat in ataxin-7 and retain the endogenous regulatory landscape. Due to the sequence homology of the wild -type allele, such a strategy would likely render the wild-type protein non-functional via a frameshift.",

From the three patients (two SCA7 and one control), 4 iPSC clones where derived (2 SCA7 lines and 2 Control lines). (TIF) S2 Fig. Representative karyogram from a iPSC line. Karyogram from iPSC clone P1 showing no gross abnormalities. (TIF) S3 Fig. iPSC characterisation. (A) Representative immunocytochemistry image showing positive OCT4 staining (red, top panel) and TRA-1-60 staining (green, bottom panel) in iPSCs clone 47Q. (B), Immunocytochemistry in newly infected fibroblasts (top panel) and iPSC colonies (bottom panel) co-stained with primary antibodies against OCT4 (red) and the viral nucleocapsid protein (green) showed effective silencing of the reprogramming Sendai virus. DAPI staining shown in blue. Expression of pluripotency markers in iPSC lines, determined by qRT-PCR. All five iPSC lines (47Q, 41Q, CON A , CON B ) expressed OCT4 (C), SOX2 (D) and NANOG (E), compared to low expression levels in the original donor fibroblasts (F), or cells subjected to the retinal differentiation protocol for 10 days (D10, pooled data from lines 41Q and CON B ). All levels shown relative to beta (\u03b2)-actin. (TIF) S4 Fig. iPSCs differentiation. iPSCs were differentiated to three germ layers in vitro and validated by staining with appropriate markers: mesoderm using smooth muscle actin (SMA), ectoderm using \u03b2-III-tubulin, and endoderm using alpa-fetoprotein (AFP). Nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (blue). Images are representative of iPSCs from the 47Q patient clone. (TIF) S5 Fig. Quantitative PCR results from SCA7 derived fibroblasts. There were no significant transcriptional changes in SCA7 patient-derived fibroblasts compared to unaffected control fibroblasts.
