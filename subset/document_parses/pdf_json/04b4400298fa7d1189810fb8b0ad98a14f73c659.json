Stroke in adult patients has been extensively reported and is thought to be due to inflammation driven hypercoagulability with thrombotic microangiopathy playing a major role in COVID-19 syndromes. 8 A characteristic radiologic feature noted in our cohort is the splenial lesion. Among other neuroradiologic features, the same splenial findings had been previously reported and also with a favorable clinical outcome, during the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection 5 and delayed hyperinflammatory syndrome. 9 Of interest, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was undetected in 24 (32%) of children. One plausible explanation for this is that antibody concentrations may have decayed to below the threshold of detection by the time testing was clinically available in our patients. 10 Alternatively, antibody specificity and concentrations are known to differ in children with PIMS-TS in comparison to adults with COVID-19, 11 explaining an incomplete seroprevalence in this PIMS-TS cohort. Seronegative patients with PIMS-TS were phenotypically similar to seropositive patients with PIMS-TS, presented in the period of the first surge of cases in the UK COVID-19 pandemic, and were negative by PCR and relevant serology to extensive virologic testing.",

These findings support the hypothesis that PIMS-TS-associated neurologic involvement comprises a systemic para or postinfectious immunemediated phenomenon. A study from our institution has demonstrated that there is a distinct immunophenotype with high levels of interleukin activation in children with PIMS-TS. 12 The key question of how systemic inflammation might Box plot graphs comparing highest mean inflammatory markers.

Similar difficulties are described shortterm complications of ICU admissions in children. 14 However, the important observation in our study is that those with residual reported symptoms had higher inflammatory markers at presentation. Systemic hyperinflammation may acutely influence brain structural connections and could lead to longterm neurocognitive sequelae, as seen in some patients following autoimmune encephalitis. 15 This single-center retrospective observational study spans a short period where the case definition and management of a newly evolving disease entity was being established and has inherent limitations. The full spectrum of the neurologic symptoms would have been underestimated in children in critical care and may result in inaccurate cross-sectional comparison. In addition, treatment effects cannot be systematically evaluated, as within this cohort, virtually all have been given first-line immune therapy (70/75, 93%), and that therapy was variably escalated to second line in 28/75 (37%).",
