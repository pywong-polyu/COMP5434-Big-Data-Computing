For HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), combination therapy has proved life-saving. The targets of direct-acting antivirals for HCV infection are NS3/4A protease, NS5A phosphoprotein and NS5B polymerase. Differential visualization of drug-resistant and -susceptible RNA genomes within cells revealed that resistant variants of NS3/4A protease and NS5A phosphoprotein are cisdominant, ensuring their direct selection from complex environments. Confocal microscopy revealed that RNA replication complexes are genome-specific, rationalizing the non-interaction of wild-type and variant products. No HCV antivirals yet display the dominance of drug susceptibility shown for capsid proteins of other viruses. However, effective inhibitors of HCV polymerase exact such high fitness costs for drug resistance that stable genome selection is not observed. Barriers to drug resistance vary with target biochemistry and detailed analysis of these barriers should lead to the use of fewer drugs.",

            "text": "The emergence of drug-resistant variants follows basic evolutionary principles, requiring spontaneous mutations as well as selective pressure, so that beneficial mutations increase the progeny size of genomes that bear them. The genetic diversity in RNA viral genomes results from the high error frequencies incurred by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which occur at approximately 4 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 errors for each nucleotide synthesized (Sanju\u00e1n et al., 2010) . Given the iterative copying of positive and negative strands, much higher cumulative error frequencies are observed, even during a single cycle of infection (Sanju\u00e1n et al., 2010; Acevedo et al., 2014) . When more than one mutation is required to confer drug resistance, the outgrowth of drug resistance can be delayed (Bloom et al., 2010) . As a result, treatment with combinations of drugs can be extremely effective at suppressing siblings. If the drug target is, for example, a subunit of an oligomeric complex and subunits from different genomes have the opportunity to mix, chimeric oligomers often form. At the time of its creation, the drug-resistant genome will be a minority species, and such chimeras would be predominantly composed of the drug-bound, susceptible components thus incapacitating the entire oligomeric structure. Such 'phenotypic masking' was originally invoked to explain the very low frequency of foot-and-mouth-disease escape variants following selection with neutralizing antibodies when passaged at high multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (Holland et al., 1989) .",

The high cost to viral fitness of Sofosbuvir-resistant variants is sufficient to explain its high barrier to resistance. There are currently no antivirals directed against HCV core protein; however, it is likely to be a dominant drug target. We used differential hybridization of RNA probes to detect two different genomic RNAs in a single cell by confocal microscopy and by flow cytometry. This analysis showed the cis-dominance of HCV viruses that are resistant to inhibitors of either NS3/ 4A protease or NS5A phosphoprotein, consistent with the rapid outgrowth of drug-resistance in patients of these two inhibitor classes.",

To mimic such mixed infections, we have previously employed co-infection of cultured cells with drug-susceptible and drug-resistant viruses at high MOIs to ensure mixed infection (Tanner et al., 2014; Mateo et al., 2015) . For HCV, it is not practical to use high MOIs to achieve co-infection due to the difficulty of obtaining sufficiently high-titer viral stocks. Thus, we needed to develop an approach to distinguish between uninfected, singly infected and co-infected cells in relatively sparsely infected cell populations ( Figure 1A) .",

A recently developed branched DNA probe technology allows the generation of sufficiently sensitive RNA probes to identify single molecules within cells, but requires approximately 1000 nucleotides of differential probe hybridization to achieve specificity (Affymetrix Inc, 2016) . To create a viral strain with this extreme dissimilarity from wild-type virus, we tested the viability of three different codon-altered versions of the JFH1 variant of HCV ( Figure 1B) . Each mutated version contained 200-300 nucleotide changes that did not alter the protein sequence (Figure 1-figure supplements 1-3). Of these codon-altered (CA) variants, CA-1 was inviable, CA-2 showed reduced viral protein accumulation, and CA-3 showed accumulation of both viral protein and RNA to abundances equivalent to those of the wild-type virus ( Figure 1C) . Recently, detailed analysis of covarying nucleotides within the HCV coding region has identified the location of several previously unknown functional RNA secondary structures (Pirakitikulr et al., 2016) . Interestingly, CA-1 contains two such regions and CA-2 contains one, which correlates with decreasing viability, while CA-3 contains no such regions (Figure 1-figure supplements 1-3) (Pirakitikulr et al., 2016) . Thus, subsequent experiments were performed only with CA-3. This variant, now termed 'CA' virus, contains 247 synonymous mutations over a 918-nucleotide region that spans the coding sequences for most of NS2 and the N-terminus of NS3 (Figure 1 ",

            "text": "To test the genetic properties of viruses that are resistant to NS3/4A inhibitors, we employed the original NS3/4A inhibitor, BILN-2061 ( Figure 3A ) (Lamarre et al., 2003) . Like other NS3/4A inhibitors, BILN-2061 treatment rapidly allows the selection of drug resistant variants both in tissue culture and in patients (Lamarre et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2004) . Given the ease of outgrowth of drug-resistant variants, we hypothesized that NS3/4A was not a dominant drug target and that drug resistance would be genetically dominant. NS3-D168A is the prototypic mutation associated with resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors. Asp168 is in close proximity to the protease active site ( Figure 3B ). The ability of the NS3-D168A mutation to confer resistance to BILN-2061 was confirmed in both the WT and CA backgrounds ( Figure 3 -figure supplement 1). As shown schematically in Figure 3D , the ability to track cells that are uninfected (U), singly infected with drug-susceptible virus (S), infected with both susceptible and resistant virus (S + R) and singly infected with drug-resistant virus (R), can reveal dominance relationships during co-infection. In the absence of a drug, all viral populations should be present. However, in the presence of a drug, three outcomes are possible depending on the genetic outcome within the R + S population. If drug resistance were trans-dominant ( Figure 3E ), the drug-resistant virus would rescue the drugsusceptible genomes and all viruses in R + S cells would survive in the presence of the drug. S cells would drop into the U population, and R cells would survive. If drug resistance were cis-dominant ( Figure 3F ), only the R viruses in the R + S cells would survive, because the drug-resistant proteins would be unable to rescue the S viruses in the same cell. Consequently, the R + S cells would drop into the R population. If drug susceptibility were dominant ( Figure 3G ), all viruses in the R + S cells would be cleared, and the R + S cells, like the S cells, would drop into the U population, and only the R cells would continue to replicate.",

Cells were infected for 72 hr at MOIs such that all four populations were represented, followed by 36 hr of continued incubation in the absence or presence of 2 mM BILN-2061. Cells were then harvested, fixed, co-stained with wild-type and codon-altered RNA probe sets and analyzed by flow cytometry. All four cell types appeared in the absence of BILN-2061 ( Figure 3H ,I). In the BILN-2061-treated samples ( Figure 3J ,K), the susceptible S population shifted to the U cells as expected. The S + R cells, on the other hand, shifted to the R population upon drug treatment. Thus, the drug-resistant viral genomes in the co-infected cells could replicate, but could not rescue the drug-susceptible ones. Data from this and replicate experiments ( Figure 3I ,K) confirmed the quantitative shift of S + R cells into the R population upon drug treatment. We conclude that, for the NS3/4A target, drug-resistant genomes are cis-dominant for the 1:1 ratio of S and R viruses tested here. We also tested whether over-expressed drug-resistant NS3/4A precursors could rescue BILN-2061-susceptible virus ( proteins are drug targets, drug-resistant products will enhance the propagation of only those genomes that encode them, allowing powerful selection for drug resistance.",

To investigate whether a related compound, R1479 (Klumpp et al., 2006) , exacted a similar cost to viral fitness to drug-resistant variants, we attempted to recover R1479-resistant viruses for dominance testing. JFH1 was passaged for multiple rounds of infection in the . Each mutation was introduced independently into the JFH1 genome and RNA transfections were performed. The T481A genome was the only variant to show any viral RNA production by 7 or 21 days post-transfection. We noticed that F427L and T481A were always isolated together. To test whether these mutations could together increase viral fitness, JFH1 viruses were generated that contained both mutations. Viruses with the mutations separate or together were passaged extensively in the presence of R1479. Occasional resistant outgrowths were observed, but none conferred sustained growth ( Figure 3 -figure supplement 3C). Thus, like Sofosbuvir, the poor viability of mutant viruses resistant to R1479 precludes the ability to perform further genetic analysis but provides an excellent paradigm for antiviral development.",

            "text": "NS5A is highly oligomeric (Sun et al., 2015; Tellinghuisen et al., 2005) and we were curious as to whether drug resistance or drug susceptibility would be dominant during viral infections. This idea seemed promising because exogenously expressed NS5A has a dominant-negative effect on the growth of HCV replicons (Graziani and Paonessa, 2004) . Additionally, the NS5A inhibitors, as a class, display EC 50 's in the low picomolar range (Gao, 2013) , making them among the most potent antiviral compounds ever identified. Assuming uniform inhibitor concentrations in cells and in medium, it has been estimated that only a small fraction of NS5A molecules should be bound to drugs under inhibitory conditions (Sun et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2016) . Thus, it seemed mechanistically likely that drug-bound NS5A proteins from drug-susceptible viruses could be dominant inhibitors of NS5A encoded by newly arising drug-resistant ones. However, NS5A inhibitors have generally demonstrated low barriers to resistance in patients. Our goal was gain mechanistic insight into this dichotomy. The structures of two such potent NS5A inhibitors, SR2486 (also known as BMS-346) (Lemm et al., 2011) and Daclatasvir (Gao et al., 2010) are shown in Figure 4A . Mutations of Tyr93 to Asp or His confer resistance to a broad array of NS5A inhibitors (Gao et al., 2016) . Tyr93 is located near an NS5A dimer interface shown in the crystal structure ( Figure 4B ) . Thus, this interface is postulated to be part of the binding site for the NS5A inhibitor class. The Y93N and Y93H mutations were introduced into both the wild-type and codon-altered viruses. As shown in Figure 4C , the Y93H mutation conferred resistance to both SR2486 and Daclatasvir while the Y93N mutation conferred resistance only to SR2486.",

            "text": "To test whether susceptibility to NS5A inhibitors was dominant in the context of viral infections, we analyzed U, S, S + R and R cell populations by flow cytometry as previously performed for the NS3/4A inhibitor in Figure 3 . Huh-7.5.1 cells were coinfected with CA and WT-Y93N viruses for 72 hr ( Figure 4D ). Cells were then treated with DMSO or 500nM SR2486 for 24 hr, harvested, fixed, costained for WT and CA vRNAs and analyzed by flow cytometry. In the absence of the NS5A inhibitor, all four populations, U, S, R + S and R were observed ( Figure 4E ,F). In the presence of SR2486, the S population of cells dropped into the U population as expected. As was the case in Figure 3 , the co-infected R + S population of cells dropped into the R population. Thus, resistance to NS5A inhibitor SR2486 in the context of viral infection was genetically dominant and the lack of rescue of the S virus with which it was mixedly infected shows that drug resistance is also cis-dominant. HCV infected cells become resistant to superinfection upon expression of non-structural proteins (Schaller et al., 2007; Tscherne et al., 2007) . Due to this superinfection exclusion, it is likely that all coinfected cells arise through nearly synchronous infection throughout the course of the experiment. To control for any effects on selection that may occur due to the differential timing of coinfections that occurs over the initial 72 hr incubation period, we performed the same experiment with higher titer virus and a single cycle of infection in the absence of drug. Huh7.5.1 cells were infected at an MOI of 1 focus-forming unit (FFU)/cell with CA and WT-Y93N viruses and incubated for only 24 hr before drug treatment. Cells were then incubated in the absence and presence of 500nM SR2486 for an additional 24 hr. In this case, we also observe cis-dominance of drug resistant WT-Y93N genomes, indicating that asynchronous coinfection has no effect on selection ( Figure 4G) . Finally, the cis-dominance of Daclatasvir-resistant WT-Y93H was observed when coinfected with drug susceptible virus (S) in the absence and presence of Daclatasvir ( Figure 4H ). We conclude that NS5A, despite being an oligomeric species is not a dominant drug target. Instead, genomes resistant to NS5A remain drug resistant in co-infected cells but do not rescue drug-susceptible viruses present in the same cell. This is consistent with the observed outgrowth of viruses that are resistant to NS5A both in cultured cells and in patients, and with an earlier report that at least some functions of NS5A act exclusively in cis (Fridell et al., 2011) .",

As previously demonstrated, two different NS5As expressed from the same RNA can associate, while NS5A molecules expressed from different constructs could not (Berger et al., 2014) . We were curious whether the dominance phenotypes were altered if we forced NS5A alleles to mix. To test whether exogenously expressed drug-susceptible NS5A proteins could co-assemble with drug-resistant NS5A, we utilized the previously described HCV plasmid that expresses HA-tagged and GFP-tagged NS5A within the same polyprotein but does not support genome replication ( Figure 5A) . Constructs that contained all combinations of drug-susceptible NS5A (S) and the drug-resistant Y93N variant (R) were created. Upon transfection, all tagged proteins were expressed and can be observed in Figure 5 (Input, Panels B,C). Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies revealed that the GFPtagged and HA-tagged NS5A proteins were present in the same complexes in the presence or absence of SR2486. Therefore, as has been shown previously, mixed oligomers can form upon coexpression within the same polyprotein (Berger et al., 2014) . Furthermore, these interactions are not disrupted by drug treatment or by drug-resistant mutations ( Figure 5B ,C).",

All S and R combinations of NS5A co-localized at discrete membrane-associated complexes characteristic of HCV infection in the absence of drug ( Figure 5D , top panel). However, in the presence of SR2486, membrane-associated complex formation was inhibited in R:S and S:S expressing cells and observed only in R:R expressing cells ( Figure 5D, bottom panel) . The dispersal of NS5A signal upon drug treatment in the presence of S protein makes NS5A protein appear less abundant ( Figure 5D ). However, the immunoblots demonstrate that no such decrease in expression occurs as we observe equal levels of NS5A protein independent of allele or the presence of drug ( Figure 5B ,C). One hallmark of HCV infection is the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (Miyanari et al., 2007; Romero-Brey et al., 2012) . Electron microscopy performed by high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution, to preserve membrane structure, revealed many lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of cells expressing S:S, R:R and S:R combinations of NS5As in the absence of inhibitor ( Figure 5E,F) . However, in the presence of SR2486, only the R:R cells displayed the accumulation of lipid droplets ( Figure 5E , G). Therefore, using both assays, the presence of drug-susceptible NS5A prevented drug-resistant phenotypes from being displayed, and thus drug-susceptibility was genetically dominant. This confirmed our original hypothesis that NS5A had the potential to be a dominant drug target.",

Identification and quantification the vRNA puncta in coinfected cells was determined computationally using Volocity software.

Failure of NS5A proteins to mix during infection is a likely explanation for the cis-dominance of drug resistance observed in cultured cells (Figure 4) . These circumstances account for the ready outgrowth of drug resistance in patients (Gao et al., 2016) , even though NS5A is highly oligomeric. (Berger et al., 2014) were created to co-express HA-and GFP-tagged NS5A alleles. Huh7-Lunet-T7 cells were transfected with pTM-Dual-NS5A constructs that contained two drug-resistant (R), two drug susceptible (S), or mixed alleles of NS5A. Proteins from transfected cell extracts that were incubated in the absence (B) or presence (C) of SR2486 were subjected to SDS-PAGE without further fractionation (Input) or after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies (IP aHA). The gel was subjected to immunoblotting with GFP or HA antibodies as indicated. (D) Cells were transfected with dual-NS5A constructs in the absence or presence of SR2486 for 24 hr. Cells were then fixed, stained with anti-HA antibodies and visualized by confocal microscopy. Representative images from over 25 cells are presented. (E) Cells transfected with dual-NS5A constructs that expressed drug-susceptible (S) and drug-resistant (R) alleles as shown were prepared for electron microscopy by highpressure freezing and freeze-substitution and visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Even when drug-resistant NS5A was overexpressed in a precursor form, no rescue of drug-susceptible virus was detected (Figure 3-figure supplement 2C ). It has previously been shown that when HA-and GFP-tagged NS5A molecules were expressed on different constructs such as those depicted in Figure 5A , no mixed complexes were formed (Berger et al., 2014) . Thus, even though high-order NS5A oligomers are formed in infected cells, it is unlikely that these are mixed-allele oligomers, preventing dominant inhibition of drug-resistant HCV.",

This has led to abandoned usage and development of many otherwise promising antivirals. To decrease the frequency with which drug-resistant variants arise, combinations of antivirals that, individually, exhibit low barriers to resistance are often used. When drug-resistant variants are first formed intracellularly, through error-prone RNA replication, they arise in a population that includes parental and sibling drug-susceptible viruses. Several genetic relationships between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible genomes are possible. First, the drug resistance of the new variants has the potential to be genetically dominant, and rescue both resistant and susceptible viral genomes. Alternatively, drug resistance can be cis-dominant, with the drug-resistant products rescuing only the genomes that encode them.

The anticipation, which proved to be correct, was that inhibitors of NS3/4A would prove useful in combination therapies (Feld et al., 2014; Lawitz et al., 2014) . We have used flow cytometry to identify cell populations that are co-infected with HCV that is susceptible or resistant at a 1:1 ratio, to protease inhibitors. Within these cells, the drug-resistant genomes replicated, but the drugsusceptible genomes did not. We therefore conclude that NS3/4A inhibitor resistance is cis-dominant (Figure 3) , which should allow the rapid and specific selection for outgrowth from its cell of origin.",

The original characterizations of the NS3/4A protease suggested that cleavage of the NS3/4A junction occurred in cis, but that cleavages at the 4A/4B, 4B/5A and 5A/5B junctions could all occur in trans (Bartenschlager et al., 1994) . We felt that it was therefore, more likely, that drug-resistant NS3/4A could rescue drug-susceptible virus within the same cell. NS3/4A is not known to assemble into high-order oligomers in the same manner as NS5A, and we therefore did not anticipate drug-susceptible NS3/4A would be trans-dominant. Furthermore, a trans cleavage assay demonstrated that a NS4B-5B polyprotein could be cleaved by NS3/4A supplied in trans (Romero-Brey et al., 2015) . However, the trans-cleavage system does not result in membranous web formation that would accompany genome sequestration. Other groups have reported a different result, that defective NS3 mutants cannot be rescued in trans by replicons with functional NS3/4A (Kazakov et al., 2015; Appel et al., 2005) . Our interpretation of these studies is that NS3/4A is likely physically able to Figure 6 continued (C) Huh7.5.1 cells were coinfected with CA and WT-Y93N at a MOI of 1 FFU/cell for 24 hr.

(E) Depiction of the clonal nature of individual RNA replication sites (Adapted from Figure 9 in Zayas et al., 2016] ). Membrane invaginations house either drugresistant (red) or drug-susceptible (blue) genomes. In the model, the RNA replication sites are segregated and therefore only the RNA from drugresistant virus is amplified in the presence of inhibitors of RNA replication. It is visually suggested that NS5A molecules that bring core protein to lipid droplets for viral assembly mix on this surface and that this could lead to genetic dominance of drug susceptibility at a packaging step. cleave in trans in cells, but requires access to the alternate precursor proteins in order for this to occur. Therefore, cis-dominance of drug-resistance is likely the result of a lack of free-mixing of NS3/ 4A encoded by different vRNAs within the same cell.",

The ease with which resistant viruses were selected suggested that drug resistance was either dominant or cis-dominant. This was somewhat surprising, given that NS5A is oligomeric and the NS5A inhibitors are extremely potent, and have been postulated to function at sub-stoichiometric ratios to NS5A protein (Gao, 2013) . Indeed, when drug-susceptible and drug-resistant NS5A protein were co-expressed in the present study, hetero-oligomers formed and the biological phenotypes of the drug-susceptible protein were dominant ( Figure 5) . Nonetheless, single-cell analysis of cells coinfected at a 1:1 ratio with NS5A inhibitor-susceptible and -resistant viruses showed, as with the NS3/4A inhibitor, that resistance to both SR2486 and Daclatasvir was cis-dominant ( Figure 4) .",

Genome-specific RNA probing of co-infected cells revealed that both the negative strands and positive strands from the two viruses were present at physically distinct locations ( Figure 6 ). It is therefore highly probable that membrane-associated proteins such as HCV NS3/4A and NS5A do not mix within individual RNA replication complexes. However, not all mutations in a particular viral product should lead to the same defect with the same genetic properties. For example, we show here that viruses that are defective in a function of NS5A in RNA replication complexes are not rescued and have no effect on the outgrowth of drug-resistant variants. However, NS5A also plays an important role in packaging and assembly of mature HCV particles on lipid droplets (Miyanari et al., 2007; Boson et al., 2017) . Lipid droplets are large and form adjacent to RNA replication complexes. In Figure 6E , we have depicted the possibility that NS5A molecules encoded by distinct RNA replication complexes might mix on the surface of these lipid droplets. However, if replication of the drug-susceptible genomes is inhibited, contribution of their encoded proteins to any oligomers on the surface of lipid droplets should be minimal. In this vain, a hypothetical NS5A inhibitor that allowed RNA replication but inhibited the function of NS5A in particle assembly might have different genetic properties than the NS5A inhibitors currently in use.",

Thus, when antiviral targets are capsid proteins, drug susceptibility can be genetically dominant by suppressing the outgrowth of drug-resistant virus within the cell in which it is first generated (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005; Tanner et al., 2014; Kirkegaard et al., 2016) . For HCV, very few inhibitors of capsid function have been identified, and their inhibition of viral growth is not sufficiently robust to make genetic experiments possible (Kota et al., 2010) . It is therefore not yet possible to test if, as we hypothesize, drug-susceptible virus will prove to be a dominant inhibitor of drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, however, epitope-tagged HCV core protein can form mixed disulfide-bonded core oligomers (Kushima et al., 2010) .",
