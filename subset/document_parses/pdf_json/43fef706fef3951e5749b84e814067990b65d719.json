However, little is known about the prevalence of low housing quality among low-income smokers. Using correlations and logistic regression, we examined associations among eight housing quality indicatorspests, water leaks, mold, lead paint, and working smoke detectors, appliances, heating, and air conditioningand between housing quality and social needs, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, sleep problems, and self-rated health in a community-based sample of 786 low-income smokers from 6 states. Most participants were female (68%), and White (45%) or African-American (43%). One in four (27%) completed less than high school education, and 41% reported annual pre-tax household income of less than $10,000. Housing quality problems were common. Most participants (64%) reported at least one problem in their home, and 41% reported two or more problems, most commonly pest infestations (40%), water leaks (22%), lack of air conditioning (22%) and mold (18%). Lack of heat and air conditioning were correlated, as were water leaks and mold. Using logistic regression analyses controlling for participant demographic characteristics, we found that reporting more housing quality problems was associated with greater odds of worse mental and physical health outcomes. Multiple health threats, including housing quality, depressive symptoms, stress, poor sleep, and financial strain may be mutually reinforcing and compound the health consequence of smoking. Future research should seek to replicate these findings in other samples, and examine associations longitudinally to better understand causality.",

Consistent with literature examining the mental health impacts of poor housing quality (Evans et al., 2003; Wells and Harris, 2007) , the magnitude of association was stronger with depression, stress, and sleep than self-rated health. One possible explanation for the smaller effect size is that self-rated health may be more strongly influenced by factors common among smokers, such as shortness of breath, than by housing quality. Prior research has proposed several potential underlying mechanisms that could explain how housing quality affects mental health, including anxiety about structural hazards, worry and lack of control over maintenance and management practices (Evans et al., 2003) , and social withdrawal (Wells and Harris, 2007) . Environmental exposures such as lack of heating or air conditioning can also disrupt thermoregulation, a key mechanism regulating sleep (Okamoto-Mizuno and Mizuno, 2012) . Improvements in housing quality have led to reduced psychological distress in some low-income populations (Wells and Harris, 2007; Evans et al., 2000) .",

Smokers experiencing financial strain may have less money to allocate toward housing or home improvement, especially when accounting for cigarette costs. A 2012 study found that lowincome smokers nationally spent approximately 14% of their annual income on cigarettes (Farrelly et al., 2012) . Poorer neighborhoods are disproportionately targeted by tobacco industry advertising (Barbeau et al., 2005) . Prior research showed smokers spend less on housing costs than non-smokers, and the difference in spending is larger among lowincome samples (Busch et al., 2004) . This suggests that cigarette expenditures may leave less money for housing expenditures, particularly for low-income smokers (Busch et al., 2004) . It is possible that for some low-income smokers, quitting smoking might result in reallocating money previously spent on cigarettes toward an improved housing situation; thus, providing a dual health benefit from both smoking cessation and lower environmental risks. Smokers may weigh these health benefits as less impactful compared with the perceived cons of quitting, including losing contact with friends who smoke or feeling less capable of dealing with stress (McKee et al., 2005) .",

Housing quality problems were common in our sample, yet are not always assessed by social needs screening tools (National Association of Community Health Centers, 2016; Page-Reeves et al., 2016; Health Leads, 2018) . Given the strong and consistent associations between housing quality and mental and physical health outcomes in this study, adding such items to social needs screeners should be considered. If housing quality concerns are identified during screening, providers could advise patients on environmental mitigation strategies to reduce allergens such as pests or mold, or refer patients to community programs that assist with larger structural repairs (Bryant-Stephens et al., 2021) . Social needs interventions that improve housing quality might not only help eliminate harmful exposures, but also improve mental health and other outcomes. This was a cross-sectional study and causality cannot be determined. All data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, when housing insecurity was heightened, particularly for low-income populations (Benfer et al., 2021) . While an eviction moratorium, multiple federal stimulus payments, and expanded unemployment benefits were enacted to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on Americans' economic security, requests to 2-1-1 helplines for rent and other housing-related assistance increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kreuter et al., 2020) .",

Housing satisfaction might reflect perceptions of housing quality, but also other factors such as satisfaction with cost or location. The current study did not examine these factors, and future research could examine more closely factors related to housing satisfaction and whether they moderate the relationship between housing quality and health. Due to eligibility requirements of the larger trial, only daily smokers who allow smoking inside their homes were included in the study. Future research should include those with home smoking bans and nondaily smokers to make housing quality and health comparisons in a more heterogeneous population of smokers. Participants in the study were also not representative of all low-income smokers. Smokers were recruited from a limited number of states. Compared to CDC estimates of smoking prevalence (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019), women and African-Americans are overrepresented in our sample while Hispanic smokers are underrepresented. Although the average age of our sample corresponds to the age groups with highest prevalence of smoking, our lowest-income group earned much less annually than the low-income group defined by the CDC ($10,000 vs. $35,000 annual income). Future studies should seek to engage more men, Hispanic smokers, and other groups underrepresented in this sample.",
