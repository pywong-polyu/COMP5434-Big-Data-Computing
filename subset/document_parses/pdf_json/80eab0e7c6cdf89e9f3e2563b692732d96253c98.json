In addition to their social and cultural importance to Somali pastoralists, camels play a vital role in food security and national economy in the country. Interest in dromedary camel (one-humped camel) rearing has increasingly developed in arid countries, including Somalia, as dromedaries are more drought tolerant than any other domestic animals [2] . Camels are not only kept for milk, but also provide meat, and are used as a means of transportation. As a result of camels being the main source of milk in Somalia, intensification of camels for milk production in many parts of the country was started in the last few years.",

The disease can affect almost all domestic animals, and cross-transmission can occur between cattle, sheep, goats, and camels [2] . Brucella infection in camels is mainly caused by B. abortus and B. melitensis. Camels are not known to be the primary host for Brucella spp., and infection in camels depends on contact with other primary host animals [3] . Clinical disease in camels is very rare; however, infected camels are silent carriers of the Brucella pathogen, and the possible shedding of the organism in the milk may lead to transmission of the pathogen to humans [4] [5] [6] . Additionally, this disease imposes restrictions on the livestock trade.",

Few studies have been conducted in south and central Somalia, or in Somaliland (northern Somalia) [3, 15] . One study reported 3.9% individual seroprevalence in camels in northern Somalia [3] , while 4.4% individual seroprevalence of camel brucellosis was reported in Mogadishu, southern Somalia [15] . However, no information is available on camel brucellosis in the Puntland State of Somalia (northeastern Somalia). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2014), livestock exports-especially sheep, goats, cattle, and camels-are the most traded commodity in Somalia. Brucellosis can hinder this huge livestock trade in the country.",

Three districts were covered-namely, Bosaso (in the Bari region), Garowe (in the Nugal region) and Galkayo (in the Mudug region). Only commercially kept dairy camels were targeted, and these three districts were purposely selected because they represent the main dairy camel farming areas in the state. The number of animals to be sampled was calculated based on an assumed individual Brucella seroprevalence (unknown seroprevalence) of 50%, within a 95% confidence level and 5% desired precision. Sample size was obtained using the following formula [19] :",

A proportionally representative sample was allocated to each district based on its estimated number of dairy camel farms. A list of dairy camel farms in each district was obtained from the veterinary authority and from locals, and farms were selected randomly. All eligible animals were randomly sampled on every farm with \u226420 animals. For farms with larger herd sizes, a maximum of 30 animals were sampled from each herd. Each unvaccinated dairy camel commercially reared under the semi-intensive production system and above six months of age was included in the study. A structured questionnaire preloaded into smart phones using Epicollect5 (https://five.epicollect.net/, accessed on 8 December 2019) was administered in order to collect risk factors for brucellosis in camels. Information for each camel sampled was obtained, including age, sex, and history of abortion over the last two years. Information on each herd sampled was also obtained, including herd size, contact with ruminants, introduction of new camels to the herd, vaccination status, contact with other camel herds, and history of abortion in the herd over the last two years.",

Despite the fact that there is no c-ELISA assay specifically validated in camels, the assay is widely used in the diagnosis of camel brucellosis [20] . Further, a study by Sayour et al. (2015) suggests that c-ELISA is an excellent test for the detection of Brucella antibodies in camels, but needs further standardization in camel sera [21] . The findings of the current study disagree with the studies conducted in southern northern Somalia [3, 15] , which reported lower seroprevalence of 3.9% using both SAT and c-ELISA, and 3.1% using i-ELISA, respectively. These results also contrast with studies reported in Ethiopia, where the seroprevalence was 2.2% [22] , 4.1% [23] , and 3.37% [24] . Seroprevalence of camel brucellosis higher than the seroprevalence found by this study (37.5%) was reported in Sudan [25] . It is known that the risk of the disease is higher in intensively reared animals due to increased exposure [26] , and in this study, all sampled camels were from semi-intensively kept dairy camels, to which this relatively higher prevalence might be attributed. In addition to the lack of Brucella control programs in all domestic animals in Somalia, the free movement of camel herds and their contact with other herds and ruminants in the pasture and watering points can also contribute to the spread of Brucella infections. This finding shows that Brucella infection may pose a public health risk, as all sampled camels were apparently healthy animals from herds commercially reared for milk production.",

In larger herds, more contact between camels may occur, especially during the calving season, which increases the chance of transmission of Brucella to susceptible camels. Camels from herds that had contact with sheep and/or goats were also significantly associated with seropositivity for camel brucellosis, and were about 11 times more at risk than those who had contact with cattle (p = 0.011; OR: 10.941; 95% CI: 1.728-69.285).

The risk factors influencing the seroprevalence of camel brucellosis at the animal level were district, herd size, and contact with ruminants. There is a need for further studies investigating brucellosis in ruminants and testing the correlation between brucellosis in camels and in ruminants. Studies focusing on the isolation of Brucella strains in camels in Somalia are also recommended. Moreover, serological assays, including c-ELISA, should be validated for Brucella antibody detection in camels. Further studies aiming at isolating Brucella spp. from camel milk would allow the tracing back of human infection in One Health approaches. Institutional Review Board Statement: The study was approved by ethical committee at the Ministry of Livestock and Animal Husbandry, Puntland State of Somalia, and its ethical approval identification code is MoLAH/DG004/2020.",
