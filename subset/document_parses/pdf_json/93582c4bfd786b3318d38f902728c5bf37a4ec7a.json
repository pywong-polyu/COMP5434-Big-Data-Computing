With the most recent approval of EP plus a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, there are now more therapeutic options for managing ES-SCLC. A number of novel agents have emerging data for activity in relapsed ES-SCLC, and single-agent lurbinectedin (an alkylating drug and selective inhibitor of oncogenic transcription and DNA repair machinery in tumor cells) has conditional FDA approval for use in this patient population. Trilaciclib, a short-acting cyclindependent kinase 4/6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitor, has also been recently approved as a supportive intervention for use prior to an EP or a topotecan-containing regimen to diminish the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. The current review is based on a recent expert roundtable discussion and summarizes current therapeutic agents and emerging data on newer agents and biomarkers. It also provides evidence-based clinical considerations and a treatment decision tool for oncologists treating patients with relapsed ES-SCLC.

In response to this challenge, a number of trials have explored the use of alkylating agents (e.g., ifosfamide), anthracyclines (e.g., epirubicin, amrubicin), antifolates (e.g., pemetrexed), camptothecins (e.g., irinotecan, topotecan), or taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel) in combination with platinum drugs as first-line treatment for ES-SCLC (Table 1) [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, none of these regimens have proven superiority over EP, which had remained the standard-of-care frontline treatment regimen until the advent of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunecheckpoint therapy [6, 14] .",

There are differences in the inclusion criteria regarding brain metastases between the studies, which is worth highlighting since patients with asymptomatic and untreated brain metastases were allowed in CASPIAN whereas they were excluded from IMpower133 [19, 20] . Currently, no biomarkers exist to differentiate between patient subsets who may benefit from the addition of a PD-L1 inhibitor to standard EP chemotherapy and those who may not. Notably, patients derived similar benefit from the addition of atezolizumab to EP in IMpower133 independent of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry or blood-based tumor mutational burden (bTMB) status [27] ; however, the bTMB biomarker needs further refinement and validation as there are variable gene panel sizes, algorithms, and cutoffs that may vary on the basis of the tumor type such that a bTMB cutoff of 16 mutations per megabase may be sufficiently high for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but not for SCLC [28, 29] .",

However, in platinum-sensitive patients (relapse C 90 days) with ECOG performance status 0-2, a recent study has shown platinum-based chemotherapy rechallenge to be superior to topotecan. This multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial conducted in Japan (JCOG0605) compared topotecan alone with combination chemotherapy consisting of EP (with cisplatin) plus irinotecan [47] . OS was significantly longer in the combined chemotherapy arm versus the topotecan arm (median 18 thrombocytopenia, and anemia were more common in the combination chemotherapy arm [47] . Given the unfavorable toxicity profile of this triplet regimen, it is unlikely to be widely adopted. Similar results were shown for PFS in a randomized, open-label, phase 3 French study that compared orally administered topotecan with EP in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed SCLC [48] . Although median PFS was significantly longer in the combination EP chemotherapy arm compared with the topotecan arm (4.7 months [90% CI 3.9, 5.5] vs 2.7 months [90% CI 2.3, 3.2; HR 0.57 [90% CI 0.41, 0.73]; P = 0.0041), there were no significant differences between the treatment arms for median OS. Unlike the JCOG0605 triplet regimen, there were no major differences between the platinum-doublet chemotherapy and topotecan treatment arms with respect to percentages of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, or febrile neutropenia in this study [48] . Given the importance of platinum-based chemotherapy in SCLC-including platinum-sensitive, relapsed disease-there are agents being developed to induce or re-induce platinum sensitivity [51] .",

The trial treatment arms compared the combination of lurbinectedin plus doxorubicin with standard of care (investigator's choice of topotecan or cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/ vincristine [CAV]) in 613 patients with SCLC, disease progression after one prior platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen, and a chemotherapy-free interval of 30 days or more [58, 59] . In December 2020, a press release reported that the trial did not meet the primary endpoint of OS for significance in the intent-totreat patient population. The safety and tolerability data of ATLANTIS were consistent with the known safety profile of lurbinectedin, and there were no new safety signals in the lurbinectedin treatment arm [59] . The ATLANTIS trial has not yet been published since the press release, and without the full study outcomes, a full understanding of the implications of the results is not possible. On the basis of the limited information currently available, it is hypothesized that the lower lurbinectedin dose used in the phase 3 trial (2.0 mg/m 2 every 21 days) compared with the phase 2 trial (3.2 mg/m 2 every 21 days) may have affected the outcomes [57] [58] [59] . This hypothesis is in line with an exposure-response analysis of lurbinectedin dosage in SCLC that determined the 3.2 mg/m 2 dose every 21 days (same dose as used in the phase 2 trial and FDA approved) provided the most benefit in patients with SCLC who had disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and had a manageable risk of grade 4 neutropenia [60] . Given that the single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study in 105 patients resulted in conditional accelerated approval of lurbinectedin by the FDA on the basis of ORR and duration of response, ''continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials'' [61] .",

As previously discussed, the immune-checkpoint inhibitors durvalumab and atezolizumab have an established efficacy as part of frontline therapy for ES-SCLC in combination with EP [19, 20] . Although pembrolizumab and nivolumab, both PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, had received accelerated FDA approval for patients with relapsed SCLC who had received two prior lines of treatment (including platinum-based chemotherapy), both applications have been recently withdrawn [67] [68] [69] . Pembrolizumab initially received accelerated approval based on the pooled data from two basket trials (KEY-NOTE-028 and KEYNOTE-158) [68, 70, 71] [31, 72] . Nivolumab was initially studied alone or in combination with ipilimumab in patients with relapsed ES-SCLC in the Checkmate-032 phase 1/2 trial. Although the study treatments were not initially designed to be compared with one another, the ORRs of nivolumab monotherapy versus nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with relapsed SCLC were 11.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Median OS was 5.7 months with nivolumab monotherapy versus 4.7 months with nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination therapy. Not surprisingly, combining ipilimumab with nivolumab increased grade 3-4 toxicity from 12.9% with nivolumab monotherapy to 37.5% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab [73] . In the confirmatory phase III trial comparing nivolumab with chemotherapy (topotecan or amrubicin) in patients with relapsed SCLC, Checkmate 331, the primary endpoint of superior OS was not met [74, 75] . In addition, examination of immunotherapy maintenance strategies after first-line chemotherapy of nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab monotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC in the randomized, phase III Checkmate 451 study did not result in a prolongation of OS versus placebo [74] . On the basis of these results, the nivolumab indication for relapsed ES-SCLC was withdrawn in January 2021 from the USA by its manufacturer [69] .",

A balance between the benefits and risks of therapy versus those associated with untreated disease is often dependent on a joint decision between the physician and the patient. Patients with SCLC commonly present with shortness of breath or chest pain that often rapidly improve following initial chemotherapy administration. However, the probability of controlling SCLC with available systemic treatments decreases in the relapsed setting, particularly in those patients with platinum-resistant disease. Hence, quality of life is frequently an important goal of care along with the expectation of increased duration of life. These perceived conflicting value propositions sometimes still lead to aggressive therapy when the suffering from the cancer exceeds the suffering expected with side effects of treatment.",

Therefore, consideration of the most important factors to the patient is as critical as the information about the pros and cons associated with various therapies in the shared-decision plan. Some patients may choose hospice care as their preferred option, wishing to avoid hospitalization at all costs, especially when family members may be restricted from visiting (as has been experienced during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic), while others may choose an experimental therapy on a clinical trial.",

In patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed SCLC-especially if the treatment-free interval has been greater than 180 days-reintroduction of EP may be a consideration [6, 80] . Patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed SCLC whose initial therapy did not include immunotherapy (e.g., relapse after chemoradiotherapy for LS disease) may be offered EP rechallenge with the addition of a PD-L1 inhibitor (i.e., durvalumab or atezolizumab). For patients with relapse, regardless of platinum sensitivity and/or whether they received frontline immunotherapy, a clinical trial, lurbinectedin, and topoisomerase I inhibitors are all reasonable second-line therapeutic options [6, 80] .",

            "text": "Several guidelines vary on their preferred treatment option for relapsed SCLC on the basis of tumor sensitivity at the time of relapse and performance status. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend (category 2A) the use of the preferred regimens of topotecan, lurbinectedin, or a clinical trial for patients with SCLC who have relapsed 6 months or less after first-line therapy [6] . Likewise, the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM) guidelines recommend a clinical trial (preferred) as well as topotecan for patients with a relapse 3 months or less from their last platinum dose [80] . In 2020, European SCLC expert analysis identified CAV as the preferred option in fit patients with a relapse less than 3 months from the last platinum dose and a preference for topotecan in unfit patients with a relapse less than 3 months after the last platinum dose [76] . However, on the basis of the review of the most current evidence along with the clinical concerns for using topotecan (schedule, limited efficacy, and myelosuppressive toxicity), the authors do not frequently use topotecan as second-line treatment for patients with relapsed SCLC, although it is still approved on the basis of evidence from randomized phase 3 data and is used in this setting both in the USA and elsewhere. Irinotecan remains an alternative topoisomerase I inhibitor option in this setting. In the absence of head-to-head comparative data, given the more favorable risk-benefit profile with regards to myelosuppression, and given the less frequent dosing schedule, lurbinectedin monotherapy may be considered as the preferred agent over topotecan as a second-line treatment option in patients with chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant relapsed ES-SCLC. However, the one major limitation is that lurbinectedin is under conditional accelerated approval based only on data from a phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial in 105 patients and the phase 3 randomized study of combination lurbinectedin and doxorubicin that failed to show OS benefit, without a full publication available to examine the implications of this result. For many patients with relapsed ES-SCLC, a clinical trial with a novel investigational agent may be the preferred approach, while transition to hospice care remains an option for those with poor performance status (i.e., [3] [4] and/or those who wish to focus on comfort.",

Rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), the first DLL-3-targeted antibody-drug conjugate, initially showed promise as a treatment in SCLC [97] , but later failed to demonstrate superiority in a randomized phase 3 trial when compared with topotecan, with inferior OS, PFS, and ORR seen in patients receiving Rova-T. Additionally, Rova-T was noted to have a challenging toxicity profile of significant cutaneous reactions and fluid accumulation [98] .

PARP inhibitors may enhance DNAdamaging or cytotoxic effects when co-administered with other chemotherapeutic agents [35, 100] . PARP is highly expressed in SCLC tissue and has become a target for therapeutic drug development [22, 35] . PARP inhibitors currently being investigated in SCLC clinical  trials  include  veliparib  (NCT02289690,  NCT01642251, NCT01638546, and NCT03227016), olaparib (NCT04728230, NCT03923270, and NCT02446704), and niraparib (NCT04701307, NCT03830918, and NCT04592237). SLFN11, a DNA/RNA helicase that irreversibly induces a block of replication and leads to cell death, is emerging as a biomarker of response for PARP inhibitors [101] . SLFN11 has also been purported to predict sensitivity to cytotoxic or DNA-damaging chemotherapies, such as topoisomerase I inhibitors (i.e., topotecan, irinotecan) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (i.e., etoposide), as well as DNA cross-linkers and alkylating agents (e.g., cisplatin) [97] .

Furthermore, peripheral lymphocyte counts increased and T cell activation was enhanced following transient exposure of patients with SCLC to trilaciclib during chemotherapy, suggesting that trilaciclib may also enhance immune function when coadministered with chemotherapy [109] . There is an ongoing phase 2 study (NCT03041311) of trilaciclib with EP and atezolizumab in the frontline setting for ES-SCLC.",

Only recently have PD-L1 immunotherapies (atezolizumab and durvalumab) begun to enter the therapeutic armamentarium, with standard use in combination with EP. The best second-line therapy after combination of chemo-immunotherapy is not well defined, as many second-line therapies were studied only after use of EP. However, second-line treatment options for patients with relapsed ES-SCLC are limited and include reintroduction of EP (with or without an immunotherapy), lurbinectedin, and topotecan. For many patients, participation in a clinical trial and transition to hospice care are preferred options. Research efforts continue in the identification of biomarkers with potential prognostic significance and predictive value with certain therapeutics. Better understanding of the molecular characteristics of SCLC and the development of biomarkers will lead to more rapid advances and better guide treatment decisions in the future.",
