It is a lipophilic material containing a large collection of naturally produced plant organic molecules, including flavonoids. The flavonoid galangin is consistently found in propolis, independent of the hive geographical location and its X-ray crystal and molecular structure is reported. The antioxidant scavenging of superoxide by galangin and propolis is here presented. Using a cyclic voltammetry technique developed in our lab, we show that galangin is an excellent scavenger of the superoxide radical, perhaps even better than quercetin. Our results show that galangin displays a Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) function. This is described experimentally and theoretically (DFT). Two modes of scavenging superoxide are seen for galangin: (1) superoxide radical extraction of H atom from the hydroxyl moieties located in position 3 and 5 of galangin, which are also associated with proton incorporation defining the SOD action;",

This method permits us to evaluate the superoxide radical scavenging activity of the pure compound, galangin, as well as samples of bee propolis. Additionally, we obtained high quality crystals of galangin, suitable for X-ray diffraction studies and we describe the molecular geometry and intermolecular interactions. Earlier structure-activity studies have suggested that the 2,3-double bond in conjugation with the 4-oxo group in the flavonoid structure is a major determinant of flavonoid antioxidant activity in mitochondria [10] . Many studies relating to flavonoid and polyphenolic antioxidant potential have been reported [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In our study, we focus on the slight structural differences between galangin and chrysin, as they can be related to the experimental determination of superoxide scavenging. Moreover, using computational results from dispersion-corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT-D), we study interactions among galangin and superoxide radicals. We suggest a mechanism for scavenging of the superoxide radical anion by galangin, and bee propolis, in agreement with our cyclovoltammetry findings.",

In summary, 4 runs plus blank were performed in the RRDE experiment for galangin to determine the antioxidant activity with equal addition of 5 \u03bcL of galangin stock solution, whereas 5 aliquots, were added for propolis study.",

Initially, one might imagine that the 7OH would be favored for this process, since the H atoms in the remaining hydroxyls of galangin form strong intramolecular H-bonds with the O(carbonyl), making these H atoms more difficult to extract from the polyphenol. Fig 3B shows the result of DFT geometry optimization for superoxide separated from H7, initially set as 2.60 \u00c5, which is the distance corresponding to the sum of van der Waals distances for O and H atoms. It is seen that H7 is not captured by superoxide radical. However, this result may be due to an energy barrier and so we minimized the potential product to exclude that possibility: HO 2 was placed at van der Waals separation from the H7 excluded radical galangin, and the whole system becomes a radical species. This results in no recapture of H7 by the galangin radical, Fig 3C. Comparing energies of the resulting product structures shown in Fig 3C and 3B , we see that the latter is 1.7 kcal/mol lower and A: Galangin geometry obtained from X-ray coordinates after DFT minimization; B: Initial van der Waals separation between H7 and superoxide, 2.60 \u00c5, decreases to 1.465 \u00c5 after DFT minimization, while hydroxyl separation is still a bond length, 1.065 \u00c5. Superoxide: stick style; galangin 7-OH: ball and stick style; C: H7 was eliminated from the hydroxyl and the remaining species, the galangin radical, was DFT minimized and later placed 2.60 \u00c5 from HO 2 for further geometry minimization. Fig 3C shows However, it is known that the presence of a 3-hydroxyl in the flavonoid system induces antioxidant activity [30] . Here we show that the interaction between superoxide and this hydroxyl substituent in galangin confirms this experimental fact. Minimization of the van der Waals approached superoxide to H3(hydroxyl), Fig 5A, converges to a structure very similar to the one approaching HO 2 and the H3 excluded galangin radical, Fig 5B. More importantly, the energies of these 2 minima are exactly the same (\u0394G = 0.01 kcal/mol). We conclude that the initial interaction between galangin H3 and superoxide generates a complex. It is interesting to analyze the outcome when a proton approaches this complex. From the structural complex created in the related minimization, shown in Fig 5C, it is seen that H 2 O 2 is formed.",

From Fig 5C, H 2 O 2 was excluded, and superoxide \u03c0approached to ring B, which was chosen because it has some quinone characteristics and so likely to be a good target for capturing the superoxide unpaired electron. Indeed, the superoxide electron is captured by the ring, while O 2 is formed (O-O bond distance = 1.273 \u00c5) but the latter does not penetrate galangin \u03c0 system, as its separation from ring B is still similar to van der Waals value, 3.508 \u00c5, Fig 6A. Hence, molecular oxygen was eliminated, and the residual structure minimized, Fig 6B. Finally, a proton was van der Waals approached to galangin O3 and, upon minimization, galangin was reformed. This suggests galangin acts as a SOD mimic for scavenging superoxide with H3 supporting reaction (a), corresponding to SOD activity: (1) Incoming superoxide (red) interacts with H3; (2) H3 is sequestered, forming HO 2 ; (3) a proton arrives and adds to HO 2 forming, and eliminating, H 2 O 2 (light blue); (4) A second incoming superoxide (green) interacts \u03c0-\u03c0 with galangin ring B; (5) the superoxide donates its electron and O 2 is released (light blue); (6) an incoming proton interacts with O3, re- Finally, we explore if hydroxyl H5 can also detach from galangin when approached by superoxide, by performing DFT-D minimizations. Although there is some shortening between H5 and superoxide, it is much weaker than that seen for H3, and additional approach by a proton does not induce H 2 O 2 formation (not shown). Hence, we studied the behavior of the potential product, which is an HO 2 moiety interacting with galangin after H5 exclusion. The energy of this product is lower and a TS was explored. Fig 6C and 6D , show that the capture of H5 by superoxide is feasible: \u0394G = -2.067 kcal/mol, E(barrier) = 1.3 kcal/mol.",

The original separation between superoxide O atoms becomes much shorter, 1.246 \u00c5, corresponding to the expected length of a O 2 molecule, but still bound to the polyphenol. It is clear that the superoxide unpaired electron is now located within the polyphenol structure and this species is not a radical, as the number of electrons is now even due to 2 superoxides incorporated into the complex. It is noteworthy that one H from H 2 O 2 now is within H-bonding distance (2.820 \u00c5) to the polyphenol O1. To analyze the corresponding potential H 2 O 2 transfer to the polyphenol plane, a transition state calculation was performed after observing that the product has lower energy than the reagent, Fig  8A and 8B . Attempts to explore if the newly formed O 2 species, trans to H 2 O 2 , or H 2 O 2 itself, are able to detach from the Fig 9B complex failed, although additional superoxide radicals were incorporated as seen in the arrangement of Fig 9C.

This complex is a result of 5 incorporated superoxide and 2 protons, but before formation of this complex, H 2 O 2 formation and release was described. Thus, the number of superoxide anions associated with galangin in this \u03c0-\u03c0 superoxide-galangin study is six, which when added to 4 protons, defines the final charge of the complex (-2) shown in Fig 9C.

In this cyclic voltammetry method superoxide is developed in situ by bubbling O 2 into the electrovoltaic cell containing anhydrous DMSO solvent, see details in Experimental section. After the blank experiment, aliquots taken from a stock 0.02M galangin solution, were added to the voltaic cell. Fig 10A shows voltammograms of blank and all runs for both electrodes. The lower part of these voltammograms develops at the disk electrode, where O 2 incorporates an electron to generate superoxide O 2 \u2022 -. The opposite effect, oxidation of O 2 \u2022 -, takes place at the ring electrode, which has a fixed potential enough positive for this action, upper part. As scavenger aliquots are added, they consume part of the superoxide and the ring disc detects less superoxide, lowering the current. The collection efficiency is shown in Fig 10B, for all data, showing the decrease of superoxide. All scavengers studied by us so far behaved in a linear manner for the initial aliquots used. Beyond the initial aliquots, 2 possibilities were seen: (1) complete linear behavior, as in, chrysin [22] , eriodictyol [22] , BHT [31] , emodin [32] , celastrol [34] or (2) initial linear behavior followed by asymptotic performance, such as in quercetin [22] , embelin [31] and clovamide [35] . In the present study, we also calculated a linear trend for all data, with regression factor of 0.9296, whereas the initial 3 data (using the blank plus 2 initial added aliquots) have a linear regression factor of 0.9635, slightly better, but still not ideal. Since we find that several superoxide anions are incorporated in one galangin unit, Fig 9C, galangin is a very efficient scavenger, and indeed this is demonstrated by the slope in Fig 10B, -19x10 4 .

Fig 11C only considers the initial 4 points of Fig 11B shows a linear behavior with an excellent regression factor, 0.9958. When comparing with our previously described RRDE analysis of olive oil [36] , which is also a mixed substrate, propolis shows higher antioxidant activity, as shown by an almost complete elimination of superoxide after the last aliquot.",

This is compatible with the galangin crystal structure that shows a rich network of hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions. Using DFT methods, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between superoxide and galangin are further confirmed; these interactions are in part responsible for superoxide oxidation and capture of the superoxide electron by the aromatic rings of galangin. Additionally, abstraction of galangin H3 and H5 by superoxide is also demonstrated and associated with SOD action by galangin. This SOD action may be responsible for the RRDE steeper slope of galangin compared with quercetin [22] . When analyzing propolis, RRDE results show very strong antioxidant capability, including almost complete elimination of superoxide from the electrochemical cell. Since propolis contains other scavengers besides galangin, a main component of propolis, the total amount of effective compounds in the propolis contribute to the antioxidant activity.",

S3 Fig shows the result of geometry minimization for an initially separated proton (2.60 \u00c5) from the O 2 moiety of Fig 3B, that results in no formation of H 2 O 2 . This is in contrast with the behavior of chrysin [22], where H7 was transferred to superoxide and evolved towards H 2 O 2 formation. Fig 4 shows the 2D structures of galangin and chrysin. It is interesting that the presence of an additional 3-hydroxyl in galangin can preclude this type of scavenging.",
