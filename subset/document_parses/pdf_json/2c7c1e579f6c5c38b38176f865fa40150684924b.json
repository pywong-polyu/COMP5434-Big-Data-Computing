However, they have also become a fertile ground for the spread of false information, particularly regarding the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Best described as an infodemic, there is a great need, now more than ever, for scientific fact-checking and misinformation detection regarding the dangers posed by these tools with regards to COVID-19. In this article, we analyze the credibility of information shared on Twitter pertaining the COVID-19 pandemic. For our analysis, we propose an ensemble-learning-based framework for verifying the credibility of a vast number of tweets. In particular, we carry out analyses of a large dataset of tweets conveying information regarding COVID-19. In our approach, we classify the information into two categories: credible or noncredible. Our classifications of tweet credibility are based on various features, including tweet-and user-level features. We conduct multiple experiments on the collected and labeled dataset. The results obtained with the proposed framework reveal high accuracy in detecting credible and non-credible tweets containing COVID-19 information.",

These sentiments have been echoed by the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus [4] . During the Munich Security Council held on February 15, 2020, he stated that the world was in a war to fight not only a pandemic, but also an infodemic. Various sources have shown that the spread of COVID-19 has been accelerated by the kinds of information, or indeed misinformation, being communicated [3] , [4] . This is because individuals act to protect themselves from contracting the disease based on the information they receive from different sources. An example that illustrates the extent to which false information regarding The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Derek Abbott . the pandemic has spread was provided in a report by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). ICFN brings together more than a hundred organizations that essentially do fact-checking. By April 2020, they revealed that over 4000 false claims had been spread regarding the pandemic [7] . Unfortunately, misinformation has a horde of adverse outcomes associated with it: it can increase fear of the pandemic among people [8] , and it can mislead people when it comes to correct medical practices, as some may follow wrong advice on how to protect themselves from COVID-19, which could lead to ill health or even death [9] , [10] .",

A fundamental example that illustrates this is the myriad conversations regarding vaccines and cures to COVID-19. Many people have spread false information regarding COVID-19 cures, and have shown inclination towards accepting it. Figure 1 shows example tweets that promotes false COVID-19 cure and encourages people to purchase it. Another blatant example was the tweet by US President Donald J. Trump that suggested that combining hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was the ''biggest gamechangers in the history of medicine'' [17] . Medical bodies and medical research institutions subsequently came forth to demystify this false assertion, asking physicians not to follow such information when treating patients. Intended or otherwise, misinformation brings about fear and wrong medical prescriptions. It also leads to defiance of medical guidelines regarding preventive measures, such as social distancing and personal hygiene. This is as the direct result of a horde of misinformation [18] .",

They have also sought to discover the driving force that motivates people to share false information regarding various events such as the COVID-19 pandemic or political scenarios [28] . For example, Oh et al. [29] carried out an analysis of information obtained from Twitter regarding the Haiti earthquake in 2010. They found out that uncertainty and anxiety with regards to information are fundamental factors that determine how false information spreads. They noted that the best way to counter the spread of misinformation is to cite credible information from reliable sources. Domenico et al. [30] also sought to establish how scientific misinformation spreads. They concluded that most people deemed information as credible when their friends tweeted about it often.",

We used hashtags and keywords related to COVID-19 for our search. Table 1 presents a list of all the relevant keywords used to collect tweets about COVID-19. Identification, annotation, and classification of the tweets were conducted based on the tweet type. In this work, we define a credible COVID-19 tweet as a verified and relevant tweet containing COVID-19 news, vaccination, medication, ways of protection, etc., that had a confirmed, reliable source such as the WHO, IFCN, a fact-checking platform or an official health agency. The non-credible tweets were defined as a collection of non-confirmed or false tweets about COVID-19 that had spread over Twitter. For tweets collected from news segments, detailed research was carried out to determine whether they contained true information. In the case that our annotators determined that a tweet bore false information, it would automatically fall under the ''non-credible'' category. Furthermore, to increase the accuracy with which the tweets were categorized, annotators would seek opinions from each other. Ultimately, we compiled a dataset of 980,000 tweets. After deleting duplicated and irrelevant tweets, the final dataset contained more than 400,000 tweets. Figure 3 illustrates the actual numbers of collected tweets. These tweets were annotated and classified into 121,950 credible tweets and 287,534 non-credible tweets. This dataset forms the primary basis for the subsequent experiments in our work. ",

However, a fundamental issue of ensemble learning is interpretability losses [46] . Additionally, large models were found to have a vast quantity of parameters in place [47] , thus increasing the overfitting problem. A stacking scheme is hence necessary to come up with an acceptable size, which also affects the performance of the given ensemble model and guides the ensemble process. Therefore, we combined models such as level-0 models when performing the stacking. We also replaced the voting module with a meta-model.

We used the 10-fold cross-validation model as the stacking model. Our aim was to create training and test sets using the initial training set for a given meta-model, and also to test the complete ensemble model using the test set. Figure 6 shows the accuracies of the seven different combinations of base models specified above, and Table 4 shows the performance of each model combination. It is clear that the SVM+RF combination has better accuracy (97.8%) than the C4.5 model (96%), although it has lower performance in terms of the remaining three measurements. The SVM+RF combination had greater accuracy compared to the All model. This indicates that combining many models when creating an ensemble model is not necessary as the weak ones may reduce the overall performance. Consequently, a wisely selected meta-model with appropriate combinations of smaller base models may perform better than all the base models put together. ",

This is the only way to stop their growth of popularity. 3) If any form of misinformation is shared on social media, then it is also good to report the content.

            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a threat to human beings. Unlike other global challenges, such as global warming, containing and defeating COVID-19 will depend much on the quality and credibility of information shared amongst people. However, research has shown that misinformation has spread rapidly on OSNs regarding the pandemic. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive experiment using real data from the Twitter social network. The results revealed that the proposed ensemble-learning model had better performance than single machine-learning-based models. We enhanced the performance of our stacking model by assessing meta-models and weak-learners. We concluded that the final model size can contain fewer features, and it performed slightly better than the original model. As of now, our model has been designed to detect two categories of tweet credibility: credible or non-credible. We acknowledge that there is room for improvement, part of which shall include the following. First is the incorporation of complex tweets containing news and emotional content. Additionally, we shall take into consideration other OSNs that will help us enhance our dataset. Secondly, we shall look out for updated ensemble techniques and machine-learning methods to enhance the current model.",
