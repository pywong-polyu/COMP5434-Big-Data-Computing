Design Prospective validated and de novo questionnaires administered to NICU parents and nurses during two observation periods: (1) no webcam access (off webcam) and (2) webcam access (on webcam). Results Seventy-nine \"off webcam\" parents, 80 \"on webcam\" parents, and 35 nurses were included. Parental stress levels were significantly lower \"on webcam\" and perceptions of the technology were overwhelmingly positive. There were no significant differences in nursing stress levels and burnout between periods. Only 14% of nurses believed that webcam use improves infant's quality of care. Majority nurses felt that webcams increase parental and nursing stress. Conclusions Webcam use in the NICU is associated with lower parental stress levels and has no effect on nursing stress levels or work-related burnout. These findings contradict nurses' beliefs that webcams increase parent and nurse stress.",

            "text": "Telehealth refers broadly to electronic and telecommunications technologies used to provide care and services from a distance. The first system consisting of a combination of webbased systems and videoconferencing from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was introduced in a tertiary NICU in 1997. It was found that the program significantly improved family satisfaction with the care of very low birth weight infants and lowered the cost of care by decreasing hospital to hospital transfers [1] . Modern web-based camera systems (webcams) are currently an increasingly utilized tool for families separated from newborns hospitalized in the NICU. Parental access to the NICU has been further reduced since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and webcams could allow for parental virtual access. The technology typically consists of a webcam mounted to an infant's bedside, which allows parents to view them from remote locations. Most webcam systems transmit a live stream of the infants and sometimes even allow for one-way audio from parent to infant.",

It is also the first study to allow for matching of parent and nursing perceptions during the same test period. The decision to only asses nursing stress, rather than including other types of providers, was based on published data suggesting that webcams primarily affect those working at the bedside [8] [9] [10] . In addition, when previously queried, physicians and nurse practitioners in our NICU reported to be unaffected by the presence of webcams, whereas bedside nurses had varying opinions about their use and possible benefits. The results of this study illustrate striking differences in parents and nursing perceptions. Parents' perceptions with respect to the effects of using webcams while their infants were hospitalized were consistently positive. Stress measuring tools verified this finding for parents with scores being significantly lower when they were using the webcam irrespective of parental role (mothers versus fathers), age, or race. Conversely, the majority of nurses reported a consistently negative perception of webcam use in the NICU, which was consistent with previous anecdotal evidence of nursing dissatisfaction with webcam use in our NICU. However, while these perceptions were negative, nursing work-related stress and burnout were not found to be significantly different between the two periods, illustrating a lack of measurable adverse effects.",

In addition, most nurses in our study reported receiving phone calls to \"fix\" something seen by a parent on the webcam feed and the majority of both nurses and parents reported experiencing technical difficulties with webcam use. This effect of webcams on increasing nursing workload, coupled with negative nursing perceptions of the technology presents a substantial challenge to any administrators considering the implementation of webcam use in their NICU. When considering plans to utilize webcams in a NICU, administrators should emphasize the lack of objective changes in workrelated stress and burnout. Similarly, webcam companies should focus on improving the quality of their products to decrease technical difficulties that are commonly experienced by both parents and NICU staff alike.",

            "text": "Our results should be considered in light of a few limitations. The original PSS: NICU survey was created by testing parents within 5 days of NICU stay [2] , while our study surveyed parents much later, within 7 days of discharge. However, previous literature successfully utilized this tool after a minimum of 7 days in the NICU [20] and also used it to evaluate longitudinal changes in stress over time [6] . Our decision to enroll parents who had infants in the NICU for at least 7 days and at 30 days of life or within 7 days of discharge, whichever came first, was based on this previous work and allowed us to capture a broad group of parents. Additionally, parents were approached for study participation by personnel consisting of nurses and neonatologists who were also part of the NICU clinical team caring for their infant(s). This could potentially have introduced bias in parental responses, but unfortunately nonclinical personnel to fulfill study team roles was not possible. With respect to nurses, we aimed to objectively measure their levels of workplace stress and burnout associated with webcam use. Since no one combined validated tool exists that simultaneously assesses both, we chose to utilize two scales, the MBI and the PSS. We acknowledge that the PSS is a validated tool to study stress in the general population and does not separate workplace stress from external influencers [6] . This should be considered when interpreting our results. In addition, periods of 6 months off and 6 months on webcam may not have been sufficient time for stress levels among nurses to have substantially changed and there was variable total previous nursing exposure to webcams within our respondent group as the technology had been available in our NICU since 2015. Finally, our parent population was more than 77% white, 90% lived with their partners and more than 60% reported having some college or a higher education degree, while over 50% of study nurses were over 50 years old and had worked as a nurse for more than 6 years. Despite this, our study found no effects of parental gender, race, and age on PSS: NICU scores and no effects of nursing age and years of experience on PSS scores. Even so, the results may not be generalizable to other populations and therefore should be considered with caution.",
