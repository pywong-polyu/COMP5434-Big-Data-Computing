However, governments across the world have consistently failed in these duties. Breastfeeding has been notably absent from mainstream feminist advocacy on sexual and reproductive health rights ('SRH rights'). Why is there this lack of focus on breastfeeding in feminist advocacy in this area? This review seeks to identify the extent to which the protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding is visible within the SRH rights and the gender responsive budgeting literature.",

Yet, there continue to be egregious violations of these human rights with relation to breastfeeding, including throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 precautions have resulted in a proliferation of maternity care barriers to breastfeeding, including unnecessary separation of newborns from mothers, forced caesarean sections and prevention of breastfeeding in some cases, and inappropriate promotion of commercial food products for mothers and infants and young children through health channels [2] [3] [4] . This is in spite of authoritative World Health Organization (WHO) guidance emphasising that breastfeeding should be protected, supported and encouraged among all mothers including those with or at risk of COVID-19 due to its benefits to maternal and child health [5] . This paper will identify how breastfeeding rights fit into the broader sexual and reproductive health rights of women, and examine the visibility of breastfeeding within the sexual and reproductive health rights and gender responsive budgeting literature.",

Systematic review research has shown that longer durations of breastfeeding are associated with lower risks of breast cancer, with potential protections against ovarian cancer and type 2 diabetes [9] .

This includes human rights in the context of women's employment as well as their health and nutrition rights, and rights which are specific to pregnant and lactating mothers, and infants and young children [13, 14] . These human rights are enshrined in treaties including the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979 (CEDAW), the International Labour Organisation's Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 (No. 183) (MPC), the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989 (CRC) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966 . Table 1 provides a summary of the human rights instruments protecting breastfeeding. The process for treaties ratified by a State to become legally enforceable under domestic law depends according to the State, with two broad categories of monist or dualist legal systems. In monist jurisdictions, ratified treaties are immediately enforceable as domestic law. Under a dualist system, such as Australia, ratified treaties only become incorporated as part of domestic law when federal legislation is introduced. The United States system is a hybrid of these two approaches [15] .",

However, breastfeeding has been seen to be traditionally invisible within mainstream feminist advocacy [26] . Feminism has evolved over the last two decades, and feminist worldviews appear to be increasingly inclusive of breastfeeding. However, despite its impact on reproductive health and being a facet of reproductive autonomy, it is not clear whether breastfeeding is now more included in discussions of sexual and reproductive health rights in research or policy formulations. This paper therefore seeks to identify whether breastfeeding is visible in research articles on the topics of sexual and reproductive health rights and gender responsive budgeting.",

The reviews of these two fields of study were conducted separately in order to obtain separate results as to what extent breastfeeding had entered the mainstream literature in the respective fields, particularly given that gender budgeting analysis is a newer field having originated in the 1980s [27] . No search terms specifically related to breastfeeding and infant feeding were included in order to review the visibility of breastfeeding within the general SRH rights and gender responsive budgeting literature. The methods employed in this review were motivated to align with some features of the systematic review process. A specific research question, search strategy, and inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined in advance of the review. All citations that appeared in database searches using the search strategy were downloaded, and this sample was reduced through screening titles and abstracts on the basis of this pre-defined inclusion criteria, before a final stage of full-text review for eligibility. Some steps of the systematic review method, such as employing a Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, were not applied. Hence, this review has not been labelled a systematic review, but rather employs some of the features of the systematic review method in order to model some of the improved rigour, reproducibility and wide publication sourcing of the systematic review method. We consider this approach appropriate for this research project given the heterogeneous literature to be sampled and the motivation to explore the sociological context around breastfeeding, rather than a clinical purpose to evaluate the quantitative results of randomised control trials or qualitative data findings of a survey project.",

Publications covered a wide range of geographical areas of focus across the two reviews, including thirty-five different countries. Forty-four per cent of the total publications had a global focus. Publications in the SRH rights literature were more likely to narrow down into a particular sub-context or population of focus. Five of the eighty-seven SRH rights publications focused on women with a disability, five focused on emergency and conflict situations, four on HIV/AIDS, three on sexuality education, and two on women from a refugee background. The majority of publications were journal articles and books, at 93 per cent for the SRH rights review and 81 per cent for the gender budgeting review. Reports made up 7 per cent of the SRH rights review and 16 per cent of the gender budgeting review samples.

Relatedly it is worthwhile reflecting on the differences we found between the different publication types. Reports were typically commissioned by international intergovernmental bodies and were more likely to have a programmatic policy or health discipline focus, whereas academic publications were more likely to reflect a feminist sociological approach of policy critique. One might expect that the reason for the invisibility of breastfeeding differs between these two formats. International reports perhaps avoid delving deeply into breastfeeding due to a potential political sensitivity about promoting child spacing as a sexual and reproductive health right, whereas the academic articles may not be as grounded in (what may be seen as) public health issues rather than social science issues. The consequence of excluding breastfeeding from academic research articles is that a format that typically focuses on holding policy makers accountable for accelerating gender equality issues does not include breastfeeding as part of this critique. Alternatively, the invisibility of breastfeeding in technical reports is concerning as it suggests that breastfeeding is not being adequately considered in policy formulation.",

            "text": "Secondly and crucially, exclusion of breastfeeding from gender equality agendas may reflect the consideration of breastfeeding as being exclusively in the interests of the child and hence only the child's right. This reflects the lack of a recognition of an interdependent mother-child feeding dyad relationship within what is the dominant individual liberal rights frameworks of many national and international legal systems ( [46] , p1118). This is reinforced by the narrowing of the discussion on breastfeeding to a programmatic public health focus and away from a strategic human rights focus ( [46] , p1102). Key institutional bodies such as UNICEF have adopted, in response to the demand for quantifiable health improvements, 'operational, target-based approaches' rather than framing and pursuing breastfeeding policies under the banner of human rights ( [46] , p1102). Meier and Labbok have reflected that 'the absence of a scholarly foundation for human rights in breastfeeding policy' has limited the development of international legal human rights protections from the harms of inappropriate breast milk substitute marketing and lobbying in the developing world ( [46] , p1075). A public health focus limits the focus to children's wellbeing given the long-time deficiency of research into the maternal health importance of breastfeeding. Indeed, one recent publication on gender and health published in The Lancet, in inquiring as to the cause of observed health improvements, stated plainly that there lacked research on 'whether these improvements occur entirely through mechanisms unrelated to gender equality, such as facilitating breastfeeding' ( [50] , p2526]. This statement inferring that breastfeeding and gender equality are unrelated is in utter conflict with the literature and evidence that many women cannot breastfeed due to gender equality related barriers such as a lack of paid maternity leave, parent-friendly workplaces, etc. [47] . The invisibility of breastfeeding in sexual and reproductive health rights and gender responsive budgeting literature likely reflects therefore the categorisation of breastfeeding as a public health issue rather than a gender issue.",

This is heightened by a long history of maternal reproductive traits being used to justify the subordination of women and their exclusion from the public sphere.

Formula has been consistently marketed as 'liberation in a can' that empowers women to work and be freed from the constraints of domestic obligations, with breastfeeding represented as the realm of traditionalists rather than women in the labour force [14, 53] . The 'rhetorical link' made by formula marketing between women's freedom and formula use is predicated on a legal approach of only pursuing 'formal equality' , rather than the more robust protections of 'substantive equality' , such that the structure of market work is not being reformed to accommodate care work such as breastfeeding, through maternity leave and flexible working policies ( [54] , p11, [55] ). Breast milk substitutes marketing, such as in the Similac 'Sisterhood of Motherhood' advertisement [52] , have framed the public narrative as a discourse on lifestyle in a manner that suppresses scientific discussion of breastfeeding and opens a moral narrative on infant and young child feeding decisions that provokes judgment of parents who face structural barriers that in fact deny them a choice to breastfeed [54] . Over US$25 million was spent advertising infant formula and toddler milk in the USA in 2015 [52] , and recent research has highlighted the political power of the industry to achieve and maintain policies that suit their commercial interests [56] Limitations A limitation of this study is that it identified studies from across a number of disciplines in order to sample the wide literature and determine the overall visibility of breastfeeding from this literature. As a result, the identified literature was highly heterogeneous in both methodology and focus. Additionally, the study did not separate out the different types of publications (reports vs journal articles and books) to distinguish the results from the analysis of research articles as compared to reports. This could have provided more nuanced results about the global politics of population control and sensitivities on the child spacing effects of breastfeeding, and warrants further consideration in future research.",

Equally, for public health advocates a gendered approach to breastfeeding is essential to raise optimal breastfeeding rates, given that institutional structures that devalue care work and breastfeeding and hence provide inadequate support are a major reason for introducing breast milk substitutes [59] .",

Marginalised, low-income mothers are most likely to be employed in work that does not support breastfeeding, and due to racial differences in employment patterns women of colour, and their infants, are particularly impacted by the lack of structural support for breastfeeding [63] . This represents a clear example of interference with reproductive and bodily autonomy. Hence the protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding and the interdependent mother-infant feeding dyad must be prioritised by human rights frameworks, and the need for funding of supportive policies and programs must be highlighted in future gender budgeting analyses.",
