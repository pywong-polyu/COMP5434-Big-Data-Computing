Since then, the coronavirus 2019 disease has infected more than 103 million people worldwide, with more than 2 million deaths confirmed as of January 2021 (WHO COVID Group, 2020). The pandemic had a huge impact on most medical fields, including fertility clinics. Like most fertility centres, all ART activities were interrupted in Belgium (except for oncofertility) in March 2020, including at our centre, and a slow restart was initiated in June 2020 in accordance with local and international recommendations regarding the implementation of specific sanitary measures (ESHRE COVID-19 Working Group, 2020 ). However, one major concern remains the possible impact of COVID-19 infection on both male and female reproductive health in terms of sexual transmission, vertical transmission and ART outcomes.",

Viral RNA is released, and then viral replication and transcription occur in the host cell, leading to viral infection. In addition to lung cells, receptors are expressed in other types of cells, including the testis where both Leydig and Sertoli cells highly express ACE2 receptor (Wang and Xu, 2020) . Although co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found only in spermatogonia stem cells and spermatids, this observation suggested that viral infection could potentially harm the testes and compromise fertility status (Massarotti et al., 2021; Morelli et al., 2021) .",

Indeed, there is no evidence at present that contamination of female reproductive cells can occur in vivo or in vitro in an ART setting (Rajput et al., 2021) . One study evaluated viral mRNA in 16 oocytes from two SARS-CoV-2positive women and all samples were negative (Barragan et al., 2021) . Two other groups did not find either SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluid and/ or cervical exfoliated cells of symptomatic patients (Cui et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, data are scarce and the risk of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the seminal, follicular and vaginal fluids of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients during ART treatment remains uncertain (Morelli et al., 2021) . Such data are therefore urgently needed for the safety of ART laboratory procedures (Tur-Kaspa et al., 2021) .",

The vials were stored at 4 C in a secured location until inactivation (maximum 72 h). Medulla was frozen at \u00c080 C before homogenization using MagNA Lyser (Roche Life Science). All vials were transported to the laboratory and disinfected under flow before inactivation in a Biosafety level 2 room. Each UTM sample (100 ml) was inactivated using 1 ml of TRIzol solution (LifeTechnologies) and mixed with an internal control (IC) (RNA sequence of the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) produced by in vitro transcription from a plasmid encoding the cDNA sequence of SBV L segment, kindly provided by University of Namur, Belgium). Briefly, RNA was extracted using a chloroform protocol according to the validated protocol (Coupeau et al., 2020) . Specific primers and probes (Supplementary Table SII) for SARS-CoV-2 and IC and master mix (Takyon TM One-Step Kit Converter, Eurogentec) were used for quantitative PCR according to manufacturer's instructions. The Sars-Cov-2 sequence (product length: 113 pb) amplified by the primers corresponds to the virus gene coding for envelope protein (E). A positive SARS-CoV-2 control (SARS-CoV-2 virus amplified in Vero cell culture) was added to each plate as was a negative control (transport media; Supplementary Fig. S1 ). PCR reactions were performed in duplicates using 4 ml out of the 30 ml of extracted RNA in a Roche Light Cycler 480 (LC480) using the following program: (10 min at 48 C then 3 min at 95 C, 45 cycles 15 s at 95 C, 30 s at 58 C and 30 s at 40 C). Each plate was validated based on the results of the three controls (IC, SARS-CoV2 positive and negative controls). Results of each sample were validated based on the IC control ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). All samples with discordant results in the duplicate (CT > 1) were reprocessed (REDO). The test was considered positive when CT < 40.",

With the 14-day cumulative number of positive COVID-19 cases per 100 000 reaching 637 for the time period (https://www. ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea), Belgium was considered to be in a critical situation during its second wave, based on ESHRE definitions (https://www.eshre.eu/Home/COVID19WG, 14 October 2020). Although this second wave affected all age groups, younger patients of reproductive age were more often infected during this wave compared to the first COVID-19 wave. In Belgium, around 7000 COVID-19-positive cases were diagnosed daily during the study period with a majority being asymptomatic patients. This was associated with a dramatic increase in hospital admissions (>200 patients/day) and the effective reproductive number (Rt) was 1.516 indicating that the pandemic was progressing quickly (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/ cases-2019-ncov-eueea). Although Belgian fertility centres interrupted their activities during the first wave (March to June 2020), continuity of care was provided during the second wave under strict sanitary conditions. However, uncertainties remained regarding the risk of sexual transmission of the virus through intercourse and how to ensure safe practices. Moreover, as the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 virus receptors were identified in reproductive organs (Wang and Xu 2020) , it became crucial to assess the risk of semen, ovarian tissue, follicular fluid and vaginal secretions for contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing ART cycles. This risk evaluation has important implications for lab procedures such as staff protection, sperm sampling rooms cleaning/disinfection, aeration of the rooms between consecutive patients and use of face masks during sperm retrieval to avoid semen contamination (Hamdi et al., 2020) .",

However, a limited number of patients were included and the previous status of semen parameters was unknown. One study reported the presence of viral RNA particles in the semen samples of 6 out of 38 men . This study raised questions about the need for additional safety measures for the fertility clinic lab personnel and regarding the possibility of viral sexual transmission. However, the authors stated that this positive finding should be confirmed in future studies before making conclusions about the possibility of sexual transmission . No additional positive viral RNA tests were reported among 18 semen samples from patients who had recovered after COVID-19 infection and two semen samples from acute COVID-19-infected patients (Holtmann et al., 2020) . The presence of SARS CoV-2 RNA was also not detected in 61 prostatic secretions from recovered COVID-19 patients (Ruan et al., 2021) . Another study reported one case of positive viral RNA in testicular tissue but the sample contained mainly fibrovascular tissue, suggesting that the virus may have been detected in the blood instead of the testicles (Yang et al., 2020) . Electron microscopy confirmed the absence of viral particles (Yang et al., 2020) . Our study confirms the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in a large series of 122 semen samples from asymptomatic men during the second pandemic wave, irrespective of the results of a triage questionnaire or nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 test. We observed no evidence of viral contamination or sexual transmission through the male reproductive tract in the absence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, our study also suggested that the sensitivity of the testing could be reduced in semen. However, the results of the positive control (IC) remain were within the detection limits in all samples and the TRIzol method was previously described for Sars-CoV-2 detection in semen Best et al., 2021) . RT-qPCR has also been used as a highly sensitive standard technique for detection of other viruses such as hepatitis B or HCV in sperm (Cassuto et al., 2002; Englert et al., 2004; Lesage et al., 2006; Pasquier et al., 2006) .",

All samples were negative in patients undergoing IUI and sperm analysis despite the facts that triage questionnaire was the only COVID-19 risk assessment and that some patients had unknown questionnaire status. It is likely that some of these patients were infected with COVID-19 at the time of the procedure. These data suggest that no further sanitary measures need to be implemented in the fertility laboratory to avoid the risk of staff or cross-patient contamination for asymptomatic patients. In addition, this study is the first to include ovarian medulla samples collected during ovarian tissue during cryopreservation. This observational cohort provides compelling evidence for the safety of handling reproductive tract material from asymptomatic patients, and additional safety measures do not need to be implemented by IVF laboratory staff to avoid cross-contamination.",
