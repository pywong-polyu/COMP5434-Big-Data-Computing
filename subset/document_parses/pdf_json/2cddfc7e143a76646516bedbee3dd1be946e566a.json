Splenic infarction, renal infarction, and intestinal ischemia have all been documented recently as abdominal visceral infarctions. Case presentation: A 59 years old female patient with a history of COVID-19 disease was admitted to our hospital due to her left upper quadrant abdominal and left flank pain. She had a history of left heel color change in few days. We perform an ultrasound and it was shown vein thrombosis. So, heparin infusion was started for her. We also performed a thoraco-abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) with intravenous and oral contrast. Total evidence suggests a splenic system infarction. A regular clinical examination for malignancy was performed on the patient and there was no evidence of cancer. Other probable reasons were ruled out. The patient was diagnosed with splenic infarction, Due to coagulopathy caused by SARS-Cov-2 infection. Treatment with heparin was continued for 5 days and she was discharged home on day 9 with oral agents. The patient was asymptomatic when she returned. The spleen had decreased in size on the follow-up CT, and there were no clinical complications. Discussion and conclusions: Spleen artery thrombosis is a rare complication of COVID-19. In this report, we described a 59 years old female with a history of COVID-19. She was discharged home and in follow-up, there was no evidence of thrombosis anymore.",

Despite the fact that thrombotic events are one of the most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are few instances of splenic infarction in the literature. Because abdominal imaging tests are rarely routinely conducted and reported cases are frequently accidental findings from chest CT scans that extend to the upper abdomen, its prevalence is likely underestimated [4] .
