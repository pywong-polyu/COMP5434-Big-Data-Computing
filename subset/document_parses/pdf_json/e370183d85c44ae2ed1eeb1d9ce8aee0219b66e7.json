To measure the severity of the said disease, the mortality rate plays an important role. In this research work, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated by using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model. As the disease contains a significant amount of uncertainty, a fundamental SEIRD model with minimal assumptions is employed. Further, a basic method is proposed to obtain time-dependent estimations of the parameters of the SEIRD model by using historical data. From our proposed model and with the predictive analysis, it is expected that the infection may go rise in the month of May-2021 and the mortality rate could go as high as 1.8%. Such high rates of mortality may be used as a measure to understand the severity of the situation.",

There is a notable imbalance between the supply and the demand of medicines and oxygen cylinders in the healthcare system. With every passing day, the death toll rises with 3000 deaths reported every day due to COVID-19 pandemic. This infectious disease is historically different in the following ways. The asymptomatic cases, one of the cause of virus transmission among the healthy population, are practically unnoticed by the healthcare system. Also, the government policies, social movements and actions by healthcare departments of any country are not yet well studied in epidemiology.",

Few of them validated the COVID-19 pandemic results and predicted the trajectory of COVID-19 in order to match the available data of the region under consideration ( [1] [2] [3] , etc.). Note that all these models follow one common approach, i.e., introducing distinguishable compartments to all the possible states of a person living in an affected region. Stanford Model [5] assumed different compartments such as exposed, symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, hospitalized, and recovered for a COVID-19 patient's journey from beginning to end. This assumption led to a large number of unpredictable interactions when the parameters of the mathematical models are tuned accordingly. With every single moment, the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases caused the exact data recording task challenging and unreliable. Consequently, mathematical modelling with such data may be questionable and the confidence interval of the obtained results may be uncertain. Thus, the trade-off between the description and accuracy of the mathematical model should be given the the greatest preference.",

The identification and estimation of the SEIRD model for COVID-19 are discussed in [9] . The identification of the model from the observed number of deaths and confirmed cases is not up to the mark. Thus, by using the Monte Carlo method, Korolev [9] finds some fairly accurate estimations for reproduction numbers. Ala'raj et al.

Their model analyzed the real-time data and provided long-term and short-term forecasts with confidence intervals.",

On the other side, Huang et al. [24] and Wang et al. [25] reported that the median time from the onset of the symptoms to being admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) is near about ten days. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) mentioned that the time between the onset of symptoms and death ranges from two weeks to 8 weeks [26] . Hence, there is a requirement to introduce mortality rate based on the ratio of the number of people who died and the number of people who got infected few days back. Therefore, true mortality rate, say TMR n , which is obtained by dividing the number of deaths on nth day by the number of confirmed COVID-19 infections kth days before of that nth day, is defined as where k \u2208 \u2115 .

Consequently, India unexpectedly entered deep into the second wave of coronavirus. In the total tally of infections, India reached at the second position after USA. The main cause of this sudden surge was considered as a mutant of the earlier version, commonly known as the double mutant. This particular strain was found in many countries, like, UK, South Africa, etc., other than India. Though it has been a subject of global interest, but it is still not confirmed scientifically. The transmission of the virus from an infected person to a susceptible one is very much similar as it happened in the first wave (Oct 2020). Since the spread of this virus is dependent on location, person, etc., it is difficult to characterize the behavior of this virus at the equal level all over India. One other prime factor behind the massive increase in the number of cases is the increased testing drive.",

Though the lockdown is supposed to be the best way to reduce the virus transmission, uplifting the previously imposed restrictions may tend to increase the people's interaction in person. Further, it is also observable that these parameters are different for disparate regions. Therefore, the parameters should be estimated based on the data to relate the model with the actual senario. Kuniya et al. [22] proposed an estimation method in which the parameter is a simple random variable and the estimate is a single value. Since such methods may be inaccurate at times, a basic method to find a time-dependent estimate for the parameters and using historical data is intended to present in this paper to improve the accuracy of the model.

The SEIRD or SEIR model consists of susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered and dead cases while SIR model is restricted to susceptible, infectious and recovered cases. Since SIR model does not consider the latent stage (the exposed individuals), it will be an inappropriate model to employ in the proposed scenario. Therefore, SEIR \\& SEIRD models can provide better approximation as compare to SIR model [12] . The mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated by taking into account the dynamic behavior of the spread of the disease. It was inferred that the infections are expected to peak in May-2021 and the mortality rate could go as high as 1.8%. Such high rates may be used as a measure to understand the severity of the pandemic. There is an advantage that this predictive methodology can be applied in any region, if the historical data is available. This analysis will be useful in making important decisions such as health care policies in India. In future work, the estimated results can be validated by the simulation model. In future, our proposed model can also be extended by obtaining well established reproduction rate (R) along with mortality rate. Also, the scenarios effects (base, best, worst, etc.) on a monthly basis helping policies on restrictions like lock down can also be incorporated in future.",
