Opting for proactive E-health services is the best thing. It helps the remote patients to share their confidential data through secured encryption. Telehealth services are emerging element in these proactive medical sciences. It helps the remote patients to share their confidential data through secured transmission. In this paper, amino acid guided matrix encoding scheme has been proposed. White blood cell count or Leukocute count is a dominant indicator of patients' health condition, even amid COVID-19. An abnormal growth in leukocyte count is mainly caused due to an infection, cancer, or any other severe symptoms. It initiates internal haematological inflammations, cardiovascular diseases, Type II diabetes, etc. Therefore, tracking leukocyte count may for disease diagnosis and further treatments. The leukocyte count is generally done in different pathologies, and the data evaluation needs the expertise of a pathologist. In this paper, a technique involving security measures to transmit the result of the histological test with the help of cryptography has been proposed. The data to be transferred to the concerned physician for further diagnosis with the help of proposed way of encryption using amino acids, which ensures no data loss, no data modification, no data theft in the middle of transmission. The proposed encryption method using the amino acid codes has produced results showing satisfactory performances such as p-values found to be 7.215544e\u221204 and 8.48904e\u221203 for the key stream and cipher key matrix monobit test respectively, and 8.10245e\u221204 and 8.10245e\u221204 for the key stream and cipher key matrix frequency test respectively. It may be used as a transmission module in any wireless COVID-19 Telehealth Systems.",

Clinical diagnosis and treatments are possible globally using such E-Health systems. Coronavirus that affects the human immune system mostly in geriatric patients, co-morbid patients, pregnant women and children. Human immune system helps to fight against bacteria, viruses and other pathogenic organisms. An individual bearing low antibody (Ab) producing system gets affected easily by any invaders irrespective of its quality and quantity. That means their immunity has been compromised. Moreover, an individual with good antibody producing system i.e. having effective defence immune mechanism leads a healthy life. White Blood Corpuscles (WBC) or Leukocyte is said to be the chief army of the human immune system. The deviated magnitude of WBC count provides us the health conditions of a patient. Further, analysing the exact number of the different types of leukocyte provides us the idea of the individual might be affected by which type of disease in E-Health [5] . Evaluating the number of leukocyte in the blood smear was earlier done manually using Haemocytometer. It was a challenging task then. Now-a-days with the rapid development in the field of instrumentation, WBC counting for disease detection is done by different easy methods like Fourier Psychographic Microscopy (FPM). The leukocytes reports that are generated has to be transferred to the respective physicians/doctors for diagnosis and treatments. In electronic based health system, secured data communication through public channel is the biggest threat. Eavesdroppers are promptly active in nature to read the patient's private data. So security has to be provided on medical data before transmission in E-Health [6, 7] . Cryptography is the technique of encrypting and decrypting the plain message into meaningless format for the intruders [8] .",

If these two are processed with two unequal keys, then such is called asymmetric key cryptography. If a single character of the plain text is converted at a time with the key in case of symmetric key cryptography then it is called stream cipher. When a block of characters of the plain text are converted at a time with the key in case of symmetric key cryptography then it is called block cipher [10] . The effective method based on cryptographic is the physical characteristics of the data and public transmission channel are to be taken into consideration. RSA public key cryptography is the most frequently and inevitable algorithm for data transmission [11] . The security of RSA algorithm depends on the choice of prime numbers factoring [12] . In this proposed technique, haematological data are encoded through single letter codes of amino acids. The sequences of binary bits are derived through proposed method. Furthermore, that sequence has been equally partitioned into blocks. Each block will be put inside another frame of encryption technique. It could be done with an eye to combat the Man-In-The-Middle attacks. The differential leukocyte count could be done using standard digital mechanism, could be greatly used to detect and diagnose different diseases. From a genetic disorder to chromosomal disorders could be assessed by this method, i.e. from Cancer to Tuberculosis. Neutrophils responsible for the first line of defence occupying the highest percentage (60%) in the blood. Eosinophils has fight against infections caused by the parasites, generally gives allergic responses 0.1% of the white blood cells are Basophils, best role in asthma. Lymphocytes which either produce the antibodies against specific antigen or release cytokines like Interleukins (IL-1, 2, 3, 4), Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) and induce apoptosis of the infected host cell. The garbage trucks of the immune system, Monocytes and Macrophages (in tissues) are 5 to 12% of white blood cells in bloodstream and flushes pathogens by phagocytosis [13] . Following Table 1 represents the normal range of WBC. We have focused on WBC for proposed haematological encoded encryption scheme [14] .",

This aberrant Leukocyte count can face two scenarios i.e. either increased WBC count or decreased WBC count. The lower WBC count called \"Leukopenia\"-when the count is less than 5000 in men/\u03bcL and 4500/\u03bcL in women which might be because of diseases such as Sepsis, Aplastic anemia, Myelodysplastic syndrome, HIV etc., while when the WBC count is greater than 10,000/\u03bcL in men and 11,000/\u03bcL, this is said to be \"Leukocytosis\" which might be the indicator of diseases like Leukemia (CML, AML, ALL), Leukemoid reactions, and tissue damage.

Plenty of researches have been carried out at different global locations to provide more data security on the medical data. Extensive research works have been noted on DNA based cryptography [17]. Yamuna et al. [18] had developed an encryption technique based on amino acids. Authentication of the patients' DNA sequences at the recipient's end is an open challenge due several middle way attacks. Also the concept of key generation has been missing in [21] had proposed a data security technique that involves amino acids and DNA with four square matrix decryption. But the security analysis likes of brute force attacks, middle man attacks, time stamp attacks, etc. were not included in their paper. Nirmala et al. [22] have proposed a scheme guided by amino acids protein sequencing. They have converted a plain data into amino acid protein sequences. The process of key generation is not robust in nature in terms of resistance against the intruders. Sohal et al. [23] had proposed at DNA roused got symmetric key cryptography in the field of cloud computing. It is essential to strongly encrypt the message before transmitting to the clouds. Time complexity of their technique has not been illustrated there. Mulyad et al. [24] have proposed a strategy to improve the precision of ECG utilizing waveform division. The accuracy of this technique is itself a challenging constraint. Capua et al. [25] have proposed a technique to evaluate the patients' ECG signals in genuine casing. A sensor has been utilized to detect the ECG signs and it is handled utilizing an individual computerized colleague termed as Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). PDA can impart signs to the crisis/emergency unit when some strange readings are distinguished. The security mechanisms could have been enhanced during the mid way signal transmission over the network. Borghetti et al. [26] have built up a sensor based glove to gauge hand finger flexion for restoration. It comprises of a glove and a bunch of sensors set at the constant securing unit with proper setup, which thusly offers criticism to restoration unit utilizing patients' fingers positions. Patients may wrongly provide inputs (finger movements) to their proposed system. Thus, the system may not detect such exceptional cases. Sarkar et al. [27] Fig. 1 Differential leukocyte count [16] had considered biometric encryption on fingerprints utilizing metaheuristic salp swarm algorithm. They have used the patients' biometric traits to generate additional bio-key. Their performance comparison was missing their paper.",

[28] thought of a local area overview among African and Americans and tracked down that the WBC Count is more noteworthy than 7000 cells/mm 3 . It shows 1.9 times more occurrence of coronary diseases, 2.9 times more danger of episode ischemic stroke, and 2.3 times more odds of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The mortality for the least quartile of WBC check for example is less than 4800 cells/mm 3 [29] . The inter-relationship between greater Leukocyte count and higher Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) was observed to be uniformly linear,i.e. specifically high Leukocyte count is seen with SBP 130-139 mmHg whereas lower with those having SBP 120 mmHg [30] . The bacterial invasion during the septic infection results in change of leukocyte count in the body of a human being. The differential WBC count may be useful for determining the efficiency of bacterial infection, the arrival of the fever results in greater Leukocyte count which is more than 15,000/\u03bcL with the neutrophils count greater than 1500/\u03bcL. It happened because of the bacterial antigen activating the first and the second line of defence. The lymphocyte percentage showing a simultaneous decrease, causing lymphopenia and also the lowering of lymphocyte TCD4+, CD8+ and NK cells [31] . Moreover, Department of Hematology and Immunohaematology, the Hospital of Kenana, had visualized the fact that the Monocyte Count is said to have a higher percentage with the fall in the Leukocyte Count [32] . According to WHO, the hematological diagnosis during the illness of dengue fever it has been cited by Leucopenis i.e. Leucocyte < 5000 cells /mm 3 , thrombocytopenia < 150,000 cells/mm 3 , an increase of haematocrit (6-10%). Its symptoms includes such as arthralgia, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, rash, hemorrhagic manifestations, leucopenia. Lately the DHF (fever having hemorrhagic tendency) proved it to be the dengue infection [33] .",

The thing to be noted is the fact that 16 amino acids are taken into consideration among the 20 and each are assigned different WBC count level.

An enormous and constant progress is going at very speed pace on strengthening the encryption key. It protects each of medical data communication using public media. In this proposed technique, cryptography has been embedded on amino acids followed by another round of cipher key matrix has been done. Such are done only to confuse the intruders. Any proposed technique on the encryption algorithm is hypothetically supposed to be fragile in connection with brute-force attack by the intruders. To analyze the time needed to decipher the key by the intruder is another fruitful context. year has 365 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 60 = 31,536,000 number of seconds. Hence, the number of years expected to diffuse one cipher text is (3.34 \u00d7 10 7 )\u2215(148 \u00d7 10 12 \u00d7 31,536,000) = 7.15 \u00d7 10 15 years. So it is more important to note that the time needed to decrypt a single key by the intruder in Telecare System, is almost impossible.

This report helps the physician to put her/his concentration towards the diseases having such abnormal count of lymphocytes and basophiles. Further, this disease is said to be biphasic or even triphasic, and the analysis of such symptoms of each phase could help such reach to a strong conclusion of CML. After the diagnose, Jorge E. Cortes had realized that patients having common symptoms like fatigue, anorexia, upper left quadrant discomfort, and early satiety are seen at their early phase [40] . Moreover, in some cases retinal hemorrhages, tinnitus, priapism are also found. Further, at the later phases, the change in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow in the most concentration, having complications like anemia, infection related problems lymphadenopathy and bleeding disorders are too observed. The blastic phase comprises of tissue infiltration at lymph nodes, skin, bone etc. occurs. The platelet count is also 30-50% higher in such patients i.e. higher than 1,000,000/\u03bcL along with Thrombocytopenia [40] .

[23] Proposed here Matrix computing The matrices are hard to detect by the Intruder rather than plain text Security at public channel Cipher text are likely to be hacked during the public paths Time complexity evaluation The time complexity is a crucial parameter for any cipher key matrix. More to say that during this COVID-19 context, online medical transactions have rapidly spurred. To reduce certain number of transactions, artificial neural network synchronization may be applied to have the same orientation of key bits. Also the length of the key bits can be extended to manageable length. It may reduce the time complexity of such wireless COVID-19 telehealth system.
