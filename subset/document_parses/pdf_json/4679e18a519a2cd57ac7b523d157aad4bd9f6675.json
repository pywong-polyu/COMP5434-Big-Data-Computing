            "text": "Since the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many clinical practices saw an urgent need to re-evaluate the safety of their techniques and instruments to assure the safety of both patients and medical staff. Despite COVID-19 being primarily a respiratory disease, studies have identified multiple ocular symptoms, including conjunctivi-tis, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] increased ocular secretions, 1,5-7 ocular pain, 6, 7 and dry eye. 1 There is less evidence supporting disease transmission through tears or ocular tissue. Xia et al. demonstrated the presence of SARS-COV-2 by realtime polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from ocular samples from patients with conjunctivitis and argued that although the prevalence of virus in tears is low, the disease transmission via the eyes is still possible. 8 Liang et al. and Wu et al. replicated these initial results. 7, 9 Ho et al. have reviewed 20 case series and case studies comprised of 2228 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, where 4.3% of subjects manifested ocular symptoms and only 0.5% had positive viral nucleic acid in ocular swabs. 10 Given this speculative evidence that ocular fluids may be an infection route or serving as a source of disease spread, it is critical to identify sources of potential disease spread via common diagnostic devices, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. Noncontact tonometers (NCTs) use an air puff to deform the corneal surface and assesses intraocular pressure (IOP), as well as characterize ocular biomechanics with respect to the air-cornea interaction. Recent studies have suggested the potential for aerosolization of the tear film with NCTs which would pose a risk with the clinical use of these devices during this pandemic with concern of possible viral load in the tears. [11] [12] [13] However, the instructions for caution have been controversial and other research groups have contradicted such findings, indicating that NCTs do not generate droplets unless eye drops are given prior to the examination. 14, 15 Given the recent emergence of several COVID-19 mutations, which reportedly have a higher infectious rate, as well as increasing evidence that the major disease transmission route is airborne, it is timely to characterize the potential for droplet formation with these devices. In this study, we conducted high-speed imaging of the NCT air puffs impacting the corneal surface in vivo during a standard examination. The goals of this study are to address the question of tear droplet formation and to provide insight into the mechanism of tear film displacement.",

A preservative free lubricant eye drop with a viscosity close to that of the tears was used for these tests which contained 0.1% dextran 70 and 0.3% hypomellose (GenTeal Tears; KC Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pomona, CA, USA). Each eye drop was administered by slightly tilting the subject's head back and pulling the lower eyelid downward, away from the cornea. The eye drop vial would then be held over the eyelid pocket and one drop would be gently administered. The testing order was as follows: (1) the first NCT device, (2) the first NCT device after one drop of lubricant was administered, (3) the second NCT device, (4) the second NCT device after one lubricant eye drop was administered, (5) iCare testing, and followed by (6) administration of topical anesthetic containing 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (Akorn, Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA) and Tono-Pen testing. Note that several minutes elapsed between tests two and three to allow for movement of the NCTs and camera setup. Further, to account for the potential effect of order of testing, 10 subjects received ORA testing first, followed by CorVis ST, whereas the other 10 subjects received CorVis ST measurement first, followed by ORA. To evenly distribute the order between the two NCT devices, ORA and Corvis ST were selected as the first device for every other subject.",

Videos that captured the air puff deformation after the administration of a lubricant eye drop provided the optimal setting to study the air puff interaction with the tear film because of a larger tear load. Under this condition, the air puff arrives at the corneal surface, the tear film is pushed radially away from the apex while remaining attached to the corneal surface. This behavior, explained by the Coanda effect, 16,17 occurs due to the tendency of the tear film to follow the ocular surface curvature during deformation and results in droplets leaving the eye only at the eyelid boundary which interrupts tear flow.",

The edge of the tear film wave traveling radially from the center is shown with red arrows. This resembles that of the water surface impinged by a drop of rain (Fig. 5c) . As the tear film moves further away from the location of the impact, the tear wave approaches an obstruction in the tear meniscus and eyelid. Depending upon the wave velocity and surface tension, the meniscus obstruction could result in droplet formation or only tear drops tracking the edge of the meniscus-eyelid boundary. The kinetic energy of the tear film displacing radially can be characterized using continuity equation. Assuming the tear film flow is incompressible, axisymmetric, flowing radially across a flat cornea, and that the film thickness does not decrease appreciably in the distance range under consideration, the kinetic energy can be simplified to:",

            "text": "As shown in Equation 1, the kinetic energy is expected to decrease as at least 1/r where r is the distance traveled. Furthermore, as demonstrated in Equation 1, the tear wave's kinetic energy decreases as the tear wave moves further away from the impact location. Thus, smaller distances between the air puff impact location and the meniscus-eyelid boundary would leave greater kinetic energy and increase the potential of droplet formation. This equation accounts for variations between individuals with respect to orbital anatomy with relative position of the eye in a shallow versus deep setting. Specifically, in an individual who has a relatively shallow eye within the orbit, there is a short distance between meniscus-eyelid and air puff impact location which resulted in droplet formation with forward trajectory. This tear wave behavior can be explained by the higher kinetic energy at the time the tear wave encountered an obstruction at the meniscuseyelid boundary. In other words, the risk of droplet formation with forward motion increases in an individual who has a shorter distance from the meniscus-eyelid boundary. It is worth noting that the upper lid was retracted during the testing, which resulted in a much shorter distance to the lower lid due to mechanical elevation of the periocular tissues. In this study, lubricant eye drops were used to simulate subjects with a larger tear volume, similar to other studies with NCT devices. 12, 14 However, the other studies used not only low viscosity, but also medium and high viscosity eye drops, which might influence results. Despite this variation in eye drops, all studies showed that no droplet formation occurs without the addition of an eye drop. Our study design was robust with a side-by-side comparison of contact and noncontact tonometers and characterized the effect of larger tear load in the NCTs with the administration of a single eye drop. In addition, we were able to expand upon the findings by Shetty et al. 14 by using two NCTs with distinct air puff strategies, as well as characterizing the air puff/tear film interaction. The distance between air puff impact location and tear meniscus/lid as an important potential cause for droplet formation with forward motion after an eye drop is administered. Although both devices use the same mechanism of air puff deformation to characterize ocular biomechanics and IOP, it should be noted that each device has distinct air puff strategies, which might affect response from the interaction with the tear film. However, we did not note differences based on magnitude of the air puff.",

Additionally, due to the small number of subjects and only one case with droplet formation showing a forward trajectory, the threshold for air puff impact distance from meniscus-eyelid could not be determined. Lastly, given that droplet formation is a three-dimensional phenomenon, and the video recordings are only looking at a two-dimensional plane of view, the droplet diameter measurements in this study depend upon the distance in the depth of field and could render our droplet diameter measurements inaccurate. In addition, droplets less than the pixel resolution of 20 microns could not be detected.",

Therefore, it is recommended to avoid holding open the upper lid alone which pulls up the lower lid and shortens the distance the tear wave travels to the lower lid. Rather, it is recommended to hold open both the upper and lower lids if the patient has difficulty maintaining open eyes for the examination.
