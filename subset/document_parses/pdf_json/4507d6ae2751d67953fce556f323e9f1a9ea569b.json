Periodically, there have been reports of reduced immunogenicity and effectiveness associated with consecutive annual vaccination [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Nabeshima et al [15] found lower immunogenicity of revaccination in 2003 among Japanese HCP compared with those unvaccinated in 2002, unrelated to prevaccination HI titers [15] . Other studies have reported better serologic response among previously unvaccinated adults [13, [35] [36] [37] although findings regarding revaccination and vaccine effectiveness have been mixed [38, 39] . antibody and effector and memory B-cell responses were greater in TIV recipients than in LAIV recipients. Prior-season TIV recipients had significantly higher preseason HI titers, but lower HI response after vaccination with either TIV or LAIV in the study season compared with those who were not vaccinated during the previous season. These subjects also had a lower effector B-cell (antibody-secreting cell) response to new TIV but not LAIV. A possible mechanism is that some of the injected hemagglutinin protein in TIV could form antigen-antibody complexes with preexisting HI antibodies, which could reduce the amount of HI antigen available for stimulating B cells [40] . In our study, we observed differences in HI antibody response based on receipt of MIIV even in participants with preseason HI < 10, suggesting that HCP with HI < 10 despite prior MIIV were primary vaccine nonresponders who were also less likely to respond to repeat vaccination. We speculate that this nonresponse may be related to exhaustion of memory B cells from prior influenza infections. Another explanation is the \"antigenic distance hypothesis\" [41] . By comparing the predictions from a computer model to 7 influenza outbreaks from 2 studies [9, 42] , Smith et al [41] accurately predicted year-to-year variations in vaccine efficacy, and specifically predicted that revaccination would negatively interfere with serologic response when the antigenic distance between strains in consecutive vaccines is small. Because MIIV and 2010-2011 TIV contained an identical A(H1N1)pdm09 antigen, this theory would predict lower response among those receiving a second annual vaccination with A(H1N1)pdm09, which fits what we observed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 262, "end": 265, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 266, "end": 270, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 271, "end": 275, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 276, "end": 280, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 281, "end": 285, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 286, "end": 290, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 291, "end": 295, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 314, "end": 318, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 470, "end": 474, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 568, "end": 572, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 573, "end": 577, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 578, "end": 582, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 583, "end": 587, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 672, "end": 676, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 677, "end": 680, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1358, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1818, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1915, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1919, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1934, "end": 1938, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Secondary Analyses"}, {"text": "In a recent report of T-cell and antibody responses against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, similar CD8 recall T-cell responses to H1N1 from 1934 and 2009 implied cross-reactive T-cell responses [43] . Almost 60% of a Toronto cohort had crossreactive memory T-cell responses to influenza virus at 1 year after the pandemic.

This effect was at least partially mediated by KPNW HCP characteristics and does not impact the interpretation of our results overall. This is so because when we stratified analyses by site, the same inverse association between receipt of MIIV and HI response to subsequent TIV was found, statistically significant for SWH albeit not for KPNW.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Secondary Analyses"}, {"text": "The proportion of HCP with preseason HI \u2265 40 against A(H1N1)pdm09 was 14% among 819 HCP not receiving MIIV, suggesting that some had past infection (or cross-reactive antibody). Our finding is similar to previous studies reporting 19% of emergency department providers who had HI \u2265 40 after the first wave [44] and to an estimated 20% of the US population infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 prior to the 2010-2011 season [45] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 310, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 413, "end": 417, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Secondary Analyses"}, {"text": "Randomized clinical trials reported that 90%-100% of healthy adults had HI \u2265 40 post-MIIV [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . For our cohort, the proportion of HCP with HI \u2265 40 after A(H1N1)pdm09containing TIV was 74% (95% CI, 71%-77%) overall; 85% (95% CI, 81%-88%) among those who had only TIV and 66% (95% CI, 61%-70%) among those who had both MIIV and TIV. However, the overall proportion we observed is higher than that reported for HCP in Hong Kong [46] of 54% (95% CI, 44%-63%) and in Japan [47] of 38% (95% CI, 33.2%-42.9%) after receipt of 1 unadjuvanted MIIV dose. What we observed is closest to HI \u2265 40 of 80% among HCP in the Netherlands, after 1 MF-59 adjuvanted MIIV dose [48] . Strengths of our study include its large sample size, and the ability to compare findings across study sites and major vaccine lots. There are also several limitations to our study. First, although HI \u2265 40 is considered a surrogate marker of protection for licensure of influenza vaccines [29, 34] , its association with vaccine effectiveness is limited and the clinical meaningfulness of the differences we observed is unknown. Second, the observational nature of this study introduced differences in timing of blood draws, site, and participant characteristics, which could only be adjusted for statistically in multivariate models and by subsetting our data by site. Because HCP aged \u226550 years and those with high-risk conditions are more likely to be revaccinated, we cannot rule out residual confounding. Although we included medically attended acute respiratory illness as a covariate in models, we are limited by variable prior exposure to influenza viruses and vaccines, and underlying health and immunologic status of our participants. Other potentially serious limitations include selection bias, as MIIV or TIV recipients were not randomized, and possible variable potency of many lots of 2009-2010 MIIV.
