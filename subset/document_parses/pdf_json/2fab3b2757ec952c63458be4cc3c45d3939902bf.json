Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) of the bladder accounts for 0.12-0.6% among the different histological subtypes of bladder carcinomas. This type of bladder cancer was first described in 1955 by Saphire. So far, data on just over 300 cases with such a finding have been published in the literatur\u0435. Characteristics of this type of tumor are its poor prognosis and its tendency to resistance to known chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy. 2 We present a rare case of SR\u0421\u0421 with clinical manifestations of hematuria (two times) treated with transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB).",

            "text": "Cases of adenocarcinomas of the bladder represent only 0.5-2% of all primary malignant tumors affecting this organ. 1 SRCC is a neoplasm that usually affects the stomach, colon, breast, pancreas, lung, prostate, or gallbladder. Most of the cases found in the urinary bladder are secondary as a result by a direct extension or metastatic spread by hematogenous or lymphatic route. 3 A classic feature of this type of tumors is their poor differentiation. The typical age for its appearance is the sixth decade, and most of the cases have been observed in men (sex ratio M: F = 11: 2). The most common symptoms in patients with SRCC are: hematuria, dysuria, frequent urination, incontinence or urinary retention. 4 This type of tumor is most often presented as a diffuse infiltrating form. The histological picture shows the disease-specific cells with a nucleus pushed into the periphery. It is extremely important to differentiate primary carcinomas from metastases from other affected organs due to the different therapeutic strategies that are applied. Primary adenocarcinomas of the bladder are much rarer than secondary ones, among which colon adenocarcinoma is the most common variant involving the bladder. The following pathological features have been identified that are used to distinguish primary from secondary adenocarcinomas: polypoid formation affecting the bladder mucosa, glandular or mucosal metaplasia, Brunn's nests, transitional and squamous carcinoma foci. The prognosis of SRCC is extremely poor, with 25% of patients already having metastases at the time of diagnosis, and half of them being classified as stage IV. 5 The treatment of this type of tumor is multimodal and includes surgery (radical cystectomy or TURB), chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5 In our case, all clinical, imaging, hitological and immunohistochemical studies support the diagnosis of primary signet-ring cell cancer of the bladder. Immunostochemical studies showed positive expression of CK7 and CK20. Signet-ring cell carcinoma in most cases is characterized by a poor prognosis. It is a real challenge to treat this pathology in its advanced cases. However, in our clinical case, deep transurethral resection of the tumor and adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy were performed. From the cystoscopies and ultrasonographies performed in the 12-month follow-up period, there was no evidence of tumor recurrence. In our opinion, TURB is a therapeutic option in selected patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the bladder, who would find it difficult to tolerate such a major surgical intervention as radical cystectomy.",
