Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force workers (n = 212) completed online questionnaires measuring work exposure to sexually explicit material, secondary traumatic stress symptoms, and parenting behaviors. Professionals in this field reported a wide range of secondary trauma symptoms, and their parenting behaviors were both directly and indirectly (via secondary trauma) affected by prolonged exposure to sexually explicit material involving children.

Secondary traumatic stress is defined as \"the natural, consequent behaviors and emotions resulting from the knowledge about a traumatizing event experienced by a significant other\" or \"the stress resulting from helping or wanting to help a traumatized or suffering person\" (Figley 1995, p. 10) . Essentially, secondary traumatic stress encapsulates the negative effects experienced by professionals due to indirect exposure to traumatic events (Figley 1995) . Secondary traumatic stress symptoms are similar to those seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which include avoidance of trauma reminders, compartmentalizing stress reactions, reexperiencing the trauma through intrusive thoughts, and increased arousal when reminders of trauma cases are present (Ludick and Figley 2017) . Secondary traumatic stress and PTSD are differentiated by the mechanism through which symptoms arise. With PTSD, symptoms manifest in response to directly witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event, whereas secondary trauma symptoms occur in response to indirect exposure, such as hearing accounts of another person's trauma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 57, "end": 70, "text": "Figley (1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 568, "end": 588, "text": "(Figley 1995, p. 10)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 739, "end": 752, "text": "(Figley 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1083, "text": "(Ludick and Figley 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Secondary Traumatic Stress"}, {"text": "Unfortunately, instances of secondary traumatic stress are not isolated to one specific profession.

The participants' job-related requirements included searching computers and other technological devices for evidence of criminal activity and spent seven to eight hours every day searching for such files. Findings from this study indicated that employees were experiencing significant rates of burnout and were at greater risk for developing secondary traumatic stress symptoms (Perez et al. 2010) . Similar results were found in a study examining how work exposure to child pornography affects Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force agents and affiliates in a sample drawn from 511 agencies. Researchers found that 45% of respondents noticed problems arising from work exposure to child pornography, with approximately 40% believing that more mental health services were needed in their agencies (Wolak and Mitchell 2009) . Furthermore, in a study documenting the hazards of investigating internet crimes against children, it was found that digital evidence handlers who had more frequent exposure to materials involving sexual abuse of children reported increased levels of secondary trauma and more frequent initiation of coping behaviors such as distraction by focusing on unrelated tasks when at home (Burruss et al. 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 442, "end": 461, "text": "(Perez et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 842, "end": 861, "text": "(Perez et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1298, "text": "(Wolak and Mitchell 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1703, "text": "(Burruss et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Secondary Traumatic Stress in Various Professions"}, {"text": "Very little research has focused on the ways in which job-exposure to child abuse materials during investigations may carry over to negative parental interactions. However, there is a sizeable research base on the spillover effects of a range of work-related activities for law enforcement officials and their families, such as how shift scheduling can alter family functioning (i.e. day and night shift and marital stress) and the psychological effects of being in the line of duty, such as officer hypervigilance both on-and off-duty (Craun et al. 2015) . Although these studies may offer insight into how work in the field of child exploitation affects these professionals' families, few studies have explicitly explored the implications this kind of work may have between these professionals and their own children. Craun et al. (2015) analyzed the impact of investigating internet crimes against children on interpersonal relationships and found that higher levels of secondary traumatic stress increased respondents' reported discomfort levels in expressing intimacy with their own children. This same study (using a predominantly male sample) revealed that several respondents felt their interpretation of expressing intimacy with their children (i.e. hugging, tickling, etc.) changed after being exposed to sex offenders engaging in these same behaviors in order to groom their underage victims (Craun et al. 2015) . Specifically related to police work, research has indicated that female police officers are likely to engage in \"danger-protection\" parenting practices that arise from their own experiences as police officers in an attempt to prevent their own children from becoming victims or offenders of various crimes. Reported practices included setting strict, authoritarian rules, omniscient monitoring and supervision of their children (i.e. use of GPS tracking devices, keystroke loggers on computers etc.) and carefully monitoring self-disclosure about work to their children (Agocs et al. 2015) .

Parental exposure to traumatic experiences and the presence of parental PTSD have been linked to heightened levels of parental distress and decreased parenting satisfaction as well as problematic parenting behaviors, such as emotional distance towards children and a higher risk of child abuse, as well as increased incidence of PTSD and anxiety in children (Berz et al. 2008; Cross et al. 2018; Gewirtz et al. 2010; Ruscio et al. 2002) . Similarly, National Guard members who were deployed during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts who experienced greater PTSD symptoms were more likely to self-report poorer parenting behaviors such as greater likelihood of utilizing harsh disciplinary actions (Chesmore et al. 2018) . PTSD symptomatology in deployed and returning veterans has also been found to be associated with negative parenting outcomes. Low satisfaction in parenting, increased aggression toward children, low warmth and engagement, and emotional distance from children have all been found to be related to the emotional numbing symptom of PTSD; with poorer, disengaged parent-child relationships being associated with the avoidance symptom of PTSD (Davidson and Mellor 2001; Duranceau et al. 2015; Lauterbach et al. 2007; Samper et al. 2004; Sherman et al. 2016 ). Related to gender differences, a study examining the moderating role of PTSD on a parenting intervention for military families yielded results that indicated paternal PTSD significantly moderated the effects of parenting interventions, such that the interventions were less effective for fathers with PTSD (Chesmore et al. 2018) . Findings from this study suggest that fathers with clinical levels of PTSD displayed smaller improvements in effective parenting skills compared to fathers without PTSD, possibly because fathers with PTSD were avoiding managing child problems because of the emotional arousal associated with parenting practices (Chesmore et al. 2018) . The body of literature addressing the ways in which PTSD affects parenting behaviors of veterans offers insight into the mechanisms of PTSD symptomatology and how it is implicated in the manifestation of negative outcomes in the children of traumatized parents. Although the same mechanisms can be hypothesized to apply to law enforcement officials who investigate and protect child sexual abuse victims, the literature is slim on data providing such associations, especially concerning the mechanisms of secondary trauma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 644, "end": 662, "text": "(Berz et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 663, "end": 681, "text": "Cross et al. 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 682, "end": 702, "text": "Gewirtz et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 703, "end": 722, "text": "Ruscio et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 983, "end": 1005, "text": "(Chesmore et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1472, "text": "(Davidson and Mellor 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1495, "text": "Duranceau et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1496, "end": 1519, "text": "Lauterbach et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1539, "text": "Samper et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1540, "end": 1559, "text": "Sherman et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1869, "end": 1891, "text": "(Chesmore et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2228, "text": "(Chesmore et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PTSD and Parenting"}, {"text": "Study aim Previous research has been devoted to investigating such topics as compassion fatigue, workplace burnout, and secondary traumatic stress across a variety of helping professions. Pertaining to law enforcement officials, previous research has explored the development of secondary traumatic stress and significant burnout as a result of their experiences in the workplace (e.g., Perez et al. 2010 ). There has also been research on PTSD and the resulting negative implications on parenting practices, particularly with fathers (Chesmore et al. 2018) , and parental monitoring behaviors, particularly with mothers (Agocs et al. 2015) . However, the present literature is slim on secondary traumatic stress among child abuse and child pornography investigators and whether the development of secondary traumatic stress carries over to parenting behaviors for mothers and fathers. Due to this gap in the present literature, the goal of the present study was to analyze whether working in a profession that involves investigating internet crimes against children influences how law enforcement officials parent their own children, through the mechanism of secondary traumatic stress. Specifically, the present study examined whether secondary traumatic stress in child abuse investigators was associated with parenting behaviors, such as warmth, involvement, internet monitoring, and being concerned about their children's use of the internet. In the present study, employees of both state and federal law enforcement agencies across the United States who serve various job roles related to legal cases involving child pornography completed measures that assessed secondary traumatic stress, general parenting behaviors such as warmth toward their children and involvement in their children's lives, and parental monitoring behaviors relating to their children's internet use. Based on the review of the literature, the present study hypothesized that secondary traumatic stress symptoms would be negatively associated with warmth and general involvement with their children, and this relationship would be stronger for fathers compared to mothers.

However, only a few studies have documented this finding and even fewer have investigated the potential carryover effects of secondary traumatic stress on parenting behaviors in this population. Using a sample of 212 Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force investigators, this study tested the hypothesized association between secondary traumatic stress symptoms and the potential spillover effect regarding parenting behaviors (i.e. warmth, involvement, internet monitoring behaviors, and concern about online disclosure of information). It was expected that participants who reported higher levels of secondary traumatic stress symptoms would also report less warmth and involvement with their children. Based on the literature indicating that fathers in this particular field report more discomfort in expressing intimacy with their children, the present study also expected the association between secondary traumatic stress, warmth, and involvement to be moderated by gender, such that the relationship would be stronger for fathers compared to mothers. Contrary to expectations, secondary traumatic stress symptoms were not significantly related to parental warmth nor involvement. However, workplace exposure to explicit materials was positively associated with warmth. This finding hints to a possible protective mechanism that parents in this field may utilize in response to commonalities that typically land children in situations that make them prime targets for child predators. Similar to sex trafficking victims, runaways and those lured by false promises tend to be prime targets for human traffickers (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 2018). As such, children who do not receive proper care or attention at home tend to search for it through other avenues; typically online. In light of this, these findings may be reflective of a protective parenting mechanism, in that parents in this field may display more warmth towards their children to ensure their children receive the care and attention they need at home rather than feeling the need to satisfy these needs from outside sources.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It was hypothesized that participants who reported higher levels of secondary traumatic stress would also report engaging in more frequent internet monitoring behaviors. Based on the study findings, one form of internet monitoring was significant related to secondary traumatic stress symptoms: stopping internet usage. However, contrary to predictions, the association was negative; the higher the traumatic stress symptoms, the less internet stopping behaviors. These results were perplexing at first, in that the expectations were for participants who reported higher levels of secondary traumatic stress to also report higher frequency of stopping their children from using the internet. Finding that participants who report higher secondary traumatic stress were less likely to stop their children from using the internet may be indicative of the avoidance mechanism of secondary traumatic stress (similar to that found in PTSD; Ludick and Figley 2017) playing an active role in the participants' thought processes when confronted with their children's internet use. As such, prior research has focused on anxiety sensitivity and cognitive avoidance in patients with PTSD, with common findings indicating that individuals with PTSD report an aversion to situations that may lead to physiological arousal, with examples of those being associated with anxiety or fear (Simpson et al. 2006) . Connecting this research to the findings of the present study, it would make sense for participants who report greater secondary traumatic stress levels to be less likely to intervene and stop their children from using the internet. Specifically, participants with elevated secondary trauma levels may actively avoid stopping their children from using the computer in order to completely avoid inserting themselves into a situation that may serve as a PTSD trigger since computers and other technological devices are the main focal points in the child pornography field.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 934, "end": 957, "text": "Ludick and Figley 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1392, "text": "(Simpson et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The association between secondary traumatic stress and stopping behaviors was stronger for mothers, which also follows previous research findings on gender differences in PTSD symptom expression which indicate that females are more likely to have greater reactivity to emotional cues (Murphy et al. 2018) .

Participants being concerned about their children's disclosure of information online may reflect an active role of the anxiety/arousal component of PTSD (Simpson et al. 2006) playing into their children's use of the internet. It is common within the realm of child pornography for predators to engage in online solicitation while posing as an adolescent in order to gather information from potential victims, with 97% of cases originating with a law enforcement entity involving online solicitation to an undercover agent (The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 2016). Additionally, finding that women were more likely to report concern about their children's disclosure of information online follows the trend highlighted when discussing stopping internet usage. As the research states, it can be expected for mothers to be hypersensitive to fearful or anxiety provoking situations (Simpson et al. 2006) .

Thus, it seems that being in this profession, and not necessarily the traumatic stress that may result from work in this profession, is directly related to certain proactive internet monitoring behaviors.

These supervisory behaviors are likely appropriate and indicative of proactive and responsible parenting. It is important to consider the need for parenting instruction and/ or parenting classes for parents who investigate child pornography, as these parents may be interested in this material. While the availability of such classes tailored to this population is unclear, research on general parenting classes indicates such learning opportunities can yield stronger parenting skills, greater knowledge on child development, and lowered parenting stress levels for those who complete them (Scudder et al. 2014) .

Firstly, due to participants working in federal and state law enforcement capacities, requirements for the study's continuation included anonymity of respondents due to security clearances and regulations. So, due to these restrictions, demographic questions were not able to include a location that would offer insight to geographical differences. Additionally, initial data collection was to be completed with agencies contained within United States provinces. In light of this, the ListSERV through which the surveys were distributed unknowingly contained email contacts of affiliate agencies outside of the United States, with surveys reaching entities in Norway, Brazil, Great Britain, and Canada. As such, the prevalence of child sexual abuse crimes vary by country, as well as the availability of governmental assistance in combatting these crimes. Similarly, parenting practices and beliefs vary widely by country due to societal and cultural influences as well as geographical location. Thus, due to the anonymity of respondent data, respondents' country of origin may have implications on the data collected and the study's results. Also, due to the nature of the survey's distribution, the calculation of survey response rates was not possible as the survey was distributed throughout both federal and state agencies both within and outside of the United States. Lastly, that the survey did not assess respondents' marriage or child custody status is another important limitation to note given that approximately 15% of law enforcement professionals are divorced (McCoy and Aamodt 2010).
