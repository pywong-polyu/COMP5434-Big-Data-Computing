On 18 November 2020, 55,714,647 people worldwide were registered as infected and 1,340,645 as deceased [4] . In Germany, the virus began to spread on 27 January 2020, and by 18 November, 843,757 cases of infection had been registered. Drastic measures with a first lockdown were introduced in the thirteenth calendar week in March 2020 to inhibit the pandemic. Both the virus and the measures taken to combat it have had a serious direct impact on society, national economies, and everyday life [5] . The pandemic also created special challenges for German hospitals, not only in the treatment of infected patients but also in other departments where the effect of the pandemic on patient numbers became clearly noticeable [6] . For example, fewer heart attacks were reported in cardiology, and fewer strokes in neurology [7] [8] [9] .",

In the intensive care setting, there was a marked reduction in the SAPS/TISS scores, a reduction in ventilation hours due to the reservation of monitored beds for COVID-19 patients, and lower bed utilization.

These recommendations were also issued for Italy [21] and presented in a series of measures regarding hospital perioperative preparation recommended by the European Society of Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ESTES) [22] . The cancellation of major elective surgeries also led to a decrease in trauma surgery ICU bed utilization, allowing deployment of ICU staff to other units.
