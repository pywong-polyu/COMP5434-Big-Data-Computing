Compared with infants receiving exclusive formula, those receiving the highest volume of human milk daily [\u226550 mL/(kg \u00b7 day)] had lower incidences of BPD [27.5% in \u226550 mL/(kg \u00b7 day) vs 40.1% in 0 mL/(kg \u00b7 day) human milk, P = 0.001)], moderate and severe BPD [8.9% in \u226550 mL/(kg \u00b7 day) vs 16.1% in 0 mL/(kg \u00b7 day), P = 0.004], necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC; 3.8% in \u226550 mL/(kg \u00b7 day) vs 10.8% in 0 mL/(kg \u00b7 day), P = 0.001], late-onset sepsis (Continued on next page)",

The logistic regression indicated that those receiving \u226550 ml/kg \u00b7 day human milk had lower odds of BPD [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.453; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.309, 0.666], moderate and severe BPD (AOR 0.430; 95% CI: 0.249, 0.742), NEC (AOR 0.314; 95% CI: 0.162, 0. 607), LOS (AOR 0.420; 95% CI: 0.263, 0.673), and EUGR (AOR 0.685; 95% CI: 0.479, 0.979). Conclusions: A daily threshold amount of \u226550 ml/(kg \u00b7 day) human milk in the first 4 weeks of life was associated with lower incidence of BPD as well as NEC, LOS, and EUGR in VLBW infants.

BPD prolongs neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization and impacts long-term pulmonary morbidity and chronic neurologic impairment [2, 3] . BPD is affected by multiple factors, including exposure of the immature lung to hypoxia and inflammation, and inadequate nutrition, among others [4, 5] . Preventive and therapeutic strategies are not clear [6] . Human milk has potent protective mechanisms targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and inadequate nutrition [7] . However, exclusive breastfeeding rates in the early years of life are very low in China, and most NICUs use mixed feeding [8] . Multicenter studies conducted in China on the association between the dose of human milk in mixed feeding and BPD are lacking. This study was performed to evaluate the dose-dependent impact of human milk received up to the end of week 4 of life on BPD in VLBW infants.",

The proportion of exclusively formula-fed VLBW infants with a hospital stay of \u226528 days in this study was 28.9%, less than one-third of the total. The proportion of mixed feeding of human milk and formula was significantly higher than that of exclusive breastfeeding and exclusive formulafeeding due to limitations from various factors. This led to the question regarding the dosedependent effect of human milk on the risk of BPD and other morbidities in VLBW infants. Several metaanalyses [12, 15, 19, 20] comparing human milk or own mother's milk and any human milk with exclusive formula drew different conclusions, although most found that exclusive human milk feeding was associated with decreased incidence of BPD. Partially receiving human milk was also shown to have a protective effect compared with exclusive formula feeding, but the level of evidence was not high [12] . Patel et al. [21] revealed a 9.5% reduction in the odds of BPD for each 10% increase in enteral feedings consisting of mothers' milk received from birth to 36 weeks PMA. Another study found that the risk of BPD reduced when the average breast milk volume given was more than 7 mL/(kg \u00b7 day) at 42 days after birth [22] . This dose of human milk was far lower than that in the present study. The difference might be explained by different time period and different GA. The GA in the aforementioned study was less than 32 weeks and the time of feeding was 42 days after birth. However, while the gestational age in the present study was less than and equal to 34 weeks and the time of feeding was 28 days after birth. The time of feeding in the present study was selected according to the definition of BPD.",

The detailed clinical and feeding information of VLBW infants from 19 NICUs in Jiangsu province in 2018 was collected, providing a sufficiently large sample. At least 50 mL/(kg \u00b7 day) of human milk daily given up to the end of the fourth week of life decreased the rates of BPD, as well as NEC, LOS, and EUGR in VLBW infants.

            "text": "Oxidative stress is a common pathway shared by BPD, NEC, sepsis, and EUGR, it causes lipid, protein, and DNA damage. Preterm infants have poor antioxidant defenses in response to oxidative challenge, because the physiologic increase in antioxidant ability occurs at the end of term birth [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Therefore, preterm infants are more susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS)induced damage. Inadequate nutrition increases oxidative stress [28] . Human milk has many bioactive components that prevent oxidative stress [7, 29, 30] . The composition of human milk can vary with the infant's requirements according to its age and other characteristics [31, 32] . High-dose human milk feeding may provide nutritional and bioactive components that mitigate oxidative stress, inflammation, and dietary inadequacies [33, 34] . Furthermore, these protective components of human milk are highly concentrated as the volume of human milk increases. The human milk included own mother's milk and donor milk. Only two of the NICUs in present multicenter study. The volumes of donor milk were low and were combined with human milk. The methods of storage and disinfection of donor milk may also have affected its nutritional composition [35, 36] . A subgroup analysis was performed to verify dose-related effects of donor milk and own mother's milk. The donor milk intake of \u226550 mL/(kg \u00b7 day) during the first 4 weeks of life also reduced the incidence of BPD, NEC, LOS, and EUGR as own mother's milk.",
