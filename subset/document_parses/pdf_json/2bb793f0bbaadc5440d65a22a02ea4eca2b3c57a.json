With as many as thirty-two notable mutations in spike protein in late November, Omicron subsequently and swiftly replaced the circulating Delta and other variants [1] . The recognition of a variant is considered to have taken place two months later than its emergence. The remarkable global spread was notable, involving 50 countries with genome surveillance capacity as of 8 December 2021.",

Here, we present our modelling result from an analysis of genome surveillance data in Gauteng province, South Africa, using an existing estimation technique [2] .",

Multinomial distribution was employed for maximum likelihood estimation of unknown parameters. Figure 1A shows the comparison between predicted and observed fractions of Omicron, Delta, and other variants for 16 September-30 November 2021. R omicron (t) of Omicron was estimated to be 4.2 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1, 9.1) greater than that of the Delta variant. The effective reproduction number of other variants was estimated as 1.3 times (95% CI: 0.7, 2.0) times greater. Alternatively, estimating the relative exponential growth rate from 18 October-30 November 2021, the Omicron variant was 3.3 times (95% CI: 2.0, 7.8) more transmissible than the Delta variant. \u03c9 represents the immune fraction in South Africa. R delta /R omicron is the ratio of the basic reproduction number of Delta variant to that of Omicron, i.e., 1.5 indicating that Delta is more transmissible in a na\u00efve population, 1.0 equally transmissible, and 0.5 indicating that the intrinsic transmissibility of Omicron is twice as large as that of Delta variant.",
