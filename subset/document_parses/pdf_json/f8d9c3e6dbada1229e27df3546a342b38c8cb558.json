They seem to invariably disappoint, the written equivalent of empty calories. This paper asks: is this true? If so, how so? And why? To answer, a selection method produced a modest subset of current, topical white papers to analyzehence this article as a fragment on recent, topical white papers. A simple discourse analysis was performed to find if there was a broad pattern the documents followed, and if a more analysis was required. A clue as to why this pattern prevailed came from criticisms of prognostications about the current pandemic (as of this writing), leading to a return to the reports: who authored them, and how they are situated in politicalsociological terms in LIS discourse? The concluding findings fit with earlier analyses, suggesting much about prestige in LIS and how that is maintained, how practices are (and are not) formulatedand what that has to do with the white papers.",

I did what I try always to do: I left it highlighted, or bookmarked it, or printed a copy, or jotted a quick note to go back to it. My job responsibilities mean I have an obligation to monitor information and research that can help my library and/or my university. When an opportunity ariseslunch at my desk, a bit of time at the end of the day, a cancelled meeting -I return to it. Reading through, I am almost invariably disappointed. \"How we done it good\" publications in library and information science (LIS) are often denigrated as not-real-research, but at least such publications report on something actually being doneusually a definite course of action to solve a problemand what worked (or didn't) for a library, and recent analyses suggest a research ethos and methodology actually informs them (Clarke, 2018a (Clarke, , 2018b . So many white papers pertaining to LIS seem not to do even this; the written equivalent of empty calories. The question is, is this really true? If so, how so? And why? Thinking through these questions required more than grousing about on-the-fly disappointments. There are simply too many white papers produced over too many years to survey all of them, or even a large set. To investigate in a manageable way a selection method was needed to produce a modest subset of white papers to analyze, with an emphasis on recency, topicality and a modest spread of topicshence this article as a fragment. Once formulated, the white papers were reviewed and a simple discourse analysis was performed to find if there was a structure or a broad pattern that they followed, and if a more detailed technical analysis was called for. Why this particular pattern prevailed came in the form current events: prognostications about the fallout from the ongoing pandemic (as of this writing) and criticisms thereof. This led to a return to the reports: who authored them, and how they are situated in political-sociological terms in LIS discourse? Put another way, is there a cogent explanation for how the white papers and their authors are situated in LIS: the why question. The remainder of this paper will follow this outline.",

Second, for brevity's sake limiting the publications to the last 36 months (maximum) as of this writing should mean the reports retain topicality. Third, at least one of the authors should be formally linked to the organization that produced the white paper since the definition states that it is done under its imprimatur. Fourth and last, given that the topic is libraries and higher education, the organization should be nonprofitthat is, much like a think-tank if not actually one. The reason is that there are many forprofit organizations producing white papers as pitches for a particular product or solution for academic librarianship in which they have a financial or professional interest. The white paper genre has become generalized well beyond its origin in government reports and policy recommendations (see the source in footnote 1).",

Pew Research produces reports on libraries (https://www.pewresearch.org/search/libraries), but only a few touch on academic libraries (most out of the date range). Both EDUCAUSE (https://www.educause.edu/) and the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) (https://www.cni.org/about-cni) specifically seek to advance technology agendas in higher educationrelevant, but covering only slice of higher education and sliding close to the for-profit interests of technology firms. OCLC's Research Reports (https://www. oclc.org/research/publications/reports.html) share a bit of both of the previous limitations. The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) produces white papers on a range of topics addressing academic libraries (https://www.arl.org/who-we-are/), but their reports are very often from members or outside consultants, not necessarily representing ARL itself. And, they are primarily aimed at the research library community, not the whole of academic librarianship. Ithaka S + R (ISR) is the best candidate as a source of white papers to select from among. ISR is an independent nonprofit with a broad focus on \"help[ing] academic and cultural communities know what is coming next, learn from rigorous and well-designed research studies, and adapt to new realities and opportunities [by offering] strategic advice and support services [to] help institutions improve their performance and further their missions. We generate action-oriented research for institutional decision-making and act as a hub to promote and guide collaboration across the communities we serve\" (https://sr.ithaka.org/about/). ISR has produced a plethora of white papers across a range of topics on or relevant to academic libraries as of this writing (https://sr.ithaka.org/?s=library), and many of those publications include members of the ISR staff as authors or coauthors: of the roughly 28 white papers (as defined here) of varying types that dealt with academic libraries in the last 36 months as of this writing, 23 of them had ISR-staff authors or coauthors, fitting the selection criteria. Five of thoseone from the second half of 2017, two from 2018 (an extra for topical coverage), and one each from 2019 and the first half of 2020were chosen to analyze, covering a range of relevant topics: a survey of academic library leaders, community college students and their libraries, new academic library services, individual scholarly collection and data practices and libraries, and international students.",

In that earlier study political sociology was adapted and deployed as a tool to analyze power within and among (the political part) social and organizational relationships (the sociological part) in the Beall's List affair. Four groupings were identified as playing a prominent role in the affair: the hegemon of science/scientists, political romantics, librarians, and elite pluralists. It is this last group that is of interest here: the \"chefs\" at the Scholarly Kitchen blog (https:// scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/chefs/) were the identified elite pluralists who commented on and interacted extensively with Beall and his list. Without repeating the entire analysis, this grouping fit Winter's (1993, 184) description of LIS elites: \"oriented toward national and international networking trends \u2026 remote from \u2026 routine organizational problems \u2026 often [identifying] with \u2026 foundations, boards \u2026 and other administrative networks [and] lean[ing] toward the elite corporate culture that controls telematics technology [and] publishing.\" Of particular interest here is that the \"chefs\" grouping overlaps with ISR: four appear on ISR's site as authors when their names are searched, one of whom -Schonfeldis a Director at ISR, and another eight have had their research or work cited/mentioned in ISR papers when searchedexactly half the current \"chefs\" as of this writing.",

Gilmour (2002, 354, 2003 ) did a two-part \"brief history of the future of academic libraries\" from 1975 to 2000, identifying a \"body of speculative and conjectural writings\" that addressed \"great hope and great concern\" at the turn of the millennium, written by LIS elites: coverage of publications by Ivy League and ARL directors and associate university librarians, consultants, library school professors, prestigious scientists, American Library Association presidents, and consultantsall of whom \"spoke\" for the profession and cited one another in their discoursedominate the two articles. A third, smaller analysis that sampled stentorian calls for change on the part of the profession (Buschman, 2003, 10-11) cited seven authors who appeared in the Sapp and Gilmore pieces, and of the remaining seven authors one was a blue-ribbon government panel, one was senior vice president of a prominent (at the time) library systems firm, one was director of a college library, one was president and CEO of OCLC, one was an associate director of an ARL library, one was former city librarian of Los Angeles-turned-consultant, and one was a ARL library-administrator-turned-publisher-and-consultant. The point is that LIS elites have \"voice\" and speak for the profession (Warren, 1996) , referring and responding to one another in circular fashion. Though the ISR grouping fits this political sociology profile, the issue here is different than the earlier analysis of the Beall's List affair: returning to our pandemic-prognostication lession, what is the grouping's interest, and can political sociology help explain why the ISR white papers might be empty calories? It is the pluralist part of LIS elite pluralists that gives us an analytical path",

Following the clue gleaned from pandemic guessers, they are a grouping with interests in weighing in on the issues concerning them: leaders (such as they) are \"crucial,\" they promote just interests by negotiating among themselves as experts, and the resulting \"stability\" within LIS is a good in itself (Cunningham, 2002, 80, 83; Held, 2006, 166) . LIS elites thus \"handle \u2026 affairs efficiently with the largely passive approval\" of the broader profession (Mara, 2008, 111) . Indeed wider participation in decision making is thought neither desirable nor efficacious by elite pluralists (Held, 2006, 209; Cunningham, 2002, 86-87) . And so, the white papers are part of a complex process of \"maintain[ing] their empirical 'realist' credentials\" while leading \"speculation about institutions and \u2026 visions\" (the white papers) that often just reflect their own values (Cunningham, 2002, 89) . We've answered the question of the interests of this grouping, and begun an answer to the why question on these white papers' empty calories: leading via \"incrementalism is [the] rational [path] to change,\" not \"call[s] for required structural reforms\" (Manley, 2003, 389) . This particular political sociology itself encourages \"moderate attitudes [and] behaviors\" and seeks to satisfy \"a multiplicity of preference clusters [through] strategems\" (Miller, 2003, 134) to maintain position. Our LIS elite pluralists are \"much more [prone to] continuity than \u2026 change,\" effectively reducing professional studies (white papers) and decisioning to economic bargaining among the other elite groupings in and around LIS in the interests of stability (Mara, 2008, 111-112) .",

The white papers were reviewed via a simple discourse analysis in light of their self-described Elements, and a more detailed technical analysis was not required. The current pandemic and analyses/criticisms of predictions led to a return to the white papers: who authored them, and how they are situated in political-sociological terms in LIS discourse?

Political sociology provides an analytical path to explaining why the white papers produced by the ISR elite pluralists are empty calories: continuity, smooth bargaining, moderate attitudes and behaviors, and seeking to satisfy a multiplicity of preference clusters through strategems is in their positional and professional interests. Making clear recommendations and claims in the white papers: not so much. More study of the questions is, perhaps, the point. It is remindful of an old joke: What does a lawyer always recommend? Answer: More lawyer. As with the \"chefs\" and the early definition of LIS elites, prestige is maintained by close association with resources (grants) and access to where decisions are made (publishers, foundations) to steer how practices are (and are not) formulated. A sympathetic reading would highlight the terribly delicate balancing act between wildly varying interests that are growing no closer in this work. A less sympathetic one would point to an inside track on more than four million dollars per year of scarce LIS grant funding going toward producing the empty calories of white papers that are produced largely -if perhaps not exclusivelyin maintaining positioning.",
