Additionally, we suggest an asymptotic normal distribution for the MLE for C L in order to construct a mechanism for evaluating products' lifespan efficiency. We have specified all the steps to carry out the test. Additionally, not only does hypothesis testing successfully assess the lifetime performance of items, but it also functions as a supplier selection criterion for the consumer. Finally, we have added two real data examples as illustration examples. ese two applications are provided to demonstrate how the results can be applied.",
