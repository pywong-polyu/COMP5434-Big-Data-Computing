The epidemiologic data is being continuously updated as the epidemic evolves around the world. During previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV1) outbreaks, human to human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites, similar to COVID-19. It is believed that most of the COVID-19 infected individuals will be either asymptomatic or suffer from mild symptoms, with some suffering from acute cardiac events, severe lower respiratory tract infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and other pro-thrombotic events which ultimately can lead to death in certain group of people [5] . Healthcare workers are at a very high risk of acquiring infections by the new SARS COV-2 during provision of care for patients who carry the virus. Many healthcare professionals around the world are succumbing to the complications of COVID-19 despite many being young and having no underlying health problems. This is thought to be related to the increase in the viral load which triggers the immune system into cytokine storm that can lead to wide spread damage resulting in multi-organ failure [6] .",

It is important to work on the assumption that the pandemic will not fully resolve and the possibility of a second wave. In fact, returning to pre COVID-19 era will likely take years unless an effective and safe vaccine is developed and disseminated worldwide. When resuming clinical practice of dentistry post COVID-19, it is expected that the influx of patients will increase. The challenge here is to regulate the flow of the patients and prioritize care to ensure social distancing measures are followed. Simultaneously, it is important to reduce patient's suffering and potential complications from long waiting times. When returning to the \"new normal\" dental practice and training at colleges and/or institutes, all staff and students would be expected to abide by the new rules and regulations. This includes adequate social distancing, reduced gatherings in buildings, in clinical and educational settings.",

Acquiring this equipment from the current market may represent a challenge due to the high demand, hence the sooner the process is initiated, the higher is the probability of success. One example here is the procurement of facial masks. Providing N-95, FFP2 or FFP3 masks is essential, as there is controversial information on the efficacy of the regular surgical face masks in preventing the transmission of disease to the individual who wears it [10] . Good hand washing (for 30 s) and the use of surface disinfectants have been recommended as the most effective measure in reducing the risk of transmission at any setting, thus, the timely procurement of such consumables is critical [11] . Another example is the need to acquire infrared thermometers to screen patients at the reception area. The availability of WHO-approved COVID-19 testing kits to be used with suspected cases will be advantageous in any practice. The well planned procurement of such new essentials is extremely important for the \"new normal\".",

The air should also flow from halls and corridors (cleaner areas) into the isolation rooms (less clean areas) [26] . This prevents cross-contamination and spread of the virus. Regular daily monitoring of the air pressure periodically with audible or visual control system is mandatory. As the first choice, the exhausted air must be drenched directly outside the building. If this is not feasible, until recirculation, the air should be passed through a filter with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) [27] . If the exhaust air is re-circulated, it is suggested to have a high density HEPA filter with a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) of 18 or higher and the doors should be kept closed as much as possible [28] . Barriers such as glass or plastic windows may be an important remedy for reducing Health Care Personnel (HCP) exposures to patients that are potentially contaminated.

DHCP must always be trained to the correct way to wash hands with soap and water or with an alcohol-based hand rub according to the WHO-recommended method [30] . The CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer greater than 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol in healthcare settings. Unless hands are visibly soiled, an alcohol-based hand rub is preferred over \"soap and water\" in most clinical situations due to scientific evidence of better compliance [31] . It is important that DHCP instruct the patients, before any procedure, to use antimicrobial mouth rinse for 30 s with a hydrogen peroxide solution 1% or iodopovidone 0.2% [32] .

Thus, we have presented here an overview and provided practical solutions to be carried out in the post COVID-19 pandemic in a dental setting, at least until identifying an effective vaccine. The dental professionals and staff should be prepared to treat every patient as a suspected COVID-19 carrier and be ready to receive and manage an increased number of patients requiring care when services are resumed. We suggest that dental practices establish a sensible workforce shift schedule and manage patients' scheduling and triaging.
