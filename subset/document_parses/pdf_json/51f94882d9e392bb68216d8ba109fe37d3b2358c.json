Although nutritional deficits in adolescence are not as severe as they appear in childhood and infancy, adolescents are considered as a nutritionally vulnerable population for a variety of reasons, including their greater developmental requirements, their usually unhealthy eating habits, and their lifestyle particularities [2] [3] [4] . At the same time, adolescence consists of a critical period for the establishment of healthy eating habits, that will be kept during the rest of life [5] . According to studies primarily from Western countries, adolescents' diets appear to be less adequate than those of adults [6] . Adolescents' unhealthy eating habits include frequent snacking with high-energy and low nutrient density foods, skipping meals, consuming low amounts of fruits and vegetables, and eating fast food frequently [6] [7] [8] [9] . On the other hand, many adolescents, particularly females, drastically limit their energy intake in their attempt to lose body weight [10, 11] .",

The present findings are in agreement with studies performed in Greek adolescents. The EYZIN study revealed a high degree of adherence to MD for 39.8% of the Greek adolescent population, with 9.7% following a diet of a low quality [70] . Similar results were also observed by Costarelli and associates [71] , with 33.4% of their population exhibiting a high level of adherence to the MD. On the other hand, when compared to other studies performed in representative [72] and less representative samples of Greek adolescents [8, 73] , the results herein indicate a greater adherence to the MD. When compared to studies conducted in athletes, Zorzou [74] reported a lower degree of optimal adherence to the MD among Greek adolescent female athletes (18.4%), whereas Philippou [75] observed an optimal adherence to the MD among 21% of adolescent swimmers.

This result should be interpreted very carefully, as it may lead to the conclusion that better adherence to MD is linked to greater risk of being underweight, which is a serious concern for the sport of gymnastics. In our study, the mean BMI of the athletes was greater than the BMIs that were observed in other studies of adolescent gymnasts [29, 53, 64, [76] [77] [78] and the percentage of underweight athletes was relatively small; this may affect the results of the analysis. Nevertheless, we believe that the association between MD adherence and BMI in non-normoweight athletes should be further examined in future studies. There may be the possibility that athletes that are underweight adhere to the MD, but at the same time they are not able to balance their energy intake. This may happen by eating less than the required amounts or by exercising more than their energy intake can cover (factors that we did not explore in our study), or even by using unhealthy weight control methods. On the other hand, in the group of normoweight athletes, which comprised the majority of our sample, the correlation between KIDMED and BMI was also present. This could mean that for the athletes who have a normal weight, adherence to MD may help them to control their weight and achieve a low, within-normal-limits weight that is considered beneficial for the execution of the exercises. Future research on this vulnerable population could clarify this issue.",

The participants who reported consuming nuts at least 2-3 times per week (42.8%) demonstrated a lower BMI when compared to the girls failing to consume nuts at the same frequency. This finding is in line with other studies conducted among adolescents. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) study, performed on participants from 35 countries, revealed that the adolescents consuming nuts three or more times per week exhibit a lower BMI when compared to those consuming nuts rarely, or never [83, 84] . Another study found that adolescents who reported consuming nuts had a lower likelihood of being overweight or obese [85] . A possible explanation to this association may be that nuts provide significant amounts of essential fatty acids, protein and dietary fibers, thus promoting satiety [84] . Moreover, nut consumption has been correlated to improved overall diet quality in children and adolescents, by increasing their intake of essential nutrients [86] .",

Moreover, as gymnastics is a sport that is associated with a high prevalence of disordered eating, there is also a chance that some athletes might have undiagnosed typical or atypical eating disorders, or chose not to report relevant symptoms. This consists of a serious limitation, that we tried to overcome by asking the parents/guardians (through the consent form) if their child carried a nutrition-related diagnosis (such as diabetes, celiac disease, or anorexia nervosa).

Firstly, in the total sample of the athletes, the linear regression demonstrated that each increase of one KIDMED unit corresponded to a decrease of 0.27 kg/m 2 in the participants' BMI (F(1,267) = 16.22, p \u2264 0.001, \u03b2 = \u22120.27, 95%CI: \u22120.41 to \u22120.14) (Table 4-Model 1). As underweight is a serious and frequent problem in gymnastics, we also explored if this association meant that adherence to the MD was associated with a greater risk of being underweight. Firstly, all overweight athletes were excluded from the analyses in order to determine if the correlation remained. It was indicated that each increase of one KIDMED unit corresponded to a decrease of 0.19 kg/m 2 in the participants' BMI (F(1,252) = 10.26, p = 0.002, \u03b2 = \u22120.19, 95%CI: \u22120.31 to \u22120.07) (Table 4-Model 2). Then, underweight athletes were excluded, and it was observed that each increase of one KIDMED unit corresponded to a decrease of 0.25 kg/m 2 in the participants' BMI (F(1,239) = 14.00, p \u2264 0.001, \u03b2 = \u22120.25, 95%CI: \u22120.38 to \u22120.12) (Table 4-Model 3). Finally, the analysis was repeated using normoweight athletes only. It was revealed that each increase of one KIDMED unit corresponded to a decrease of 0.17 kg/m 2 in the participants' BMI (F(1,224) = 8.84, p = 0.003, \u03b2 = \u22120.17, 95%CI: \u22120.29 to \u22120.06) (Table 4-Model 4).",
