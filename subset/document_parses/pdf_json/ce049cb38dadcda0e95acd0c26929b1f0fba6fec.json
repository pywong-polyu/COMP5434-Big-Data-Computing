Unfortunately, the high percentage of individuals using insulin analogues was not paralleled with the improvement of glycemic control or prevention of diabetes complications [7] . On the contrary, people with diabetes were offered expensive insulin analogues free of charge with no or very limited possibility of glucose monitoring, since the test strips were quite expensive and were largely unavailable for the majority of people with diabetes. It was like driving the most expensive car in the world blindfolded. Such high penetration of insulin analogues was not mirrored by any monitoring of metabolic control parameters that are crucial for the prevention of diabetes complications.",
