It is genetically different from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (MERS coronavirus, MERS-CoV). 1 The WHO has officially named the disease as COVID-19. As of 20 February 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has affected 74 675 persons and has caused more than 2121 deaths in China, and it is rapidly spreading across the world. The recent research of Wang et al has indicated that the higher affinity of SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to ACE2 receptor compared with SARS-CoV leads to its rapid spread across the world. 2 Studies identified that patients with COVID-19 were infected though personto-person transmission, and most patients with COVID-19 travelled to Wuhan within 14 days before the disease onset; also a familial aggregation was observed. 3 The main transmission is respiratory droplets, but it can also be transmitted through close contact. Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted through the fecal-oral route. 4 However, the maternal-fetal vertical transmission remains controversial. Two recent studies showed that there were no clinical findings or investigations suggestive of COVID-19 among neonates born to infected pregnant women and all samples, including amniotic fluid, cord blood and breast milk were detected negative for SARS-CoV-2. 5 6 Moreover, none of the neonates born to pregnant women with Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This is the first study to describe the neurological development of neonates exposed to SARS-CoV-2. \u25ba Data are collected prospectively and systematically using a predesigned standardised case report form in order to minimise the information bias. \u25ba The majority of the data are from Hubei province, so the generalisability may be limited. \u25ba The diagnosis of affected status of COVID-19 for the maternal and neonatal cases were based on reverse transcription PCR tests, which cannot avoid the chance of misclassification.",

Francis et al reported that neonates with FIRS had lower mean motor development scores than those without FIRS. 15 Moreover, animal and clinical studies have indicated that human coronaviruses have been related to central nervous system pathogenic processes, such as demyelinating disease in humans. 16 Human coronavirus in cerebrospinal fluid has been identified as the pathogen in a child with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. 17 Currently, no studies have described the neurological outcomes of neonates with COVID-19. Additionally, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have caused perinatal adverse outcomes, including fetal distress, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth and fetal demise. [18] [19] [20] Compared with the clinical features of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the rate of adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers and fetal mortality seems lower. 5 6 20 For these reasons, we have undertaken this observational study focusing on the clinical course and long-term neurological outcomes of neonates with SARS-CoV-2 exposure.",

Given that SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly and is contagious to the general population, all suspected or confirmed patients are admitted to designated hospitals. Patients are enrolled in this study after receiving informed consent from the patient or their guardian. The medical information questionnaires are classified into maternal and neonatal versions, which include demographic details, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, timing and results of laboratory tests and imaging, and therapeutic data. Two researchers independently check and record the data to ensure accuracy. Each maternal and neonatal case report form (CRF) is assigned a unique identifier number and the initials of the first name and family name of the patient to maintain confidentiality (see CRFs in online supplementary file).",
