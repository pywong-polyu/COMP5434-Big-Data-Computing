The main purpose of the registry is to provide a comprehensive information profile of demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and treatment data of confirmed and probable COVID-19 patients in Hormozgan. The data is retrospectively and prospectively collected. Case report form (CRF) was mainly based on International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) CRF. A web-based, 2-language software was also developed to facilitate data collection and storage. Data analysis is to be conducted with collaboration of clinical physicians, data-mining specialists, and epidemiologists after reaching appropriate sample size.",

            "text": "In facing such pandemics, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) of the Islamic Republic of Iran recommends to execute control programs developed based on scientific evidence to prevent the loss of financial and human resources and to access quality, valid, accurate, and timely data. One of such programs is to establish disease registries (9) . In fact, establishing COVID-19 registries is a solution to collect quality data related to those infected by COVID-19 in different geographical areas. A registry is an organized system that systematically collects clinical and nonclinical data using standard observational methods. In fact, registries combine data from all cases of a particular disease or all individuals with specified characteristics and are implemented in a specific population. Systematic data collection allows for the evaluation of specific outcomes, health-related characteristics, and outcomes according to epidemiological criteria (10) (11) (12) . Given the rapid spread of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to identify specific patients' characteristics and disease outcomes in different populations. Hence, it seems registries can play a critical role in providing quality data for conducting a wide range of research. Registries also follow other objectives, including identifying cases for clinical trials, and collecting timely and accurate data which in turn can assist researchers in various studies (10, 13) . In other words, registries improve our knowledge regarding a disease or a health outcome (12) . Additionally, joint studies using quality data at national and international levels are necessary. Therefore, standardization organizations at national and international levels should take the necessary measures to establish standards for data exchange among registries developed for this purpose. Thus, organizations such as WHO and Ministry of Health will be able to conduct complete and comprehensive programs for prevention, control, and treatment of the disease. Therefore, developing a registry based on a standard method and data set can also be used as a model for other registries. In this study, we aimed to describe our protocol for the development and implementation of regional COVID-19 registry in Hormozgan province (RCovidRH), Iran.",

In the beginning, we developed a steering committee, including 10 experts in related fields such as health information management, information technology, biostatistics and epidemiology, health care administration, virology, and infectious diseases. The committee was responsible to develop the registry protocol, formulate the purposes, secure the funds and operational technical staff, and supervise and evaluate the registry. We developed some operational subgroups, including IT subgroup with the responsibility of developing web-based software; data collection subgroup to find cases and gather and enter the data; data quality subgroup to evaluate the quality of data, provide feedback and improve quality; information management subgroup to review the literature to develop the dataset and CRF; and finally, data analysis subgroup to develop data analysis plan and to conduct data analysis ( Fig. 1) . Recently, we have made the decision to add biobank and patients' follow-up subgroups. ",

We found that organizational coordination is highly important to run a disease registry and improve its implication. After 2 months, our registry is now very well recognized in the university, even at the level of top managers and other clinical departments. We did some predictions based on these data for decision-makers. Some departments, e.g. genetic department, are going to join us to develop a biobank and also add genetics and biobank data to our registry.
