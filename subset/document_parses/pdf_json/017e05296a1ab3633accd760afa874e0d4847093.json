Ontario's mid-stakes tests were meant to ensure accountability and transparency, and assure system-wide improvement, while avoiding the negative effects and perverse incentives of their high-stakes counterparts. The paper provides new evidence from two projects covering almost a 10-year timespan in 10 of Ontario's 72 school districts. It shows that even though mid-stakes testing is milder in its manifestations and effects than high-stakes testing, concerns remain about the need for and side effects of such testing. The findings concern two periods of Ontario educational reform. In the first period, with a specific focus on improving performance in literacy and mathematics, administrators and special education support staff felt that the assessments raised teachers' expectations and sense of urgency leading to steady improvements in measured achievement, but that there was also evidence of negative effects, especially on paying undue attention to \"bubble\" students just below the threshold for minimum proficiency. In the second reform period focused on broad excellence, well-being and equity as inclusion, mid-stakes tests were perceived as having more widespread negative effects. These included teaching to the test, cultural bias, avoidance of innovation, dilemmas of whether to include highly vulnerable students in the testing process or not, and emotional ill-being among students and teachers. The paper concludes that Ontario's twentieth century system of large scale, mid-stakes assessment has not kept pace with its twenty first century commitments to deeper learning and stronger well-being.",

            "text": "Twenty years ago, the leading article in the very first issue of the Journal of Educational Change, of which I was founding Editor-in-Chief, was by Michael Fullan, who invented the entire field of educational change. Fullan presented an argument that both noted and nudged forward what he called \"The Return of Large Scale Reform\" (Fullan 2000) . Commenting on and drawing together evaluations of large-scale reform efforts in large school districts, across huge networks or collaboratives of schools, and within the policies of whole nations, Fullan set out 8 key lessons that could be derived from this collection of reforms. One of these lessons was the importance of combining pressure and support in implementing change. Pointing to research by Hill and Cr\u00e9vola (1999) on literacy improvement in a Catholic system in Victoria, Australia, and also on the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy in the UK (Barber 2009 ), Fullan (2000: 24) argued that accountability, targets and testing were a big part of the pressure-support mix. A standards-based approach to systemic change on a significant scale, Fullan claimed, held promise if schools, districts and nations set out to \u2022 \"Determine standards and set system-wide and school-specific, year-by-year targets\"; \u2022 \"Focus school support services and available funds on achieving the standards and targets\"; \u2022 \"Put in place accountability and incentive arrangements linked to performance against standards and targets\"; and \u2022 \"Conduct periodic full-cohort testing to monitor performance against the standards and targets\".",

Like high stakes testing, mid-stakes testing uses large-scale assessments to report on the progress of schools and systems, and to guide districts' and schools' improvement efforts. It also reports these results online to inform parents' choice of school and, in various ways, to compare schools' performance. However, mid-stakes testing does not come with the punitive consequences of high-stakes testing, such as firing principals and teachers, or closing lowperforming schools. Writing about mid-stakes testing in South Korea, Lee and Kang (2019: 4) describe the government's move from a high-stakes to mid-stakes strategy in 2013 as one involving reduction in the number of testing points, and abolition of uses of the tests for evaluating schools.",

It provides new evidence from two projects covering almost a 10-year time-span which shows that even though mid-stakes testing is milder in its manifestations and effects than high-stakes testing, legitimate concerns remain about the need for and side effects of such testing.

Problematic aspects of Ontario's system-in particular, the nature and sideeffects of its mid-stakes testing processes-have largely been omitted from these accounts, in ways that could prove misleading for other systems interested in adopting some or all of Ontario's reform model.",

Without careful and critical appraisals of high performing systems based on all relevant scientific evidence, there is a risk that global policy advocacy regarding these systems and their characteristics will be based on political ideology and opinion rather than on the full span of empirical research.

On the other hand, our evidence-based appraisal of Ontario reforms and their impact has also pointed to imperfections such as potential sources of cultural bias in definitions of well-being (Hargreaves and Shirley 2018b ), unsustainability of middle-level leadership strategies , and educators' reluctance to acknowledge hierarchies of expertise in the development of collaborative professionalism (Hargreaves and O'Connor 2018) .

The tests were designed to hold schools and systems responsible for public and political accountability in meet learning standards (Smith and O'Day 1990; Darling Hammond 2004) . If schools failed to meet mandated benchmarks or targets for proficiency, then, in the US and UK at any rate, severe consequences could followreplacement of the principal, firing some or all of the staff, takeover by the state or an entity designated by the state such as a private company, or complete closure to enable replacement by a totally different school. For these reasons, large-scale assessments in England and many parts of the US came to be known as being highstakes in character.",

According to the UK Royal Statistical Society, the resulting rates of alleged improvement in achievement scores were, in any authentic sense, statistically improbable (Bird et al. 2005) .

Especially given the prominence and popularity of Ontario as a system that is frequently cited by global policy organizations such as the OECD (2011) and the US National Center for Education and the Economy (Tucker 2011) as one of a very small number of educational systems that are both high performing and quite equitable, and that hosts numerous teams of educators and policy makers from overseas, a critical, balanced and evidence-based appraisal is long overdue.",

At the top, following a strategic concept developed by Harvard Business professor John Kotter (1996) , the overall vision and direction of policy was built by a guiding coalition of government leaders in partnership with key stakeholders such as unions, school boards and business interests. Closely following the UK's Literacy and Numeracy strategy, two priorities were those of literacy and numeracy achievement where the key goals were to \"raise the bar\" and \"narrow the gap\" in measured achievement.

In explicit contrast with the UK model, though, the province pledged and provided significant support to the middle and lower levels in the tri-level model.

The tests received support from administrators and from special education resource teachers. They developed a sense of urgency about expectations and equity by all teachers for all students. They stimulated data-driven collaborative inquiry devoted to diagnosing student difficulties and making interventions in real time. They also enabled system leaders to discharge their responsibilities properly as a result of knowing how the students they served were or were not performing. Teachers and some administrators complained about various aspects of the tests, but none admitted that this adversely affected their own instructional practice. And at the end of the day, the Drive to 75 increased proficiency levels to around 70% by 2011. These new levels were up from 54% at the beginning of the drive in 2004 and were accomplished at gradual rates that were statistically defensible and educationally sustainable, compared to questionably rapid gains in schools and systems in England and the US.",

Partly this would take the form of continuing the movement towards 75% proficiency levels on EQAO assessments, with a particular focus on mathematics, where results had flat-lined and were starting to fall. Other areas of excellence were now added to literacy and mathematics as priorities, like the Arts and STEM. Equity was a third priority alongside excellence and public confidence, but it was no longer interpreted just as narrowing achievement gaps. Equity now encompassed inclusion of diverse and vulnerable groups and their identities, such as indigenous, refugee and LGBTQ students, so they could see themselves, their communities, and their needs reflected in the life and learning of their schools.

Accountability, he said, \"assumes that educators will respond to these prods by putting in the effort to make the necessary changes\" (p. 8).

There are legitimate roles for such assessment in both maintaining accountability and also providing system leaders with knowledge of how their students are performing. However, the authors of the review argued, \"going forward, large-scale assessment data should not be used for individual student diagnostic or evaluative purposes and students should not be subject to excessive test preparation for a summative system-level snapshot\" (p. 4). The report identified a strong consensus about the negative, indirect side effects of EQAO assessments on students' learning and well-being. It concluded that inappropriate uses of EQAO and other large-scale assessments include \"using large-scale provincial assessments for student diagnostic purposes, to infer evaluation of educators, and for ranking schools and school boards\" (p. 8).",

The report also recommended providing effective accommodations and modifications for students with special educational needs including appropriate exemptions; and mitigating unintended negative consequences especially by sticking to the original purpose of EQAO in providing a summative snapshot rather than also being used as a tool to promote improvements and interventions in particular schools and districts and to rank schools (pp. 11-13).",

Subsequently, other adjustments have been announced, such as greater accommodations for English Language Learners, and inclusion of Indigenous content, pointing to incremental implementations of other aspects of the advisors' review, but falling short of abolishing testing before Grade 6.",

Instead, he is concentrating on developing global networks of innovative schools committed to deep learning as expressed in qualities such as creativity, character, and citizenship . With Dennis Shirley, my own work, meanwhile, draws on our research on the second period of Ontario educational reform from 2014, to outline a move in Ontario and elsewhere from an Age of Achievement and Effort in which narrow achievement goals and testing prevailed, to an Age of Engagement, Identity and Wellbeing in which broader and more inclusive goals of learning and human development are more evident alongside declining commitments to top-down reform strategies, including large scale and especially high stakes testing (Shirley and Hargreaves, in press) . In this respect, with regard to the wider field of educational change and assessment, while the work of Fullan and myself had undergone a considerable divergence in the first decade and a half of the twenty first century during the Age of Achievement and Effort, it has reached a new convergence in the latter part of this second decade.",

But when educational goals for learning and well-being become broader and deeper, as many contemporary system goals have become in an Age of Engagement, Identity and Wellbeing, the evidence of this research on their use in Ontario, is that this 20-year old strategy of accountability and systemic improvement is now an educationally ineffective and systemically incoherent anachronism.",
