During the pandemic, many firms have been forced to close or minimize their operations and those who continue deployed new digital systems for communications to adapt to the COVID-19 environment. Studies prove that digital technologies such as social media, information systems technology, and cloud-based infrastructure played an important role in response to the pandemic, and they are no longer used by firms but by societies [2] . In a postpandemic, the competitiveness between firms will increase due to the periods of lockdowns during the pandemic and the future is for who can be equipped with up-to-date methodologies and technologies [3] .",

In the post-pandemic and with the widespread of new technologies like social media and big data, these systems became inefficient. At present, billions of people around the world use social media platforms daily to share their interests, opinions, activities, etc. [5] . Consequently, a huge amount of data is produced more than ever before and has different characteristics such as big volume, big velocity, big variety, and big value [6] . So, it is impossible to benefit from these big data by using classical business intelligence systems, and the evolution to modern systems based on new technologies became an urgent necessity for firms, specifically in a post-pandemic phase [7] .",

Making appropriate data collection tool for each social media platform may be a good solution to solve this problem. For example, API is a good solution for Twitter, but in Facebook the privacy of users' data, long text of messages, and streaming data are still challenges for effective data collection tools. (ii) Data quality: as data are unstructured and collected from a wide range of users, the quality of data will be decreased. Data quality faces many challenges such Journal of Healthcare Engineering as the difficulty of data integration due to the diversity of data sources that bring abundant data types and complex data structures, judging data quality within a reasonable amount of time due to huge amount of data, and timeliness of data is very short due to the fast change in data that require high technologies in processing and data quality standards [52] . Data cleaning and filtering techniques can deal with this issue [39, 53] . (iii) Privacy: protecting the privacy of users on social media platforms is an important issue. Collecting the personal data of users by firms without striking a balance between the use of personal data and privacy concerns makes an untrusted environment. e balance is regarding to type of service, personal data, customers served, and regulatory environments. Some challenges are still open for privacy problems such as social identification and evaluation of test privacy-preserving services with real data [36] . Some solutions are given for this problem such as \"k-anonymity\" and \"differential privacy\" [36] , but more efforts are still required. (iv) Validity: social media data may face some issues such as misinformation, fake accounts, and fake news. ese issues make a bad effect on any analytical process, and the output insights will be biased; for example, the mislead public opinion that occurred during the 2016 US presidential election [54] . Section 5.3 works on solving validity issue. Besides, an ensemble machine learning approach through effective feature extraction is a considerable technique to classify fake news. It extracts the important features of fake news and then classified them using ensemble models with a high accuracy rate [55] .",
