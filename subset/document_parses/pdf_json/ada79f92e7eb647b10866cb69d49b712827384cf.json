On the other hand, the overinvestment hypothesis posits that managers (insiders) may overinvest in CSR activities to build their reputation for being a socially responsible manager at the expense of shareholders, which in turn reduces firm performance and value (Barnea & Rubin, 2010; Cespa & Cestone, 2007) . In the same vein, Manchiraju and Rajgopal (2017) show that mandatory CSR expenditures reduce shareholder value. Notably, Nelling and Webb (2009) advocate that the causal relation between CSR and financial performance is a virtuous circle-that is, CSR activities lead to good performance and whether firms showing superior financial performance devote more resources to CSR activities. Thus, extensive literature focusing on the CSRfirm performance relation explores the correlation between firm performance and CSR activities instead of causation (see Cheng, Hong, & Shue, 2013) .",

We use the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment in which the pandemic acts as an exogenous financial shock that disrupts firms' financial conditions (value), but the levels of CSR activities remain fixed, at least in the short term. In other words, the COVID-19 crisis is a precipitous and unpredictable event, and thus it is exceptionally challenging for firms to adjust their optimal CSR activities concerning a future financial crisis. In such a case, we can contemplate CSR activities as an exogenous variable that explains shareholder value during a subsequent crisis. As a result, we can mitigate endogeneity issues attributable to the recursive CSR-shareholder value relation. Also, unlike previous financial crises, such as the 2008 global financial crisis that originated from financial imbalances and risks that soared over multiple years, the COVID-19 originated out of public health concerns (a viral pandemic) that severely restricted global economic activity (Bernanke, 2020) . Subsequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented and unpredictable shock to the global economy (Georgieva, 2020; Shehzad, Xiaoxing, & Kazouz, 2020) . Managers may be destitute in countering it strategically, leaving them clueless to manage shareholder value, at least in the short term.",

First, it is difficult to control all country-specific factors that may influence shareholder value and CSR activities. Second, the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy is not uniform, and thus, a single-country analysis provides a homogeneous ground for the empirical study. Finally, as a developing economy, India offers many unique characteristics that may influence the stated relation. In India, weak investors' protection rights coupled with concentrated ownership provide incentives and capacity to controlling owners to expropriate minority shareholders (Bertrand, Mehta, & Mullainathan, 2002; Chauhan & Kumar, 2018) . Therefore, it will be exciting to explore the role of CSR activities, particularly governance metrics, in determining shareholder value when the confidence of investors is low, and a drop in expected returns on investments may result in more expropriation by controlling owners, producing a further decline in shareholder value. In the same vein, Johnson, Boone, Breach, and Friedman (2000) find that during the Asian financial crisis, managers of weak corporate governance firms were involved in more expropriation.",

Refinitive ESG database evaluates firms' CSR activities based on three pillars: social, environmental, and corporate governance. Using 155 Indian firms, we observe that firms belonging to the top quintile of CSR scores before entering the COVID-19 outbreak have significantly higher stock returns (0.16% per month) than firms belonging to the bottom quintile of CSR scores. This result suggests that investors should expand their focus beyond financial performance to explore the determinants of shareholder value during distress periods.",

Most of the studies explore the CSR-shareholder value relation in a typical scenario. Therefore, the empirical findings may be vulnerable to endogenous concerns that make it challenging to identify whether CSR affects firm value or vice versa. Our paper is very close to Buchanan et al. (2018) and Lins et al. (2017) , who study how CSR affects firm value around the 2008 global financial crisis (2008) (2009) . We believe that a two-year time period is adequate for firms to adjust their policies. Nevertheless, our study exploits the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment that has mushroomed with alarming speed, bringing economic activities to a near standstill as countries imposed strict lockdown. 1 Thus, we contemplate that COVID-19 is a sharper exogenous shock to shareholder value and allows us to directly examine how investors adjust stock value with different levels of CSR activities.",

            "text": "This theory is grounded on agency problems stemming from conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders. It posits that managers (insiders) may spend firms' resources on CSR activities to increase their reputation and portray themselves as socially responsible managers at the cost of outside shareholders. As a result, such overinvestment can destroy firm value. In the same vein, Barnea and Rubin (2010) show that higher insider holding is negatively related to CSR activities. Kr\u00fcger (2015) , Manchiraju and Rajgopal (2017) , and Cheng et al. (2013) also show that CSR activities are detrimental to shareholder value. Ben-Nasr and Ghouma (2018) observe that employee's welfare positively contributes to stock price crash risk. Based on these opinions, we propose our first hypothesis that predicts a negative relation between CSR and shareholder value during the outbreak of COVID-19.",

The contract theory postulates that the firm is a nexus of contracts between managers and other stakeholders wherein stakeholders are the supplier of resources required to operate the firm in exchange for claims outlined either with explicit contracts (e.g., wage contracts or product warranties) or with implicit contracts (e.g., the promise of job security) (Alchian & Demsetz, 1972; Coase, 1991; Hill & Jones, 1992; Jensen & Meckling, 1976) . Unlike explicit contracts, implicit contracts are vague and have limited legal supports. Firms, therefore, can violate implicit contracts without legal recourse from other stakeholders. Nevertheless, firms' commitment, such as CSR engagements, to endorse implicit contracts can increase the value of implicit contracts, increasing firm value (Cornell & Shapiro, 1987) .",

Consistent with this view, Guenster (2010) and Jiao (2010) document a positive valuation effect around CSR activities. In this study, we postulate that CSR activities should pay off for firms when the trust and cooperation from other stakeholders are more valuable, particularly during an enormously uncertain period such as the COVID-19. Moreover, stakeholders' trust prevailing in firms with greater CSR activities can help investors pay a valuation premium to these firms when the overall market is facing an unprecedented uncertainty.",

We rerun our regression equation, with our independent variable being environmental scores (ESR), social scores (SR), and governance scores (GSR), and report the results in Table 4 . The coefficient of all three scores is positive, but the coefficient of governance scores (GSR) is statistically different from zero.

The collapse of the stock market was vigorous and rapid, and firms would not have sufficient time to adjust their policies, such as CSR activities. We use this episode as an exogenous shock to equity value and study the effect of CSR on stock value during the COVID-19 period. Using Indian data, we observe a positive relation between CSR activities and shareholder value during the COVID-19 crisis period. Consistent with the stakeholder theory, it is evident that firms' concern for various stakeholders pays off during distress periods. As far as three major components of CSR activities (environmental, social, and governance) are concerned, only the governance score has a notable positive impact on firm performance. The result highlights the relevance of strong corporate governance practices to curb managerial expropriation during a crisis period.",

Firms belonging to the top quintile (61.576) of CSR activities before the COVID-19 pandemic earned 2% higher annualized raw returns and 1.9% higher annualized excess return than firms belonging to the bottom quintile (37.46). Note that CSR activities are measured before the dependent variable (stock returns). Therefore, our results are unlikely to be vulnerable to endogeneity caused by the recursive relation.
