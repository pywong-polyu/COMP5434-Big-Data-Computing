Sequencing cost remains a major concern in sequencingbased study, although the application of next generation sequencing has dramatically decreased the sequencing cost and increased the efficiency. The choice of sequencing depth and the sequencing sample size will largely determine the final study investment and performance. Many studies have been conducted to find a cost-effective design of sequencing depth that can achieve certain sequencing accuracy using minimal sequencing cost. The strategies previously studied can be classified into two groups: (1) single-stage to sequence all the samples using either high (>~30\u00d7) or low (<~10\u00d7) sequencing depth; and (2) two-stage to sequence an affordable number of individuals at a high-coverage followed by a large sample of low-coverage sequencing. However, limited studies examined the performance of the medium-coverage (10-30\u00d7) sequencing depth for a genetic association study, where the optimum sequencing depth may exist. In this study, using a published simulation framework, we comprehensively compared the medium-coverage sequencing (MCS) to the single-and two-stage high/low-coverage sequencing in terms of the power and type I error of the variant discovery and association testing. We found, given certain sequencing effort, MCS yielded a comparable discovery power and better type I error control compared with the best (highest power) scenarios using other high-and low-coverage single-stage or two-stage designs. However, MCS was not as competent as other designs with respect to the association power, especially for the rare variants and when the sequencing investment was limited.",

The single-stage design is to sequence all the samples using either high (>~30\u00d7) or low (<~10\u00d7) sequencing depth. The two-stage design is first sequencing an affordable small number of individuals at a high coverage to create a reference panel, then followed by a large sample of low-coverage sequencing and perform dense imputation based on the locally constructed reference. It has been shown that using the local reference panel can help identify rare variants that may be missed in other populations [7] [8] [9] . There were plenty of studies focused on single-stage design. For example, Flannick et al. [3] developed a statistical framework to compare the sensitivity and specificity of lowcoverage (0.5-4\u00d7) sequencing and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array (100 k to 2.5 M) individually and jointly. Pasaniuc et al. [4] studied the performance of extremely low-depth (0.1-0.5\u00d7) sequencing in genomewide association study. In addition, Li et al. [10] systematically compared the performance of both low and high depth (2-30\u00d7) sequencing for studies of complex traits. Regarding the two-stage design, Xu et al. [11] simulated the entire study process of sequencing-based association study and showed that the two-stage sequencing was an effective approach under certain conditions, such as for the discovery of rare variants.",

[12] concluded that under a large sample size, medium or low coverage might be more cost-effective than the other study designs. Xu et al.

Independent case-control scenarios were considered having equally distributed samples of European populations based on an additive genetic model. Given a certain sequencing coverage and sample size, samples of sequencing data with SNPs in a region of 100 kb were generated based on the reference genome chromosome 22. The length of 100 kb spans long enough to cover an LD block for European populations. The commonly used Illumina pair-end sequencing reads with 125 bp read length were generated by ART [14] . SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) \u2265 0.05, 0.01 \u2264 MAF < 0.05, and MAF < 0.01 were defined as common, low-frequency, and rare SNPs, respectively. Among the simulated SNPs, 15 causal SNPs were randomly selected with the effect size (deleterious only) determined by controlling the variance it explained to be~1% respectively for each selected SNP. In the generated simulation data, the actual variance explained by all causal variants corresponded to 10.9%. We set the disease prevalence to be 9.3%, which is similar to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the United States [15] . The disease associations for simulated SNPs were simulated by Hapgen2 [16] and tested by PLINK (v1.07) [17] , PLINK/ SEQ (v0.10, https://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/plinkseq/), and SKAT [18] . The procedure was repeated 1000 times for each scenario. The complete simulation code is available at https://github.com/xu1912/spS-Gas.",

A logistic regression model was employed to perform an association test of the variants with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In addition, the rare variants were examined by the region-based association test SKAT as follows: We divided each of the simulated 100 kb sequences into nine regions with a length of 20 kb by a sliding window of 10 kb. Only rare variants were considered for each region. Multiple testing was adjusted by Bonferroni correction.

For MCS, with the same sequencing effort, sequencing more subjects at a lower coverage usually resulted in a higher discovery power, especially for the rare variants (Table 2 and Fig. 1 ). For example, given the effort of 48 kpd, the rare variant discovery power increased from 76.82% to 81.98% when the sample size increased from 2000 to 4000 and coverage decreased from 24\u00d7 to 12\u00d7 (Table 2 ). Relative to the other types of sequencing coverage under the same sequencing effort, the MCS did not exhibit greater advantage in the power for variant detection. The MCS only led at effort level of 12 kpd by a narrow margin (Fig. 1) . However, we can find a two-stage scenario (100@30 + 4000@2) reaching a higher power with less sequencing effort than the MCS at 12 kpd. At other effort levels, the medium-coverage resulted in detection power close to the best (highest power) of other scenarios, most of which were low-coverage as depicted in Table 3 . We defined optimum power ratio (OPR) to compare the best power performance of MCS to other sequencing designs at the same sequencing effort. In Table 3 Table 1 ). For instance, among 48 kpd scenarios, the optimum power using MCS was very close to that using other coverages (87.52% vs 88.01% from low-coverage) with a less corresponding type I error (0.01% vs 0.02%). At other slices with OPR > 0.9, the type I error of MCS was also much lower relative to the other scenarios with a higher power, such as the 8, 16, and 24 kpd with the type I error ratio (TR) of 18.45%, 33.33%, and 1.36% respectively (Table 3) . Further, at 12 kpd scenarios, MCS not only yielded higher power but also much less type I error with TR of~0.01 (0.01% vs 0.77%).",

The sample size played a more important role in association than the choice of sequencing depth for the design using medium-coverage. Given a certain sequencing effort, the larger sample size always produced higher power (Supplementary Table 1 ). When collapsing the coverage axis (as depicted in Fig. 2a) , an increase of sample size led to a power gain (Fig. 2a and c) . However, if we collapsed the sample size axis (as depicted in Fig. 2b) , the benefit of using a higher coverage was very limited (Fig. 2b, c) . In addition, MCS was not as competent as other sequencing coverages in identifying disease-associated variants. The OPR was only 24.71% (7.42% vs 30.04% from low-coverage) when the sequencing effort was fixed at 4 kpd. With the sequencing effort increased from 4 to 48 kpd, the OPR elevated from 0.25 to 0.92 (Table 3) . We observed a similar trend for the type I error of association testing using MCS relative to other sequencing coverages. The higher sequencing effort, the closer type I error using MCS to other sequencing options, while the type I error of MCS was always less (Table 3 ). In Fig. 3a , we plotted the common variant association power versus type I error for the scenarios with optimum power using MCS and other sequencing depth under the same sequencing efforts. The points from optimum MCS and other sequencing coverages likely lie in the same line, which also provided a general idea of how the sequencing-based genetic association study performed given our model assumption. Similar results were also observed for the association test of low-frequency variants (Table 3 and Fig. 3b ). However, MCS was able to achieve high power to identify low-frequency variants with less type I error than the other sequencing options. When the sequencing effort is large, at 48 kpd, MCS yielded higher power (64.13% from 4000@12 vs 57.61% from lowcoverage 6000@8) and 21% less type I error based on the comparison of same scenarios (17.18% vs 21.71%).",

In the scenarios with optimum power using other sequencing coverages, the testing power quickly rose t\u00f5 90% when the sequencing effort was over 8 kpd.

Assuming a disease prevalence of~9.3% and 15 causal variations, our result is generalizable to the study of complex diseases, like type 2 diabetes, but not rare diseases or single-gene disorders. Our result showed that, given certain sequencing investment, the variant discovery power of MCS was just close to the best power of the other schemes. However, the medium-coverage yielded less type I errors in variant discovery compared with the best (highest power) of others. Further, the variant association testing power of using medium-coverage was not comparable with the best power of others for most of the cases. Based on our findings, we can make an addendum to existing guidelines on designing a cost-effective sequencing study given a certain sequencing investment. If the study goal is only detecting variants/mutations and there is sufficient sequencing effort (\u226512 kpd), medium-coverage is applicable in addition to low-coverage and appropriate twostage design. Medium-coverage can reach a tightly close power but will be less error-prone relative to low-coverage and two-stage design. However, if the study goal is not only detecting but also identifying disease-associated variants, MCS may not be appropriate. Instead, low-coverage and two-stage schemes should be adopted. In summary, we provided a recommendation table for the selection of low-/ medium-/high-coverage and two-stage sequencing when designing a genetic association study (Supplementary Table 3 ).",

Gilly et al. found that genotype accuracy is substantially more dependent on sequencing depth for indels than for SNPs [13] . In a recent study, the performance of several CNV detection tools varied with the sequencing depth, with high-coverage resulted in high sensitivity and specificity [20] . We expected the sequencing coverage would play a more important role than that in the present study of SNP. The high-coverage sequencing may be more appropriate for scenarios targeted on SVs. The cost-efficiency of various sequencing coverage in the study of indels, CNVs, and other SVs needs further investigation. By comparing MCS scenarios together with single-stage low-/high-coverage and two-stage sequencing scenarios, we have investigated nearly all the practically used sequencing depth. Some general guidelines can be concluded to design a sequencing-based association study. First, the sample size is more important than the sequencing depth for the association test. Second, increasing the sequencing coverage does help in decreasing the error of variant detection. Above all, one limitation of our study is that the default parameter setting in the simulation was used without fine-tuning and thus the observed type I error may not represent the true number in real-world analysis. However, our study still faithfully presented the performance of MCS and other sequencing coverage.",
