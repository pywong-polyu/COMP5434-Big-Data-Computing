As an overly anthropogenic diet can have negative health consequences for wildlife, monitoring the frequency of foraging in litter compared to natural food resources can be an important component of wildlife conservation efforts. To understand how common litter foraging is among different bird species, we conducted a citizen science project with volunteers across the UK. Through this project, we also tried to engage people in birdwatching and bird surveys who would not normally participate in these activities. A particular focus was on recruiting respondents from underrepresented groups, and the methodology was designed to accommodate people without any background knowledge of birds. While we did not receive enough observations to draw conclusions about the litter foraging rates of different bird species across the UK, we report the submissions we received, as well as the demographic composition of the volunteer group. We successfully reached volunteers who did not participate in birdwatching or BTO bird surveys before, as well as some young volunteers, but were unsuccessful in reaching respondents from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. We hope that the successes and failures of our methods reported here can be useful to others designing citizen science studies, so that birdwatching and volunteering for bird surveys will be equally accessible to all in the future.",

House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) are more abundant in areas where there is access to rubbish containers, compared to areas where rubbish is stored underground or managed more effectively (Bernat-Ponce et al., 2021) .

Other than waste disposal sites, birds generally forage in areas where human activity occurs, such as picnic areas (Kurosawa et al., 2003) , where they may directly take food from humans (Kurosawa 1999 , as cited in Kurosawa et al., 2003) .",

Adult birds who consumed a higher proportion of anthropogenic food had a significantly greater body mass compared to that of individuals which consumed a higher proportion of naturally occurring foods (Catto et al., 2021) . A study conducted on urban American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) nestlings found that they had higher levels of cholesterol compared to their rural counterparts, though evidence as to whether cholesterol negatively or positively impacts avian life is mixed (Townsend et al., 2019) . Birds have also been observed to eat cigarette butts which contain toxic chemicals and plastics, which may consequently impact health and survival (Torkashvand et al., 2020) . Plastic has been found in the faeces of urban black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), but almost none was found in that of Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), which avoid urban habitats (Balleko et al., 2021) .",

Without continued involvement in their citizen science they would be unable to provide detailed analysis of changes to the UK's bird population. In doing so, the BTO has helped to establish a community around birding; whether that's working with bird observatories, supporting young people, or getting people outside and using their green spaces. Citizen science's impacts on mental health and wellbeing for many people and particularly those of young people is of paramount importance (White et al., 2019) . However, more work still needs to be done to encourage a more diverse population of birders participating in bird surveys and to ensure their safety when joining. Women, young people, people of colour, people without a background in higher education, and people in lower income households remain minorities within birding (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 2009 ).",

Understanding the prevalence of litter foraging along the urban-rural gradient, as well as potential differences between species, is an important component of wildlife conservation work. The second aim was to develop a survey that is accessible to volunteers from the general public who don't have any previous knowledge about birds. Projects such as this can help engage more people with the natural world, and in particular the birds in front of their doorsteps. While not necessarily collecting much usable data and not a solution to other deterring factors such as racism, sexism, and financial constraints, this project seeks to help engage underrepresented groups by reducing the barrier of required prior knowledge and prior established contact with the bird community through our design of the questionnaire and use of recruitment channels. Recruitment of a citizen science sample not only provides the opportunity to engage different communities in bird watching, but it also presents the opportunity to educate people and encourage behavioural change initiatives (Van Noordwijk et al., 2021) , such as reduced rates of littering. We focused on reaching groups currently underrepresented in birdwatching, in particular with regards to age and socioeconomic backgrounds.",

We therefore chose to only report the observations submitted. It should however be noted that the species reported to consume human food in place of naturally occurring food were consistent with previous research (Palacio, 2019) : Urban exploiters such as Gulls, Crows and Pigeons were found to be foraging in diverse habitats and predominantly eating human food in place of naturally occurring foods in more than half of the observations submitted for those species. Gulls were observed to exclusively forage and consume human food in place of natural food. Garden birds, Magpies, Starlings, and Blackbirds were reported to consume human food to a much lower degree, and in the case of the Blackbird not at all. These species were also observed foraging in areas such as gardens and parks, as opposed to streets. Although these species relied to a greater degree on naturally occurring foods, in this study we included food items which could also be provided by humans, such as nuts on bird feeders, as natural food.",

We were partially successful in this endeavour: In our sample gender was well balanced, approximately half the respondents were not already engaged in regular birdwatching and almost none of the participants have been involved with the British Trust of Ornithology (BTO) before. 14 participants made use of the option to enter common names for birds in place of species names, which was added to increase accessibility. 10 volunteers were under the age of 30, six of them 18 or younger.",
