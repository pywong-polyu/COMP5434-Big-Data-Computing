The model coefficients are calculated: the growth rate and the expected number of infected people, as well as the exponent indexes in the generalized logistic equation. It is shown that the dependence of the number of the infected people on time is well described on average by the logistic curve (within the framework of a simple or generalized logistic equation) with a determination coefficient exceeding 0.8. At the same time, the dependence of the number of the infected people per day on time has a very uneven character and can be described very roughly by the logistic curve. To describe it, it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the model coefficients on time or on the total number of cases. Variations, for example, of the growth rate can reach 60%. The variability spectra of the coefficients have characteristic peaks at periods of several days, which corresponds to the observed serial intervals. The use of the stochastic logistic equation is proposed to estimate the number of probable peaks in the coronavirus incidence.",

            "text": "Already in this century, several global epidemics have broken out (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), etc.). The latest coronavirus epidemic struck everyone with its scale and affected literally all countries forced to take emergency measures to prevent the infection spread of (closure of state borders, quarantine, self-isolation, temporary work break of many enterprises and institutions, transition to distance work and training). The number of people infected in the world exceeds 4.89 million people (the data from end-May 2020), and the number of deaths is more than 320,0 0 0 people. General information about this viral infection can be found on the Internet. The dynamics of the disease spread is illustrated in Fig. 1 , built according to the World Health Organization (WHO) website ( https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports ) on 05/20/2020. In this figure, the growth in the number of coronavirus cases in the world and in several countries is indicated in a semi-logarithmic scale. The dashed lines show exponential asymptotics corresponding to doubling the number of cases in a certain number of days. Asterisks indicate the days when countries introduced restrictive measures. As one can see, the nature of the epidemics spread in each country follows almost the same scenario, first there is an exponential growth (or close to exponential) of the number of infected people, and then this growth slows down (however, the numerical values of the constants describing these curves are different for different countries). In some countries, the number of cases is no longer increasing, so the coronavirus epidemic in these countries is almost over. In other countries, the curves in these coordinates are still almost straight lines, which means an exponential increase in the number of cases, and the epidemic has not yet reached its peak. In general, these curves are quite smooth, although some of them show bends associated with the action of certain quarantine measures. Fig. 2 presents the dynamics of the infection by days, built on the same data. In contrast to Fig. 1 , the curves in Fig. 2 are not smooth, and sporadic outbreaks of the number of cases are noticeable in them, which is caused by many, often unpredictable reasons. These data show that in the dynamics of the epidemic spread there are different scales from several months (the total epidemic duration), to several weeks (the incubation period), and even up to several days (the serial interval and local causes). Some of the scales are associated with certain virus properties, others -with https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110241 0960-0779/\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The noted features of the dynamics of the COVID-19 virus spread can be reproduced in mathematical models.",

            "text": "To explain the spread of epidemics and predict their consequences, a number of mathematical models of different complexity levels are used. Historically, the first model is the Verhulst logistic equation [1] , representing a nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. It is also used as the simplest model to describe the population growth and advertising performance. Qualitatively, it explains the increase in the number of disease cases over the time presented in Fig. 1 : the exponential increase in the number of infected people at the initial stage of the epidemic development and the tendency towards a constant value by the end of the epidemic. In the context of COVID-19, this model is used in [ 2 , 3 ] . The COVID-19 data analysis given in [4] , showed that an exponential increase in the number of cases at the initial stage is found mainly in America and Australia, while in many European countries it is a power law. In this case, one can use the generalized logistic equation [ 5 , 6 ] , and it was used in [ 3 , 7-9 ] . From the mathematical point of view, the dynamics in the framework of the logistic equation is trivial. More complex dynamics, including chaotic, arise in the different logistic equation or when the delay for the incubation period is accounted for [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , and these models are also used to interpret and forecast COVID-19 [15] [16] [17] .",

The more complex is the model, the larger is the number of its coefficients. The experience of using models to interpret \"old\" epidemics may not always help, since the intensity of the virus impact on living organisms changes, many epidemics were local, and, accordingly, measures to prevent the epidemic spread were different. The pattern of the curves shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , shows their strong differences for different countries, which is associated with different population density, differences in their customs, traditions and administrative preventive measures. Therefore, any forecasts at the initial stage of the epidemic development regarding its final stage are very rough and unreliable. As the epidemic develops, more and more constants in the equations can be determined from medical databases, but the previous constants are also corrected. Therefore, in essence, for prognostic purposes, equations with variable coefficients are solved, which mathematical properties (existence, convergence and stability) are not defined. As a result, different models with permanently \"corrected\" coefficients can lead to close forecast results for a short time. At the same time, for long-term forecasts, it is necessary to understand the possible temporal variability of the model coefficients, and their influence on the character of the obtained solutions.",

Section 2 presents the classical logistic equation and shows the calculations of the coefficient average values within this equation for the above mentioned countries. It has been shown that this model with a high determination coefficient is suitable to describe the number of patients with coronavirus in most countries, except for South Korea. To take into account the data randomness on the number of cases per day, it is proposed to switch to a stochastic logistic equation with external force. The spectral and statistical properties of random parameters of this equation are investigated. Section 3 describes the same procedure within the framework of the generalized logistic equation.

Therefore, later in this section we will not use the data on South Korea, for which the logistic model is not suitable (this case is analyzed in the next section).

In the former case, the logistic equation remains to be the ODE with constant coefficients, but it has a rather complex nonlinearity. In the latter case we come to the ODE with variable coefficients. We study both possibilities of changing the growth rate coefficient r . Fig. 4 , top, shows the variability of the function r ( N ) for Austria and Switzerland. For convenience, we switched to a dimensionless variable r norm = ( r \u2212 r ) / r , for its variability to be more obvious. Herewith we didn't take into account the first few days, when nothing is clear with the epidemic, and the last few days, when the epidemic was essentially over, since these points correspond to the small values of the denominator in Eq. (9) . Reducing the number of points, of course, affects somewhat the average value of this coefficient (for Austria 0.225 instead of 0.195 as in Fig. 3 , 0.2 instead of 0.16 for Switzerland), but more important is the demonstration of variability of the coefficient r . Functional dependence r ( N ) can be rewritten in more familiar terms of temporal variability r ( t ), presented in Fig. 4 , bottom, where it is demonstrated that this coefficient changes almost every day. As an example, let us give the amplitude spectrum of the coefficient variation r , relative to the average, for Austria and Switzerland ( Fig. 5 , left) . Peaks corresponding to intra-weekly variability are clearly visible on the spectrogram due to the fluctuation properties of the epidemic spread, which are different inside condominiums with different apartment numbers or on farms far from each other. In fact, changes in model coefficients can be considered to be random. The probability distribution of the same coefficient for Austria and Switzerland is characterized by the probability density ( Fig. 5 , right) , which is well described by a normal curve. The standard deviation is not small (60-70%), that fact speaks once again about the necessity to take into account the growth rate variability in the epidemic dynamics.",

More interesting are the magnitude of the exponent indexes in Eqs. (14) , (15) and their differences from the unity in a simple logistic model. The power \u03b1 varies from 0.6 to 1.2, and it is not very far from the unity.

For Austria and Switzerland, the characteristics of variability have not changed much compared to those considered above, which is to be expected, since both models give similar results for them. But now we can evaluate the growth rate variability for South Korea, for which a simple logistic model does not work. In general, the characteristics of variability are close for different countries, in the sense that the spectra have peaks at close frequencies and the histograms are qualitatively similar. Similarly, we can relate the data discrepancy with the theory using the \"external force\" introduced analogously to Eq. (12) : Fig. 11 shows the calculated dependences of external force on the number of patients and on the time. Its spectral and probability characteristics are illustrated by Fig. 12 . The corresponding graphs are similar to those within a simple logistic curve.

This is illustrated by Fig. 13 , which shows the actual data and logistic curves. It is evident that for many countries the use of the simple logistic equation leads to a very good agreement with the available data. The use of a generalized logistic curve improves the agreement significantly, including the countries for which the logistic model is too crude (for example, South Korea). It is worth noting that the prognostic number of the total number of cases N \u221e in the generalized logistic model is slightly higher than in the simple logistic model, and the approach to the limiting constant value is delayed in time. Fig. 14 illustrates the capabilities of the logistic model for describing the number of sick people per day. On average, the theoretical model describes the real data rather well, but the scatter of points is still not small, and sometimes deviations can reach 50% and higher, although on average they are less than 50%. These differences are especially evident near the epidemic peak when it is desirable to have a more accurate prognosis for medical facilities. The extent to which this scatter is better described by other models (such as SIR models) will be clear in the near future when the results of relevant studies appear. From the mathematical point of view, the resulting difference in the use of the logistic model to describe two characteristics: the total number of cases ( N ) and the number of cases per day ( K ) is obvious: the curve N ( t ) is the integral with respect to K ( t ), and, therefore, it is smoother and more determined. To describe the dependence K ( t ), at least on a qualitative level, it is better to use stochastic equations of a logistic model of the Eq. (19) type, where external random forces or random coefficients are introduced. They will help to understand the degree of the data spread, and, what is most important, the number of possible large outliers during the epidemic. Such work remains to be done.",

Such models should include high-order ODEs and PDEs, taking into account lagging arguments and integral terms. Such complex models are being developed now, yet we will not consider them here. Nevertheless, the analysis within the framework of simple low-parameter models is important because it allows us to describe the process qualitatively, to understand the role of certain factors, and to identify certain phenomena (stochastization, fractality, nonlinearity) that are also interesting for other branches of physics and technology.

This is an interesting problem to investigate contribution of each factor which is out of simple mathematical model. Best approximation for such non-control factors is an approximation by random functions. This randomness is not related to the properties of physical models (their stochasticity). Of course, this variability can not explain features of mechanisms of epidemic dynamics, and the main advantage of given analysis is the determination of possible levels of non-control factors when mathematical models are used for analysis of epidemic spread.",
