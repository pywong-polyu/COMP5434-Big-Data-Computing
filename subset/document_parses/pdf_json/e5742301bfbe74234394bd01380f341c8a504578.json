Although the moodel is relatively simple, the comparison with the data listed in [6] shows that the analytical solution of the model (with the correctly-specified parameters) leads to the results, which are in good agreement with the measured data. Some well-known recommendations naturally follow from the model. It follows from the exact solution (4) that one needs to reduce the coefficient a = a 0 S as much as possibly. It means that the number of contacts S should be minimized. On the other hand, the government should make more efforts (to close shops, restaurants, to restrict transport traffic etc.) in order to increase the function B(u). These efforts should increase with growing of the total number of the COVID-19 cases. The government restrictions can be stopped only under condition that that the number of new COVID-19 cases per day already began to decrease from day to day. It means mathematically that the second order derivative of the function u(t) takes negative values. In order to find the so-called critical number u * , we analyze the function u(t) from (4). Calculating the second order derivative, one obtains",

So, having the measured data in the initial period, we may specify the parameter a. It means that our model can allow to predict the total numbers of the COVID-19 cases if the data for t * and u * are known. Let us consider, an example. It can be noted from the public data [6] that the COVID-19 outbreak in Austria had the maximum number of new daily cases on March 26. So, u * = 6909. If we fix March 8 as the initial point t = 0, then t * = 18 and u 0 = 104 (we think that there are essential errors in measuring at the very beginning of the epidemic process, so that it is unreasonable to start from very small numbers of u 0 ). Now we make approximation of the measured COVID-19 cases using the formula u(t) \u2248 104e at during the first 15 days. It turns out that the parameter a = 0.27 provides very good approximation during the first 12 days (see Fig. 3 ). So, using formula (5) we define b = 0.000020. Now we may predict that the total number the COVID-19 cases in Austria should be u max = a/b \u2248 13500. Taking into account that this number was calculated under some assumptions, the real number can be larger. For exmple, if one takes March 10 as the initial point t = 0 then u max \u2248 13800. We estimate the maximum error in 10 percent. It should be noted that the parameter \u03b3 plays essential role if one uses Eq. (2) instead of Eq. (1). In order to highlight this, we present exact solutions of Eq. (2) with different values of \u03b3 in Fig. 4 (all other parameters are the same as in Fig. 1 ). One may see that \u03b3 = 1 is a good choice in the case of China. On the other hand, taking into account the known data [6], we conclude that \u03b3 < 1 in the case of S. Korea. Obviously, the model cannot be thought as such that is applicable for the COVID-19 outbreak in each country. For example, the outbreak in China was mostly localized in the province Hubei. The size and population of this province are very small comparing with total those of China. A similar situation is in USA, where two states, New-York and New-Jersey are affected by the coronavirus much more than other states (up to date April 5, 2020).",

So, we propose that the space distribution of the infected population should be taken into account in such cases. The simplest generalization of the basic equations of our model are \u2202u \u2202t = d 1 \u2206u + u(a \u2212 bu \u03b3 ), \u2202v \u2202t = d 2 \u2206u + k(t)u, where \u2206 is the Laplace operator, d 1 and d 2 are diffusivities, the functions u(t, x, y) and v(t, x, y) are analogs of u(t) and v(t). Of course, the generalized model based on the system of (6) and relevant boundary conditions (for example, zero flux conditions at the boundary) is much more complicated problem and cannot be solved analytically in contrast to the model (1) and (3). Here we only note that the first equation in (6) with \u03b3 = 1 is the classical Fisher equation [17] , which was extensively studied in many works (see, e.g., the monographs [9, 18] and papers cited therein).",
