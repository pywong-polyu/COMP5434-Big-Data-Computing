Yet multiple factors impact morbidity and mortality. First, reduced access to critical care in LMICs means that people who fall ill are more likely to die. For example, 10 African nations have no ventilators; another 41 share 2000 among hundreds of millions of people (for comparison, the USA has >1 70 000 ventilators for a population of roughly 328 million). 7 Second, lessons learnt from prior pandemics show that caring for infected patients during a pandemic strains healthcare systems in poorer nations in ways that jeopardise people's health and lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, experts predict dramatic increases in morbidity and mortality from unrelated diseases, such as malaria 8 and measles, 9 in sub-Saharan Africa. Already, Uganda's Ministry of Health declared a public health emergency following a polio outbreak and attributed it to diverting essential services, like immunisations, to address COVID-19. 10 An objection to our analysis is that it gives a narrow rendering of 'utility' by focusing only on morbidity and mortality. A broader rendering would consider 'returning to normal' as a utility gain, because it allows opening economies and creating conditions in which citizens can fare well. Does a broader interpretation of 'utility' tip the balance in favour of boosters? Do boosters allow people in wealthy countries to 'return to normal' whereas without them, they would be unable to do so?",

One way to interpret this during a global pandemic would be to say that people everywhere deserve a chance to have access to life-saving vaccines so that they can be minimally healthy, move freely from place to place, affiliate with others and 'have a life'. This implies not only donating vaccines to poorer countries without vaccine access but also taking other steps to build capacity for vaccine manufacturing, storage and distribution. For example, temporarily waiving patent protections for vaccines during a global pandemic emergency is one way to increase supply and jumpstart investment in vaccine manufacturing in poorer nations. Doing so, in tandem with other measures, brings the world closer to the standard of protecting the conditions necessary for justifiable aspirations.",
