Self-care mHealth applications can provide helpful guidelines for COVID-19 prevention or management in case of infection. is study aimed to develop and then assess a self-care smartphone-based application to provide self-care for pregnant women against COVID-19. e present study was conducted in two phases. First, a needs assessment was performed based on the opinions of 30 obstetricians and pregnant women. en, relying on the results, a smartphone-based application was prototyped and assessed in terms of its usability and user satisfaction. To assess the application, 36 pregnant women (11 infected with COVID-19) were asked to use the application for a week. e QUIS questionnaire 5.5 was used for assessment, and the results were analyzed via descriptive statistics in SPSS 23. According to the obstetricians and pregnant women, of the 41 information requirements, 35 data elements were noted to be essential in the needs assessment. Features of the application were placed in four categories of User's Profile, Lifestyle, Disease Management and Control, and Application Functions (e.g., introducing high-risk places in terms of COVID-19 prevalence in each city, introducing specialized COVID-19 medical centers to pregnant women to receive services, medication management, stress management and control, nutrition and diet management, sleep management, contacting physicians, doctor's appointment reminder, searching the available educational materials, and making application adjustments such as text font, size, and color). With an average score of 7.94 (out of 9), pregnant women rated the application at a good level. e application can be used to reduce anxiety and stress about COVID-19 in mothers, provide access to reliable information to answer possible questions, identify high-risk locations, and provide pregnant women with instant access to healthcare facilities and information related to COVID-19 self-care processes.",

Some of their major concerns are preventing and managing the disease and the potential risk of its transmission [2] . Pregnant women have a reduced tolerance to hypoxia due to their weakened immune system and physiological changes, especially in their respiratory system (e.g., lowered position of their diaphragm, increased oxygen consumption, and developed mucosal edema in their respiratory system). erefore, when infectious diseases become epidemic, pregnant women and their fetuses become more vulnerable and highly at risk [3] . COVID-19 increases labor complications such as preterm labor, miscarriage, and fetal distress. Managing the pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 infection is challenging for physicians because there is still no consensus on issues such as optimal treatment, indications for hospitalization, choice of imaging modality, and time and route of delivery [4] . erefore, personal protection against the coronavirus is of greatest concern to pregnant women who need special attention in terms of disease prevention, diagnosis, and management [5] .",

Pregnancy self-care is defined as the observance of care programs and principles to ensure mothers' and fetuses' health during pregnancy, at childbirth, and in the postpartum period [7] . Self-care guidelines can be used as practical ways to reduce the possibility of infection by the coronavirus and decrease the stress caused by it [8] , improve pregnant women's quality of life [9] , reduce the cost of pregnancy-related healthcare, and lower the number of mortalities [10] . By following self-care guidelines, pregnant women can also avoid stress which, itself, can eliminate the possibility of weight loss in their newborns-the most significant cause of improper growth and development of infants and their mortalities [11] . McIntyre [12] believed that self-care activities during pregnancy can ensure mothers' and fetuses' health during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Moradi et al. [13] also investigated self-care strategies for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during the COVID-19 pandemic and showed that following self-care programs can improve both mothers' and fetuses' health, especially among women with GDM.",

In addition to providing quick and easy access to health information, mobile applications have improved communications with healthcare systems [14] . Pregnant women have increasingly relied on social media and mobile-based health applications during their pregnancy and the postpartum period for both self-care and infant care processes and to access informative resources or receive health services. Applications can help these people to manage their health, promote a healthy lifestyle, and access reliable information at any time and place [15] . For example, lowincome pregnant women were able to access personalized content (multimedia educational resources, referrals, health goals, etc.) through prenatal care coordinators (PNCCs) [16] . Tripp et al. [17] investigated pregnancy-related applications and their impact on prenatal care; they showed that pregnancy-related applications can greatly help mothers in self-care while also improving mothers' and fetuses' health. Studies have also emphasized the significance of self-care during pregnancy [18, 19] and/or during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic [5, 13 ]. e benefits of pregnancy self-care [12] , the nature of pregnancy-related applications [17] , the effects of education on improving pregnancy self-care processes [20] , and the evaluation of self-care strategies for women with GDM during COVID-19 [11] have all been examined in studies on pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic; still, it seems that no study has been conducted to develop a COVID-19 self-care application for pregnant women. erefore, this study aimed to develop and evaluate a smartphone-based application for pregnancy self-care to help mothers protect themselves and their fetuses against COVID-19.",

Moreover, the User's Profile and Lifestyle information (excluding the data about patients' age, weight, height, education level, exercise, and national ID number) was approved. e five dimensions of usability scored an average of >6, indicating that users rated the application at a good level. Table 5 compares the results of the present study to related studies. In this study, similar to other studies, educational needs could be provided to pregnant women through different methods such as texts, educational videos, audios, and images regarding all three dimensions of \"Lifestyle,\" \"Disease Management and Control,\" and \"Application Functions.\" Nussbaum et al. [35] stated that mHealth applications have numerous functions and offer various features to help with disease management, such as home-based exercise programs, symptom trackers, medication diaries, educational information, and movement analysis. Dasuki and Zamani [36] also stated that mobile phones can be used to improve mothers' and pregnant women's maternal health literacy instead of merely being used for accessing maternal healthcare. Oyeyemi and Wynn [37] believe that mobile phones provide a platform for pregnant women to stay connected to one another and freely share their Journal of Healthcare Engineering health-related issues with midwives; consequently, this will help promote their self-confidence and self-esteem and raise the possibility of applying maternal practices that have been confirmed and recommended in other studies. In most of the studies listed in Table 6 , providing information related to the pregnancy period for pregnant women has been greatly taken into consideration as the most important educational requirement to help increase pregnant women's health knowledge [16, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] .",

In the literature, different purposes such as followups [16] , daily loggings, information about pregnancy weeks [38] , and sending appointments [42] have been mentioned for reminders. Various studies have shown that the use of reminders can have a positive impact on patient appointment attendances [43] , adherence to using the drugs [44] , antiretroviral therapy [45] , patient self-management [46] , and improving health outcomes and patient care processes [47] . ree randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reviewed antenatal care (ANC) services and concluded that the use of appointment reminders and prenatal training for pregnant women can play a significant role in encouraging mothers to visit their physician or care-provider regularly, improving mothers' knowledge and understanding, and enhancing their health status [48] [49] [50] . Entsieh et al. [51] investigated the significance of sending reminders to pregnant women to remind them of planned antenatal care visits and reported that reminders could increase planned antenatal care visits. e application presented in the present study has other functions such as introducing high-risk places (i.e., with a high prevalence of COVID-19) in each city, introducing specialized COVID-19 medical centers to pregnant women to receive required services, COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis, drug management, stress reduction and control, nutrition and diet management, sleep management, contacting physicians, searching related educational materials, making application adjustments (e.g., font type, size, and color), and providing specialized information about women's self-care practices, provided in the two categories of Lifestyle and Disease Management and Control.",

In the present study, most of the identified problems were mainly related to learning capabilities and the terminology and information used in the application. e limited number of participants in the needs assessment and evaluation and the short duration for evaluation are the limitations of this study. is was, however, due to the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgency to design and evaluate a helpful application. Other studies have also encountered comparable challenges [16, 38] . erefore, it is recommended that the same study be conducted on more specialists and pregnant women, over a longer period, to further reveal the merits and possible flaws of the application, as well as new users' requirements and expectations. Moreover, the designed application's effectiveness in improving pregnant women's self-care behaviors and health status has not been evaluated, which is another limitation that will be investigated in future studies. e application presented here was designed and evaluated based on scientific documents and the opinions of obstetricians and pregnant women. Our application offers different services (e.g., introducing high-risk places in terms of COVID-19 prevalence in each city, introducing specialized COVID-19 medical centers to pregnant women to receive services, medication management, stress management and control, nutrition and diet management, sleep management, contacting physicians, doctor's appointment reminder, searching the available related educational needs, and making application adjustments such as font type, size, and color) for women during prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpregnancy (breastfeeding) periods. In other words, this application helps pregnant women in two ways; first, it is a tool for tracking pregnancy and its changes, and second, it increases the awareness of pregnant women about their health and issues related to pregnancy and beyond during the COVID-19 outbreak. erefore, it can be widely used by pregnant women to alleviate their concerns about COVID-19 and maintain maternal and fetal health.",
