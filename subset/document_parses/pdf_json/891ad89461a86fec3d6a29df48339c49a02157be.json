In addition, all patients who had a telephone consultation with our center between May 7 and July 31, 2020 were invited to fill in a 57-item online questionnaire focusing on epilepsy and comorbidities, any changes in lifestyle or clinical conditions and any emergency-related problems arising during the COVID-19 emergency, and their views on telemedicine. Associations between variables were detected through X 2 test and Fisher's exact test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the effects of different factors on clinical conditions. Results: Twelve studies met the literature search criteria. They showed that the rate of seizure worsening during the emergency ranged from 4 to 35% and was mainly correlated with epilepsy severity, sleep disturbances and COVID-19-related issues. Our questionnaire was filled in by 222 PwE or caregivers. One hundred (76.6%) reported unchanged clinical conditions, 25 (11.3%) an improvement, and 27 (12%) a deterioration. Reported clinical worsening was associated with a psychiatric condition and/or medication (OR = 12.59, p < 0.001), sleep disorders (OR = 8.41, p = 0.001), limited access to healthcare (OR = 4.71, p = 0.016), and experiencing seizures during the emergency (OR = 4.51, p = 0.007).

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, quickly reached pandemic proportions, seriously impacting the health systems of many countries. Italy was the first country in the Western world to be hard hit by the disease. On February 21, 2020, the Italian government issued the first of a series of legislative decrees that introduced increasingly stringent measures, closing down nonessential activities and severely restricting travel. These measures were rapidly extended to the whole of Italy. By March 11, the country's entire population was required to comply with strict home confinement (lockdown) measures.",

The rapid HS re-organization together with the lockdown measures produced a restriction of care provision to all non-urgent conditions, including chronic neurological diseases. It has been reported that seizures in people with epilepsy (PwE) might be triggered by stress (1), including major environmental stressors (2) . Sleep and other lifestyle changes may also influence seizure occurrence. Stress linked to health concerns, restricted healthcare access, and lifestyle changes due to home confinement and remote working might all be factors influencing seizure occurrence and the overall well-being of PwE. We set out to explore the impact of the recent lockdown measures on the health of PwE. A further aim was to explore how PwE felt about telemedicine, as the present, unprecedented situation has given us (and others worldwide) our first experience of application of this modality in epilepsy care. In this paper, after reviewing the literature on the use of questionnaires in the fields of epilepsy and COVID-19, we present the original results of an online survey conducted in Italy.",

Therefore, inpatient admissions for epilepsy diagnosis, monitoring and surgery were suspended. The activity of the outpatient clinic was also reorganized, in compliance with orders from local authorities aimed at limiting interpersonal contact. With the exception of selected urgent cases, first visits were suspended, as were follow-up EEGs, while followup consultations were performed almost exclusively through telephone calls with the treating clinician. From June 3, the full lockdown measures in Italy were partially relaxed. Travel between different regions was possible once again and facilities gradually reopened. Our inpatient clinic reopened on June 1. First visits and face-to-face check-ups for patients with vagal nerve stimulation implants or those in need of a neurological examination (e.g., for alleged side effects) were restored; however, at the time writing, most follow-up appointments are still conducted by telephone, as the authorities recommend use of this modality whenever feasible.",

Variables on therapy and sleep changes, derived from open-ended questions, were coded into categories. A further variable derived from the open-ended questions concerned the presence of sleep disorders. Descriptive statistics were run on all variables, except the uncoded open-ended questions. Subsequently, associations between qualitative variables were investigated through bivariate analyses using a X 2 test, or Fisher's exact test in the case of low expected frequencies. A multiple correspondence analysis was also applied to detect associations between a subset of variables through a multidimensional technique.

In general, the large majority of patients (76.6%) reported unchanged clinical conditions. The remaining patients were equally distributed between improvement and worsening of clinical conditions, where worsening did not necessarily refer to seizures. Indeed, reported worsening was also significantly associated with disability, reported psychiatric condition and/or medication and sleep disorders.

The observation that the system held up well, compared with other reported data (3, 5, 6, 8, 10) , could be attributed at least in part to the fact that, in many Italian regions, ASMs are normally supplied directly by hospitals in large quantities at a time, thereby limiting the risk of shortages for patients.",

It should be mentioned that for the patients in our study, telemedicine took the form of telephone consultations as we were not equipped for videocalls, and this could have influenced their answers. Moreover, as elsewhere, telemedicine did not allow further diagnostic (15, 18, 19) . According to an online survey endorsed by the main national neurophysiological scientific societies, the number of EEGs performed in neurophysiological centers all over Italy dropped by 76% during the 1st weeks of lockdown (18) . The COVID emergency has accelerated the implementation of telemedicine in Italy leading also to the issue of specific national recommendations on its use in the context of neurophysiology, including remote inter-hospital consultations (19) , which could allow EEG recording while limiting people travels to reach a tertiary center, possibly impacting both on telemedicine effectiveness and on patients' satisfaction.",

Third, due to its cross-sectional design, caution is needed when inferring causal relationships.
