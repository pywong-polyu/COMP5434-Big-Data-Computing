They are challenged in fundraising opportunities in their home countries and in finding ways to continue their work in the Global South. As the first study to present a systematic mixed method, cross-country study of smallscale, voluntary development organisations in four different European countries, this study provides insight into the role of these private development initiatives (PDIs) in the COVID-19 crisis and sheds light on the differential impact of the crisis on these organisations. Whereas most PDIs are involved in long(er)-term development interventions, the COVID-19 crisis was for most organisations their first experience of emergency aid. Overall, we see strong resilience among PDIs and also find that the organisations which relied more exclusively on traditional methods of fundraising (offline) received a greater funding hit than organisations-often with more younger members-that had already moved to online fundraising.",

First of all, the charitable cause determines how organisations are being impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, with in the Netherlands health-related organisations facing a significant harder financial drawback and nature and environmental organisations experiencing an overall increase in budget. Also, organizational characteristics turn out to define the impact of the crisis. Both in the Netherlands and in the UK, smaller organisations are, overall, more severely hit by the crisis, and a larger number of them do not expect to survive the crisis (Schulpen et al., 2020; PBE, 2020; SIDCN, 2020) . In the Netherlands, these organisations are also more negative about the ability to continue their regular work in the near future and, compared to larger organisations, a smaller number of them started COVID-19 activities (Schulpen et al., 2020) . In the study at hand, we zoom in on small civil society organisations-with civil society referring to the 'third sector' of society, distinct from government and business and including the family and the private sphere. In particular, we focus on smallscale, voluntary development organisations (henceforth, PDIs) . We study the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on these so-called private development initiatives across four European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and France and study the role they play in the Global South in response to the crisis.",

As noted by Appe and Tech (2019) , these PDIs are 'an expanding subset of international NGOs working in private development aid which are based in the Global North and fund foreign aid projects in the Global South' (p. 2). With exception from academic research in the Netherlands, studies on PDIs do not employ a clear-cut definition of what defines a PDI. In the Netherlands, 'small-scale' is defined as having fewer than 20 regular staff members, or an annual budget of less than 1 million euros, and their voluntary character is of an upper limit of 20% or less of paid staff members (Kinsbergen & Schulpen, 2009, p. 166) . 1 A European mapping in 17 countries concluded that, although differently named and in different numbers, citizen initiatives are common and widespread across Europe (Pollet et al., 2014) . Outside Europe, in the USA and Canada, there is also an increasing number of PDIs, but the current study will focus on PDIs in European countries (Appe & Schnable, 2019; Davis, 2020) .",

We contribute to the current understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on charitable organisations by focusing on this particular group of organisations and by answering the following question: which factors explain why certain organisations are hit harder than others and, following this, how can organisations mitigate the impact of the crisis?

In addition, previous studies were analysed. The interviews and desk study allowed to gain understanding of the field of PDIs in the different countries and the support provided to PDIs during the COVID-19 pandemic by the support organisations. These insights gave as well guidance to the design of the survey (see 'Appendix 1').

In total, 567 surveys were completed, resulting in a response rate of 11.5%.

Table 1 presents the response rate for the different countries.

In this part, we include all of the organisations that participated in the survey (n = 567). Following this, we explore if organisational characteristics, such as age of the organisation, number of members, percentage of paid staff, annual budget, revenue sources and fundraising strategies to be of influence. We start the analysis with multiple bivariate analyses for three dependent variables: impact of the crisis on organisations, experienced concerns and opportunities. Next, we zoomed in on the impact of the crisis on PDIs' budget. Here we only included those PDIs that provided information on the relevant variables, resulting in 428 organisations being included in this part of the analysis. Considering we treated our dependent variable, impact on budget, as a continuous variable and the distribution of the variable, we applied a standard multiple regression analysis.",

For more information on the organisations that participated in this part of the study, see 'Appendix 2'. All interviews were conducted in October 2020, took approximately 1-2.5 h and were held online. The interviews comprised three parts: (1) a general introduction to the organisation, (2) the impact of COVID-19 on the organisation, (3) the response of the organisation to the crisis. The data obtained by these interviews were analysed by using an open coding strategy. To prevent further complications to the participation of PDIs in this part of the study, we decided to conduct interviews with only Dutch/Flemish-speaking PDI members (the mother tongue of the researchers), limiting this part of the study to PDIs in Belgium and the Netherlands. The organisations were selected from the survey respondents. When sampling the organisations, we aimed for a group of PDIs reflecting the variety both in terms of organisation characteristics, type of interventions and response to and impact of the crisis (see 'Appendix 2' for more elaborate information on the sample).",

With an average number of 35 members and an annual budget of around EUR 147,000, Danish PDIs are by far the largest in terms of budget and number of core members compared to those in the other countries. With Belgium and France Danish PDIs are also more professionalised, indicated by their relatively high share of paid staff members (9.4%). Although PDIs in all countries share a voluntary character, this feature is most prominent among Belgian PDIs, with nearly 97% of the organisations being completely run by volunteers. Dutch and French PDIs can be placed in the middle, with on average 92.4% and 92.9% volunteers, respectively. We did not study the characteristics of PDI members in this current study, but previous studies have shown that whereas PDI members in Belgium, the Netherlands and France are on average of middle age, Danish PDIs tend to be more diverse in terms of age, with more younger people being involved as well (Kinsbergen et al., 2020a (Kinsbergen et al., , 2020b (Kinsbergen et al., , 2020c (Kinsbergen et al., , 2020d .",

For Dutch PDIs, NGOs are the second largest donors. Furthermore, both in Denmark and in the Netherlands, private foundations contribute to a considerable degree to the work of PDIs.

PDIs are considered an expression of public support for development cooperation, and at the same time, 'in many cases, governmental policies consider citizen initiatives as vehicles of public support for international development' (Pollet, 2017, p. 189) . It is expected that, because PDIs are strongly embedded with local communities in the Global North, they are able to reach out those parts of society that are not (yet) convinced of the importance of international development cooperation. As a result, most subsidy schemes request that PDIs organise public gatherings and raise attention about their work in local media in return for the project funding they received (Pollet, 2017, p. 189 ).",

Considering that these two latter countries strongly rely on physical fundraising events, this might explain the stronger negative impact of the crisis on the budget of PDIs in these countries.

Because we approached PDIs via support organisations, it could be that younger and smaller organisations are underrepresented in the study because they might not (yet) cooperate with such organisations. This might also account for diaspora organisations, which risk being underrepresented in the network of PDI support organisations. For Belgium and the Netherlands, we could compare the composition of our sample with those of earlier PDI studies conducted among a broader population of PDIs, and we did not find significant differences between our sample and those of these previous studies in terms of core characteristics of PDIs, such as average annual budget or number of members.",

Because no systematic comparison between those PDIs run by representatives of diaspora communities and those that are not, it is hard to see if and how this might have distorted the findings of our study. Because we included the largest support organisations in each country, we believe that we managed to reach out to a large number of representative PDIs in each country.",

With the personal encounter being at the heart of PDIs' work, prolonged travel restrictions might prevent PDIs and their local counterparts from meeting in person. These personal encounters are known to have a motivating role for PDI members and a catalysing role for (mobilising) their (private) donors. Continued travel restriction might thus have a severe impact on the functioning of PDIs, also because it might affect the often close personal relationships, often referred to as friendships by those involved, between staff members of the PDI and its local partner. These friendships have been shown to impact the development of partners in the Global South (Kumi & Copestake, 2021) . Additionally, in case the impact of the crisis continues to affect societies in the Global North, this might challenge the abilities of PDIs to raise funds from regular (private) donors to reach out to new (private) donors. In addition, a longer-lasting COVID-19 crisis might impact the visibility of PDIs in their own communities, not only affecting their fundraising activities and the development interventions they support, but also the role they play in contributing to global citizenship in their home countries.",

A longitudinal study on the development interventions of PDIs has shown that in the partnership between PDIs and their local partners overall little progress has taken place in terms of increased local ownership (Kinsbergen et al., 2020b) . The results of our study show that during the COVID-19 crisis, local partners seized the opportunity to step up the game. Our study also shows that, for those PDIs and their local counterparts working on an exit strategy, the COVID-19 crisis may result in drawback in this process. With fewer opportunities for local fundraising, PDIs mentioned how they, after a process of reducing their financial and non-financial support, have to step forward again for their local counterpart to continue providing support. Knowing that many local partners are often heavily dependent on PDIs and that most PDIs do not have an explicit exit strategy or only started working on it at a very late stage (Kinsbergen et al., 2020a (Kinsbergen et al., , 2020b (Kinsbergen et al., , 2020c (Kinsbergen et al., , 2020d , has meant that local counterparts are often ill prepared for an actual aid withdrawal. In times when the call for shifting power sounds louder than ever, it is time for PDIs, their local counterparts and support organisations to work on increased independence for the local counterparts, with the importance of the personal connectedness being a critical challenge in achieving this.",
