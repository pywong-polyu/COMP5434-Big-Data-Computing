This study aimed to assess the perceived and unperceived continuing professional development needs of psychiatrists practicing in Quebec, Canada. Methods The authors sent an online cross-sectional survey (2018) to members of the 'Association des m\u00e9decins psychiatres du Qu\u00e9bec' and collected data on unperceived needs via the critical incident method (focused on managing challenging clinical cases/situations). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, thematic analysis, and triangulation of data. Two coders independently analyzed qualitative data. Results Of 1150 eligible psychiatrists, 187 (16%) completed the survey. Over half were female (58%), caring for adult patients (60%), and practiced in a university hospital (49%). Top perceived and unperceived learning need areas were neurodevelopmental disorders and psychopharmacology. Three hundred forty-three factors influencing the management of reported challenges were classified as case complexity (53%), patient (22%), environment (19%), and lack of knowledge (4%). Consultation with colleagues (49%) was the most frequently accessed resource for approaching challenging cases. During the previous year and across both self-directed and group learning activities, respondents reported engaging more frequently in in-person than online activities. Conclusions A comprehensive needs assessment integrating perceived and unperceived needs is the cornerstone for planning relevant continuing professional development. The critical incident method is a useful tool to assess psychiatrists' unperceived needs. Critical reflection after solving complex clinical cases might provide an opportunity to optimize psychiatrists' selection of relevant continuing professional development.",

This entails systematic information gathering to determine instructional solutions to close the gap between actual and optimal knowledge, skills, and attitudes (i.e., a learning need). A variety of methods are available to help physicians identify their learning needs [4, [7] [8] [9] . Perceived needs can be defined as I know what I want and need to know whereas unperceived would be defined as I do not know that I do not know [6] . Traditional needs assessments are often flawed by healthcare professionals' limited ability to self-assess their professional educational needs [10] and poor response rate. In order to address these limitations, both perceived and unperceived needs [11] of target audiences should be investigated using approaches such as the critical incident method (CIM) [12] .",

Across both self-directed and group learning activities, respondents engaged in more in-person activities (834/1475 or 56.5%, 829/1055 or 78.6% respectively) than online activities (507/1475 or 34.4%, 167/1055 or 15.8% respectively). The preferred format for group activities was in person (rather than online). As was the case for solo activities, the most popular types of activities were in-person conferences (157/1055 or 14.9%), hospital rounds (141/1055 or 13.4%), journal clubs (111/1055 or 10.5%), small group activities (101/1055 or 9.6%), and workshops (94/1055 or 8.9%). The most reported online self-directed learning activities included internet searches such as Medscape, UpToDate, and Dynamed (140/1475 or 9.5%); webinars (118/1475 or 8.0%); and reading peer-reviewed journals (78/1475 or 5.3%). The most common in-person reported self-directed activities were hospital rounds (136/1475 or 9.2%), conferences (133/1475 or 9.0%), and journal clubs (100/1475 or 6.8%). Regarding assessment, participants reported a preference for face-to-face multisource feedback (48/273 or 17.6%), followed by online accredited self-assessment programs (47/273 or 17.2%), and chart audit/feedback (43/273 or 15.7%). A blended format (i.e., online and face to face) across all types of activities was the least popular.",

The survey response rate was lower than that of similar studies in the literature; in general, studies of physicians tend to have low response rates [36] . Rationale for not completing the survey among nonrespondents was not investigated due to limited resources. The current study received support from the provincial psychiatry association from which participants were recruited. Thus, social desirability could have influenced our findings, reducing generalizability and introducing potential bias. Two strategies were implemented for mitigation: participant anonymity and assurances of confidentiality. The cross-sectional nature of our findings, as well as the use of self-reported measures which should be triangulated with objective measures, represent additional limitations.",
