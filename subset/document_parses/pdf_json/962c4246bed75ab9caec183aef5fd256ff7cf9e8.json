Additionally, RUDN University provides an opportunity for students to continue learning the target language at foreign partner universities, where students can practice the language in its natural environment. In this regard, the serious research interest for us is which of our students' language competencies will transform after graduation from these universities and how their motivation changes towards learning Spanish.",

By the 1990s, it had become the most commonly used method of teaching foreign languages in the world, having almost completely overshadowed alternative target language teaching methods (Philipson, 2020) . This approach has had a significant impact on Spanish-language teaching policy, forming the basis for the Spanish government's officially recommended textbooks for teaching the language to foreigners. For this reason, by 2019, the official teaching manuals of the Instituto Cervantes (the official body of the Spanish Government in charge of organizing the teaching of the Spanish language for foreigners and promoting the cultural heritage of Spain and Latin America) were based entirely on the communicative methodology (Sotomayor et al., 2019) .",

These universities focus on more traditional methods of teaching by using native languages (Hall and Cook, 2012; Shenderuk et al., 2018) . In particular, they employ the conscious-practical method (better known in the West as the grammar-translation method). This tendency to utilize more traditional approaches to teaching foreign languages is because the communicative method, despite all of its obvious advantages, namely, solving the problems of overcoming language barriers and developing the language skills of speaking in the target language, has significant drawbacks that do not allow it to be used as the only possible approach in educating practices (Turnbull and Dailey-O'Cain, 2009) . Specifically, the communicative approach does not pay sufficient attention to building students' skills in understanding grammatical structures or forming ideas about the structure of language, and it does not adequately use the capabilities of the native language to teach students (Khokhar et al., 2020; Swain and Lapkin, 2000) . In this regard, universities in Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union are trying to abate the shortcomings of the approach by complementing teaching activities with their own developments (Sergeeva et al., 2019; Aubakirov and Dolgopolova, 2018; Lyubova et al., 2014) .",

However, along with the advantages outlined above, this approach also has significant disadvantages. In particular, teaching within the framework of this approach does not allow students to gain a full understanding of how the grammar of the language and its syntax function (Fois, 2020) . This is because the method mainly uses the practice of memorization of standard phrases and communicative expressions that can be understood by native speakers (Smirnova and Bagramova, 2018) . However, we consider the main disadvantage of this method to be the universalistic nature of the approach itself, rather than the disadvantages listed above. This nature is manifested when a foreign language is taught according to the same models for all countries, according to the same textbooks, which form the standard language communication skills among students. Consequently, the communicative approach not only excludes adjusting to the local features of learning a foreign language but also does not use a student's native language as an aid to the acquisition of a target language (Adil, 2020) .",

As a result, they cannot use the knowledge gained in the classroom in practice (Leyi, 2020) . As a consequence, we believe that using a teaching method based on \"repeating patterns/models\" is not very effective when teaching a foreign language to students who are learning it outside its natural environment and who later are going to use it in their professional activities. We believe that for this category of students, the communicative method (assuming the memorization of standard expressions that are aimed primarily at establishing oral communication) does not allow them to form an understanding of the principles of language functioning, which future specialists could use to competently formulate their thoughts.",

Thus, relying on the learned grammatical constructions, students master the rules of functioning of language structures at both the phonetic and lexical levels (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-V azquez, Crism an-P erez, 2021). This provides students with the tools to communicate easily, correctly, and creatively, which is never just a matter of reproducing learned patterns. The substantial advantage of the grammar-translation method for students who will later employ it in their professional activities is that it helps them develop two-way translation skills. These skills are not only useful for their future professional life but also valuable in today's globalized world, which, because of the development of global communication technologies and instant systems of exchange of text information (messengers and e-mail), largely encourage competent written communication among people (Merchant, 2021) .",

In many cases, the choice of specialisation by future students depends not so much on their own desire or motivation to study, but rather on the will of their parents, who pay for their studies at the university and want their children to take up a specific occupation in the future. According to our surveys held among foreign languages students, their motivation to study may be rather weak since, as students have pointed out themselves, their parents were the ones who chose this specialisation for them (there is about 32% of all cases from our university) (see Appendix). This situation gradually improves over time thanks to the efforts of our academic staff, who try to involve the students in a variety of learning activities. However, when students are offered an opportunity to take part in a foreign internship, they find themselves in a difficult situation again. It is highly likely that the cost of internship will be covered by their parents since most students cannot afford to pay for their studies abroad because of the difficult economic situation in Russia. In this case, participation in internship programmes has virtually nothing to do with a student's personal motivation, it depends on the external conditions that lie beyond their control.",

Quantitative tools enabled us to consider the mistakes made by students in numerical terms. Comparative data analysis was used for identifying the general trends and variations in the knowledge of grammar topics across the two groups of students who did or did not take part in the international internships. This method enabled us to find and rank the most challenging aspects of Spanish grammar for Russian-speaking students, as shown in Figure 1 . After that, we checked the assimilation of verb constructions and their use by students and uncovered the changes in the formation of the participants' grammar competencies.",

Before using this system, we prepared two text corpora based on the essays of students who did and did not take part in internships, respectively. 1 To this end, we removed all function words from the texts, i.e., all words that do not have an independent semantic meaning which cannot be derived from other words, namely, prepositions, articles, conjunctions, and auxiliary verbs. All other parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, participles, and adverbs were not removed to avoid possible distortions in research findings. This enabled us to locate the most used words across all corpora. Thanks to a visual representation of these words in the Voyant Tools, we were able to analyse the perceptions of Spanish history and culture by the students who wrote the essays.",

However, conditional clauses (line 13 in Figure 1 ) for describing possible or desired actions did not cause problems for students who completed the internships, unlike those who studied Spanish only in Russia. Thus, we can conclude that such a difference is explained by the fact that students who were on the internships better mastered those grammatical structures that are most often used in colloquial speech.
