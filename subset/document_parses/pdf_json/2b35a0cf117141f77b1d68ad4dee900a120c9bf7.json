The team uses machine learning and natural language processing to identify risk of death, and they have previously demonstrated the ability to accurately predict mortality in patients with dementia. 13 While tools that use mortality prediction as a proxy indicator for serious illness are common, the approach remains imperfect, because the tools do not assess other critical human elements of serious illnesssuch as illness' impact on personal and family life 14that can predict the need for patient-clinician conversations about goals and values.",

While iCMP nurse care coordinators knew their patient panels well and could engage in an in-depth conversation regarding goals and preferences, this was less feasible for other members of the care team making calls to primary care patients with whom they were speaking for the first time.

Furthermore, while we used Algorithm 2 to prioritize patients by their probability of death, this is not the ideal way to identify and prioritize patients for the type of intervention we have described. 14 We instead need tools that can help us target those who are most in need of a patient-clinician conversation about goals and values in advancing serious illness; while this may include those with conditions that carry a high risk of mortality, it will also identify those who may have impairments in quality of life, functional status, or caregiver support. We continue to work with our informatics team to broaden the scope of the predictive analytics tools and are also testing the algorithms to see if they are acceptable to clinicians and able to change behavior rather than simply measuring the accuracy of mortality prediction.",
