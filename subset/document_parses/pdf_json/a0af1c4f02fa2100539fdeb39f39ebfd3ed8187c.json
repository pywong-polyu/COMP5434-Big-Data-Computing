It also argues that though centralisation of power has been justified by political elites as an exception to the liberal constitutional paradigm and not as an abandoning of the same, that centralisation has become a normal and essential feature of constitutional praxis in plurinational states aimed at protecting the dominant community's status in the state. This is in its totality shows a process whereby the constitution and laws beholden to the dominant community are instumentalised in the normalisation of what would be otherwise considered to be abnormal.",

The question has become particularly animated in the post 9/11 context with constitutionalists dealing with how a prolonged war against 'terrorism' can fit within the normal order of liberal constitutionalism. This paper however focuses on a different kind of setting in which there have been temporally long states of exception-plurinational states in conflict. By plurinational states in conflict I mean those states wherein politics is deeply divided on the basis of identity and where conflicts as to the means of conceiving and sharing state power has led to armed conflicts. The first section of this paper lays down the theoretical framework of the chapter. I draw from both Carl Schmitt and Giorgio Agamben in this chapter and with modifications to both suggest a normative means of interpreting states of exceptions in plurinational contexts. The second and third sections deal with two case studies-Sri Lanka, in quite some detail and India as a short note.",

            "text": "Carl Schmitt's proximity to the German Nazi party and the decisionism that riddles his legal philosophy should not blind us to his work on the state of exception and his resulting take on sovereignty. 1 His argument that is of relevance for my discussion here is his argument that the true sovereign manifests himself in a state of exception. 2 Schmitt through his theorsation of the sovereignty in connection with the exception was mounting a challenge to liberal constitutionalism arguing for the primacy for the political over the legal. His argument was that the authority identifying the exception decides on its own discretion its temporal scope and substantive content and precisely of this character of being unconstrained it is the true sovereign. His disagreement with liberal constitutionalism then was that this domain of the exception was not subject to the law. For Schmitt argued that in invoking the exception the law recedes allowing the sovereign to emerge and to conduct the affairs of the state. But Schmitt does not disregard the relevance of the law altogether. His argument was chiefly that the exception was not governed by the law but that the law could return to its normal function when the sovereign had decided that the state of exception was over. But why is a state of exception called for? According to Schmitt a political community is defined on the basis of a friend-enemy distinction. The state of exception is promulgated by the sovereign to enforce this distinction and to constrict the enemy through violence, suppression, elimination or expulsion. 3 This distinction Schmitt claims is political and not social and hence identity based considerations such as ethnicity and religion, while may contribute to the drawing of this political distinction are not the only means of distinguishing the friend and the enemy. The crucial question is as to whether the people consider a particular identity marker as important enough as defining their political existence. It is defined in contradistinction to others who do not share that identity and according to Schmitt has to be defended by going to war against the other. Schmitt while repeatedly insisting on the political nature of this distinction does concede that his friend-enemy distinction has to be a sense of shared identity that stands above legal form and that this shared identity has to be strong enough to wage war against the other.",

Those who do not share this monist view of political community are enemies of the state who have to be eliminated or sufficiently suppressed so that they don't pose a threat to the state. 4 The role of the sovereign then in the state of exception is to reinforce the dominant community's understanding of what is normal or exceptional and as to who belongs and who doesn't. It is by establishing such a monistic community Schmitt argues, that the proper applicability of law during normal times is rendered possible. Schmitt however is careful to clarify that his intention is not to glorify warfare but that if the community is interested in its political existence, that war may be inevitable in order to sustain itself. 5 This conclusion about the rationale for the exception as being aimed to define the normal is very important. The exception defines the human existence that is politically relevant and that which is not. Hence it is the exception that defines the normal. In the normal, existence is not possible unless one accepts the distinction drawn by the exception. If you are the 'enemy' you accept the dominance of the 'friend' and if not there is no prospect for a normal for a member of the enemy community.",

The standard explanation in constitutional law is that a state of necessity governs the temporal life of an exception. However as Agamben points out this necessity cannot be objectively defined in a legal sense. There are no such objectively identifiable finite set of situations that constitute a necessity. Hence Agamben argues states of exceptions exist in a 'zone of indifference'. The inability of law to police necessity hence according to Agamben provides the environment in which the exception becomes the rule.",

The debate on balancing liberty and security then tries to hide the real force of political power and helps perpetuate the illusion that nothing has changed. We become in other words accustomed to understanding that exceptions are in fact exceptions while in fact they have become the normal. Hence politically there is also a need for us who do not wish to drown ourselves in the normalising of the exception to remind ourselves that we should not accept the exception as the normal. The objectives of the exception succeed when its recipients accept the exception as the normal. And the prescriptive part of Agamben's work is dedicated to how one may then break this internalisation of exception. This is the part where he engages with the work of Walter Benjamin. 7 I will not say anything about this for the lack of strict relevance to my intentions in this paper.",

Obviously Agamben disagrees with Schmitt in his normative endorsement of the definition of politics on a friend-enemy distinction. But the disagreement is also not merely normative but also descriptive. Agamben's work invites us to go beyond the enemydistinction and makes use of Foucauldian notions of bio-power to make the point that the state of exception in its normalised version has reduced all life into bare existence. For Agamben then the sovereign does not need the binary of friend and enemy. The situation presented is far more complex and the idea of power is far more nuanced that the sovereign need not appeal to the friend-enemy distinction to subject us to the bare life of existence that we find ourselves in.",

While statist nationalism seeks to find new ways to assert itself in the era of globalization stateless/state-seeking nationalisms across the world be it Scotland (UK), Quebec (Canada), Catalonia (Spain), Kurdsithan (Iraq/Turkey/Syria), Kashmir (India) or Tamil Eelam (Sri Lanka) also continues to thrive. The nationalism of these stateless nations is largely in response to the fact that the state has identified itself largely with a singular nation or demos denying in essence the multinational/plurinational character of the state. The confounding of the state with the nation surprisingly to date remains a popular idea in the study of political science, international relations and in international law. John Sturart Mill's well-known claim that 'free institutions are next to impossible in a country made up of different nationalities' dominates scholarly work on democratic theory to this day. Habermas for example asserts that while not all nation-states have not been democracies that all democracies have been indeed nation-states. His theory of constitutional patriotism which draws from civic nationalism in fact seeks to reproduce the false dichotomy between civic and ethnic nationalism. 8 There is indeed a bias on favour statist nationalism willing to endorse it as civic nationalism while branding non-state nationalism as 'ethnic' and 'primordial'. This also finds itself reflected in the theory and practice of liberal constitutionalism that seeks to gloss over.",

            "text": "The ideology of the nation-state is most of the time accompanied by rigorous nation-building exercises, which seek to coerce the non-believers into assimilating with the larger nations and their culture. These assimilatory tendencies are not only a feature of illiberal states but also of liberal states. Liberal nationalists have for some time questioned the falsehood of liberal states being culturally neutral. As Requejo argues liberal democracies have always acted as 'nationalising agencies for specific cultural particularisms'. 9 The nature of the nation-state is such that it wittingly or unwittingly converts the public sphere in favour of the dominant nation within the state. It assumes that there is only one people (demos) within the state who share the characteristics of this dominant nation. This is what the plurinationalist theorists call the 'monist thesis of the state'. Public law and the power structure of the state is arranged without affecting the notion of 'democratic legitimacy' in a way that benefits the dominant nation. Herein the stateless nation feels alienated. In worse forms not alien to even Western liberal states, the state actively pursues a policy of assimilation of the 'others' so as to forcibly create this monist nation-state. This provides the breeding ground for stateless nationalism to grow which is more often than not accompanied by violence and in a number of cases civil war. Hence the claim to self-determination by these stateless nations is a direct challenge to the notion of a nation-state. As Stephen Tierney neatly puts it, central to the challenge presented by sub-state national societies to the host state is a call for the disaggregation of the terms 'state' and 'nation; those who adhere to the traditional conceptualisation of the 'nation-state' as one politico-constitutional territory encapsulating a unitary national society are charged with the task of reconceiving the plurinational state in appreciation of its essential societal plurality. 10 In the plurinational context the fault lines of the friend-enemy distinction that Schmitt alludes to as the purpose of a declaration of the state of exception is very clear. The sub-state entity seeking to question the very foundations on which the state nationalism has been built is the 'enemy' that needs to be eliminated or suppressed. In plurinational contexts then the state of exception is invoked more of then that not to resolve this friend-enemy distinction. The purpose of the state of exception is defeating the sub-state's claim to sovereignty, claim to state power and the project of radical re-envisioning of the state. Schmitt it will be recalled, identifies quite explicitly the resolution of the friend-enemy problem as the purpose of the sovereign invoking the state of exception. Self-determination conflicts provide for an exemplary illustration for the uses of which Schmitt's conception of the state of exception can be put to use. In many a context the tensions over the construction of monist societies has led to armed war, wherein the violence of the state in its project to construct a monist society and to reify the friend's victory over the enemy has resulted in violence and counter-violence. Hence as Schmitt has argued a resort to war in these circumstances, was an attempt to resolve problems associated with this friend-enemy distinction.",

The war to be clear is indeed an important instrument in the attempt to advance the interests of a monist political community. But war is not the only instrument. The state of exception as was seen earlier is only an instrument to define the normal. The normal seeks to perpetuate that which was defined by the exception and hence the normal has characteristics in it which help perpetuate the distinctions and dominations thus established by the sovereign. Outright war is used sparingly and states have learnt to use more sophisticated means of entrenching the friend-enemy distinction. The slow creeping exception into the normal is also seen in the legal domain where ordinary law has features of the exception. Hence the exception has become all pervasive as Agamben has shown us.",

Schmitt's analysis of the true sovereign as being identified by the one who invokes the exception in the plurinational context reinforces the identity of the sovereign as not explained by popular sovereignty but by majoritarianism. Hence in plurinational democracies which are in effect reduced to an ethnocracies, the true sovereign is identified with the dominant community. Accordingly centralisation of powers and a unitary vision of state are strictly adhered to as the best way of protecting the unity of the state and this understanding pervades into the normal. Any alternative envisioning of the state for example on federal or confederal lines are seen as an attack on the unity of the state. Constitutional law has largely focused on the emergency powers when thinking about states of exception but in plurinational democracies governmental institutions for normal times are designed based on the rationale of the exception. Hence in plurinational democracies centralisation of powers in a particular institution (which Schmitt would conclude as the true sovereign) is not merely a characteristic of the exception but also of the normal.",

The main complaint against judicial review then was the susceptibility of it being used as an instrument by the minorities to thwart the programme of homogenisation. Basic tenants of liberal constitutionalism were considered luxurious and expensive to this political agenda and as weakening agents in the construction of a strong state. These liberal constitutional principles were not sought to be displaced as a matter of exceptiontionality but rather as the normalised way in which the constitutional order was to be envisaged. The 1972 constitution's disbanding of Section 29 hence is an excellent example of the possibility of taking forward an agenda of the exception of through the normal process of constituting a constitutional order.",

Not only did the scheme of devolution fail but a later amendment that sought to take away the unilateral appointment powers that the Executive Presidency had over public institutions 20 also failed in the face of a political praxis that allowed the Executive President to whole sale ignore an entire chapter of the constitution. The 17 th amendment was formally done away with through the 18 th amendment after the end of the war in 2009. The end of the war reversed as I have elsewhere argued, 21 the liberal consensus within the political elite to do away with the Executive Presidency, and ended up strengthening the Executive Presidency by doing away with the 17th amendment and abolishing term limits on the executive Presidency. It was argued that it was the Executive Presidency as an institution that allowed the war to be concluded and that the continuation of the Executive Presidency was necessary for continuing stability and prosperity. Centralisation of power hence in the Sri Lankan context has rebelled against the basic tenants of liberal constitutionalism such as separation of powers and asserted itself as a necessity for the continuity of the state. The rationale for centralisation of power in Sri Lanka has been mounted on the grounds of necessity but also for continuity of the State. The argument is both that it is needed for exceptional reasons but also as an organising principle of the constitutional order if Sri Lanka is to survive and prosper as a singular political community.",

The idea of the amendment was mooted by President JR.

The sixth amendment and the law banning the LTTE, was also used to ban the Tamil Rehabilitation Organisation, a humanitarian organization for alleged links with the LTTE in 2007 just before the onslaught of the last phase of the war.

The Prevention of Terrorism Act was or objects the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka. The Supreme Court on application can declare such political party or other association or organisation to be proscribed. Any person who holds office in the organization can be prosecuted and if convicted be subjected to the consequences referred to above. 23 Sieghart, Paul: Sri Lanka-A Mounting Tragedy of Errors -Report of a Mission to Sri Lanka in January 1984 on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists and its British Section, Justice, (March 1984). enacted in 1979 as a temporary measure, as an aspect of the then government's military strategy in dealing with the early stages of the Tamil militant movement and more broadly as a political strategy to contain and narrow down the political space for the Tamil self-determination movement. The sun set clause-Section 29 of the original enactment expressly provided that it would be in force only for a period of three years, but this was repealed by the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Act No. 10 of 1982, making the PTA a permanent measure, although incongruously, the short title of the Act continues to contain the words 'temporary provisions.' The Act as a whole has many problematic features. For example Section 6 (1) provides for arrest without warrant, Section 7(1) provides for detention of a person arrested initially for 72 h before producing before a magistrate, Section 9(1) provides for detention for a period of three months extendable to eighteen months and Section 16 provides for confession given to a police officer not below the rank of an Assistant Superintendent of Police as admissible evidence. Of particular concern is Section 2(1) (h) of the PTA provides that any person who by words either spoken or intended to be read or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise causes or intends to cause commission of acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony or feelings of ill-will or hostility between different communities or racial or religious groups has committed an offence which per Section 2(2) is liable to be punished for a minimum of seven years and a maximum of seven years. In Nallaratnam Singarasa v Sri Lanka 24 the Human Rights Committee noted that Section 16 was in violation of articles 14, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, (c), and 14, paragraph (g) of the Covenant. In Nallaratnam Singarasa v Attorney General 25 the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka refused to reconsider its decision based on the observations of the HRC and further found that Sri Lanka's accession to Optional Protocol 1 was contra the Constitution of Sri Lanka.",

            "text": "The Prevention of Terrorism Act similar to the sixth amendment is used to curtail and criminalise Tamil politics. The most high profile example of such usage was the one against J.S. Tissanayagam, a Tamil journalist and editor, who was arrested in 2008 and convicted under Section 2(1) (h) for writing and publishing articles critical of the Sri Lankan military's conduct of the war in violations of principles of humanitarian law. The article in question argued that the state was depriving the Tamils in the East of access to food and water as part of the Sri Lankan Army's strategy to take over lands which were hitherto under the control of the LTTE. The state prosecutor's principal argument in court was that the criticism of the Sinhala-only Army would create communal disharmony between the Tamils and the Sinhala community. Tissanayagam was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and subsequently released on a Presidential pardon following international pressure and condemnation. Another post-war example of the use of the PTA to regulate the Tamil public sphere is from November 2012, wherein four students attached to the University of Jaffna were arrested 26 and sent for 'rehabilitation' for more than four months, under the newly enacted regulations promulgated under the PTA for holding events at the university in remembrance of the dead in the war. The students were treated as \"surrendees\" a new category of disciplining introduced under the PTA. Clause 3. (2) of PTA Regulations no. 5 of 2011 provides that \"Any person who surrenders (hereinafter referred to as the \"surrendee\") in connection with any offence under the Explosives Act, the Offensive Weapons Act, No. 18 of 1966, the Firearms Ordinance, the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 or under Chaps. 6, 7 or Chap. 8 of the Penal Code or under any emergency regulation which was in force prior to August 30, 2011, or through fear of terrorist activities, to any police officer, or any member of the armed forces, or to any public officer or any other person or body of persons authorized by the President by Order, shall be required to give a written statement to the officer or person authorized to the effect that he is surrendering voluntarily\". The regulations provide that a person who has thus 'voluntarily surrendered' to be assigned for rehabilitation by the Defence Secretary acting through the Commissioner General for Rehabilitation. A person who voluntarily surrenders can be held for an initial period of 12 months and a maximum period of two years at the Defence Secretary's discretion. Given that the security establishment claims that the students are being 'rehabilitated', it was assumed that the students are being held for rehabilitation under these regulations. This case brought into light the enormous powers under these regulations. An arrest could be converted into a surrender and the surrendee could be assigned for rehabilitation on the discretion of the Defence Secretary which could not be subjected to judicial scrutiny. The most bizarre aspect of this regulation is that the surrender need not have anything to do with an offence. An arrest could be converted into a surrender by the police applying pressure on the person arrested that if he did not consent that he could be detained for a period of 18 months under the usual provisions of the PTA. The arrested students were reluctant to take legal action fearing that their potential release after rehabilitation could be affected by way of a formal arrest under the PTA. The students were eventually released after four months in captivity. University sources argued that the arrests were intended to send a larger message to the influential students union to constrict their political activities. The design of these security regulations in the post-war context was tailored to serve as an instrument in the overall design of preventing any possible political re-appearance of the Tamil self-determination project after the defeat of its armed phase in 2009.",

The Indian Constitution while federal in normal times has been described as a perfect unitary state during times of emergency. 28 The more complicated truth is that for parts of India which agreed with the dominant narrative of what constituted India, the normal federal experience has been continuously available while those parts that fundamentally question the nature of the Indian state the prolonged state of crisis has meant that the Indian constitutional experience has been one of a unitary state. This is true for most of the North-Eastern states and Kashmir. 29 The primary instrument of control over the North-East has been the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act first enacted for the North-East in 1958 and in operation in Kashmir since 1990. It is not a coincidence that two regions in which the Indian state has struggled to meet demands for autonomy and self-determination are the two regions in which the law is applicable. The AFSPA for the North-Eastern states was enacted soon after the Nagas organised an informal plebiscite in favour of a separate state. The Act was also used in Punjab in the mid-1980s to contain the Khalistan movement and remained in place until 1997 when for all intents and purposes Punjab had stopped being a threat to the idea of the Indian State. As Atul Kohli frames the Punjab experience: \u2026[O]ver time, militants were repressed out of existence, and a tired population was relieved to accept some concessions from a more accommodating national leadership and to vote an elected provincial government back to power 30 AFSPA provides wide ranging powers to the Indian Army. Once declared a \"disturbed area\" by either the state Government or the central government certain special powers, including the right to shoot to kill, to raid houses, and destroy any property that is likely to be used by insurgents, to arrest without warrant even on \"reasonable suspicion\" a person who has committed or even \"about to commit a cognizable offence\" are available to the Indian Armed Forces under the AFSPA. No less than an Indian Government Committee opined that the law was \"a symbol of oppression, an object of hate and an instrument of discrimination and high-handedness.\" 31 The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, visited India in March 2012 and concluded that 'the widespread deployment of the military creates an environment in which the exception becomes the rule, and the use of lethal force is seen as the primary response to conflict. 32 \" The other important tool that the Indian Government has used is the British colonial given law of sedition 33 that has been used to police speech over self-determination for Kashmir. 34 The Indian experience thus understood confirms the Sri Lankan narrative, that of the state of exception being normalised to shape the kind of political community that will be dominant within the state structure.",

It has also argued that though centralisation of power has been justified by political elites as an exception to the liberal constitutional paradigm and not as an abandoning of the same, that centralisation has become a normal and essential feature of constitutional praxis in plurinational states aimed at protecting the dominant community's status in the state. This is in its totality shows a process whereby the constitution and laws beholden to the dominant community are instumentalised in the normalisation of what should be otherwise considered to be abnormal. This needs further substantiation but through the Sri Lankan and more briefly the Indian case studies I have tried to illustrate these conclusions.",

This paper is not devoted to answering this question but I think an important starting point to answering these questions is to start questioning the assumptions that liberal constitutionalism to its answers. For far too long the simple mantra of rule of law and good governance has been suggested as the panacea for dealing with questions that go to the heart of the character of the state, its political-social composition and states of emergencies. The answer to the illiberal national security regimes is not to understand them as exceptions but as normalised states of being that are reflective of a far deeper fracturing of the societies that make up the state. A truthful diagnosis of the problem will most often than not, help us resolve the problem.",
