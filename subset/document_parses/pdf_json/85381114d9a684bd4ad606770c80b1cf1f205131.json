During these uncertain times, public health decision makers, from city health departments to federal agencies, sought the use of epidemiological models for decision support in allocating resources, developing non-pharmaceutical interventions, and characterizing the dynamics of COVID-19 in their jurisdictions. In response, we developed a flexible scenario modeling pipeline that could quickly tailor models for decision makers seeking to compare projections of epidemic trajectories and healthcare impacts from multiple intervention scenarios in different locations. Here, we present the components and configurable features of the COVID Scenario Pipeline, with a vignette detailing its current use. We also present model limitations and active areas of development to meet ever-changing decision maker needs.",

The flexibility of our approach has allowed us to provide rapid support to multiple organizations at the same time, while customizing our models to situation-specific questions and data. This framework has been used to provide tailored estimates of the relative impacts of different scenarios of disease transmission, severity, and control, thus guiding intervention policies in several states, countries, and humanitarian aid settings.",

The pipeline consists of multiple modular components designed to run in sequence to produce results and reports focused on policy relevant outcomes in any set of geographic locations (i.e., multiple countries, a single country, a set of subnational administrative units, or a single subnational administrative unit) ( Fig. 1 ). While the pipeline was developed to be extended, the current core components are (1) epidemic seeding, (2) the transmission model, (3) health outcome generation engine, and (4) report generation. These modular components of the pipeline fit together because each is composed of multiple pieces: an input format, an output format, one or more code libraries (where applicable), and a runner script. The standardized input and output formats ensure that components may be switched out according to user preference without impacting other phases. The \"library\" generally contains the core functions for a pipeline component. The script liaises between the user-defined configuration and the library by choosing which library to use and converting the input format to a format used by the library.",

Drawing from the user-specified data source, this option identifies the first five days that cases were reported in each modeled location. We assume that confirmed cases were infected a user-specified number of days prior to when they were reported, and that there is a user-specified ratio of infections to confirmed cases. Seed infections are, hence, created in each modeled location on the estimated days of infection for the first 5 days with reported cases; they are drawn stochastically from a Poisson distribution where the mean is the product of the number of reported cases and the user-specified ratio.",

The pipeline has four modules, each with specific inputs that can be specified by the user. First, we identify when and in which model locations epidemics are seeded using an air importation model or confirmed case data. Second, the epidemic seeding events are used to initiate the disease transmission model, which is informed by our epidemiological assumptions and intervention scenarios. The disease transmission model produces daily incident infection counts and infection prevalence. Next, we calculate health outcomes like hospitalizations and ICU admissions from these infection counts according to assumptions about health outcome risks and infection fatality ratios. Finally, these health outcomes may be summarized using templates and functions from the report generation component of the pipeline. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ source location incidence data, to inform a model with which absolute counts of importation are estimated on a daily basis into airports 12 . Geographic areas surrounding airports are classified spatially into \"airport catchment areas\" with a Voronoi tessellation of space in reference to the latitude and longitude coordinates of the airport 14 . When there are multiple airports within close proximity, the user may specify a threshold distance under which airports may be grouped into a single cluster that is defined by its centroid. We then assign a probability of importation to each intersection of a Voronoi tile and an administrative unit boundary. This probability is calculated as the proportion of the airport catchment area population that lives in that intersection, assuming that population is distributed evenly by area. All air importations on a given day are then aggregated to the administrative unit level and seeded into the epidemic model as newly infected individuals.",

In the absence of vaccines and other preventive treatments, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as school closures, social distancing, stay-at-home directives, and testing and isolation are critical strategies for reducing disease transmission.

The model enables users to specify changes to the basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) and the inverse of the infectious period (\u03b3), for pre-specified periods of time to all or subsets of model locations independently. These interventions or exogenous changes can be implemented with fixed or distributional effectiveness. In addition, users may specify a rate of fatiguing effectiveness (e.g., declining adherence to a policy) over a certain number of days. This format enables flexibility in scenario planning; for instance, the model can be used to examine the effects of chaining multiple interventions together over time (e.g., school closure then stay-at-home), gradual declining adherence of the population to an intervention, switching interventions on and off over time, spatially heterogeneous interventions, or innate spatiotemporal heterogeneities (Fig. 2) .",

Data to inform these factors was scarce when this model was initially developed, but these processes can change the dynamics displayed by scenario projections. Moreover, this model structure means that we cannot model age-targeted interventions (e.g., cocooning of high-risk age groups) or interventions targeting asymptomatic individuals (e.g., systematic age-specific testing) in a mechanistic manner. However, we can and do adjust for these types of interventions through overall population-level reductions in disease transmission. Additionally, the current model cannot tune changes in population mobility or connectivity over time, although we know that travel and movement restrictions played a role in changing the spread of COVID-19.",

In addition, the delays and durations involved in our health outcomes progression are fixed in time for a given location, although stochastic variation may be incorporated across simulations.. Nevertheless, the modular approach taken is meant to allow for easy substitution of models with improvement in any of these areas while still taking advantage of other pipeline components. We have leveraged this feature throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and individual modules continue to develop. This flexibility does come at a cost, as the modular pipeline approach requires us to write and read files at the end and beginning of each phase, respectively. This procedure requires more disk space and input/output steps than other modeling approaches that can hold all of the necessary data in memory until a single output is produced at the end. Still, these slowdowns are not critically limiting; we have been able to run 1000 county-level simulations of the United States in less than 10 min on a 96 core server.",

While our approach is well-suited to answering policy questions about interventions, it is critical for policymakers to explore projections from multiple models in order to understand the range of possible trajectories and the sensitivity of results to different assumptions. Models that incorporate individual-level behaviors may be better for considering the impact of specific contact tracing strategies or location-specific measures like workplace occupancy or symptom screening policies that are not well captured in compartmental models such www.nature.com/scientificreports/ as ours [21] [22] [23] . Other individual-based models are better suited for addressing heterogeneities due to differences in household or social structures 24, 25 . Models incorporating real-time mobility data can best characterize the impact of movement-related restrictions 26 models with age-specific transmission may provide more detail on the impact of age-specific interventions like \"cocooning\" 27 or closing and opening schools 4 . Still other models are particularly suited to address questions about health systems burden and forecast operational needs 5, 28, 29 and to consider the economic impacts of transmission and interventions 30, 31 . Integrating knowledge from multiple models, where appropriate, with careful consideration of the assumptions and appropriate applications of each model, will strengthen response and preparedness 32 . The heat maps display county-level ICU bed needs, shaded according to the log ratio above or below the assumed ICU bed capacity (secondary y-axis) in each county (primary y-axis) for three example intervention scenarios (panels). The salmon pink shading indicates periods of time where ICU bed needs exceed capacity in the fictional counties. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Our flexible modeling pipeline brings an important voice to this \"conversation\" of models, by allowing rapid and flexible specification and simulation of even very complex intervention scenarios, and providing flexibility to rapidly update models as our understanding of a disease changes. This approach only reaches its full potential when parameters are based on careful and ongoing consideration of the literature and available data. But, when appropriately used as part of an iterative approach to decision making, this pipeline can be a valuable tool for public health decision making. Countylevel variation in attack rates can arise from differences in risk of importation, mobility patterns connecting subdivisions, and differences in non-pharmaceutical interventions applied in each location. If location-specific health outcome risks are specified (as are age-standardized health outcome risks in this example), this may serve as another source of county-level variation.",

First, we identify when and in which model locations epidemics are seeded using an air importation model or confirmed case data. Second, the epidemic seeding events are used to initiate the disease transmission model, which is informed by our epidemiological assumptions and intervention scenarios. The disease transmission model produces daily incident infection counts and infection prevalence. Next, we calculate health outcomes like hospitalizations and ICU admissions from these infection counts according to assumptions about health outcome risks and infection fatality ratios. Finally, these health outcomes may be summarized using templates and functions from the report generation component of the pipeline.",
