Hence, this study aims to investigate the association between population migration and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China while investigating its measures for pandemic prevention and control. Subject and methods A susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dormancy (SEIRD) model for the spread of COVID-19 in China was created to theoretically simulate the relationship between the populations migrating from Wuhan and the number of confirmed cases. Data from Baidu's real-time dynamic pandemic monitoring system were elicited to empirically examine the theoretical inferences. Results Populations migrating from Wuhan to other cities increased the initial number of latently infected cases in these cities, raising the number of confirmed cases. Hence, implementing social distancing between the susceptible and infected populations could effectively lower the number of infected cases. Using data from Baidu's real-time dynamic pandemic monitoring system, the empirical results revealed that an increase of 1000 persons migrating from Wuhan raised the number of confirmed cases by 4.82 persons. Conclusion This study confirmed the positive association between population migration and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Based on the theoretical and empirical analysis, China's pandemic prevention and control measures are discussed.",

Specifically, the migration of latently infected and infected populations catalyse a pandemic's spread. To mitigate the pandemic's damage to the economy and society, the Chinese government implemented joint prevention and control strategies, issuing labour and production shutdowns, and imposing a strict lockdown on all urban and rural communities (Chen et al. 2020a, b; Gong et al. 2020; Deng and Peng 2020) . The efficacy of the intervention eventually allowed China to attain control over the pandemic. To effectively respond to similar public health emergencies in the future, China needs to summarize patterns and experiences pertaining to the pandemic (Zhang 2020; Xu et al. 2020) . Notably, these stratagems should account for the mechanism of action associated with population migration according to the spread of the pandemic. Hence, China's experiences concerning the prevention and control of COVID-19, based on the variable of population migration, are of the utmost importance.",

First, we computed population migration into the SEIRD model and conducted a simulation analysis of the impact that migrating people, regarded as latently infected populations, had on the number of confirmed cases. Second, contrary to existing numerical simulation work, this study used statistical data to empirically validate the aforementioned theoretical inference. Finally, contrary to existing policy simulation and empirical research work, we introduced China's measures to prevent and control the spread of the pandemic, based on the variable of population migration. This article's research contributions are as follows. First, it enriches and expands on simulation and empirical research regarding the impact that population migration has on the COVID-19 pandemic. It offers an evaluation and early warning mechanism based on the variable of population migration, to help with the prevention and control of similar public health emergencies in the future. Second, its introduction to China's pandemic prevention and control measures, based on the variable of population migrations, is beneficial to effectively curb the global pandemic.",

The vertical axis reflects the peak number of infected persons, while the horizontal axis denotes the proportion of initial populations migrating from Wuhan to various cities out of these cities' populations. Figure 1 shows that regardless of whether a state of frequent or infrequent contact was instated among the public, the larger the population migrating from Wuhan to a city, the larger the initial latently infected population, and the higher the peak number of infected cases. Nevertheless, when members of the public were in frequent contact with one another, the peak number of infected cases was higher. Overall, based on theoretical analysis, we discovered the following: the larger the population migrating from Wuhan to each city in the initial period, the larger the infected population in each city in the later period.

First, specific population migration trends were obtained from Wuhan. The government collaborated with communication companies, such as China Mobile, technological companies like Baidu, and the Ministry of Communications, and was able to deduce the trajectory of population migration from Wuhan using the Global Positioning System (GPS) linked to mobile phone signals, Baidu Maps' street-navigation platform, and a real-name registration system linked with transportation. Next, regions necessitating precautionary measures were charted based on the population migration trends observed from Wuhan. As an example, through data obtained from Baidu in a timely fashion, we discovered that Wuhan's populations migrated primarily to other prefecture-level cities in Hubei, such as Xiaogan, Huanggang, and Jingzhou. At the same time, we found that these regions were among prefecture-level cities with larger numbers of infected cases other than Wuhan, as shown in Table 3 . Amid the peak of the pandemic, these prefecture-level cities should promptly activate emergency response policies, and fully equip themselves with human, financial, and material resources. Next, presumptive populations were identified within regions of focus. Through the aforementioned platforms and communities, the activity records of all presumptive personnel from a pandemic region were identified and tracked. Additionally, these cases were promptly reported to the pandemic prevention and control departments, and were isolated and issued notices on time. Such a strategy reduced contact between presumptive and confirmed populations, successfully preventing the pandemic from spreading.",

The surge of the disease was effectively prevented and controlled in China, and the study deciphers the migration patterns in light of the SEIRD model to track the spread of COVID-19. Through our simulation of the mechanism of influence that population migration had on the number of confirmed cases in each region, we found that by increasing the number of latently infected cases in each city at the initial stage, the strength of populations migrating from Wuhan to each city increased the number of confirmed cases in each city. Reducing contact between susceptible populations and infected populations could effectively lower the number of infected cases. Our empirical findings further validated the theoretical inference that 'the larger the population migrating from Wuhan to each city, the greater the population of confirmed cases in each city'. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis of the impact that population migration in China had on the number of confirmed cases, how did China prevent and control the spread of the pandemic? First, the directions of population migration from the source of the pandemic were confirmed, and regions of focus for prevention and control based on the variable of the population were highlighted. Next, after identifying regions of focus, contact between susceptible and infected populations within the regions was effectively intercepted. This study's research contributions lie in its enrichment of theoretical and empirical research on the impact that population migration has on a pandemic's spread. Furthermore, it provides an aspect of China's experience regarding the prevention and control of the current pandemic and encompasses lessons for early warning, prevention, and control of similar public health emergencies.

On January 23, Wuhan City's COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention and Control Headquarters announced that the operations of Wuhan's regular and long-distance buses, subways, and ferries were suspended. Routes leaving Wuhan, including airports and train stations, were temporarily closed as well. On January 25, the operations of four high-speed rail trains from Zhengzhou to Wuhan were suspended. Additionally, traffic and commuting within the restricted region was banned, to reduce interactions among individuals. For example, Wuhan City's COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters announced that starting from January 26, a rule prohibiting motor vehicle activity took effect in the downtown region.
