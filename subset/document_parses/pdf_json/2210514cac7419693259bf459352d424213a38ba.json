In males with COVID-19, kynurenic acid (KA) and a high KA to kynurenine (K) ratio was positively correlated with age, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines and was negatively correlated with T cell responses, revealing that KA production is linked to immune responses in males. Males that clinically deteriorated had a higher KA:K ratio than those that stabilized. In females with COVID-19, this ratio positively correlated with T cell responses and did not correlate with age or clinical severity. KA is known to inhibit glutamate release, and we observed that serum glutamate is lower in patients that deteriorate from COVID-19 compared to those that stabilize, and correlates with immune responses. Analysis of Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data revealed that expression of kynurenine aminotransferase, which regulates KA production, correlates most strongly with cytokine levels and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in older males. This study reveals that KA has a sex-specific link to immune responses and clinical outcomes, in COVID-19 infection.",

It was recently shown that hospitalized patients with moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection have elevated levels of certain inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and sex-differences exist in these immune responses 2 . Furthermore, across all ages, female patients at baseline had a more robust T cell activation than males. Loss of T cell activation was correlated with older age in males, and this poorer T cell response was correlated with worse disease outcomes in males only 2 . Therefore, males and females have clear differences in COVID-19 immune responses that correlate with clinical course.",

For instance, specific metabolites are required for macrophage, neutrophil, and T cell functions, enhancing glycolytic and fatty acid synthesis pathways in these cells 3 . Conversely, immune stimulation can also elicit metabolic reprograming in cells, thereby affecting disease trajectory by altering metabolite abundance 4 . In addition to the metabolic requirements of the host immune system, viruses also require host-derived metabolites and lipids 5 . Thus, utilization of metabolic substrates for viral replication could affect metabolite availability required for immune responses.",

            "text": "To address how metabolites might mediate the sex-related differences in COVID-19 immune response, we first used an untargeted metabolomics workflow with multivariable logistic regression to identify serum metabolites associated with COVID-19. Serum samples were collected from COVID-19 patients (n=22 females and n=17 males) on the day of enrollment into the IMPACT study at Yale New Haven Hospital (CT, USA). Samples were taken from patients 3-7 days after hospital admission after confirmation of COVID-19 infection who (1) were not immediately triaged to the intensive care unit, (2) had not received tocilizumab, and (3) had not received high dose corticosteroids (Cohort A described in Takahashi et al. 2 ). Uninfected healthcare worker (HCW) controls (n=10 females and n=10 males) were included in the analysis. There was a statistically significant difference in age between the COVID-19 patients and HCWs, which was adjusted for in our models (Extended Data Table 1 ). We first carried out metabolite identification on detected signals that were present in the serum metabolome of quality control samples pooled from both COVID-19 patients and HCWs. We positively identified 75 metabolites with the highest confidence (Extended Data Table 2 ). Regression analysis revealed that 17 metabolites were associated with COVID-19 status after adjustment for age, BMI, sex, and multiple comparisons (Extended Data Table 3 ). Glutamate, cysteine-S-sulfate, palmitoleic acid, arachidonic acid, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) (22:6), uracil and myristic acid were positively associated with COVID-19. Whereas glutamine, 3-methylxanthine, tryptophan, proline, citrulline, homoserine, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (18:2), LPA (20:2), and lysophosphatidylcholine (14:0) were negatively associated with COVID-19.",

Our analysis of serum metabolites from COVID-19 patients, reveals that KA and the ratio of KA:K has a strong relationship to sex-specific immune response and clinical disease course. Importantly, a previous study revealed that serum metabolites in tryptophan and K metabolism correlate with IL6 in a sex-aggregated cohort of COVID-19 patients, but sexspecificity was not examined 14 . Our study shows that, in males, a high ratio of KA:K was positively correlated with increased levels of cytokines/chemokines and portends clinical deterioration. On the other hand, a negative association was observed with Eotaxin, sCD40L, PDGFs, and T cells, indicating that males with a high KA:K may have a poorer response to inflammation associated with COVID-19, including decreased eosinophil recruitment and T cell activation 15, 16 . A previous study showed that PDGFs associate with better prognosis from COVID-19 if the patients have lower cytokine levels, supporting the association between a higher KA:K and poorer outcomes in males 17 . In females with COVID-19, a high KA:K positively correlated with a small number of cytokines and also T cell activation, but in contradistinction to males, high KA:K was not associated with disease severity. These results therefore support the role of K metabolism in sexrelated differences previously reported in immune responses to COVID-19 2 .",

Among these metabolites, perhaps the most salient discovery is the identification of KA as a metabolite associated with sex, age, increased disease severity, and elevated cytokine and chemokine levels. KA is a ligand for AhR, and when activated, AhR is a master regulator of immune responses and inflammation. Sex-specific agonism of AhR has yet to be reported in humans, but appears to be a prominent feature in COVID-19 disease, potentially underlying the cytokine storm and dampening of T cell activation. In addition, KA is known to dampen glutamate release 12 , and we observed lower levels of glutamate in patients that deteriorate compared to those that stabilize. Further investigation into the relevance of KA, KAT, and AhR activation in COVID-19 and the role of glutamate in clinical outcomes will be of utmost importance, particularly for understanding the sex-specific differences in immune response and patient outcomes.

A UPLC system (H-Class ACQUITY, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), coupled to a quadrupole time-of flight (QTOF) (Xevo G2-XS QTOF, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), was used for MS data acquisition. A Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide column (particle size, 1.7 \u03bcm; 100 mm (length) \u00d7 2.1 mm (i.d.)) and Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (particle size, 1.7 \u03bcm; 100 mm (length) \u00d7 2.1 mm (i.d.)) were used for the UPLC-based separation of metabolites. The column temperature was kept at 25 \u00b0C for HILIC-MS analysis and 30 \u00b0C for RPLC-MS analysis. The solvent flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, and the sample injection volume was 4 \u03bcL for HILIC-MS and RPLC in positive mode analysis, 2 \u03bcL for HILIC-MS in negative mode, and 6 \u03bcL for RPLC-MS negative mode. For HILIC-MS analysis, mobile phase A was 25 mM NH4OH and 25 mM NH4OAc in water, while the mobile phase B was acetonitrile, for both electrospray ionization (ESI), positive and negative mode, respectively. The linear gradient was set as follows: 0~0.5 min: 95% B; 0.5~7 min: 95% B to 65% B; 7~8 min: 65% B to 40% B; 8~9 min: 40% B; 9~9.1 min: 40% B to 95% B; 9.1~12 min: 95% B.
