            "text": "Post cardiac arrest syndrome is associated with high morbidity and mortality, which is related not only to a poor neurological outcome but also to respiratory and cardiovascular dysfunctions. The control of gas exchange, and in particular oxygenation and carbon dioxide levels, is fundamental in mechanically ventilated patients after resuscitation, as arterial blood gases derangement might have important effects on the cerebral blood flow and systemic physiology. In particular, the pathophysiological role of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels is strongly underestimated, as its alterations quickly affect also the changes of intracellular pH, and consequently influence metabolic energy and oxygen demand. Hypo/ hypercapnia, as well as mechanical ventilation during and after resuscitation, can affect CO 2 levels and trigger a dangerous pathophysiological vicious circle related to the relationship between pH, cellular demand, and catecholamine levels. The developing hypocapnia can nullify the beneficial effects of the hypothermia. The aim of this review was to describe the pathophysiology and clinical consequences of arterial blood gases and pH after cardiac arrest. According to our findings, the optimal ventilator strategies in post cardiac arrest patients are not fully understood, and oxygen and carbon dioxide targets should take in consideration a complex pattern of pathophysiological factors. Further studies are warranted to define the optimal settings of mechanical ventilation in patients after cardiac arrest.",

In this context, ventilation has the goal to maintain an appropriate level of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ), while reducing arterial carbon dioxide levels (PaCO 2 ), avoiding respiratory acidosis. However, the pathophysiology of cardiac arrest and its systemic effects, as well as the relationship between arterial blood gases, hemodynamic management, and ventilation during and after resuscitation is complex. Evidence regarding the optimal oxygen or carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) targets is limited, and the relationship between PaO 2 and PaCO 2 targets in the context of catecholamine administration and pH changes is not fully understood. Also, the pathophysiological effects of CO 2 are underestimated in the literature; variations of carbon dioxide levels can quickly change the extracellular-intracellular concentration of H + , and modifications in pH and acidosis have extraordinary importance on systemic homeostasis [1] .",

We will not focus on ventilator settings but on the pH, PaO 2 , and CO 2 physiological targets to achieve in this cohort of patients. Fig. 1 Biological effects of pH on microglia, cardiomyocytes, and lung epithelial cells. Microglia expresses two classes of acid-base transporting proteins: acid loaders (red) and acid extruders (blue). In acidosis, acid extruder proteins are increased while in alkalosis these are downregulated. In cardiomyocytes, the regulation of the adrenergic receptors is determined by \u03b2-arrestins, which can trigger the internalization process of dephosphorization or degradation and therefore define the up-and downregulation of the internalized molecule either to recycling or degradation, respectively. In acidosis, adrenergic receptors are downregulated and less responsive to catecholamines. In the lung epithelium, reduction of lung edema clearance is associated with the endocytosis of the Na+/K+-ATPase from the plasma membrane of alveolar epithelial cells, which leads to decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activity. During acidosis, protein kinase C (PKC)-\u03b6 phosphorylates the Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11-subunit, leading to endocytosis of the Na+/K+-ATPase. The activation of PKC-\u03b6 is regulated by AMP kinase (AMPK). Acidosis culminates in the Na+/K+-ATPase endocytosis from the cell plasma membrane. In the lung epithelium, alkalosis with low carbon dioxide and hyperventilation can determine increase of mechanical power and activation of the inflammatory system",

Acute lactic acidosis depresses left ventricular contractility, triggers the release of endogenous catecholamine, and decreases the responsiveness of the left ventricle to the Fig. 2 Effect of oxygen on microglia, cardiomyocytes, and lung epithelial cells. Microglia: hypoxic neurons have an anaerobic metabolism with increased intracellular Ca 2+ intake; persistent hypoxia generates reduction of ATP and further energetic failure. Hyperoxia can disrupt microglia function by increasing free radicals. Hyperoxia increases input resistance to antioxidant and decrease membrane conductance (K+ channel) and stimulates firing of putative central CO 2 /H + chemoreceptors neurons. Cardiomyocytes: effects of anoxia on cellular energetic turnover and on intra-and extracellular environments and its effect on cardiac function. In hyperoxia, O 2 radical free and reduction of nitric oxide can eventually lead to coronary vasoconstriction. In the lung epithelium, hypoxia induces pulmonary vascular remodeling, with resident vascular cell activation, monocytes/fibrocytes recruitment, and persistent vasoconstriction structural remodeling. Hyperoxia exposure stimulates p53 to activate miR34a in a positive feedback loop, with consequent abnormal cell proliferation, apoptosis, impaired alveolarization, and cell death actions of catecholamine [7] . Therefore, late detection and treatment of acidosis in the context of impaired cardiovascular function and responsiveness to vasopressors in post cardiac arrest status may lead to worse outcome [8] .",

Decreased pH also influences the synthesis and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) and nitric oxide (NO) in macrophages or macrophage-like cell lines and can \"per se\" affect hemodynamic stability: moderate acidosis (pH = 7-7.20) might elevate nitric oxide (NO) production and levels, but severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) determinates a decrease in NO release and NO synthesis [10] [11] [12] [13] . Effect of carbon dioxide on microglia, cardiomyocytes, and lung epithelial cells. Microglia: hypercapnia decreases extracellular pH and intracellular pH (Phi). Increased Phi increases firing rate of CO 2 / H 2 chemosensitive neurons, by an oxidant-induced decrease in K+ conductance. Hypocapnia with cerebral vasoconstriction and ischemic insult shifts the anaerobic metabolism and activates local and systemic inflammatory response. Cardiomyocytes: hypercapnia and acidosis reduce the sensitivity of the adrenergic receptor and expression. Hypocapnia has effect on intracellular buffers (mostly hemoglobin within red blood cells) determining release of hydrogen. Hydrogen combines with bicarbonate to form carbonic acid, which then disassociates to form water and CO 2 , thus replenishing the depleted PaCO 2 . Lung epithelium: hypercapnia inhibits proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells due to mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from hypercapnia-induced miR-183 which downregulates the TCA cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH). Hypercapnic acidosis impairs alveolar epithelial cell migration by the NF-kB dependent mechanism. Hypercapnia inhibits mRNA and protein expression of IL-6 and TNF and decreases phagocytosis in macrophages. Hypocapnia and hyperventilation can determine increase of mechanical power and activation of the inflammatory system.

Hypocarbia may cause cerebral vasoconstriction that worsens ischemic injury and should be avoided to preserve cerebral blood flow [26, 27] . On these basis, Eastwood et al. [28, 29] suggested that mild hypercapnia (PaCO 2 50-55 mmHg) may improve cerebral oxygenation when compared with normocarbia (PaCO 2 35-45 mmHg), and Beitler et al.

Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the development of ARDS in these patients: the first theory includes the indirect activation and proliferation of neutrophils with progressive inflammatory alveolar infiltrates by activation of the immune system after cardiac arrest. Another hypothesis focuses on direct epithelial barrier damage related to ischemia reperfusion injury and endothelial cells activation and dysfunction [52] . The consequent overexpression of adhesion molecules, secretion of cytokines and Global cerebral ischemia and immunological disturbances induce microgliosis, damage of blood-brain barrier, and cerebrovascular system. Endothelial dysfunction and blood brain barrier permeability are crucial in above pathological processes. The brain-lung or brain-heart-lung couplings and their disturbances may be considered as modulator of post ischemic injury, peripheral inflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction, observed in post cardiac arrest patients. Post ischemic induction of necrosis, apoptosis, and systemic inflammation predisposes to neuronal damage and poor recovery. Pulmonary complications following cardiac arrest, through cerebral ischemia or immunological activation, can result in neurogenic pulmonary edema, ARDS, or pneumonia. The clinical consequences of these pathophysiological pathways are different according to three different phases: cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and post resuscitation. ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome chemokines, activates the sequestration of neutrophils, which transmigrate across the endothelium and epithelium into the alveolar space and releases cytotoxic and proinflammatory compounds [52] [53] [54] [55] .",

Increased Phi increases firing rate of CO 2 / H 2 chemosensitive neurons, by an oxidant-induced decrease in K+ conductance. Hypocapnia with cerebral vasoconstriction and ischemic insult shifts the anaerobic metabolism and activates local and systemic inflammatory response. Cardiomyocytes: hypercapnia and acidosis reduce the sensitivity of the adrenergic receptor and expression. Hypocapnia has effect on intracellular buffers (mostly hemoglobin within red blood cells) determining release of hydrogen. Hydrogen combines with bicarbonate to form carbonic acid, which then disassociates to form water and CO 2 , thus replenishing the depleted PaCO 2 . Lung epithelium: hypercapnia inhibits proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells due to mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from hypercapnia-induced miR-183 which downregulates the TCA cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH). Hypercapnic acidosis impairs alveolar epithelial cell migration by the NF-kB dependent mechanism. Hypercapnia inhibits mRNA and protein expression of IL-6 and TNF and decreases phagocytosis in macrophages. Hypocapnia and hyperventilation can determine increase of mechanical power and activation of the inflammatory system.
