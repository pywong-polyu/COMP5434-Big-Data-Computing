In the first month of COVID-19 infection, incidence of daily positive cases did follow the susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) based predictions we reported in April, but started to deviate in the following month. COVID-19 transmission and disease progression depends on multifaceted determinants e.g. viral genetics, host immunity, social distancing, comorbidity, socio-demographic and environmental parameters. Therefore deviation in confirmed cases from predicted model may appear and warrant thorough investigation. In this short report, we tried to demonstrate and analyze the possible factors associated with the deviation which included preventive intervention strategies, socioeconomic capabilities, climatic and meteorological indexes, acquired immunity of Bangladeshi population, demographic characteristics, health indicators and food habits.",

Bangladesh is one of the low investing countries in health sector (health expenditure of 36.28 USD per capita) [13] , thus the extension of test center and recruitment and training of expertise was relatively slow and still way below the need compared to large number of populations. Especially with the increasing rate of infection this can be vital limiting factor to know real case scenario in Bangladesh. These extended centers however are mainly in divisional headquarters or in large cities, where rural people staying away from the facility had difficulty to test as inter-city transport was closed. This has resulted some samples to become non usable and some false negative as samples might have been deteriorated due to longer transport and improper sample collection. We also identified due to social non cooperation toward the COVID-19 positive or health care practitioners, many suspected individual were reluctant to give sample due to social fear. Although government hot line is open for all, many people had dissatisfactory experience calling for sample collection. Lack of management, long queue, waiting time in sample collection and test centers and delayed result also had negative impact, fear and rejection tendency among test seekers. These factors altogether had impact on uniform and broad data collection raising reliability issues on reported case numbers so far.",

Information regarding SARS-CoV-2 is still insufficient to label its seasonality; however, known other human corona viruses had shown clear preferences to winter. COVID-19 data so far showed temperate regions as the prevalence hot zone, but tropical areas are not completely out of the list. In one particular season incidence peak or hot spot may vary from virus to virus and usually avoid overlapping. Temperature and humidity determine the route of transmission and viral stability both in indoor and outdoor settings. Cold and dry weather dominate transmission via aerosol and small droplets whereas hot and humid weather facilitate transmission via fomites. Temperature above 30\u00b0C showed to block aerosol mediated Influenza virus transmission at variable RH, but contact mode transmission was still possible [21] .

Due to government imposed travel ban, reduced industrial effect air particulate emission was also low for the last two months which might have helped to reduce particulate material mediated virus transmission. Bangladesh has very high UV index during summer months with average of 10 or above with increased daylight hours [24] . UV index and daylight is related to ozone concentration which was found to reduce viability of viruses and COVID-19 transmission in a study conducted in Chinese cities [25] . In Bangladesh, ozone level in summer daylight may have helped to reduce viability of the viruses in environment [26] . Sunlight exposure which is also related to vitamin D production and immunity had helped to provide population level immunity to fight COVID-19 in Bangladesh [27] .

One study with cholera vaccination in Bangladesh showed natural immunity were long lasting compared to the oral vaccine [31] . In another study, Bangladeshi children were found to express more effector T cell activity compared to American children, supporting the 'hygiene hypothesis' [32] . According to this hypothesis early exposure to infectious agents may provide better immunity and in contrast lack of exposure may lead to allergies and autoimmune diseases. This also explains in part, reduced COVID-19 incidence in Bangladesh could be due to childhood acquired immunity against a variety of organisms. Co-infection of viruses is another aspect where one or more viruses may compete with another minimizing the virulence of the other [33] . Viral co-infection was reported in COVID-19 [34, 35] and in Bangladesh as viral co-infection was observed in case of other viruses [36] , co-infection of other respiratory viruses may have inhibitory effect on COVID-19 transmission and virulence. Food which boosts immune systems e.g. seasonal fruits, vegetables and spices could also play a positive role in slowing COVID-19 in Bangladesh.",
