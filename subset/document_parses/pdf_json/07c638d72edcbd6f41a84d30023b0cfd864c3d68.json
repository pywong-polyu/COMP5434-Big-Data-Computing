COVID-19 has so far propagated nearly 185 Countries/Regions, 83 Cities/Provinces have been registered, and 264 separate geographical locations combined. Using time-series data, it estimated the number of individual cases, such as confirmed infected, deaths and recovered around the globe and the top 10 countries in the world.

This segment will analyze various time-series data using several visual data analysis approaches with the R programming language. We have created a graph and given awareness of how SARS-CoV-2 spread around the globe from 22 January 2020 to 17 April 2020; it allows individuals to grasp the epidemiological essence of COVID-19. Figure 1 indicates that the confirmed infected cases have been crossed by 2,000,000 cases around the globe. Many cases, such as death, recovery and active, have also been shown. New cases reported on a single day do not actually represent new cases on that day, as the number of confirmed infected cases or deaths announced by any organization-including WHO, ECDC, Johns Hopkins University and others-does not reflect the total number of new cases or deaths on that day. This is due to the long chain of reporting that occurs between a new case or death and its inclusion in national or international statistics. In the event of an outbreak of an infectious disease, it is necessary not only to track the number of deaths, but also the rate of increase in the number of deaths. If there is a fixed number of deaths over a fixed period of time, we call that ''linear'' growth. But if they continue to double within a fixed time span, we call it ''exponential'' growth. Based on the results, looking at the rate of death growth, we have understood that it is linear growth in the US and Spain. Figure 3 indicates that changes every day occurred in confirmed cases between 22 January 2020 and 17 April 2020 from the USA and Spain. By this we will conclude that the reported cases will accelerate on 20 March 2020 and that the last day of change is 31,451 in the US. In Spain, the confirmed case rises linearly from 03 March 2020 to 15 April 2020, the last day of change is 7,304. It is clear that the real-time analysis of these data is extremely useful in documenting the epidemiological behavior of this severe disease. We believe that this method of data analysis will certainly increase understanding of the situation and inform behavior.",

The research presented here is based on statistical and visual data analysis methods with the aid of a dataset provided by John Hopkins University. The research was done with R Studio 1.2.5033 and R 4.0 beta versions of the Windows 10 operating system. Each and every description of the different cases of COVID-19 is documented here between 22 January 2020 and 17 April 2020. We are now also observing the harmful outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

It has supported us to generate and disseminate detailed information to the scientific community and to the public, especially at the peak phase, in order to understand the growth and impact of the novel coronavirus. Nevertheless, knowledge of this novel SARS-CoV-2 virus remains minimal among the general population around the globe. Raw data published from different sources are not adequately capable of offering an insightful understanding of COVID-19 as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2. A user-friendly data analysis platform would also be more effective in recognizing the epidemic of this severe disease. The informative graphics of the visualization platform provide an intuitive interface and a simple view of all raw data. Hopefully, in the coming days, we will continue to track the epidemiological data of this outbreak that we have used in this study and from other official sources.",

The fitted models have yielded better statistical results; the findings shown below represent all three cases in the USA. From the models results obtained, on the confirmed case, the exponential model coefficients are -0.807 and 0.17, the GLM Poisson model coefficients are 3.469 and 0.119, and the GLM Gamma model coefficients are -0.433 and 0.17, both of which are statistically significant, as shown in Fig. 2. In case of death, the exponential model coefficients are -2.774 and 0.144, the GLM Poisson model coefficients are -2.424 and 0.151, both of which are statistically reasonable. In the recovered case, the exponential model coefficients are -2.204 and 0.137, the GLM Poisson model coefficients are -2.864 and 0.163, both of which are statistically significant. From the findings, it can be understood that all cases, such as confirmed infected, deaths and recovered, are linearly increased, the same thing is reflected in the upper part of the graph, i.e. the output of linear and generalized linear models. Regression and generalized linear models of the COVID-19 time series were also used to analyze confirmed infected, death and recovered cases in Spain. The fitting models have provided better statistical results; the findings shown below reflect all three cases in Spain. Here, too, the count has risen linearly. In the confirmed case, the exponential model coefficients are -2.278 and 0.185, the GLM Poisson model coefficients are 4.159 and 0.093, both of which are statistically significant.
