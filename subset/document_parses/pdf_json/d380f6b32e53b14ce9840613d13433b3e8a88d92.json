High-quality and efficient sleep of adequate duration helps to consolidate memory, regulate the immune system and coordinate neuroendocrine functions. 1 By contrast, poor sleep quality leads to a broad range of adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular diseases, poor mental health status, cognitive impairment and even overall mortality. 2,3 COVID-19 may negatively affect sleep quality and other mental health outcomes among patients admitted to hospital, patients with mild and asymptomatic cases, and survivors. 4-8 COVID-19 symptoms and experience during hospital stay are stressors affecting mental health status. 4 Moreover, treatment for COVID-19 may have adverse effects on mental health and contribute to insomnia. 9 Furthermore, SARS-Cov-2 might also infect the brain, which could directly cause adverse effects on brain functions and mental health. 5 Understanding factors associated with sleep quality among COVID-19 survivors after hospital discharge is important for intervention development and service planning to enhance well-being. Cross-sectional studies showed that 29.5% and 26% of COVID-19 survivors in Wuhan, China, were bothered by a sleeping disorder 1 month and 6 months after discharge, respectively (measured by a single item within the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): 'Whether you have trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much in the past two weeks' and a self-reported symptom questionnaire: 'What do you think about your sleeping compared with the status prior to COVID-19'). 6 A cohort study reported that 26% of COVID-19 survivors suffered from sleep difficulties 6 months after hospital discharge. 10 Moreover, 40% of COVID-19 survivors in Italy reported insomnia (as measured by the Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale). 7 Only a limited range of factors associated with sleep quality have been reported. Being female, younger and having a history of psychiatric disorder were associated with poor sleep quality. 7 Previous studies showed that sleep problems among survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were likely to be persistent; 47%, 50% and 44% of survivors reported difficulty sleeping 3, 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge, respectively. 11 A systematic review suggested that there were three groups of risk factors for sleep quality among patients after hospital admission and/or critical illness: pre-hospital factors, in-hospital factors and post-hospital factors. 12 Pre-hospital factors included pre-hospital sleep quality, self-reported concurrent diseases before hospital admission and smoking. 12 Disease severity at hospital admission, ventilation days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of hospital stay were in-hospital risk factors for sleep quality after hospital discharge. 12 The main post-hospital factors associated with sleep quality were depression, anxiety and stress. 12 These factors were considered in this study.",

Community healthcare centres are coordinating with psychotherapists and social workers to provide such services to COVID-19 survivors in need. 14 This study also investigated the association between receiving mental health support services during hospital stay and/or after hospital discharge with post-discharge sleep quality among COVID-19 survivors. Moreover, one study evaluating psychological interventions targeting COVID-19 patients showed that better social support predicted improvement in sleep quality. 15 Therefore, social support after hospital discharge was also considered by this study. Furthermore, about 7-8% of COVID-19 survivors tested positive again after hospital discharge. [16] [17] [18] However, there was no consensus about the cause of such phenomena. 19, 20 Positive retest results may be another stressor for COVID-19 survivors.",

Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei Province, which is most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Dongguan are cities in Guangdong Province, which has the second largest number of COVID-19 cases in China. Nanning is the capital city of Guangxi Province, which has been less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

First, the measurement of sleep quality (single-item Sleep Quality Scale; SQS) was not validated in a population under 18 years old. 22 No study used this scale to measure sleep quality among children or adolescents. Second, most of the patients under 18 years old in the records kept by the collaborative hospitals were very young (5-10 years old). It would have been difficult for them to answer our questionnaire, which used relatively complicated psychosocial measurements. Asking their parents to answer the questionnaire would create additional bias.",

Previous studies have shown changes in the sleep cycles of elderly people, for instance, decreased total sleep time, increased time spent falling asleep at sleep onset, sleep fragmentation and daytime sleep. 32 They should receive more attention in future programmes. Participants without a fixed income were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Although COVID-19 treatment is free in China, hospital admission and subsequent quarantine may affect the work of the survivors and may increase financial difficulties, especially among those with low or no fixed income. Financial difficulties represent a risk factor for sleep quality. 33 Future programmes should consider providing financial assistance to COVID-19 survivors who have financial difficulties. Participants in Nanning reported better sleep quality than those in the other cities. Compared with the other four study sites, Nanning has been less affected by COVID-19. The COVID-19 situation in the city may be a structural factor influencing people's sleep quality.",

Witnessing painful symptoms and deaths of other COVID-19 patients were significant in-hospital factors associated with poor sleep quality. These experiences are major psychological traumas for COVID-19 survivors, which may result in PTSD, a mental disorder leading to serious distress and disability. 4, 34 In line with other studies targeting COVID-19 survivors, 7 our study found a high level of PTSD in this population. PTSD was negatively associated with sleep quality. 12, 35 Moreover, PTSD is long-lasting among survivors of infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., SARS). The median time taken for PTSD to remit is about 36 months for individuals who have sought mental health support services, and can be as long as 64 months for those who have never sought such services. 36 A metaanalysis suggested that early intervention could lead to durable effects on PTSD severity. 37 However, as the majority of participants had been discharged from hospitals before the government started providing mental health support services to all COVID-19 patients, 14 only 42.7% received such services during their hospital stay. It is also unclear whether such mental health support services targeted traumatic experience, as the results showed a non-significant association between in-hospital mental health support service utilisation and sleep quality. In contrast to our hypothesis, ICU admission and the use of invasive ventilation and corticosteroids were not associated with post-discharge sleep quality, probably owing to the very small number of COVID-19 survivors who had such experiences (2.5-12.1%).",

Poor sleep quality might increase the risk of depression and anxiety, whereas presence of depressive symptoms or anxiety symptoms would increase the risk of sleep disturbance. 12, 38 One recent study suggested that sleep is a mediator of the relationship between stress and mental disorders in people infected with SARS-Cov-2. 8 Such findings highlight the need to provide mental 24, 39 there has been no validation study conducted in a Chinese population. This was a weakness of this study. The study had some other limitations. First, there was no appropriate control group (e.g., patients who were admitted to hospital for reasons other than COVID-19 during the same period). Second, as compared with longer sleep questionnaires (e.g., PSQI), the single-item SQS was not able to cover important information such as sleep latency, sleep duration or habitual sleep efficiency. It merely reflected subjective sleep quality. Similar to some published cross-sectional studies, we measured self-reported changes in sleep quality before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. 6 However, such measurements are susceptible to strong recall bias. Therefore, we were not able to conclude that our participants had a decrease in sleep quality. Third, the sample size of this study was relatively small. The effect sizes of the non-significant associations were quite small, and the non-significance cannot be fully explained by the relatively small sample size. Fourth, COVID-19 survivors were recruited in five Chinese cities; generalisations should be made cautiously to other geographic locations in China. Fifth, we were not able to collect information from survivors who refused to participate in the study. Therefore, we could compare characteristics between participants and those who refused to complete the survey and hence could not estimate the impact of refusals on study outcomes. Selection bias existed. Sixth, parts of the data were selfreported, and verification was not feasible. Recall bias may have occurred, and we were not able to estimate the impact of recall bias on study outcomes. Moreover, we did not collect information about history of psychiatric disorders, which is a significant factor in post-discharge sleep quality. Furthermore, this was a cross-sectional study and could not establish causal relationships.",

These approaches may improve social support for COVID-19 survivors. In addition, having a positive SARS-Cov-2 retest result was marginally associated with poor sleep quality. As the cause of this phenomenon is still under investigation, 19,20 receiving a positive retest result may trigger fear, worry and other negative emotional responses among COVID-19 survivors. In the future, longitudinal studies should be conducted to explore whether COVID-19 survivors with sleep disorders have worse recovery than those without.This study had the strengths of recruiting survivors in multiple Chinese cities and considering pre-hospital, in-hospital and post-hospital factors.
